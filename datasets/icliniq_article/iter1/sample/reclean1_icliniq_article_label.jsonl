A painful, distressing, and embarrassing situation for men, often interferings with their sexual functions, interpersonal relationships, and self-image. Hesitance and embarrassment due to penis skin conditions often result in delayed diagnosis and treatment of such conditions.\n\n【2】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Penile Dermatological Conditions?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Penis skin conditions most commonly manifest themselves as;\n\n【4】*   Itching and redness.\n\n【5】*   Rashes.\n\n【6】*   Pain.\n\n【7】*   Swelling.\n\n【8】*   Discharge from underneath the foreskin.\n\n【9】*   Peeling of skin.\n\n【10】*   Ulceration.\n\n【11】*   Bumps or papules on the skin.\n\n【12】*   Sore penis.\n\n【13】*   Swollen lymph nodes in the groin.\n\n【14】*   Foul smell.\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What is the best treatment for genital herpes with reddish spots, itching skin, and a tighter penile foreskin?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What are the causes of ulcer and whitish slough on the penile skin?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What is the best nonsurgical treatment for tight and nonretractable penile foreskin?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Painful urination.\n\n【16】*   Areas of shiny and white skin on the penis.\n    </u>\n\n【17】What Are the Dermatological Conditions Affecting Penis Skin?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Penile skin conditions range from harmless rash to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), making evaluating and diagnosing this condition of utmost importance. Inflammation of the gland is called balanitis. Posthitis is inflammation of the foreskin, and inflammation involving both the penis and the foreskin is called balanoposthitis. Men suffering from balanoposthitis have a higher chance of developing problems related to the penile foreskin. The chances of getting phimosis, paraphimosis, or penile cancer are also high. It can present as asymptomatic or associated with itching, pain, tightness of the foreskin, and sexual dysfunctions. Inflammation of the penile skin may be attributed to three main causes.\n\n【19】1\\. **Infections:** Bacterial, fungal, and viral infections may cause issues such as\n\n【20】*   Yeast infection.\n\n【21】*   STDs.\n\n【22】*   Scabies.\n\n【23】*   Herpes simplex infection.\n\n【24】*   Human papilloma viral (HPV) infection.\n\n【25】*   Molluscum contagiosum.\n\n【26】*   Viral warts.\n\n【27】2\\. **Non-infectious Causes:** Penis skin problems occurring from non-infectious reasons are:\n\n【28】*   Allergic reactions to latex condoms.\n\n【29】*   Pruritus is itchy, dry skin.\n\n【30】*   Allergic reaction from birth control liquid or gel.\n\n【31】*   Psoriasis - skin cell buildup causes dry, itchy scales.\n\n【32】*   Lichen planus presents as purple, itchy flat bumps due to swelling and irritation.\n\n【33】*   Seborrheic dermatitis - Causes an itchy rash with flaky skin.\n\n【34】*   Zoon's balanitis - usually presents as solitary, erythematous plaque on the penis glans.\n\n【35】*   Balanitis - There are more chances of getting balanitis in males with tight foreskins and diabetes mellitus.\n\n【36】*   Pearly penile papules are dome-shaped bumps on the penis head.\n\n【37】3\\. **Precancerous and Cancerous Conditions:** Local (in situ) skin cancer on the penis may be present, which includes;\n\n【38】*   Erythroplasia of Queyrat (a form of squamous cell carcinoma) characterized by well-defined reddish, velvety pigmentation of some areas of the penile skin.\n\n【39】*   Bowen disease of the penis - whitish-gray thickened areas on the shaft of the penis, seen mostly in uncircumcised males.\n\n【40】*   Bowenoid papulosis - small and often multiple bumps are present on the shaft of the penis.\n\n【41】*   Adenocarcinoma - a form of carcinoma developing on the glands lining the organ.\n\n【42】*   Penile intraepithelial neoplasia - a rare pre-malignant disease of the outer skin layer (epidermis) of the penis.\n\n【43】*   Precancerous conditions such as candidiasis- a fungal infection caused by candida yeast.\n\n【44】*   Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) -a malignant tumor which is the most serious condition.\n\n【45】How to Diagnose Penis Skin Problems?\n------------------------------------\n\n【46】It is challenging and essential to diagnose penile skin conditions as the cause can range from remediable rash to cancerous involvement. Doctors' evaluation is required in case of persistent and painful debilitating conditions. A sexologist can help diagnose through careful clinical examination and history taking. Doctors may suggest some tests to detect yeast infections or STDs; blood sugar level tests to detect diabetes mellitus in case of recurrent infections.\n\n【47】How to Avoid Penile Skin Conditions?\n------------------------------------\n\n【48】Some measures one can take to keep penis skin healthy such as,\n\n【49】*   Maintaining good hygiene, especially under the foreskin.\n\n【50】*   Proper vaccinations such as the HPV vaccine.\n\n【51】*   Avoid harsh soap and use mild, hypoallergenic products.\n\n【52】*   Adopting a healthy lifestyle, such as limiting smoking and alcohol consumption\n\n【53】*   Protection using barrier methods before sex to avoid STDs.\n\n【54】*   Sometimes, having circumcision if the skin is too tight around the glans may help reduce infections. A procedure to remove the foreskin of the penis is called circumcision.\n\n【55】What Are the Treatment Modalities for Penile Dermatological Conditions?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】With many causative factors for penile skin conditions, treatments and management are also underlying cause centric.\n\n【57】*   For peeling of penile skin, the first line of therapy is using mild Corticosteroid creams in case of friction, psoriasis, and eczema.\n\n【58】*   Rash due to latex allergy, the polyurethane condoms are a good alternative.\n\n【59】*   Antifungal creams like clotrimazole are effective on the thrush of yeast infection on penile skin.\n\n【60】*   The recurrence rate is high in the case of warts. A new topical immunotherapeutic agent - imiquimod - is recommended, including interferon and other cytokines.\n\n【61】*   Scabies and pediculosis are transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, so proper hygiene measures such as frequently washing hands before coming in contact or touching skin may help.\n\n【62】*   The physician may prescribe a medication used to treat infection caused by parasites, like oral ivermectin, after a specific test for scabies infection.\n\n【63】*   In case of allergic contact dermatitis of the penile skin, removing and avoiding irritants such as lubricants, feminine hygiene products, deodorant sprays, latex condoms, and spermicides is helpful.\n\n【64】*   Wearing clean and dry underwear clothing is helpful in case of rashes due to persistent moisture and maceration.\n\n【65】*   If STD is the cause of the skin problem, the sexologist will treat it with antibiotics depending on the type and severity of the infection.\n\n【66】*   SCC of the penis is the most common penile malignancy, requiring biopsy for diagnosis. It may require surgical intervention. Early detection of precancerous lesions, identification of risk factors, and proper treatment of phimosis (inability to retract the foreskin behind the tip of the penis) are essential to prevent SCC of the penis.\n\n【67】*   Painful paraphimosis can be treated with the local anesthetic cream, ice packs, or oral painkiller medications.\n\n【68】*   Pearly penile papules are treated at home care through the over-the-counter antibiotic cream application. In severe cases, pulsed dye laser treatment is the most effective.\n\n【69】What Is the Prognosis of Penile Dermatological Conditions?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【70】Apart from the malignant conditions, penile skin problems have a good prognosis. Inflammations and symptoms are reducible by applying prescribed medicated creams.\n\n【71】What Are the Complications of Penile Skin Conditions?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【72】If left untreated penile skin infection becomes severe with a subsequent increase in symptoms. Untreated precancerous lesions may become malignant. Pain related to these conditions impairs sexual functions.\n\n【73】**Conclusions:**\n\n【74】Penile dermatological conditions can adversely interfere with a person's daily life and may affect interpersonal relationships with partners and self-esteem. Sexually active persons should undergo regular screening for optimal penile health, as many infections may exhibit symptoms in the early stages. A person should seek medical attention if the above signs or symptoms are seen and experienced.\n\n【75】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【76】无关删除-1:<u>*   Common skin disorders of the penis  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12175386/\n*   Penile skin diseases  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10643512/\n*   Types of Penile Conditions and Diseases  \n    https://www.beaumont.org/conditions/types-of-penile-conditions-diseases</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Foot muscles can be classified into two: extrinsic and intrinsic muscles. Intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the foot refer to the location of the muscles in the foot.\n\n【2】What Are the Extrinsic and Intrinsic Muscles?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Intrinsic muscles are located within the foot and primarily control the position and movement of the bones and joints of the foot. These muscles are responsible for maintaining the foot's arch, controlling the position of the toes, and helping to balance the foot while standing and walking. Some of the intrinsic muscles in the foot include the flexor digitorum brevis, abductor hallucis, and quadratus plantae.\n\n【4】Extrinsic muscles are located outside the foot and are responsible for moving the foot at the ankle. These muscles work together to lift and lower the foot, turn the foot in and out, and control the position of the toes. Some extrinsic muscles in the foot include the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and peroneus longus. It is worth noting that the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles work together to control the movement and stability of the foot and ankle, and any injury or weakness in one group of muscles can affect the function of the other.\n\n【5】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【7】Tendon Injury - Causes, Treatment, And Complications\n\n【8】What Are Lumbricals?\n--------------------\n\n【9】The lumbricals of the foot are a group of four small muscles located in the foot that originate on the tendons of the flexor muscles and insert into the extensor tendons. The function of the lumbricals is to flex the toes at the metatarsophalangeal joints (the joints located between the metatarsals and the proximal phalanges of the toes) while simultaneously extending the interphalangeal joints (the joints located between the proximal and distal phalanges of the toes). This movement allows the foot to grip and release the ground during walking and running, providing stability and propulsion.\n\n【10】They also assist in the inversion and eversion of the foot, allowing for a greater range of motion and stability during gait. The lumbricals also play a role in maintaining the stability of the metatarsophalangeal joints during movement. When the foot is in a neutral position, the lumbricals are contracted, helping to keep the arch of the foot raised.\n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms of Injuries Affecting the Lumbricals of the Foot?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Symptoms can vary depending on the severity of the injury, which includes the following:\n\n【13】*   **Pain:** Pain is usually the most prominent symptom of a lumbrical injury. The patient may feel it in the affected area, which can be sharp or dull. The pain may be worse with activity and may improve with rest.\n\n【14】*   **Tenderness:** The area around the injury may be tender to the touch. Walking or applying pressure to the affected area can make it uncomfortable.\n\n【15】*   **Stiffness:** The injured muscle may become stiff and difficult to move. This stiffness can make it difficult to flex or extend the affected joint.\n\n【16】*   **Weakness:** The injured muscle may become weaker, causing difficulty lifting or moving objects with the affected limb.\n\n【17】*   **Swelling:** Swelling can occur in the affected area due to inflammation. These inflammations make the area appear larger and may cause the skin to appear red or discolored.\n\n【18】*   **Numbness or Tingling:** Numbness or tingling may be felt in the affected area if the nerve is damaged.\n\n【19】What Are the Functions of Lumbricals?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【20】Foot lumbricals play several vital roles in the function of the foot. These include:\n\n【21】*   **Extension of Toes:** The lumbricals originate on the tendons of the flexor muscles and insert on the extensor tendons, allowing them to extend the toes while maintaining flexion of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints. This is important for walking and running, allowing the foot to lift off the ground and push forward.\n*   **Inversion and Eversion:** The lumbricals also assist in the inversion and eversion of the foot, which are movements that turn the foot inward or outward, allowing a greater range of motion and stability during gait.\n*   **Maintaining Stability of MTP Joints:** The lumbricals help maintain the stability of the MTP joints during movement. This stability is important for preventing injuries and maintaining balance and stability when walking or running.\n*   **Dynamic Arch Support:** Lumbricals have a crucial role in supporting the foot arch by controlling the tension in the plantar fascia, a connective tissue at the foot's bottom. This allows for dynamic arch support, which is important for shock absorption and stability during gait.\n*   **Plantar Flexion:** Lumbricals also assist in plantar flexion of the toes, which allows the foot to point downward, as occurs when standing on a tiptoe. When the foot is in a plantarflexed position (the toes point downward), the lumbricals are relaxed, allowing the arch to flatten.\n*   **Toe-Off:** Lumbricals play a role in the toe-off phase of the gait cycle by assisting the extensor muscles during the push-off phase of gait when the foot leaves the ground, helping in propulsion and forward movement.\n\n【22】What Are the Conditions Affecting Lumbricals of the Foot?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Several conditions can affect the lumbricals of the foot, including:\n\n【24】*   **Tendonitis:** Inflammation of the tendons that attach the lumbricals to the bones can cause pain and weakness in the foot.\n*   **Overuse:** Repetitive stress on the lumbricals from activities such as running or dancing can lead to strain and injury.\n*   **Trauma:** Direct injuries to the lumbricals, such as a sprain or fracture, can damage the muscles and tendons.\n*   **Neurological Disorders:** Conditions such as peripheral neuropathy can affect the nerves that control the lumbricals, leading to weakness and reduced function.\n*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** This autoimmune disorder can cause inflammation and damage to the joints, including the MTP joints, which can affect the function of the lumbricals.\n*   **Flat Foot:** It is a condition where the arch of the foot collapses, leading to overpronation (foot roll inwards) of the foot, which can affect the function of the lumbricals.\n*   **Plantar Fasciitis:** It is a condition that affects the connective tissue on the bottom of the foot, causing heel pain and stiffness. The pain can radiate forward and cause pain and weakness in the lumbricals of the foot.\n*   **Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome:** It is a condition that causes compression of the posterior tibial nerve, which runs behind the medial malleolus and through the tarsal tunnel. Tarsal tunnel syndrome can also cause weakness and pain in the lumbricals.\n\n【25】It is important to note that these conditions may also have other symptoms and should be evaluated by a medical professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【26】How Can Injuries of Foot Lumbricals Be Treated?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Treatment options will vary depending on the specific condition and the severity of the injury. Some treatment options include the following:\n\n【28】*   **Rest and Ice:** Resting the affected foot and applying ice to reduce inflammation and pain can help reduce the symptoms of lumbrical injuries.\n*   **Physical Therapy:** A physical therapist can design an exercise program to help stretch and strengthen the lumbricals and other muscles of the foot and lower limb. This therapy can help improve strength, range of motion, and stability, which will aid in the recovery process.\n*   **Custom-Made Orthotics:** Orthotics can help redistribute pressure on the foot, reducing pain and inflammation. It is helpful for people with flatfoot or overpronation issues.\n*   **Medications:** Anti-inflammatory medications, such as Ibuprofen, can help reduce pain and inflammation.\n*   **Taping:** Taping the toes together can help support the lumbricals and reduce muscle strain.\n*   **Surgery:** Surgical methods may be necessary to repair or release the lumbricals in severe cases.\n\n【29】**Conclusion:**\n\n【30】Lumbricals are an important group of muscles in the foot that play a key role in maintaining stability, the foot's arch, and the toes' movement. Injuries to these muscles can cause significant problems in foot function and should be treated promptly to prevent further damage. These muscles work in coordination with other muscles of the foot and lower limb to achieve a smooth and efficient gait pattern. Damage or dysfunction of the lumbricals can result in reduced foot function and stability, leading to gait abnormalities and an increased risk of injury.\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>*   Anatomy, Shoulder and Upper Limb, Hand Lumbrical Muscles  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534876/\n*   A Biomechanical and Evolutionary Perspective on the Function of the Lumbrical Muscle  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4155599/\n*   Lumbrical muscles of the hand  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/lumbrical-muscles-of-the-hand</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Coital headaches can be present for about a few minutes, or in some individuals, they can last up to hours or even days.\n\n【2】It can be either a one-time attack or can happen cumulatively over a period of a few months. In most cases, sex headaches are not severe conditions requiring medical conditions. While in some patients, it can be a sign of a blood vessel problem involving the arteries or veins that supply the brain.\n\n【3】What Are the Types of Coital Headaches?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【4】*   **Sexual Benign Headache:** During the course of sexual intercourse, a dull and radiating headache may develop, which increases with an increase in the amount of sexual excitement.\n\n【5】*   **Orgasm Headache:** In some cases, a sudden and throbbing headache may develop during or before an orgasm.\n\n【6】What Is the Cause of Sex Headaches?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【7】The cause of sex headaches is determined by the types. A benign sexual headache occurs due to the contraction of muscles in the head and neck region brought about by sexual excitement.\n\n【8】On the contrary, orgasm headaches are caused due to dilation of blood vessels as a result of a rise in blood pressure.\n\n【9】In addition, a few headaches can occur suddenly and are associated with the following medical conditions:\n\n【10】*   Intracranial aneurysm, which is a contraction of the arterial wall inside the head.\n\n【11】*   Stroke.\n\n【12】*   Taking birth control pills.\n\n【13】*   Arteriovenous malformation due to an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain.\n\n【14】*   Arterial wall bleeding that ends up in the brain.\n\n【15】*   Inflammation caused by certain infectious diseases.\n\n【16】*   Coronary artery disease.\n\n【17】Who Is at an Increased Risk of Developing Coital Headache?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The following individuals are at an increased risk of developing coital headaches:\n\n【19】*   Being male increases the risk of developing coital headaches, most commonly orgasm headaches.\n\n【20】*   Also, individuals with migraine headaches have an increased risk of developing coital headaches.\n\n【21】How Is Coital Headache Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【22】In most cases, sex headaches are not a problem of concern and do not require treatment. However, assessing the symptoms with a healthcare provider is essential to rule out any underlying serious medical condition. Neurological problems associated with sex headaches can be diagnosed with the help of the below tests:\n\n【23】**1) Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Head:**\n\n【24】Radio waves and magnetic fields create cross-sectional images of the structures. The structures inside the brain can be visualized for any defect with the help of magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【25】2) **Magnetic Resonance Angiography**:\n\n【26】Any abnormality in the blood vessels involving the head and neck can be determined by taking a magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).\n\n【27】3) **Computed Tomography Scan**:\n\n【28】The computed tomography (CT) scan also helps in visualizing the brain and its associated structures.\n\n【29】4) **Spinal Tap**:\n\n【30】Also called lumbar puncture, it helps identify the presence of bleeding or infection. This type of diagnostic procedure is suggested in persons with an abrupt headache but with no notable defect in brain imaging tests. A small quantity of spinal fluid is collected and checked.\n\n【31】5) **Cerebral Angiogram**:\n\n【32】Arteries of the neck and brain are examined by cerebral angiogram, in which a thin and flexible tube is inserted into a blood vessel. A contrasting material is injected into the blood vessels, and images are taken.\n\n【33】What Is the Treatment for Coital Headache?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Coital headache is usually treated depending on the cause. Usually, over-the-counter painkillers help in relieving the pain associated. In cases where there is a need for medication to prevent the incidence of sex headaches, then consultation with a healthcare provider is needed.\n\n【35】The following are the preventive medicines that are usually prescribed:\n\n【36】1) **Daily Medications**:\n\n【37】Taking beta-blockers like Propranolol or Metoprolol can help in conditions where sex headache is due to high blood pressure, migraines, and coronary artery disease. However, these should be taken only with the doctor's recommendation and when there is a history of frequent and more extended headaches.\n\n【38】2) **Occasional Medications**:\n\n【39】An anti-inflammatory drug like Indomethacin can be used as a preventive aid against coital headaches.\n\n【40】1.  When an underlying condition is the cause of the sex headache, then treating the disease is essential. The treatment modalities can be either a surgical procedure, radiation therapy, or a procedure to drain the fluids.\n\n【41】2.  Medications responsible for causing coital headaches should refrain after consultation with the treating doctor.\n\n【42】How Can We Prevent Sex Headaches?\n---------------------------------\n\n【43】Sex headache can be prevented by the following:\n\n【44】*   Taking medications to prevent the incidence of sex headaches.\n\n【45】*   In case of an orgasm headache, stopping sexual activity before reaching orgasm is helpful.\n\n【46】*   Taking a passive role in sexual activities can also help prevent sex headaches.\n\n【47】When Should I Reach Out to a Doctor for a Sex Headache?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】Sex headaches can sometimes have a severe underlying condition that can be appropriately diagnosed only with prompt medical intervention. Therefore, the time when to reach out to a doctor for a coital headache is extremely important. It is advisable to contact a health care provider when you experience any of the following symptoms:\n\n【49】*   Vomiting.\n\n【50】*   Loss of sensation.\n\n【51】*   Stiffness in the neck.\n\n【52】*   Extremely severe pain that lasts more than a day and interrupts daily activities.\n\n【53】*   Paralysis, either partial or complete.\n\n【54】*   Seizures.\n\n【55】**Conclusion:**\n\n【56】Although most times, sex headaches do not require treatment, these should not be ignored entirely. If you experience a coital headache that either starts abruptly or lasts for a more extended period of time, then it is recommended to contact a health care provider. Do not take medications without the advice of the healthcare provider. If taken rightly with the doctor's prescription, medications can help prevent the incidence of coital headaches.\n\n【57】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【58】* * *\n\n【59】#### **1.**删除换行**What Causes Coital Headache?**\n\n【60】   \nCoital headaches are brought on by sexual activity, especially during orgasms.

It damages the myelin sheath (wrapped around the nerve cells in the brain) and the adrenal cortex (that surrounds the adrenal gland), leading to neurological problems and adrenal insufficiency, respectively.\n\n【2】The fundamental unit of the brain and the nervous system is the neuron; it sends and receives signals from and to the brain. It has three main parts- dendrites, an axon, and a cell body. A useful analogy is to think of the neuron as a tree. The cell body with its dendrites looks like the crown of the tree with its branches, the axon represents the trunk, and the axon terminal looks like the roots of the tree. The dendrites receive the nerve impulse, the cell body processes them, and the axon carries the processed information to the next neuron.\n\n【3】Bundles of axons combine to form the white matter in the brain and the cell body with its dendrites and form gray matter. The axons are coated with myelin which is a mixture of proteins and lipids; it insulates the axon while transmitting nerve impulses. Without myelin, the signals between the nerve cells are not transmitted properly and will lead to neurological symptoms.\n\n【4】The adrenal glands are a pair of glands that sit on the top of each kidney and produce sex hormones, cortisol, etc. which are vital for health and proper development. The adrenal cortex is the outer layer of the cells of the adrenal glands; in some patients with ACLD, the adrenal cortex does not function properly, leading to adrenal insufficiency. This leads to abnormalities in blood pressure, heart rate, sexual development, and reproduction.\n\n【5】What Causes ACLD?\n-----------------\n\n【6】*   It is an X-linked recessive disorder that is caused due to mutations (changes) in the ABCD1 gene. Because it is an X-linked disorder, males develop more serious complications than females.\n\n【7】*   X-linked inheritance means the genes causing the trait or the disorder are located in the X-chromosome. An X-linked recessive disorder means for the gene to actually express itself, the X chromosome present in the individual should always be recessive.\n\n【8】*   Females have 2 X chromosomes (XX), and males have 1Y and 1X chromosomes (XY).\n\n【9】*   The ABCD1 gene mutation in the X chromosome will cause ACLD in a female if both the X chromosomes are recessive; if one X is dominant and the other X is recessive, she will be a carrier of the mutation but will not actually be affected by ACLD.\n\n【10】*   Similarly, in a male, the ABCD1 mutation will cause ACLD if the X chromosome in their XY composition is recessive.\n\n【11】What Happens in ACLD?\n---------------------\n\n【12】A normal ABCD1 gene contains instructions for making a protein called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy protein, or simply ADLP. This protein is necessary to transport very long-chain fatty acids (which are a type of fat molecule) to their destination, where they will be metabolized or broken down.\n\n【13】In patients with ABCD1 mutation, there is a deficiency of ADLP, which will reduce the transportation of very long-chain fatty acids. As a result, these fatty acids will not get metabolized and will build up in the brain and the adrenal cortex.\n\n【14】Accumulation of these fatty acids in the brain will trigger an inflammatory reaction that ultimately damages the myelin sheath leading to neurological symptoms. In the adrenal cortex, the excess fatty acids will destroy the hormone-producing cells leading to adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【15】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of ACLD?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【16】It affects adult men at any time between their late twenties to their early fifties. The symptoms are similar to those seen in childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy; they are-\n\n【17】*   Different behavioral problems include attention deficit disorder.\n\n【18】*   Regression of previously acquired skills.\n\n【19】*   Cognitive deficit- It translates to impairment in the mental process of the patient pertaining to how an individual should act in the world.\n\n【20】*   Difficulty in understanding speech and language.\n\n【21】*   Deterioration in writing skills.\n\n【22】The symptoms at the later stage of the condition are-\n\n【23】*   Diminished vision.\n\n【24】*   Hearing loss.\n\n【25】*   Gait difficulty.\n\n【26】*   Weakness and stiffness of the limbs.\n\n【27】*   Convulsions and seizures.\n\n【28】In the advanced stage, the symptoms are-\n\n【29】*   Blindness.\n\n【30】*   Deafness.\n\n【31】*   Inability to move.\n\n【32】The condition will further progress, resulting in a vegetative stage and death within 2-3 years from the onset of the symptoms. If the condition also affects the adrenal cortex, the symptoms are as follows-\n\n【33】*   Fatigue.\n\n【34】*   Unintended weight loss.\n\n【35】*   Nausea.\n\n【36】*   Vomiting.\n\n【37】*   Gastrointestinal issues.\n\n【38】*   Morning headaches.\n\n【39】*   Low blood pressure.\n\n【40】*   Low blood sugar levels.\n\n【41】*   Hyperpigmented skin.\n\n【42】How Is ACLD Diagnosed?\n----------------------\n\n【43】After reviewing the medical and family history of the patient with the patient's family, the clinician will request the following tests-\n\n【44】*   Blood tests to check for levels of very long-chain fatty acids.\n\n【45】*   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to observe lesions in the nerves.\n\n【46】*   Vision screening will help to estimate the prognosis of the condition.\n\n【47】*   Skin biopsy and fibroblast cell culture to check for increased levels of very long-chain fatty acids.\n\n【48】How Is ACLD Treated?\n--------------------\n\n【49】There are two types of treatment-\n\n【50】*   **Standard Therapy**\\- This includes managing neurological symptoms and adrenal insufficiency by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and corticosteroid therapy, respectively. It is done in individuals who are in their early course of the condition with no neurological symptoms. In HSTC, the patient will receive hematopoietic stem cells from a healthy person known as the donor, who will prevent the progression of neurological conditions in patients with ACLD.\n\n【51】*   **Investigational Therapy**\\- This includes gene therapy which is yet to be approved. It is a procedure where the defective gene is removed and replaced with a normal gene that will produce sufficient ADLP. This will prevent the development and progression of the condition. Theoretically, this will be the cure for ACLD, but studies regarding its effectiveness and its long-term safety are still going on.\n\n【52】Another investigational therapy is Lorenzo’s oil which has reduced neurological symptoms in some children but has not been experimented on adults with cerebral leukodystrophy.\n\n【53】**Conclusion:**\n\n【54】ALCD is a neurodegenerative condition with a poor prognosis. Diagnosis plays an important role because the symptoms of ALCD often mimic multiple sclerosis, which will deviate the treatment plan and lose precious time. Treatment includes a multidisciplinary team that can handle long-term medical and emotional challenges.\n\n【55】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【56】* * *\n\n【57】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the Common Cause of Leukodystrophy?**\n\n【58】Leukodystrophy is a rare form of neurological disorder. The gene mutation in the ARSA gene causes this disease. This mutation leads to the deficiency of an enzyme that helps break down lipids called sulfatides that build up in the myelin.\n\n【59】#### **2.**删除换行**What Body Part Does Leukodystrophy Affect?**\n\n【60】Leukodystrophy is a neurological disorder which means a disorder of the brain. Leukodystrophy primarily affects the white matter of the central nervous system. White matter is a type of tissue made up of nerve fibers that connect the nerve cells.\n\n【61】#### **3.**删除换行**What Is the Life Expectancy of Leukodystrophy?**\n\n【62】Leukodystrophy is a severe condition and can be fatal. The affected individual may experience symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations. In the case of children, the life expectancy is up to five years, and in some cases, the symptoms can also progress to the age of 15 to 20 years. In adults, the patient dies within six to fourteen years after diagnosis.\n\n【63】#### **4.**删除换行**What Is the Diagnosis of Leukodystrophy?**\n\n【64】The healthcare provider will do a thorough physical examination, including a neurological exam, and review all the symptoms. Along with that, the doctor might prescribe some tests, which include -  \n\\- Complete blood test (CBC).  \n\\- Genetic tests for mutation.  \n\\- Urine test.  \n\\- Nerve conduction test to evaluate nerve impulses.  \n\\- MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans of the brain.\n\n【65】#### **5.**删除换行**How Quickly Does Leukodystrophy Progress?**\n\n【66】Leukodystrophy is progressive, meaning they get worse with time. The early sign of leukodystrophy includes behavioral problems, which can lead to problems with studying. A patient may also face difficulty in walking. The late infantile form of this disease progresses rapidly compared to other forms, and the survival rate is less than two years.\n\n【67】#### **6.**删除换行**Is Leukodystrophy Hereditary?**\n\n【68】The majority of leukodystrophy disorders are genetic or hereditary. So a person can get this from their parents. But this is not always the case, a person can have a mutated gene during the development phase, and in some cases, they might not get affected by this disease and can become a carrier.\n\n【69】#### **7.**删除换行**What Is the Management of Leukodystrophy?**\n\n【70】For now, there is no cure for leukodystrophy, and only some treatment modalities can be used to relieve symptoms, which include -  \n\\- Medications for seizures, movement problems, and muscle tightness.  \n\\- Nutritional therapy.  \n\\- Physical and speech therapy.  \n\\- Hormone therapy.  \n\\- A bone marrow transplant may also be needed.\n\n【71】#### **8.**删除换行**At What Age Can Leukodystrophy Occur?**\n\n【72】Some forms of leukodystrophy are present from birth. However, some may not show symptoms until the child becomes a toddler. Few forms of leukodystrophies mainly affect adults.\n\n【73】#### **9.**删除换行**What Is the History of Leukodystrophy?**\n\n【74】Leukodystrophies were first identified in 1980 as a progressive central nervous system genetic disorder. This disorder was discovered by Nissl and Alzheimer coincidentally in the white matter of an adult patient.\n\n【75】#### **10.**删除换行**Are All Leukodystrophy Disorders Fatal?**\n\n【76】Leukodystrophies are a progressive and fatal disease. The neurological problems caused by leukodystrophies can get worse over time. Many children with this disease die before their teenage years, and if some people reach adulthood, their life expectancy is still very low.\n\n【77】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【78】无关删除-1:<u>*   Adult Leukodystrophies: A Step-by-Step Diagnostic Approach  \n    https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/rg.2019180081\n*   MRI pattern approach of adult-onset inherited leukoencephalopathies  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5764526/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The humectants help in breaking down those dead cells. This process is called desquamation. But when the moisture content in the corneal layer is reduced to 10%, the skin tends to dry. So as soon as the humectants break down the dead cells, they draw water from deep layers of the skin.\n\n【20】What Are the Types of Humectants?\n---------------------------------\n\n【21】The most common types of humectants are,\n\n【22】*   **Hyaluronic Acid:** This is a naturally available molecule in our body, but as we age, its production decreases. This leads to drying and aging of the skin. The hyaluronic acid used in skincare products is made in laboratories.\n\n【23】*   **Glycerin:** It is also a naturally occurring substance in plants and animals. The glycerin in personal care products is derived from soya beans and sugarcane.\n\n【24】*   **Alpha Hydroxy Acids:** These acids, such as lactic acid, citric acid, and glycolic acids, help in drawing water and removing dead cells. Glycolic acid is derived from sugarcane, lactic acid is from milk, and citric is derived from citrus fruits.\n\n【25】*   **Aloe Vera:** It acts as a humectant and emollient derived from the aloe vera plant.\n\n【26】How Do Occlusives Work?\n-----------------------\n\n【27】Occlusives are protective barriers that do not allow water to escape from the skin's surface and keep the skin protected against irritants, allergens, and other harmful substances.\n\n【28】How Can Occlusives Be Used in Your Routine?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Occlusives are one of the ingredients in moisturizers. But if you wish to have double protection, adding an occlusive product such as petroleum jelly to your routine is good. But the occlusives should be applied at the last step of your routine.\n\n【30】Who Should Not Use Occlusives?\n------------------------------\n\n【31】Individuals with oily skin or acne-prone are advised not to use occlusives as the products with occlusives have heavy consistency.\n\n【32】Why Do We Need Moisturizers?\n----------------------------\n\n【33】Individuals with dry and rough skin typically use moisturizers. However, a moisturizer should be a primary product in the daily skin care of every individual as it has the following benefits.\n\n【34】*   **Anti-inflammation:** Some moisturizers have components like palmitoyl-ethanolamine, ceramide, and telmesteine that can provide a soothing effect on inflamed skin.\n\n【35】*   **Antipruritic:** Water-based moisturizers provide a cooling effect as they contain substances like methanol, thereby reducing itchy symptoms.\n\n【36】*   **Antimitotic:** Due to their antimitotic property, mineral oils are found beneficial for psoriasis, characterized by increased mitotic activity.\n\n【37】*   **Wound Healing:** Hyaluronic acid accelerates the wound healing process.\n\n【38】*   **Sun Protection:** The moisturizer helps in protecting the skin from sun damage.\n\n【39】*   **Anti Aging:** Some moisturizers contain antioxidants that fight against free radicals and prevent your skin from aging.\n\n【40】What Are the Types of Moisturizers Used for Different Skin Types?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】What Are the Disadvantages of Over-Moisturizing Your Skin?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】*   Application of moisturizers too much can often lead to clogged pores, breakouts, blackheads, and skin dryness. The extra moisturizer settles on your skin and attracts dust and pollutants, which does not allow the skin to breathe and thus makes it dull and lifeless.\n\n【43】*   The chemicals, along with the moisturizing agents in the moisturizers, are found to cause allergies and cause skin damage. They disturb the natural sebum production activity of the skin and lead to a lack of nutrients in the skin.\n\n【44】**Conclusion:**\n\n【45】Various ingredients are present in different cosmetic products used in our skincare routine. They have their benefits and side effects and act differently for different skin types.

They are a category of benign tumors. Lymph vessels move white blood cells and lymphatic fluid through the blood and the tissues. The common sites of lymphangioma are the head and neck, but they can form in any part of the body. It usually affects infants between birth and 5 years.\n\n【2】What Are Lymphangiomas?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】*   Lymphangiomas are vascular tumor-like conditions. Lymphangiomas are acquired and developmental tumor\\-like conditions of the vascular system (blood circulating system). Lymphangiomas are endothelial cells (blood cells) lined in capillary channels filled with lymphatic fluid ( a clear fluid that carries cells made up of white blood cells, lymphocytes that fight against infections).\n\n【4】*   They are tumor-like conditions in which some tissues are jumbled up. They are endothelial cells lined channels with lymphatic fluid in their channels.\n\n【5】*   The lymphangiomas are histologically classified into three main types- capillary, cystic, and cavernous.\n\n【6】*   They are most commonly found in the head, neck, and axillae, where the loose connective tissue allows easy expansion of lymphatic channels.\n\n【7】*   Intraabdominal cases account for less than five percent of all lymphangiomas. Small lymphatic channels are present subcutaneously (1-2 cm). Clinically they look like fluid-filled blisters. The fluid component of lymphangiomas can be serous (pale yellow or transparent) depending on the location. In the presence of hemorrhage, it can become bloody or purulent.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What can be the reason for elevated RBC, Hb and Hct?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What does my blood report after jaundice indicate?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What are the different contraceptive methods to be followed during unprotected sex?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Cavernous lymphangiomas are present in the base of the neck. They look like humps and are sometimes present in the axilla. They are very large lymphatic-filled endothelial lined spaces. They are also called cystic hygroma. They are massively dilated, and their margins are not well-defined.\n    </u>\n\n【9】Cavernous lymphangiomas are associated with turner’s syndrome. The condition occurs in children with genetic conditions such as:\n\n【10】*   Down syndrome (Chromosome 21 genetic disorder that causes developmental and intellectual delays).\n\n【11】*   Trisomy 18 (a condition that causes severe developmental delays due to an extra chromosome 18).\n\n【12】*   Trisomy 13 (A condition in which the person has extra chromosome 13).\n\n【13】*   Trisomy 21 (a genetic chromosome 21 disorder causing developmental and intellectual delays).\n\n【14】*   Turner syndrome (only one X chromosome is present in the female).\n\n【15】*   Noonan syndrome (a genetic condition that affects various parts of the body).\n\n【16】What Are Hepatic Lymphangiomas?\n-------------------------------\n\n【17】*   Hepatic lymphangiomas are rare congenital tumors that occur in young adults and children. They occur mainly in abdominal regions.\n\n【18】*   Hepatic lymphangioma is a disease associated with the liver.\n\n【19】*   Hepatic lymphangiomas are rare benign neoplasia characterized by congenital cystic dilatation of lymphatic vessels in the liver cells.\n\n【20】*   Solitary hepatic lymphangioma is rare and can cause a clinical misinterpretation as a malignant tumor. Hepatic lymphangiomas are extremely rare.\n\n【21】*   In most cases reported, the hepatic lesion is part of a diffuse involvement of multiple organs, including the liver, spleen, kidneys, skeleton, gastrointestinal tract, mesentery, mediastinum, lungs, pleura, pericardium, as well as the somatic soft tissues.\n\n【22】*   The condition starts with epigastric pain. The etiology of lymphangiomas is unclear.\n\n【23】*   Dysplasia of lymphatic tissue and abnormal development of lymph vessels are the mechanism for obstruction of lymphatic channels due to inflammation or trauma.\n\n【24】*   Hepatic lymphangiomas are a subset of many abdominal lymphangiomas. A similar abnormality in other organs, including kidneys, spleen, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and soft tissues, usually accompanies it.\n\n【25】*   These are usually asymptomatic. Abdominal pain is noticed. There is no bleeding associated with cystic lymphangioma of the liver. Lympahngiomas carry the risk of malignant transformation.\n\n【26】What Are the Causes of Hepatic Lymphangioma?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【27】The exact cause is unknown. It is due to abnormal development of the child’s lymphatic system during fetal development. The lymphatic system contains lymphatic fluid that contains white blood cells that pass through the bloodstream and tissues. It helps the immune system function properly. The fluid in the lymph vessel forms a pool of lymph fluid. The fluid pool appears as a liquid-filled bump on the skin(cyst). It occurs when the lymph backs up in the lymph vessels surrounding the body's tissues. They are not apparent at birth but can be more noticeable when the children grow older. Congenital developmental abnormality of the lymphatic tissues is the main cause. Localized lymphatic obstruction and dilatation o the abnormal channels are some of the causes. The other causes are vascular endothelial permeability disorders that include inflammatory processes.\n\n【28】What Is the Diagnosis of Hepatic Lymphangioma?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Most hepatic lymphangiomas are detected during routine physical examinations. An abdominal CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resource imaging) is used to help differentiate it from similar lesions. The abdominal CT shows a poorly limited, normal-sized liver. The diagnosis can be made before birth with an ultrasound exam. The lymphangioma becomes more noticeable by the age of 2, if the lymphangioma is not visually noticeable at birth.\n\n【30】What Is the Treatment for Hepatic Lymphangioma?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【31】The treatment will be necessary if it prevents the child’s moving or is blocking the liver's function. The lymphangiomas tend to reoccur. Multiple surgeries or treatments may require to manage this condition. Reoccurrence rates vary according to the type of lymphangioma. Many lymphangiomas cause no health problems. The treatment options include:\n\n【32】1.  **Sclerotherapy**\\- In this therapy, a chemical is injected into the mass, which shrinks and collapses. It has more success rate and fewer complications.\n\n【33】2.  **Laser Therapy or Radiofrequency Ablation**\\- A needle or laser delivers the current to destroy the mass.\n\n【34】3.  **Surgery**\\- The cyst is cut out. It becomes difficult if it is closely associated with the nerves and organs.\n\n【35】What Are the Complications of the Treatment?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【36】The cyst can return after the treatment because removing all the cells that caused it to grow is difficult. The cysts are large and deep and are difficult to remove and grow back after the treatment. There is a risk of infection after the surgery. This would complicate the process of healing. Taking care of the surgical site while operating is essential for the best outcome. There is no prevention for lymphangiomas since it is due to an abnormal lymphatic system that happens when the child is growing.\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】The majority of lymphangiomas are non-life threatening. Since hepatic lymphangiomas are associated with a vital organ, they can cause the organs not to work effectively. It is always better to reach out to a doctor when the child has abdominal pain or changes in movement. Lympahgiomas result from genetic changes, so it is better to do genetic testing to understand the risk of having a child if a genetic condition.\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>*   Lymphangioma  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470333/\n*   Solitary hepatic lymphangioma mimicking liver malignancy: A case report and literature review - PMC  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7559670/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is the permanent end of menstruation. It marks the end of the reproductive cycle and reproductive years. The time before menopause is called perimenopause. Perimenopause begins eight years before menopause. Natural menopause is the ending of menstruation, and the person can no longer have menstrual periods. The ovaries stop releasing eggs and estrogen at this phase. The person goes without a menstrual period for 12 consecutive months. The average age for menopause is 51 years, but usually begins in the mid-40s. The estrogen levels go so down that there will be digestive issues and bloating during the menopause period in women.\n\n【2】What Is Menopause?\n------------------\n\n【3】Menopause is when the menstrual period ends, and the woman loses her childbearing capacity. Perimenopause symptoms begin four years before menopause. There are many ways to relieve discomfort and menopause bloating. After menopause, the ovaries no longer secrete estrogen. A decrease in estrogen can cause vaginal dryness, hot flashes, and night sweats. The estrogen changes from estradiol to estrone during menopause. The normal level of estradiol found in premenopausal women is 30-400 picograms per milliliter, and after menopause, the levels go down to 30 picograms per milliliter.\n\n【4】What Is Menopause Bloating?\n---------------------------\n\n【5】Bloating is an unpleasant pressure in the abdominal region caused by extra air or fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. It gives a feeling of tightness and fullness.\n\n【6】Bloating can cause swelling of the stomach. The person also gains weight through bloating. Menopausal bloating has two main causes. They are:\n\n【7】*   Gas retention.\n\n【8】*   Water retention.\n\n【9】Water and gas retention causes bloating during menopause. Estrogen levels fluctuate during menopause and perimenopause periods when a woman’s menstruation decreases. Water retention is caused by high estrogen levels, which can lead to bloating. Estrogen is not the only reason for bloating. During and after menopause, bloating is related to changes in the gastrointestinal tract. The other causes of bloating include:\n\n【10】*   Changes in diet or appetite.\n\n【11】*   Slowed digestion.\n\n【12】*   Stress-related to menopause.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Will I still pass fibroid tissue after six months of UFE?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Can Norethisterone and Serelys tablets help cure perimenopausal symptoms in a 52-year-old female?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Artificial Menopause: Its Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Swallowing air.\n\n【14】*   Other health conditions.\n    </u>\n\n【15】What Is Perimenopausal Bloating?\n--------------------------------\n\n【16】During menopause, there is an imbalance in estrogen. During perimenopause, a common hormone imbalance occurs due to estrogen dominance. The body produces more estrogen and less progesterone during the perimenopause stage. Estrogen hormones encourage water retention. Water retention can cause bloating throughout the body. High estrogen levels lead to bloating. This kind of bloating before menopause is called perimenopausal bloating.\n\n【17】How Do Low Estrogen Levels in Menopause Cause Bloating?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】*   During menopause and perimenopause periods, the hormones change rapidly. During perimenopause periods, estrogen levels are very high, and they cause the body to retain more water, which leads to bloating.\n\n【19】*   The estrogen levels go very low during menopause. Low estrogens can also cause bloating. During menopause, women usually have low progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone levels.\n\n【20】*   Bile is made up of bilirubin, bile salts, water, and fats. It is made in the liver and stored in the gall bladder. In response to cholecystokinin, bile is released. The bile aids in digestion by breaking down fats. It removes the excess cholesterol from the body.\n\n【21】*   Since estrogen levels are very low during menopause, there is a decrease in bile acid secretion. Estrogen increases the amount of cholesterol relative to bile salts and lecithin in bile. Low estrogen levels lead to less bile secretion and relatively low digestion.\n\n【22】Bloating occurs frequently during menopause and perimenopause periods. The other symptoms along with bloating are:\n\n【23】*   Weight gain.\n\n【24】*   Mood swings.\n\n【25】*   Vaginal dryness.\n\n【26】*   Insomnia.\n\n【27】*   Hot flashes.\n\n【28】What Is the Treatment for Bloating?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【29】The following methods are used to treat bloating:\n\n【30】**1.** **Antibloating Medications**\n\n【31】Over-the-counter medications for bloating are very effective. Both generic versions of brand drugs work the same way.\n\n【32】Some medications include:\n\n【33】*   Bismuth subsalicylate (found in Pepto-Bismol).\n\n【34】*   Simethicone (Found in GasX).\n\n【35】*   Over-the-counter food additives like Lactaid can make foods easier to digest, which helps prevent stomach discomfort.\n\n【36】**2\\. Menopause Hormone Therapy**\n\n【37】The treatment regulates the estrogen and progesterone levels of the body.\n\n【38】*   **Estrogen Therapy** \\- Estrogen is prescribed as a vaginal ring, spray, or gel.\n\n【39】*   **Estrogen Progesterone or Progestin Hormone Therapy (EPT)** \\- It is a combination therapy that combines estrogen and progesterone (progestin, a synthetic form of progesterone).\n\n【40】How to Prevent Bloating?\n------------------------\n\n【41】Bloating is also due to the build-up of gas in the gastrointestinal system. With a range of easy lifestyle changes, bloating can be avoided. The changes are as follows:\n\n【42】*   Drinking lots of water and staying hydrated. Staying hydrated can help prevent symptoms of gas build-up.\n\n【43】*   Regular exercising and physical activities help avoid water retention and move food through the digestive system.\n\n【44】*   Foods that cause gas retention should be avoided. These types of foods include beans, broccoli, and fatty, fried foods. Gas retention is the main cause of bloating.\n\n【45】*   Carbonated beverages should be avoided as they can lead to excess gas in the stomach.\n\n【46】*   Chewing gum makes a person swallow more air which eventually leads to bloating.\n\n【47】*   Smoking must be avoided. Smoking can make a person swallow more air, leading to bloating.\n\n【48】*   Salt can cause water retention and swelling. So reducing the amount of salt and processed foods can help avoid bloating. Higher the concentration of salt, the more the amount of water retention.\n\n【49】*   Yogurt, sauerkraut, and kefir are some of the probiotics that improve digestive health.\n\n【50】*   Larger meals are hard to digest as the metabolism slows down during menopause.\n\n【51】If a woman feels she suffers from repeated bloating during menopause, there are several medical treatments to alleviate the discomfort. The ways to relieve bloating during menopause are:\n\n【52】*   Using over-the-counter anti-bloating medications.\n\n【53】*   Taking hormone replacement therapy.\n\n【54】*   Taking prescription water pills and diuretics.\n\n【55】**Conclusion**\n\n【56】Bloating is a common symptom of menopause. During menopause, hormonal fluctuations are the most common cause of bloating. Other factors can play a role as well. Most bouts of bloating resolve quickly with medicinal therapies and lifestyle changes. Small lifestyle changes help a great deal to prevent bloating, eventually increasing the quality of life after menopause. Bloating is not a serious issue, and it will resolve on its own once the estrogen levels come to normal level.\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>*   Abdominal Bloating: Pathophysiology and Treatment  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3816178/\n*   What Is Menopause?  \n    https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-menopause#</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The following domains are noted in schizophrenia.\n\n【2】**Positive Symptoms:**\n\n【3】*   Positive symptoms include delusions and hallucinations.\n*   Ubiquitous cognitive deficits.\n*   Motor symptoms (dyskinesias).\n*   Deficits in social cognition or socio-occupational functioning.\n\n【4】Negative Symptoms:\n------------------\n\n【5】Negative symptoms include blunted affect, alogia, avolition, asociality, amotivation, anhedonia, ideational constriction, apathy or inertia, and abulia.\n\n【6】**Blunted affect:** This refers to the decreased intensity and repertoire of emotional expressions.\n\n【7】**Alogia:** This refers to the paucity in the speech content that is evident in patients with schizophrenia.\n\n【8】**Avolition**: This refers to the deficits in the initiation and maintenance of goal-directed behaviors.\n\n【9】**Anhedonia:** This is the decreased ability to experience and anticipate pleasure or pleasurable emotions.\n\n【10】Recent studies have pointed out that patients with schizophrenia can enjoy a pleasurable experience. Still, they lack desire to experience these pleasurable pursuits or enjoyable experiences.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>I get negative thoughts periodically. Is this a mental illness?</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-3:<u>Am I suffering from schizophrenia?</u>\n\n【15】Stress in a Broad Perspective - More Than Merely a Mental Illness!!\n\n【16】The ability to enjoy an experience is called consummatory hedonia, and wanting to experience a pleasurable pursuit is called anticipatory hedonia. Patients with schizophrenia display anticipatory anhedonia.\n\n【17】However, negative symptoms are not unique to schizophrenia alone.\n\n【18】Classification of Negative Symptoms:\n------------------------------------\n\n【19】Negative symptoms are attributed to deficits in the brain that correspond to the region of rewards, motivation, and pleasure. Negative symptoms may be further classified into:\n\n【20】**Enduring Primary Negative Symptoms**: The enduring primary negative symptoms are consistently present over long periods of time, despite fluctuations in other aspects of the disease. These enduring primary negative symptoms constitute the deficit syndrome in schizophrenia.\n\n【21】**Transitory Secondary Negative Symptoms:** Secondary negative symptoms are transitory in nature, fluctuate largely throughout the illness, and abate with a reduction in the other aspects of the disease.\n\n【22】What Causes Secondary Negative Symptoms?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【23】These may be secondary to positive symptoms. If a patient hears voices commanding him not to venture out of his home, he is attacked by his arch-nemesis. Such an individual is bound to stay at home for fear of being attacked. They will also limit his social interaction and display paucity in his speech content. This may be mistaken for apathy and alogia, but in fact, it is a reflection of the aftermath of auditory hallucinations, a positive symptom.\n\n【24】Secondary negative symptoms may then be due to chronic social deprivation. Chronic institutionalization comes across as a severely under-stimulating environment. This is evident in patients who are chronically institutionalized in asylums. Such long bouts of social isolation remove all motivation in these individuals to interact with the outside world, especially when they are overwhelmed by their illness and are unable to integrate their inner perceptual experiences.\n\n【25】Lastly, secondary negative symptoms may be due to medications themselves. In medical terms, it is called neuroleptic-induced dysphoria. The medications used to treat a psychotic breakdown cause a reduction in the levels of the happy hormone serotonin, which may produce a depression-like picture. However, this is not to be confused with the post-psychotic depression that is commonly seen after a psychotic episode. Although the treatment does not differ in both these scenarios, recognition of the individual clinical scenario has important prognostic ramifications. In theory, there is a risk for exacerbating the psychotic symptoms when post-psychotic depression is treated with antidepressants.\n\n【26】Deficit Syndrome:\n-----------------\n\n【27】Deficit syndrome or clustering of these negative symptoms entails a poor quality of life and impaired socio-occupational functioning.\n\n【28】Individuals become unproductive and lead a life of social isolation and deprivation.\n\n【29】The motivation to go out and do something beautiful, achieve a target, strive towards the betterment of oneself, work towards a good community, all day to day goals in the lives of a regular individual, cease to exist.\n\n【30】Degree of Future Negative Symptoms:\n-----------------------------------\n\n【31】One of the strongest predictors of the degree of future negative symptoms is what is called Duration of Untreated Psychosis, or DUP.\n\n【32】DUP refers to the time lag between the appearance of the first psychotic symptoms and the treatment sought for these symptoms.\n\n【33】The greater the duration of the untreated psychosis, the greater are the future negative symptoms and cognitive deficits.\n\n【34】An individual with a substantial cognitive reserve is offered some protection against the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and dementia.\n\n【35】Since the nature of these cognitive deficits is ubiquitous, these may be evident as early as the prodromal phase of schizophrenia.\n\n【36】The greater the volume of grey matter loss, the greater are the cognitive deficits. The greater the duration of untreated psychosis, the greater is the grey matter volume loss.\n\n【37】What Are the Treatment Options for Negative Symptoms?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】The prodromal phase of schizophrenia presents with memory disturbances, vague anxiety, depressive symptoms, and progressive social withdrawal before the positive symptoms set in. This prodrome can last as long as five years before the onset of core psychotic symptoms, like delusions and hallucinations. Factoring in all these points, it becomes imperative to seek comprehensive professional psychiatric help early in the course of the illness.\n\n【39】Management of Negative Symptoms\n-------------------------------\n\n【40】**Non-pharmacological Management:**\n\n【41】**(a) Psychosocial Interventions**: These are as important as psychopharmacological interventions, if not more. Forming support groups and meeting at regular intervals is important. During these group meetings, individual experiences and problems are voiced, client participation is encouraged, the progress made so far is assessed, and future goals are ascertained.\n\n【42】**(b) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Therapists aid the patient in unlearning older maladaptive behaviors and focusing on learning newer adaptive ones. Therapy is always individualized as there is no one-size-fits-all treatment. Studies have consistently shown that individual therapy is better than group therapy in the treatment of negative symptoms.\n\n【43】**(c) Cognitive Remediation Therapy for Cognitive Deficits:** This includes pencil-paper tasks, sudoku, crossword, and computer exercises. These exercises need to be tailored to focus on deficits in individual domains like attention, speed of thought processing, verbal working memory, reasoning, and social cognition.\n\n【44】(d) Aerobic exercises help in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and modulate neuroplasticity.\n\n【45】**Pharmacological Management:**\n\n【46】Traditionally negative symptoms have been treated with drugs like Amisulpride and Fluoxetine. Amisulpride can increase the level of the hormone prolactin in the long run. Hyperprolactinemia can set a precedent for osteoporosis.\n\n【47】Recent studies have shown that Clozapine has the highest level of evidence in managing negative symptoms. With Clozapine, the improvements are visible even after six months of initiation of treatment.\n\n【48】Clozapine trial requires regular monitoring of the White Blood Cell counts and will cause constipation, weight gain, salivation, postural hypotension, and palpitations as common side effects.\n\n【49】**Brain Stimulation Techniques:**\n\n【50】*   Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been proven to be very effective in the treatment of negative symptoms.\n\n【51】*   Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is also used in the management of some negative symptoms, although it is not as effective for negative symptoms as it is for depression and positive symptoms.\n\n【52】**Novel Treatment Approaches:**\n\n【53】**Emerging Molecular Targets:** These include gamma amino-butyric acid modulation. The oxytocin receptors are targeted in this method. This method has been implicated in the social cognition deficits in schizophrenia, along with mirror neurons.\n\n【54】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【55】* * *\n\n【56】#### **1.**删除换行**What Does Someone With Schizophrenia Do?**\n\n【57】Being a serious mental condition, schizophrenic patients perceive reality differently.

However, kidney arteries may have the potential to narrow or obstruct. This could severely harm this crucial filtration system. It may restrict the kidneys' ability to receive blood. Renovascular disorders affect the arteries that supply the kidneys. These diseases may result in renal failure or high blood pressure.\n\n【2】**What Is Glomerular Thrombotic Microangiopathy?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) are clinical disorders characterized by hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), low platelets, and organ damage brought on by the development of minute blood clots in capillaries and small arteries. Although practically any organ may be involved, the kidneys are frequently affected. In other cases, smoldering thrombotic microangiopathy might cause kidney injury without significant anemia or low platelets. Schistocytes, or fragmented red blood cells, are visible in the blood when viewed under a microscope. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, a kidney disease that can be severe and result in over 50 percent of people needing dialysis, is one of the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy. The term \"TMA\" originally stood for \"thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome,\" TTP or HUS. It is now understood that TMA can be caused by a wide range of other disorders.\n\n【4】**How Does Thrombotic Microangiopathy Affect the Kidneys?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】A group of capillaries, also known as glomerulus, which are tiny blood vessels, are present in a healthy kidney as well as the rest of the body. They are covered with a slippery layer of cells called endothelial cells. When the capillaries get injured, the blood flow through the kidney get reduced. The liquid component of blood called plasma, assists in the transport of waste to the kidney from the body to be removed through urine. The blood also contains solid components, such as platelets and red blood cells. Red blood cells transport oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, including the kidney cells. Platelets have the responsibility of sealing off any damaged areas in blood vessels to prevent it from leaking. Defects in the blood vessel wall lining may result in the formation of rough patches which are similar to patch holes on a road that can slow down traffic and cause a lot of damage. Red blood cells have the potential to expand and then rupture. Eventually, malformed red blood cells may explode. Clot formation may result from platelet activation. All of these events may cause blood vessels to shut down entirely. Finally the kidney may stop functioning due to poor blood flow, and the body may become deficient of platelets and red blood cells.\n\n【6】**What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Glomerular Thrombotic Microangiopathy?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The signs and symptoms of glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy include:\n\n【8】*   Decreased urine.\n\n【9】*   Blood in the urine.\n\n【10】*   Swollen legs.\n\n【11】*   High blood pressure.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Does low G6PD level cause hemolytic anemia?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Thalassemia Trait Screening: a Real Need in the Community</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Renal Complications in Normal Pregnancy - An Overview</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Tiredness.\n\n【13】*   Vomiting.\n\n【14】*   Dizziness.\n\n【15】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【16】*   Bruises.\n\n【17】*   Gum or nose bleeds.\n\n【18】*   Minor cuts bleed a lot.\n\n【19】*   Fever.\n\n【20】*   Abdominal pain.\n    </u>\n\n【21】**Who Is at Risk for Glomerular Thrombotic MIcroangiopathy?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The risk factor for glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy are:\n\n【23】*   Aging.\n\n【24】*   High blood pressure.\n\n【25】*   Diabetes.\n\n【26】*   Obesity.\n\n【27】*   High cholesterol.\n\n【28】*   Lack of exercise.\n\n【29】*   Smoking and other tobacco use.\n\n【30】*   A family history of early heart disease.\n\n【31】**How to Diagnose Glomerular Thrombotic Microangiopathy?**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】The doctor may review the medical history and do a physical examination. Other test includes:\n\n【33】*   **Blood Examination -** The doctor may test the blood to check the total blood count of red blood cells and platelets and also examine the blood smear under the microscope to check whether any red blood cells are damaged known as schistocytes.\n\n【34】*   **Duplex Ultrasound -** The purpose of this test is to examine the veins and arteries that supply the kidneys and blood flow. The term duplex means the combination of two different types of ultrasounds are used. First type of ultrasound is used to capture images of the kidney for the examination.In the second type is to examine the blood flow.\n\n【35】*   **Arteriogram -** This is an X-ray test used to capture the images for checking the narrowing or blockage of blood vessels. A skinny, flexible tube is inserted into an artery, and a dye (contrast) is placed through it. On an X-ray, this dye helps to show the blood vessels.\n\n【36】*   **Renography -** This test is used to examine the structure and function of the kidney. It is a specific kind of nuclear radiology procedure. This means that a little quantity of a radioactive substance is utilized throughout the test to aid the visualization of the kidneys.\n\n【37】*   **Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) -** This test combines intravenous (IV) contrast dye with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology to examine the blood vessels. On the magnetic resonance image, the contrast dye makes blood arteries appear solid. This makes the blood vessels visible to the healthcare practitioner.\n\n【38】**How to Treat Glomerular Thrombotic Microangiopathy ?**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】Depend on the severity of the underlying condition and avoid further organ damage, it may require immediate treatment,the treatment includes:\n\n【40】**Plasma Exchange -** Therapeutic plasma exchange is a common form of treatment in which the body's plasma (the water and protein component of blood) is removed and replaced with new donor plasma. Patients typically get a combination of plasma exchange, immunological suppression, and corticosteroids as part of this effective therapy for thrombocytopenic purpura. The steps of plasma exchange include:\n\n【41】*   One of the veins receives a big IV (intravenous) catheter (usually in the neck or groin).\n\n【42】*   Afterward, a plasma exchange device receives the blood from that catheter via tubing.\n\n【43】*   A blood donor's plasma is used to replace the plasma (liquid) portion of the blood after it has been taken.\n\n【44】*   The body receives the treated blood through a catheter before reentering it.\n\n【45】This procedure makes it possible to exchange the abnormal Von William factors that cause thrombocytopenic purpura to healthy Von William factors. This procedure is carried out every one to two days for around two weeks, treatments typically last a few hours each. It is being investigated whether the use of the drug Rituximab can stop thrombocytopenic purpura relapses in people who have experienced the condition on multiple occasions. While HUS typically gets better on its own. When the disease is getting worse, patients will need to be hospitalized for monitoring and hydration. Manual blood purification with dialysis may be required if renal function deteriorates too significantly. The toxin is eliminated from the body when the underlying bacterial infection disappears, and the signs and symptoms of HUS start to get better. The best course of action is still not defined for many of the defect TTP or HUS disease patterns. Although there is some dispute right now, they are frequently treated (like TTP) with plasma exchange.\n\n【46】**Conclusion:**\n\n【47】The damage to the blood vessels in the kidneys will usually repair on its own over time. HUS has a promising outlook. Kidney failure can frequently become severe enough during the disease's active phase to require manual blood purification with dialysis. Fortunately, it normally only lasts a short while. Actually, after a few months, kidney function almost always recovers to normal.\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【49】无关删除-1:<u>*   Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043262/#\n*   hrombotic Microangiopathy  \n    https://unckidneycenter.org/kidneyhealthlibrary/glomerular-disease/thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma/\n*   Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)  \n    https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/AcuteKidneyInjury</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is a rare severe condition that usually happens within one day of giving birth, but sometimes it can happen up to 12 weeks after childbirth. Globally postpartum hemorrhage results in 44,000 to 86,000 deaths per year. However, women usually lose about 500 milliliters to 1000 milliliters of blood after childbirth. But in postpartum hemorrhage, the amount of blood loss will be much more than this, causing severe complications. In addition, postpartum hemorrhage causes a significant change in blood pressure and heart rate resulting in very low blood pressure leading to shock and death if not treated as early as possible.\n\n【2】What Is Postpartum Hemorrhage?\n------------------------------\n\n【3】Postpartum hemorrhage or postpartum bleeding occurs when a woman loses more than 32 fluid ounces (vaginal delivery or cesarean section) or more than 500 milliliters of blood after vaginal delivery and 1000 milliliters of blood after cesarean section. Heavy blood loss results in symptoms including increased heart rate, restlessness, drop in blood pressure, and elevated breathing rate. Emergency medical management is given to patients with postpartum hemorrhage to avoid severe complications and death.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Postpartum Hemorrhage?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【5】1\\. Based on the onset of heavy bleeding after delivery, postpartum hemorrhage can be of two types.\n\n【6】*   **Primary Postpartum Hemorrhage** - In this type, severe blood loss occurs 24 hours after childbirth.\n\n【7】*   **Secondary Postpartum Hemorrhage** \\- It involves heavy blood loss in women within 24 hours to 12 weeks after delivery.\n\n【8】2\\. Based on the amount of blood loss after childbirth, postpartum hemorrhage can be of the following types.\n\n【9】*   **Minor** - The amount of blood loss will be less than 1000 milliliters (one liter).\n\n【10】*   **Major** - More than one liter of blood is lost after childbirth.\n\n【11】*   **Severe** \\- There will be severe blood loss of more than two liters.\n\n【12】What Are the Causes of Postpartum Hemorrhage?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage is poor uterine contraction. Other factors responsible for postpartum hemorrhage are uterine trauma, coagulopathy, and retained placental tissues.\n\n【14】*   **Uterine Atony** - Uterine tone or uterine atony is the most common etiology for the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (nearly 70 percent of cases). It is the inability of uterine tissues to contract adequately, leading to continuous bleeding. After childbirth, the uterine muscles may not contract enough to clamp the placental blood vessels, resulting in steady blood loss after delivery.\n\n【15】*   **Retained Placental Tissue** - Retention of placental tissues and placental abnormalities lead to heavy bleeding after delivery and cause post-traumatic hemorrhage.\n\n【16】*   **Uterine Trauma** - Injury to the vagina, uterus, cervix, and perineum (area between genitals and anus) during childbirth due to trauma from instruments like vacuum or forceps can cause bleeding, leading to postpartum hemorrhage.\n\n【17】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Renal Complications in Normal Pregnancy - An Overview</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Arrest of Dilation - All You Need to Know</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   **Thrombin** - Women with coagulation disorders (coagulopathies) have impaired blood coagulation, and thus uncontrollable bleeding occurs in such cases after childbirth leading to postpartum hemorrhage.\n    </u>\n\n【18】What Are the Symptoms of Postpartum Hemorrhage?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【19】*   Heavy vaginal bleeding.\n\n【20】*   Increased heart rate.\n\n【21】*   Increased respiratory rate.\n\n【22】*   Low blood pressure.\n\n【23】*   Unconsciousness.\n\n【24】*   Dizziness.\n\n【25】*   Blurred vision.\n\n【26】*   Postural hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing).\n\n【27】*   Cold skin.\n\n【28】*   Confusion.\n\n【29】*   Weakness.\n\n【30】*   Pale skin.\n\n【31】*   Abdominal or pelvic pain.\n\n【32】*   Vomiting.\n\n【33】*   Reduced red blood cell count.\n\n【34】What Are the Risk Factors Associated with Postpartum Hemorrhage?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】Certain factors are involved in the increased incidence of postpartum hemorrhage in women after childbirth.\n\n【36】They are :\n\n【37】*   Placental abnormalities.\n\n【38】*   Overstretched uterus.\n\n【39】*   Prolonged labor.\n\n【40】*   Perineal lacerations during delivery.\n\n【41】*   Infection during labor.\n\n【42】*   High blood pressure.\n\n【43】*   Anemia.\n\n【44】*   Clotting disorders.\n\n【45】*   History of multiple deliveries.\n\n【46】*   Obesity.\n\n【47】*   Clotting disorders.\n\n【48】*   Systemic infections.\n\n【49】*   Having multiple babies (twins or triplets).\n\n【50】*   Intrahepatic cholestasis (accumulation of bile in the liver) of pregnancy.\n\n【51】What Are the Diagnostic Tests Used for Postpartum Hemorrhage?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】Diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage is made through physical and visual examination, review of health history, and laboratory tests. In addition, the amount of blood lost after delivery is measured based on the volume of collected blood and soaked pads or sponges to diagnose postpartum hemorrhage. Other methods used in the diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage are the following.\n\n【53】*   Continuous monitoring of pulse rate.\n\n【54】*   Blood tests to measure clotting factors.\n\n【55】*   Red blood cell count.\n\n【56】*   Hemoglobin levels.\n\n【57】*   Ultrasound of the uterus.\n\n【58】*   Serum iron levels.\n\n【59】How Can Postpartum Hemorrhage Be Prevented?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【60】The most significant way to prevent postpartum hemorrhage is to identify and evaluate the potential risk factors for each woman before childbirth and take appropriate preventive measures. Individuals with placental problems like placental abruption (a serious condition where placenta separates from the uterus), placenta accreta (placenta grows deep into the wall of the uterus), placenta previa (the placenta blocks the cervix completely or partially), and retained placenta (placenta does not completely move out of the uterus after childbirth) are considered at high-risk for postpartum hemorrhage. Detailed medical history and associated symptoms must be recorded to rule out the chance of developing postpartum hemorrhage. Specific therapeutic agents can be used right after childbirth to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. For example, oxytocin is given during delivery to enhance uterine contractions and prevent heavy bleeding. However, the consumption of adequate iron supplements during pregnancy and resultant normal red blood cell levels can minimize the complications of postpartum hemorrhage.\n\n【61】How To Treat Postpartum Hemorrhage?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【62】Emergency medical management is needed for postpartum hemorrhage. The first line of treatment involves stopping the source of bleeding to avoid further bleeding as early as possible and blood volume replacement.\n\n【63】Other treatment strategies used for the management of postpartum hemorrhage are:\n\n【64】*   Uterine massage to enhance uterine contractions and reduce bleeding.\n\n【65】*   Intravenous administration of oxytocin to stimulate contractions.\n\n【66】*   Removal of retained placental tissues.\n\n【67】*   Blood transfusion.\n\n【68】*   Use of clot-stabilizing agents like Tranexamic acid to prevent excessive blood loss.\n\n【69】*   Uterine artery embolization.\n\n【70】*   Repair cervical, vaginal and uterine lacerations and tears to reduce blood loss.\n\n【71】*   Use of a balloon or catheter to apply pressure on uterine walls to prevent bleeding.\n\n【72】*   Tying off the ruptured blood vessels to reduce further bleeding and complications.\n\n【73】*   In severe cases, a hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) or laparotomy (a surgical procedure where the abdominal cavity is accessed through cuts made in the abdominal wall) is carried out to save the patient's life.\n\n【74】**Conclusion**\n\n【75】Postpartum hemorrhage is a serious emergency medical condition that occurs in women due to severe vaginal bleeding after delivery. Due to abnormal blood loss, there will be alterations in heartbeat and a drop in blood pressure resulting in complications. Poor uterine contractions, uterine trauma, coagulation disorders, placenta abnormalities, and retained placental tissue are the common etiological factors causing postpartum hemorrhage. Early detection and emergency medical management are necessary to avoid further bleeding and complications and to save lives.\n\n【76】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【77】* * *\n\n【78】#### **1.**删除换行**How Much Blood Loss Is Estimated To Be A Postpartum Hemorrhage?**\n\n【79】Postpartum hemorrhage is a common and serious complication associated with childbirth. An estimated blood loss of greater than 500 mL associated with vaginal birth and blood loss greater than 1000 mL associated with C-section birth is referred to as postpartum hemorrhage.\n\n【80】#### **2.**删除换行**When Does Postpartum Hemorrhage Happen?**\n\n【81】Postpartum hemorrhage refers to heavy bleeding following childbirth. It usually takes place within a day following childbirth but can take place up to three months following childbirth. About one to five women among hundred women who undergo childbirth have postpartum hemorrhage.\n\n【82】#### **3.**删除换行**How Does Uterine Atony Result In Postpartum Hemorrhage?**\n\n【83】During childbirth, normally, the uterus contracts, and the placenta gets expelled. After the placenta gets expelled, the uterine contractions that follow aid in compressing bleeding vessels at the region of placental attachment. If the uterine contractions are inadequate, the condition is called uterine atony and is one of the commonest causes of postpartum bleeding.\n\n【84】#### **4.**删除换行**Which Medication Are Used to Treat Postpartum Hemorrhage?**\n\n【85】The medications used for the management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) are uterotonic agents and include:  \n - Oxytocin- Oxytocin is the first line of therapy for PPH, which stimulates the contraction of the myometrium and reduces blood flow through the uterus.  \n - Ergot Alkaloids- Ergot alkaloids cause generalized smooth muscle contraction.  \n - Prostaglandins- Prostaglandins cause vasoconstriction and enhance uterine contractions.\n\n【86】#### **5.**删除换行**How to Prevent Postpartum Hemorrhage By Natural Methods?**\n\n【87】 - Breastfeeding is recommended immediately following childbirth, this results in the release of oxytocin which aids in uterine contractions.   \n - Uterine massage helps in expelling blood clots.   \n - Management of the third stage of labor helps in preventing PPH. The prophylactic measures taken include prophylactic uterotonic (medicines given for stimulating uterine contraction), early cord clamping, and controlled cord traction.\n\n【88】#### **6.**删除换行**How to Manage Postpartum Hemorrhage?**\n\n【89】The management of postpartum hemorrhage involves:  \n - Uterine atony is managed by bimanual massage. In this technique, the vaginal hand is used for compressing the anterior aspect of the uterus, and the abdominal hand is used for compressing the posterior aspect of the uterus.  \n - Medications used for management include uterotonic agents like oxytocin, ergot alkaloids, and prostaglandins.  \n - Removing placental pieces from the uterus.  \n - Blood transfusion.  \n - Repairing cervical, vaginal, and uterine lacerations.  \n - Using a catheter to put pressure on the uterine wall.\n\n【90】#### **7.**删除换行**What Are the Symptoms of Postpartum Hemorrhage?**\n\n【91】The symptoms of postpartum hemorrhage are:  \n - Persistent uncontrolled bleeding.  \n - Increased heart rate.  \n - Reduction in red blood cell count.  \n - Reduction in blood pressure.  \n - Pain and swelling in the vaginal region.\n\n【92】#### **8.**删除换行**How To Know If One Has Postpartum Hemorrhage?**\n\n【93】One with PPH shows the following symptoms:  \n - Persistent uncontrolled bleeding from the vagina.  \n - Reduction in blood pressure and signs of shock (chills, blurry vision, dizziness, and increased heart rate).  \n - Pale skin.  \n - Pain and swelling in the vaginal region.  \n - Nausea.\n\n【94】#### **9.**删除换行**What Factors Increase a Woman’s Risk for Postpartum Hemorrhage?**\n\n【95】The factors that increase a woman’s risk of developing PPH include the following:  \n - Multiple baby pregnancies.  \n - Prolonged labor.  \n - Infection.  \n - Forceps-assisted delivery.  \n - Early placental detachment from the uterus (placental abruption).  \n - When the placenta covers the cervix (placenta previa).  \n - Overdistended uterus (abnormally large uterus).\n\n【96】#### **10.**删除换行**Why Is Misoprostol Given for Postpartum Hemorrhage?**\n\n【97】Misoprostol is a uterotonic agent used for the management of PPH. It is a prostaglandin used to increase uterine tone and for reducing PPH. Studies show it to be an effective treatment for PPH, but associated side effects have limited its use.\n\n【98】#### **11.**删除换行**What Is the Most Common Cause of Primary Postpartum Hemorrhage?**\n\n【99】Uterine atony (inadequate uterine contractions) is the most common cause of primary postpartum hemorrhage. Other causes of primary postpartum hemorrhage include:  \n - Retained placenta.  \n - Coagulation disorders.  \n - Abnormal placentation.  \n - Uterine inversion.  \n - Genital tract injuries.\n\n【100】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【101】无关删除-1:<u>*   Stanford Medicine - Postpartum Hemorrhage  \n    https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=postpartum-hemorrhage-90-P02486\n*   NIH - Acute Postpartum Hemorrhage  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499988/\n*   Postpartum Hemorrhage: Prevention and Treatment  \n    https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/0401/p442.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

There has been a paradigm shift in the understanding of this complex brain disorder.\n\n【2】What Are the Inheritance and Perpetuation of Manic Episodes?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Those afflicted with bipolar disorder are prone to a lot of mood changes, sometimes on a day-to-day basis. This disorder runs in families, and research has identified many loci for its inheritance.\n\n【4】The various facets of this disorder include hypomania, mania, and depression. Each of these phases can be debilitating. The majority of those suffering from bipolar disorder spend their time being depressed rather than in mania or hypomania.\n\n【5】*   The maximum duration that depression occurs or an episode can last is for 9 to 12 months, while a manic episode will remit within 3 to 6 months. However, this is not the rule in every case, but it is the maximum time period that a mood episode can last. Following this, there will be spontaneous remission, what is called ''the natural course'' of the disorder.\n\n【6】*   Spontaneous remission of the mood episode (depression or mania or hypomania) is not seen in all cases, and there are quite a few chronic mania patients as well.\n\n【7】*   Rather than the severity or duration of manic symptoms, factors associated with chronicity in mania are the presence of psychotic symptoms and issues related to social and occupational functioning.\n\n【8】What Are Behavioral Disturbances?\n---------------------------------\n\n【9】Mood episodes are intense, and people are prone to have behavioral disturbances during such episodes. It is imperative to seek professional help from a psychiatrist.\n\n【10】If left untreated, there will be serious socioeconomic implications with resultant loss of functioning capacity, quality of life, pay, and absence from work.\n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms of People with a Manic Episode?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】*   They may feel very ''up'' or ''high'', feel ''jumpy'' or ''wired''.\n\n【13】*   They talk really fast with difficulty in interrupting them.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Do my symptoms indicate bipolar disorder or schizophrenia?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Taking medicines for bipolar disorder, but unable to sleep.

More often than not, it is common for clinicians to miss a previous mood episode which altogether changes the diagnosis.\n\n【40】*   Bipolar disorder is a clinical diagnosis, and there is no investigation that will effectively point to the diagnosis as of now.\n\n【41】*   Research is going on to find reliable biomarkers, as in the case of cancer, for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\n\n【42】How Is Bipolar Disorder Prevented?\n----------------------------------\n\n【43】Bipolar disorder cannot be prevented. But getting treatment at the earliest can help prevent bipolar disorder or any other mental health conditions from getting worsened.\n\n【44】When you have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, following some strategies can help to prevent minor symptoms from becoming full-blown episodes. They are,\n\n【45】*   **Paying Attention To Warning Signs** \\- When we address the symptoms earlier, one can prevent episodes from getting worse because the pattern of bipolar episodes and its triggering factors can be identified. Reach the doctor when you feel falling into an episode of mania or depression. Also, involve your family or friends to watch for warning signs.\n\n【46】*   **Avoid Drugs and Alcohol** \\- Recreational drugs or alcohol consumption can worsen the symptoms and make them more likely to return.\n\n【47】*   **Take the Medications As Directed** \\- Do not stop the medication or reduce the dose on your own because it may cause withdrawal effects or the symptoms may worsen or recur.\n\n【48】How Is Bipolar Disorder Treated?\n--------------------------------\n\n【49】A host of options exist for the treatment of bipolar disorders. The current philosophy of treating bipolar disorder lies in symptom control and prophylaxis.\n\n【50】Risk for recurrent episodes exists throughout one's life, and one school of thought says that prophylaxis should be for a lifetime. Again, there are differing schools of thought, as there is none to fit all treatment.\n\n【51】**Medication:**\n\n【52】These are referred to as mood stabilizers. Those with euphoric (intense sense of happiness) mania are treated with Lithium, and those with dysphoric or irritable mania are treated with Valproate.\n\n【53】Those who have a preponderance of repeated depressive spells in their course of this disorder are treated with Olanzapine-Fluoxetine combination, Quetiapine, or Lamotrigine. All atypical antipsychotics serve as antimanic agents.\n\n【54】**Therapy:**\n\n【55】''Talk'' therapy can help clients change their behavior and manage their lives. Therapy should also include family members, and they should be educated about the illness, its natural course, prognosis, and treatment options.\n\n【56】A specialized form of therapy, called Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT), exists for clients with bipolar disorder. All psychiatrists undergo training to administer this form of therapy.\n\n【57】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【58】* * *\n\n【59】#### **1.**删除换行**Can Bipolar Episodes Be Controlled?**\n\n【60】There is no such cure for bipolar episodes, but it can be managed through mood stabilizers, behavior therapy, and other bipolar medicine.

Without blood, the body's organs would be deprived of oxygen and nutrients, and people would be unable to keep warm or cool, fight infections, or eliminate waste. Blood circulates throughout the body, delivering vital substances such as oxygen and nutrients to the cells. It also removes metabolic waste from the cells. There is no replacement for blood. It cannot be manufactured or made. Human blood comprises four basic components that are plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n\n【2】The heart's pumping action circulates blood through blood vessels throughout the body. Blood also performs immunological functions such as the circulation of white blood cells and the detection of foreign material by antibodies, as well as core body temperature regulation and coagulation.\n\n【3】What Is Blood Donation?\n-----------------------\n\n【4】A blood donation is voluntary and involves drawing blood for transfusion or bio-pharmaceutical purposes. Donating blood benefits not only the recipient but also the donor's health. Blood donation has numerous health benefits. There are numerous myths surrounding blood donation. It is also an act of kindness. Blood is in high demand. Industries cannot manufacture human blood and it can only be obtained from donors.\n\n【5】Blood donation can be either a whole blood donation or donating specific components is possible (apheresis). Blood banks frequently participate in both the collection process and the following procedures.\n\n【6】Among the many advantages of donating blood is assisting people injured in accidents, undergoing cancer treatment, or battling blood diseases.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】The Mayo Clinic Diet - Effects, Benefits, and Limitations\n\n【10】Will I get lung cancer with a 3 year history of smoking?\n\n【11】Fasting and Its Implications on Health\n\n【12】What Are the Types of Blood Donations?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【13】Blood donation is a selfless act that can help save lives. There are various forms of blood donation. Each type assists in meeting various medical needs.\n\n【14】**1\\. Whole Blood Donation**: The most common type of blood donation is whole blood donation. Individuals give about a pint (half a liter) of whole blood during this donation. The blood is then separated into its constituents, which include red cells, plasma, and, in some cases, platelets.\n\n【15】**2\\. Apheresis:** Donors are hooked up to a machine that collects and separates different parts of their blood during apheresis. Red cells, plasma, and platelets are examples of blood components. The device then returns the remaining blood components to the individuals. The following are the few types of blood collection by this method.\n\n【16】*   **Platelet Donation (Plateletpheresis)**\\- Only platelets are collected during this donation. Platelets are the cells that clump together and form plugs in blood vessels to help stop bleeding (clotting). People with clotting issues or cancer and those undergoing organ transplants or major surgery are frequently given donated platelets.\n\n【17】*   **Double Red Cell Donation**\\- Donating a concentrated amount of red blood cells is possible with this donation. People's organs and tissues receive oxygen from red blood cells. Donated red blood cells are typically given to people suffering from severe blood loss, such as after an injury or accident, and those suffering from sickle cell anemia.\n\n【18】*   **Plasma Donation (Plasmapheresis)**\\- The blood's liquid component (plasma) is collected. Plasma aids in blood clotting and contains antibodies that aid in the fight against infections. Plasma is commonly used to stop bleeding in emergency and trauma situations.\n\n【19】What Are the Benefits of Regular Blood Donation?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Donating blood has both emotional and physical health benefits. In addition, people who donate blood regularly may also benefit from the following:\n\n【21】*   **Hemochromatosis Is Prevented:** Giving blood lowers the risk of developing hemochromatosis (also known as iron overload, a condition where the body overproduces iron). Unfortunately, this health condition could be inherited at our cost as a result of alcoholism, anemia, and other disorders.\n\n【22】*   **Production of Blood Cells:** Following a blood donation, the body will replenish blood loss by stimulating the production of new blood cells. The new blood cells would aid in the maintenance of a person's health.\n\n【23】*   **Cancer Prevention:** Donating blood lowers the risk of cancer by keeping iron stores in the blood at healthy levels. A lower iron level in the body has been linked to a lower risk of cancer. But, at the same time, low iron levels cause iron deficiency and other health problems.\n\n【24】*   **Maintaining the Health of the Heart and Liver:** Donating blood is advantageous because it lowers the risk of heart and liver problems caused by iron overload in the body. When people overeat food, only a portion is absorbed, and the rest is stored in the heart, liver, or pancreas. Excess iron in the body raises the risk of developing health problems such as liver failure, pancreatic damage, or heart abnormalities. As a result, by donating blood, the body can maintain the required iron levels and reduce the risk of various health conditions.\n\n【25】What Happens During Blood Donation?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【26】To donate blood, individuals must first register. This includes presenting identification, providing the medical history, and undergoing a brief physical examination. Donors will also be given some blood donation information to read. Then, the procedure will begin once the donors are ready. The most common type of donation is whole blood. This is due to the fact that it provides the most flexibility. It can be transfused whole or separated into red cells, platelets, and plasma for various recipients.\n\n【27】For a whole blood donation procedure, donors will be seated in a recliner. However, it is possible to donate blood while sitting or lying down. Their arms will be cleaned in a small area. After that, a sterile needle will be inserted. A pint of blood will be drawn while they remain seated or lying down. This takes approximately 8 to 10 minutes. A health practitioner will remove the needle and bandage from the arm once a pint of blood has been collected.\n\n【28】Other types of donation are carried out using a procedure known as apheresis. Both of the donor's arms are connected to an apheresis machine. It takes a small amount of blood and separates it before returning the unused components to the donor. This cycle is repeated several times over the course of about two hours. Once the donation is complete, donors will be given a snack and a drink, as well as the time to sit and rest for 10 or 15 minutes before leaving. If someone feels dizzy or nauseous, they can lie down until they feel better.\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】Donating blood is an excellent way to give back to the community because both the donor and the recipient will benefit from it. Donating blood is a simple and quick process. There are usually no side effects when donating blood. If a person is a frequent blood donor, consulting a doctor about iron supplements and maintaining a normal blood level in the body is required. Blood donation is an essential component of global healthcare. It makes blood transfusion possible as a life-sustaining and life-saving procedure.\n\n【31】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【32】* * *\n\n【33】#### **1.**删除换行**Is Regular Blood Donation Healthy?**\n\n【34】Yes,Regular blood donation makes a person healthy.

The fundoscopic examination is done using a magnifying glass and a special light to study the fundus of the eyes. The fundus of the eye means the innermost part of the eye containing the retina and the optic nerve. Cherry-red spot occurs from the retinal edema due to various conditions like retinal artery occlusion and traumatic retinal ischemia, where the perimacular part of the retina will remain translucent and the fovea centralis (the blind spot) will be normal.\n\n【2】In simpler words, the fat accumulates in the retinal ganglion cells, surrounded by the fovea. The retinal ganglion cells will become cloudy and become white, while the fovea remains the same, giving a cherry-red spot look. This feature helps in diagnosing various underlying conditions associated with it. In most cases, the cherry-red spot will resolve on its own or diminish over time. But this does not mean that the condition is resolved either.\n\n【3】What Are the Causes of Cherry-Red Spot?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【4】*   **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion -** The blood vessels supplying the retinal layer get blocked, causing vision loss. This can be caused due to increased blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and glaucoma.\n\n【5】*   **Intraorbital Hemorrhage -** It is caused due to an intraorbital trauma or surgery. This can compromise retinal circulation causing cherry-red spots.\n\n【6】*   **Macular Infarction -** It is a condition causing vision problems, but the cause is not known. A few suggest ocular trauma to be the cause in some cases.\n\n【7】*   **Tay-Sachs Disease -** It is a genetic disorder characterized by the absence of enzymes essential to break down the fatty content called gangliosides.

A detailed history of the patient and a complete examination is required to narrow the condition causing it.\n\n【25】A complete history of the patient will be noted. The sudden vision loss will be assessed. The history of cardiovascular diseases present will be evaluated. Patients will be asked if a lysosomal storage disorder is present in any of the family members. Patients will be asked about drug usage, smoking and if they have had any eye injury.\n\n【26】The patient will be asked to undergo a series of diagnostic tests like carotid doppler ultrasonography, fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . chest x-ray, echocardiography, electrocardiogram (ECG), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and blood pressure and pulse monitoring.\n\n【27】Lab tests are also considered to arrive at a diagnosis. Tests to find the complete blood count, blood sugar levels. Blood pressure, cholesterol levels, homocysteine levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, lipid and triglycerides levels and molecular analysis of the cells or tissues.\n\n【28】What Are the Possible Differential Diagnoses of Cherry-Red Spot?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】*   Macular hemorrhage.\n\n【30】How to Manage the Cherry-Red Spot and Associated Conditions?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】In case of central retinal artery occlusion, doctors will recommend ocular massages; hyperbaric oxygen therapy, medications to decrease the intraocular pressure will be prescribed.\n\n【32】In cases of lysosomal storage disorders, doctors will recommend therapy to replace the enzymes, improve symptoms and reduce the intake of specific molecules.\n\n【33】Surgical removal of the clot will be suggested. Pars plana vitrectomy is the procedure done to remove the clot. It is a special procedure done by inserting specially designed tools through the sclera (the white part of the eye) and removing the vitreous humor and retina affected by the scar tissue.\n\n【34】What Is the Prognosis?\n----------------------\n\n【35】There is no clear evidence that suggests the above management to bring the lost vision back. But, the condition will improve and the symptoms can be controlled.\n\n【36】What Are the Complications Associated with It?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Neovascularization is the common complication of this condition. Neovascularization can be treated if there is not much delay in seeking a doctor.\n\n【38】**Conclusion**\n\n【39】Cherry-red spot is a fundoscopic feature and can be associated with various conditions. In this case, diagnosis plays a major part. A precise diagnosis is required to frame the treatment plan. There is no evidence that suggests vision loss can be treated. Only the conditions can be treated to some extent and the symptoms can be controlled.

This can be diagnosed only through fundoscopic examination. Fundus is the part of the eye containing the retina and optic nerve.\n\n【44】#### **2.**删除换行**Is Cherry Red Spot Seen in Gaucher’s Disease?**\n\n【45】Cherry red spots are typically seen in the center of the eye's macula. It is common with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), retinal ischemia, and lysosomal storage disorders. It is a common manifestation of Gaucher’s disease.\n\n【46】#### **3.**删除换行**When Should I Be Worried About a Red Spot?**\n\n【47】The edema of the retina causes a cherry red spot. Various factors cause it. Usually, this cherry red spot resolves within four to six weeks provided the condition's cause is appropriately treated. Otherwise, it can cause neovascularization (formation of new blood vessels).\n\n【48】#### **4.**删除换行**What Is Tay-Sachs Disease Caused By?**\n\n【49】Tay-Sachs disease is a genetic condition inherited from parents. It is characterized by the absence of an enzyme that breaks down fatty substances. These fatty substances will build up in the brain and spine affecting nerve function. This condition can be inherited only if both parents have the faulty gene.\n\n【50】#### **5.**删除换行**How Long Can a Person Live With Tay-Sachs?**\n\n【51】Tays-Sachs is a genetic condition inherited from both parents that involve a gene not containing the enzyme essential for breaking down fats. Usually, a child affected by this condition will live for three to five years. Rarely this condition can start showing its effects in the later stages of life.\n\n【52】#### **6.**删除换行**Is Tay-Sachs More Common in Ethnicity?**\n\n【53】Tays-Sachs is a very rare genetic condition. It is common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. This group of people belongs to Eastern Europe and Central Europe. This condition is fatal as it affects the functioning of the nerves due to fat buildup in areas of the brain and spine.\n\n【54】#### **7.**删除换行**Can Tay-Sachs Disease Be Detected Before Birth?**\n\n【55】It is suggested to do a simple blood test before or during the phase of pregnancy to detect Tay-Sachs disease.

An overdose of flecainide can cause heart failure, dysrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Yet, despite these severe side effects of flecainide, clinicians are unaware of the toxicities. Flecainide intoxication is rare but serious due to the potential for cardiogenic (heart) shock. Flecainide toxicity diagnosis can be difficult and usually misdiagnosed. The clinicians are unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of Flecainide toxicity as the Flecainide serum level may take days to result. The clinicians should be aware as the usage of Flecainide is growing and count it as a differential diagnosis in patients who are on Flecainide. Treatment can be lifesaving if initiated promptly after proper diagnosis.\n\n【2】What Is Flecainide?\n-------------------\n\n【3】Flecainide is a subclass of antiarrhythmic drugs. Anti-arrhythmic drugs are used to prevent and treat irregularities of cardiac rhythm. Cardiac arrhythmias arise due to abnormal impulse generation or abnormal impulse conduction or both. Impulse generation refers to the signal that arises from the heart, which is sent to the brain. Arrhythmias are caused by altering the electrophysiological (electric activity of the heart) properties of the heart’s fibers. In addition, the imbalance of electrolytes and pH, stretching, injury, drug, and anti-arrhythmic drugs can cause arrhythmia.\n\n【4】Anti-arrhythmic drugs are classified into four class system, which considers the drug's primary action:\n\n【5】*   **Class 1**\\- The primary action of the drug in this class is to limit the conductance of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane and act as a local anesthetic (a substance that induces insensitivity to pain)action.\n\n【6】    *   Subclass 1(A) - Quinidine, Procainamide.\n\n【7】    *   Subclass 1(B) - Lidocaine, Mexiletine.\n\n【8】    *   Subclass 1(C) - Flecainide.\n\n【9】*   **Class 2** - The primary action of class 2 drugs is to suppress adrenergically mediated ectopic activity and delay after-depolarization. Example - Propranolol.\n\n【10】*   **Class 3** - The characteristic action of class 3 anti-arrhythmic is the prolongation of repolarization. Example - Dofetilide\n\n【11】*   **Class 4** - The Class 4 drug are calcium channel blockers. Example - Verapamil, Diltiazem.\n\n【12】Flecainide is a subclass of class 1(C) drugs.

This proarrhythmic activity occurs in 4 percent to 12 percent of patients on flecainide therapy. These activities with a similar percentage are noted with other antiarrhythmic agents. The overdose of Flecainide in the cardiac patient during the treatment of arrhythmia causes Flecainide toxicity. The most dangerous adverse effect is ventricular tachycardia. Several studies suggest a daily maintenance dose of 200 mg or less.\n\n【35】The following are the side effects of Flecainide toxicity:\n\n【36】*   **Ventricular Tachycardia** - Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are Flecainide toxicity's most serious side effects. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias refer to the irregular signal from the ventricle (lower chamber of the heart). These rhythms can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (fibrosis of the lower chamber of the heart) and lead to sudden cardiac death.\n\n【37】*   **Severe Bradycardia** - Bradycardia refers to a decreased heartbeat.\n\n【38】What Are the Symptoms of Flecainide Toxicity?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【39】Flunacide toxicity is a serious condition. The toxic effects of Flunacide can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract, and can even be fatal in some cases.\n\n【40】The following are the symptoms of flecainide toxicity:\n\n【41】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【42】*   Vomiting and diarrhea.\n\n【43】*   Lethargy and weakness.\n\n【44】*   Difficulty urinating.\n\n【45】*   Yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes (jaundice).\n\n【46】*   Seizures or convulsions.\n\n【47】How to Diagnose Flecainide Toxicity?\n------------------------------------\n\n【48】Flecainide toxicity is rare but usually misdiagnosed. The diagnosis of Flecainide toxicity is difficult as Flecainide serum level may take days to result. The dysrhythmia impact linked with Flecainide use is one of the most problematic side effects. Hence it is typically diagnosed best by electrocardiogram (ECG).\n\n【49】The following ways to diagnose Flecainide toxicity:\n\n【50】*   **Blood Tests** - A complete blood test will show a high level of Flecainide in the blood. Patients with Flecainide toxicities are detected with hypokalemia. Blood tests can examine the low level of potassium in the blood.\n\n【51】*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG)** - Easy is a technique to measure the heart's electric impulses. Patients with Flecainide toxicities show abnormal electric activities obtained from the heart.\n\n【52】*   **Liver Function Tests (LFT)** - LFT is done to detect abnormalities in the level of enzymes of the liver. Patients with Flecainide toxicities have abnormal LFTs.\n\n【53】How to Treat Flecainide Toxicity?\n---------------------------------\n\n【54】Fatalities usually occur due to rapid-onset hypotension and ventricular dysrhythmias after severe overdoses. Therefore, early recognition and proper treatment are vital. The treatment of Flecainide toxicity involves cessation of Flecainide medication as soon as possible.\n\n【55】The following ways can treat Flecainide toxicity:\n\n【56】*   Flecainide therapy should be discontinued as the signs of intoxication is observed.\n\n【57】*   Increasing the excretion of Flecainide.\n\n【58】*   The patient should be intubated and ventilated mechanically.\n\n【59】*   Cardiogenic shock can be treated with Dopamine and a sodium load infusion.\n\n【60】*   Physostigmine salicylate can be given to protect against many cardiotoxic agents.\n\n【61】*   Norepinephrine infusion for blood pressure support to treat hypotension.\n\n【62】*   The ventricular tachycardia resolved once the Flecainide was discontinued.\n\n【63】*   Acute kidney failure (AKI) resolved after stabilization of hemodynamic (circulatory support).\n\n【64】*   The toxic amounts of flecainide were removed with gastric lavage (emptying of gastroesophageal passage).\n\n【65】**Conclusion**\n\n【66】Flecainide intoxication is rare but serious due to the potential for cardiogenic shock. The potential to cause heart failure is a serious complication that highlights the importance of maintaining doctors' differential diagnosis for the patient taking Flecainide. Flecainide intoxication is caused due to overdose of Flecainide. The recommended dose of Flecainide is 200 mg or less.

In such cases, where there is a need for continuous dialysis permanently, a kidney transplant can be a healthier option.\n\n【8】Various diseases leading to renal failure are;\n\n【9】*   Glomerulonephritis (a condition in which the glomerulus (filtering unit of the kidney) undergoes inflammation).\n\n【10】*   Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.\n\n【11】*   Immunocompromised conditions.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    In spite of testing positive for herpes, can I receive kidney transplant?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Do I have urinary problems because I have just one kidney?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Dr. Aman Gupta</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   High blood pressure.\n\n【13】*   Abnormal growth of the kidneys.\n\n【14】*   Polycystic kidney disease.\n\n【15】*   Acute or chronic kidney injury.\n    </u>\n\n【16】A kidney transplant is required when kidney failure occurs. In kidney failure, one or both the kidneys stop working. And if that happens, dialysis is required permanently. Since dialysis regularly is inconvenient, a kidney transplant can be done. Kidney transplants can be done in adults as well as children. There is no age limit for a kidney transplant surgery. A child's immune system adapts to the new kidneys easily compared to adults.\n\n【17】What Is Kidney Transplant Surgery?\n----------------------------------\n\n【18】A kidney transplant is a surgical procedure in which the donated kidney is placed in the lower abdomen, where it is connected to the urinary bladder. This procedure does not involve removing patients' kidneys; rather, a donated kidney is placed in a new position lower than the position of the original kidneys near the urinary bladder. The new kidney function depends upon the source of the donation. If the donated kidney is from a living donor, then it starts working quickly. If it is from a deceased donor, it may require two to four weeks for the kidney to work, and if that happens, dialysis is required till it functions.\n\n【19】Blood matching is required in such a way that there is no mismatch between the donor and recipient.\n\n【20】*   If the recipient's blood type is A donor's blood type should be A or O.\n\n【21】*   If the recipient's blood type is B donor blood type should be B or O.\n\n【22】*   If the recipient's blood type is O donor's blood type should be O.\n\n【23】*   If the recipient's blood type is AB donor blood type may be A, B, AB, or O.\n\n【24】The AB blood type accepts kidneys from all other blood types, whereas blood type O is the hardest to match since blood type O can donate to all other blood groups and can receive kidneys only from blood type O. And if a patient with blood type O receives a kidney from a donor with blood type A, the body recognizes the donor kidney as foreign and destroys it.\n\n【25】What Is the Procedure for Kidney Transplant Surgery?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】*   A kidney transplant surgery is performed under general anesthesia. It is a condition in which a medication is given intravenously to induce sleep during the surgery.\n\n【27】*   After the anesthesia is acquired, an incision is made in the abdomen of the recipient and the donor's kidney.\n\n【28】*   Then a connection is made from the arteries and veins of the body to the arteries and veins of the new kidney.\n\n【29】*   Further, the transplanted kidney’s ureter is attached to the bladder so that urination occurs normally. The urinary bladder is a hollow organ where urine is stored temporarily, and the ureters are a pair of tubes that connects each kidney to the bladder.\n\n【30】*   The original kidneys in the body are removed only when they cause problems, such as high blood pressure or infection.\n\n【31】What Are the Measures to Be Taken After the Kidney Transplant Surgery?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Hospitalization for several days to a week following a kidney transplant surgery is required if the donated kidney has started to function immediately in a day or so. And it may extend from a week if the kidney is received from a deceased donor. Dialysis is required till the kidney starts to function.\n\n【33】Anti-rejection medications are prescribed after the surgery to lessen the risk of rejection of the kidney transplant. Daily laboratory findings of urine production are monitored for adjusting anti-rejection transplant medications. Anti-rejection medications include;\n\n【34】*   Anti-inflammatory drugs- Prednisolone.\n\n【35】*   Cytokine inhibitors.\n\n【36】*   Antiproliferative drugs.\n\n【37】*   Antilymphocyte drugs.\n\n【38】What Are the Risk Factors Associated With Kidney Transplants?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】**Rejection of the Transplanted Kidney -** There are a few chances of rejection of the transplanted kidney. Still, if it happens even after taking the anti-rejection drugs, the transplanted kidneys need to be removed and should be replaced by a new one.\n\n【40】Other risks include:\n\n【41】*   Bleeding.\n\n【42】*   Blood clots.\n\n【43】*   Infection.\n\n【44】*   Blocked ureter.\n\n【45】*   Urine leakage (urine may leak from the point where the ureter is attached to the kidney).\n\n【46】*   Heart attack.\n\n【47】*   Failure of the donated kidney.\n\n【48】*   Risks with anti-rejection drugs such as the increased risk of infection, cancer, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, weight gain, bone thinning, increased hair growth, acne, and diarrhea.\n\n【49】*   Risks associated with the procedure of surgery.\n\n【50】*   Common infections like cold and urinary tract infections can occur after the transplant surgery, whereas pneumonia is found to be a serious infection and needs medical attention.\n\n【51】**Conclusion :**\n\n【52】Kidney transplantation serves as a life-saving procedure for many individuals requiring dialysis daily. It is a healthier and more convenient way to have healthy kidneys. Certain anti-rejection drugs and regular checkups after the surgery can enhance the transplanted kidney function. Dietary changes, weight management, and practicing a healthy lifestyle can help the betterment and continuity of the new kidney. Smoking and alcohol consumption should be stopped since it reduces the chances of infection. Medical advice should be taken sooner in case of fever, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, or in case of infection.\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>*   Kidney Transplant  \n    https://www.healthline.com/health/kidney-transplant#risks\n*   Kidney Transplant  \n    https://transplantsurgery.ucsf.edu/conditions--procedures/kidney-transplant.aspx\n*   Kidney transplant  \n    https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/kidney-transplant/waiting-list</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Sleep disturbances are one of the most common complaints by patients. A parasomnia can occur before or during sleep or also arousal from sleep. Parasomnia patients have abnormal movements, emotions, talk, or do unusual movements during sleep.\n\n【2】What Are the Different Types of Parasomnias?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Parasomnias are grouped under the stages of sleep in which they happen. There are two main stages of sleep, and they are:\n\n【4】*   Rapid eye movement (REM).\n\n【5】*   Non-rapid eye movement (NREM).\n\n【6】Both rapid and non-rapid eye movement changes in a cycle that lasts about 120 minutes. Non-rapid eye movement stages are further sub-classified into four stages, stage 0, stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3. The initial stages of rapid eye movement last around five to ten minutes, followed by frequent periods. Disturbances in both cycles during continuous sleep or upon transitions to wakefulness are grouped under the term ‘parasomnias.’\n\n【7】What Is the Etiology of Parasomnia?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【8】Recent studies suggest that disturbances in stage 3 slow-wave sleep can increase the probability of this condition. These include:\n\n【9】*   Restless leg syndrome (condition refers to an irresistible urge to move the legs).\n\n【10】*   Obstructive sleep apnea.\n\n【11】*   Narcolepsy (uncontrollable daytime sleepiness).\n\n【12】*   Circadian rhythm disorders (physical, mental, and behavioral changes that follow a 24 hours cycle).\n\n【13】*   Lack of maturity of the sleep-wake cycle.\n\n【14】*   Sleep deprivation.\n\n【15】*   Genetics.\n\n【16】*   Alcohol.\n\n【17】*   Periodic limb movements.\n\n【18】*   Stress.\n\n【19】*   Fever.\n\n【20】*   Pregnancy or menstruation.\n\n【21】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Benzodiazepine Toxicity - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Sleep Disorder - Types, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Zolpidem - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Drug Warnings, and Precautions</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Inflammatory disease (for example, encephalitis).\n\n【22】*   Psychiatric illnesses, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety.\n\n【23】*   Neurological diseases such as multiple system atrophy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, migraines, brain tumors, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.\n\n【24】*   Medications involved in treating -\n\n【25】    *   Depression (Amitriptyline, Paroxetine, Mirtazapine, Bupropion).\n\n【26】    *   Causing sleep (Benzodiazepines: Zolpidem).\n\n【27】    *   Seizures (Topiramate).\n\n【28】    *   Asthma or allergy (Montelukast).\n\n【29】    *   Infections (Fluoroquinolones).\n\n【30】    *   High blood pressure (Propranolol, Metoprolol).\n\n【31】    *   Psychotic disorders (Quetiapine, Olanzapine).\n        </u>\n\n【32】What Are the Symptoms of Parasomnias?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【33】Common Symptoms of Parasomnias Include:\n\n【34】*   Movements, verbal activity, or expressions during sleep.\n\n【35】*   Confused or disoriented.\n\n【36】*   Difficulty sleeping.\n\n【37】*   Fatigue.\n\n【38】*   Sometimes finding cuts and bruises on the body, for which the cause cannot be remembered.\n\n【39】How Parasomnias Occur in Children?\n----------------------------------\n\n【40】*   This condition is more commonly seen in children than in adults.\n\n【41】*   Non-rapid eye movement eye disorders occur more commonly in children compared with rapid eye movement disorders.\n\n【42】*   This disorder occurs in children who are associated with neurologic or psychiatric health issues such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy (disorder in which the nerve cell activity of the brain is disturbed), and also in certain developmental issues.\n\n【43】*   The common features of parasomnia that occurs in children are:\n\n【44】    *   Sleepwalking.\n\n【45】    *   Sleep terror.\n\n【46】    *   Nightmare.\n\n【47】    *   Confusional arousal.\n\n【48】What Are the Effects of Parasomnias in Non-rapid Eye Movement (NREM) Sleep Arousal Disorders?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】*   Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is the first three stages of sleep, from initially falling asleep to about the first half of the night.\n\n【50】*   Non-rapid eye movement sleep disorders are also known as arousal disorders.\n\n【51】*   It usually occurs between five and 25 years of age and often occurs in people with a family history of a similar condition.\n\n【52】*   Various manifestations of non-rapid eye movement are as follows-\n\n【53】**Sleep Terrors:**\n\n【54】Patients with this sleep disorder wake up suddenly in a terrified state. It usually occurs for about 30 seconds but lasts up to a few minutes. Other features are-\n\n【55】*   Open eyes with dilated pupils.\n\n【56】*   Fast breathing.\n\n【57】*   Sweating.\n\n【58】*   Rapid heart rate.\n\n【59】*   Screaming or crying in fright after waking up suddenly.\n\n【60】*   **Confusional Arousals:**\n\n【61】In this disorder, the individual appears to be partially awake but seems to be confused or disoriented to time and place. The duration of this episode may last from a few minutes to hours. It is more common in childhood and may decrease in frequency with increasing age. Other features of this disorder include:\n\n【62】*   Slow speech.\n\n【63】*   Trouble in understanding questions.\n\n【64】*   Difficulty in responding.\n\n【65】*   During the episode, the patient may remain in bed in a sitting posture with eyes open and may cry or scream.\n\n【66】*   **Somnambulism (Sleep Walking):**\n\n【67】In this disorder, the sleepwalker gets out of the bed and moves with eyes wide open, but actually, the person will be asleep. Patients may talk or mumble (sleep talking) and perform various complex activities such as playing musical instruments or driving or moving furniture. It is too dangerous as a person is unaware of the surroundings and can fall or get hurt by objects on the way.\n\n【68】*   **Sleep-Related Eating Disorder:**\n\n【69】In this disorder, a person may eat or drink while partially awake. This condition is also dangerous as the patient has chances of eating inedible or toxic foods, which cannot be taken when awake. In addition, there is a possibility of getting injured.\n\n【70】What Are the Effects of Parasomnias in Rapid Eye Movement Disorder?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【71】Rapid eye movement disorder sleep disorders are manifested with eyes moving rapidly under the eyelids, and there is an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. During this duration, vivid dreaming occurs. The sleeping cycle repeats between non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movements; sleep for about every 90 to 110 minutes. Parasomnias mostly occur in the late part of the night, and hence the person can recall the overall or part of the memory. Parasomnia manifestations include-\n\n【72】*   **Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder (RSBD):** This sleep disorder is most commonly seen in older adults. Some people with this disorder are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple system atrophy, Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. It is associated with aggressive movements such as punching, kicking, and grabbing, and verbal activities such as laughing, shouting, and talking loudly as a result of violent dreams.\n\n【73】*   **Nightmare Disorder:** In this disorder, vivid dreams happen, which causes a feeling of anxiety, fear, and terror. Patients develop a feeling of insecurity or fear of survival and have trouble falling back to sleep. It is caused due to stress, fever, traumatic event or illness, alcohol consumption, and extreme tiredness.\n\n【74】*   **Recurrent Isolated Sleep Paralysis:** In this disorder, the patient cannot move the body or limbs during sleep since the muscles are already in a relaxed state. The duration of this episode occurs for about a second to a few minutes. It usually results in anxiety or fear. It can be stopped immediately once the bed partner starts the conversation.\n\n【75】*   **Sleep Enuresis (Bedwetting):** It is different from the bedwetting that occurs in children. In parasomnia patients, this bedwetting happens in children of age five and older and occurs twice a week for at least three months.\n\n【76】*   **Sleep-Related Groaning:** Individuals with this type of disorder have repeat episodes of groaning noises during sleep.\n\n【77】What Are the Investigation Procedures for Parasomnia?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【78】The medical history, family history, alcohol use, and drug history are clearly evaluated.\n\n【79】Various sleep disorder tests are carried out and are as follows-\n\n【80】*   **Polysomnogram (Sleep Study):** This refers to a sleeping laboratory where the patient is monitored while sleeping. The patient’s heart rate, brain waves, eye movements, and breathing are recorded. Video is recorded to observe any movements or behavior.\n\n【81】*   **Computed Tomography (CT) And Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** Neurologic examinations determine the degeneration of the brain or other possible causes of the symptoms.\n\n【82】*   **Video Electroencephalogram (EEG):** This test helps to record brain activity during a brain event.\n\n【83】How Are Parasomnias Treated?\n----------------------------\n\n【84】**Treatments for Non-rapid Eye Movement Sleep Disorders:**\n\n【85】*   Follow good sleep habits - Seven to nine hours of sleep at night, turn off lights and other electronic gadgets, avoid caffeine, and strenuous exercise before bedtime.\n\n【86】*   Maintain a regular sleep-wake schedule.\n\n【87】*   Avoid alcohol or recreational drugs.\n\n【88】*   Regular intake of prescribed medications.\n\n【89】*   Medications are not usually prescribed for non-rapid eye movement disorder. However, certain drugs are recommended. Benzodiazepines are the long-lasting drugs used for this disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants are also tried sometimes.\n\n【90】*   Psychological approaches such as hypnosis and cognitive behavioral therapy are also recommended.\n\n【91】**Treatments for Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Disorders:**\n\n【92】*   Clonazepam and Melatonin are commonly used to manage this disorder.\n\n【93】*   Other safety measures are followed. These include-\n\n【94】    *   Use floor pads to prevent injuries from falls.\n\n【95】    *   Cover the sharp edges of the furniture.\n\n【96】    *   Install alarms on windows and doors for sleepwalkers.\n\n【97】    *   Lock or remove any dangerous or sharp items from the bedroom.\n\n【98】**Conclusion:**\n\n【99】Some causes of parasomnia can be easily managed, whereas parasomnia caused due to neurologic conditions, heredity, and mental illness are managed through various treatment approaches, as discussed. Lifestyle modifications, including sleep routines, are highly focused on getting a better improvement of this disorder.\n\n【100】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【101】* * *\n\n【102】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Types of Parasomnias?**\n\n【103】Parasomnia is an unusual behavior that occurs during sleep. Their types are listed down:  \nRapid-Eye Movement (REM)-  \n\\- Nightmare disorders.  \n\\- Recurrent sleep paralysis.  \n\\- REM- sleep behavior disorder.  \nNon-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) -  \n\\- Sleepwalking.  \n\\- Sleep terrors.  \n\\- Confusional arousal.  \n\\- Sleep-related abnormal behaviors.\n\n【104】#### **2.**删除换行**What Causes Parasomnias?**\n\n【105】Parasomnia can be caused by a wide variety of factors like:  \n\\- Fever.  \n\\- Head injury.  \n\\- Stress.  \n\\- Substance abuse.  \n\\- Psychiatric issues.  \n\\- Sleep deprivation.  \n\\- Medical conditions.  \n\\- Medications that are used in the treatment of high blood pressure, psychotic issues, etc.\n\n【106】#### **3.**删除换行**Can Medications Cause Parasomnia?**\n\n【107】Medications are also involved in causing sleep-related problems like parasomnia. These include:  \n\\- Anti-hypertensives such as Metoprolol, Propranolol, etc.  \n\\- Anti-allergic drugs like Montelukast.  \n\\- Amitriptyline, Paroxetine, Bupropion, etc. are used to treat depression.  \n\\- Other drgs such as Benzodiazepine, Topiramate, Fluoroquinolones, etc.\n\n【108】#### **4.**删除换行**What Are the Triggering Factors of Parasomnia?**\n\n【109】The below-mentioned factors can trigger parasomnia:  \n\\- Substance abuse (alcohol).  \n\\- Sleep disorders.  \n\\- Anxiety.  \n\\- Depression.  \n\\- Specific medications.  \n\\- Neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, etc.).\n\n【110】#### **5.**删除换行**What Are the Clinical Features of Parasomnia?**\n\n【111】An individual with parasomnia might have the following symptoms:  \n\\- Seem to be confused while waking up.  \n\\- Disoriented.  \n\\- Fatigue.  \n\\- Feeling tired throughout the day.  \n\\- Disturbed sleep.  \n\\- Several strange bruises on the body.  \n\\- Forgetfulness.\n\n【112】#### **6.**删除换行**What Causes Parasomnia in a Child?**\n\n【113】Parasomnia may commonly occur during childhood. The factors that trigger parasomnia in a child are as follows:  \n\\- Stress.  \n\\- Specific medications.  \n\\- Genetic causes.  \n\\- Poor sleep.  \n\\- Obstructive sleep apnea can also cause parasomnia in children.\n\n【114】#### **7.**删除换行**Which Is the Most Common Type of Parasomnia?**\n\n【115】The non-rapid eye movement (NREM) is the most common type of parasomnia. It is more prevalent among children than in adults. These types of parasomnia are characterized by:  \n\\- Incomplete arousal.  \n\\- Confused after wake-up.  \n\\- Sleepwalking.  \n\\- Poor or lack of response to other people.  \n\\- The affected individual may sleep in between the sleep.\n\n【116】#### **8.**删除换行**How Is Sleep Parasomnia Treated?**\n\n【117】Sleep parasomnia is mainly treated by identifying and removing the cause. Other additional management includes:  \n\\- To maintain a proper sleep routine.  \n\\- Avoiding alcohol consumption.  \n\\- Relaxation therapy.  \n\\- Psychotherapy.  \n\\- Medications such as Clonazepam and Melatonin are also used in treating parasomnia.\n\n【118】#### **9.**删除换行**What Should I Know About Parasomnia Epilepsy?**\n\n【119】Parasomnia and epilepsy may occur during sleep due to several neurological conditions.  \nParasomnia usually does not require specific treatment as they may go on their own. But the epileptic events that occur during sleep may resemble parasomnia, and it is difficult to distinguish both. Therefore the specialist may order a video electroencephalogram or polysomnography for the correct diagnosis.\n\n【120】#### **10.**删除换行**How Is Melatonin Related to Parasomnia?**\n\n【121】The parasomnia sleeping disorder can be treated with Melatonin, available in capsules, pills, and liquid form. Generally, the melatonin hormone is secreted naturally in the body. However, poor melatonin secretion leads to parasomnia due to specific abnormalities or shift workers. Therefore, Melatonin supplements might help improve total sleep and are also used in children with other conditions such as epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), etc.\n\n【122】#### **11.**删除换行**Is Parasomnia a Mental Illness?**\n\n【123】Parasomnia is not considered a mental illness but is more common among individuals with mental disorders. In addition, the medications used to treat mental disorders also may trigger parasomnia in specific individuals. The following forms of parasomnia commonly occur in a person with mental illness:  \n\\- Sleep paralysis.  \n\\- Nightmares.  \n\\- Sleep-related eating disorder.  \n\\- Sleep behavior disorder.\n\n【124】#### **12.**删除换行**At What Stage of Sleep Do Parasomnias Happen?**\n\n【125】Parasomnia may occur before or during sleep. However, it is mainly found to happen in the latter part of sleep. In addition, people may experience the symptoms at the time of arousal. Parasomnia or the sleeping disorder is usually linked with rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. During the REM phase, which lasts 90 minutes, people may experience intense dreams, high heart rate, and rapid eye movements.\n\n【126】#### **13.**删除换行**Is Insomnia Considered Parasomnia?**\n\n【127】Parasomnia and insomnia are sleep disorders. In parasomnia, the affected individual may have abnormal behaviors during sleep and might feel confused and forget activities that happen during sleep. In contrast, insomnia causes difficulty in sleeping, and a person may feel tired throughout the day. Sleeping disorders may be triggered by stress, anxiety, neurological abnormalities, and other chronic conditions. The specialist may suggest several methods and medications to achieve proper sleep in both disorders.\n\n【128】#### **14.**删除换行**Is Sleep Apnea and Restless Leg Syndrome Considered a Parasomnia?**\n\n【129】\\- Sleep apnea is characterized by difficulty in sleeping and improper breathing. The affected individual may snore loudly and feel tired due to improper sleep.  \n\\- Restless leg syndrome is characterized by the uncontrolled movement of legs while sitting or lying down. It may occur as a result of genetic factors or other neurological conditions.  \n\\- Both of these conditions may disturb sleep and cause parasomnia in specific individuals. But, they are not themselves considered parasomnia.\n\n【130】#### **15.**删除换行**Does Parasomnia Go Away Independently?**\n\n【131】Parasomnia may greatly disturb mental and physical health. It causes confusion, disorientation, unusual bruises, and fatigue after arousal. However, these symptoms may resolve on their own by maintaining a proper sleep routine, relaxation therapy, and rarely through medications. Nevertheless, it is essential to consult a specialist to know certain safety precautions to prevent injuries and falls during parasomnia.\n\n【132】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【133】无关删除-1:<u>*   Parasomnias  \n    https://www.sleepfoundation.org/parasomnias\n*   Parasomnia  \n    https://www.uofmhealth.org/conditions-treatments/brain-neurological-conditions/parasomnia\n*   Parasomnias  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4016090/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

There are hundreds of other tropical diseases too. They are rare, and not much importance is given to them. A preventive strategy is planned for common tropical diseases.\n\n【20】How to Manage the Diseases Occurring in the Tropical Region?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The diagnosis and treatment for some of the common and neglected tropical diseases are as follows:\n\n【22】**Tropical Ulcer:** Tropical ulcer is a bacterial infection caused due to flies, friction, lack of food, and fuso-spirochetal (fusiform and spirochetal bacteria) organisms. It occurs on the lower leg and starts as a raised lesion on the skin and gradually progresses to form an ulcer. This ulcer, if left untreated, will become more infected and cause pain.\n\n【23】The treatment aims to remove the infected material and improve the healing process. To reduce the infection, antibiotic medicines are prescribed by the doctor for a few days. Later, surgical debridement of the ulcer is done. Surgical debridement is done under local anesthesia. The skin around the wound is cleaned, and the depth of the wound is visualized by probing with a metal instrument. A sharp instrument like a scalpel blade removes dead and infected tissues, which are then washed away. A dressing is placed over the wound and closed with bandages to allow healing.\n\n【24】In cases of ulcers that have been present for a long time, a biopsy (a portion of cells or tissue from the affected area is removed and observed under a microscope) is performed to detect cancer.\n\n【25】**Mycobacterial Ulcer or Buruli Ulcer:** It is common in Australia, Uganda, and Papua New Guinea. Mycobacterium ulcerans is the bacteria responsible for the disease. The lesion starts as a nodule (like a lump) and progresses into an ulcer. The ulcer grows in the margins of the ulcer, and healing occurs in the center. Lab tests confirm the bacteria by taking a sample of the ulcer.\n\n【26】The treatment for the ulcer is wound debridement and skin grafting to close the wound. Skin grafting takes a portion of the skin from a different part of the body and places it over the wound. The affected leg is immobilized with a plaster cast to promote healing.\n\n【27】The doctor prescribes medications like Streptomycin and Rifampicin for eight weeks to reduce the infection.\n\n【28】**Fournier’s Gangrene:** It is an infection that occurs in the scrotal region and is associated with multiple organs getting affected. The infection presents with pain, swelling, fever, skin discoloration, and itching in the affected area.\n\n【29】Treatment involves surgical debridement to remove the infected material from the wound. The doctor prescribes antibiotics.\n\n【30】Another treatment to improve the healing is by using hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Here, 100 percent oxygen is delivered to the wound to promote healing.\n\n【31】**Cancrum Oris:** The gangrenous infection is prevalent in West Africa. It occurs in children who are malnourished or lack oral hygiene maintenance. The bacteria responsible are Fusiform bacilli and Spirochetes. The disease starts as an ulcer within the mouth and continues to grow outwards, involving the cheek and parts of the face. Severe facial disfigurement is present, which makes the reconstruction quite challenging.\n\n【32】The treatment is started with antibiotics. The infected area is removed and reapproximated using skin grafts or flaps (healthy tissue) from the adjacent area.\n\n【33】**Pyomyositis:** The bacteria causing this infection are Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli. It is an infection of the skeletal muscle that more frequently occurs in males and those with weakened immunity. It affects the heavy muscles of the legs, hands, and the center part of the body. Diagnostic tests like ultrasonography (an imaging technique that uses sound waves to produce images of the body's internal structures) and pus aspiration can help confirm the disease. The doctor prescribes antibiotics and drains the pus carefully.\n\n【34】**Tuberculosis:** Tuberculosis of the breast is common in India, Africa, and Hong Kong. It affects young women between 20 to 30 years of age. The condition presents with a lump, nipple retraction, or hard swellings near the armpit region. When these signs are noted early, the doctor must be consulted to perform a fine needle aspiration biopsy (a sample of tissue taken using a needle to examine the cells in detail) to rule out the presence of cancer. Another type of tuberculosis common in the tropics occurs in the abdominal region. The affected person has abdominal swellings along with pain. Aspiration of the fluid from the affected area helps in confirming the diagnosis.\n\n【35】The treatment for tuberculosis of the breast and abdomen is chemotherapy. The patient is started with the therapy that continues for several months. Regular follow-ups with the doctor to check the treatment progress must be maintained.\n\n【36】If the medical therapy fails to treat the condition, surgically removing the affected part under general anesthesia is planned.\n\n【37】**Filariasis**: It is one of the neglected tropical diseases caused by a parasite, Wuchereria bancrofti. It affects the lymphatic vessels (that carry the white blood cells) of the legs and scrotum. A very large swelling of the lower leg occurs, known as elephantiasis. Since the lymphatics in the kidneys also get obstructed, milky urine is observed. Laboratory tests are carried out to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【38】The treatment is initiated with medication to kill the parasites. The elephantiasis is treated by compression stockings (tight elastic socks that cover the leg to improve circulation) that exert pressure of 40 mmHg. In complicated cases, surgery is the only option.\n\n【39】Surgery involves the removal of the swollen area of the leg and reconstruction using skin grafts. The lymphatic vessels are removed and reapproximated with the adjacent lymph vessels.\n\n【40】In the affected lymphatics within the kidney, sclerotherapy is performed, wherein a solution containing 5 percent nitrate is injected to close the affected vessels.\n\n【41】A few common diseases that occur in the tropical region and their management have been described. The patient must be educated about the prevalent conditions and certain measures to maintain proper hygiene.\n\n【42】**Conclusion**\n\n【43】The tropical diseases that are unique to their region must be brought to the doctor’s notice as soon as possible to provide early intervention for the disease. The surgeon must be skilled enough to handle the patients who report to them at an early or advanced stage and provide appropriate treatment. An interdisciplinary approach is necessary with specialties from various departments to diagnose the disease and provide a successful outcome.\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>*   Global surgery and the neglected tropical diseases  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5619702/\n*   Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/ntd/diseases/index.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It seems so normal these days to use such technologies in everyday life. Browsing the internet to find out the normal blood pressure range or researching the use of medicine when prescribed by a doctor are now common human behaviors. Modern medical advances have made human lives so much easier. But where did this progress, particularly the surgical advances, come from?\n\n【2】The field of surgery progressed to a higher level during the old days, as seen in India, Greece, China, etc. The 18th century brought an increased understanding of surgical procedures such as tumors and kidney stones. Then, in the 19th century, the famous microbiologist, Louis Pasteur, studied the relationship between germs (bacteria) and infectious diseases, which brought an evolution to the medical field around the globe. Later on, the discovery of X-rays brought another change in the medical field during the 20th century, and so on, leading to a new era of modern surgery.\n\n【3】Modern surgery is greatly advanced by diagnostic tools such as blood pressure monitoring, pulse rate monitoring, etc. The modern era has also witnessed new surgical technologies developing with time worldwide that have replaced many old techniques. Nowadays, surgical procedures are less invasive (less painful) and time-consuming, with a fast recovery rate. In addition, the world is moving towards robotic surgeries now. As a result, surgeries meant to save lives and improve quality of life have become a crucial aspect of healthcare systems worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), millions of people undergo surgeries yearly, accounting for 13 % of the World's Disability-adjusted Life Years (DALYs).\n\n【4】What Is Surgery?\n----------------\n\n【5】Surgery is a type of treatment that involves cutting the body parts by removing or repairing the diseased or injured body parts. The main aim of surgery is to repair or completely remove the damaged or diseased body part and improve the quality of life.\n\n【6】How Many Types of Surgery Are There?\n------------------------------------\n\n【7】Types of surgeries based on the type of method or procedure are listed below :\n\n【8】1.  **Open Surgery** **-** It means cutting the skin so the surgeon can see the internal body part or organs. For example, open-heart surgery.\n\n【9】2.  **Minimal Invasive Surgery** **-** It means the surgery is less painful and requires less or minimum cutting of skin or tissues.\n\n【10】Different types of minimally invasive surgeries are:\n\n【11】*   **Endoscopy** **\\-** It is a non-surgical method used to examine or check the food pipe (digestive tract) through a camera and other tools.\n\n【12】*   **Laparoscopy** **\\-** It is done to examine the diseased organs present in the stomach area, including the intestines, liver, spleen, etc.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Is surgery necessary to treat kidney inflation?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Surgery in Neurological Diseases - An Overview</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Complications of Cataract Surgery in Old People</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   **Gastroscopy** **\\-** It is done to examine the upper parts of the digestive system (food pipe, stomach, and throat).\n\n【14】*   **Arthroscopy** **\\-** It is a diagnostic tool to examine the body joints such as the knee joint, ankle, etc.\n\n【15】*   **Bronchoscopy** **\\-** It is done to examine the lungs' airways(bronchi).\n\n【16】*   **Hysteroscopy** **\\-** It is done to examine the female reproductive parts through the vagina.\n\n【17】*   **Cystoscopy** **\\-** It is done to examine the urinary tract.\n\n【18】*   **Sigmoidoscopy** **\\-** It is done to examine the lower one-third part of the large intestine during constipation, diarrhea, etc.\n\n【19】*   **Laryngoscopy** **\\-** It is done to examine the voice box (larynx).\n    </u>\n\n【20】**3\\. Other Types:**\n\n【21】*   **Laser Surgery** **-** It is a type of surgery involving a special light beam (LASER) to do surgery instead of a knife and other instruments.\n\n【22】*   **Electrosurgery** **-** It is a type of surgery involving a high-frequency electric current to cut the skin or tissue.\n\n【23】Types of surgeries based on the type of need or urgency:\n\n【24】1.  **Emergency Surgery** **-** A type of surgery done when the patient urgently needs surgery. An unplanned surgery may lead to serious health consequences or death if delayed. For example, bypass surgery after a sudden heart attack, an accident, etc.\n\n【25】2.  **Elective Surgery** **-** It is a type of surgery that a surgeon plans after assessing the patient's condition or disease. For example, bariatric surgery (weight loss surgery), knee surgery, cataract surgery, etc.\n\n【26】Types of surgeries based on the seriousness of surgery or the risks associated with it:\n\n【27】1.  **Minor Surgery** **-** It is a type of surgery with a low risk of complications and fast recovery time. Such procedures are of short duration, such as half-hour or one hour, and the patient can go home the same day after the surgery. For example, dental implantation.\n\n【28】2.  **Major Surgery** **\\-** It is a type of surgery with a high risk of complications, and the recovery time is long. The patient stays in the hospital for some days. For example, organ transplant and tumor removal.\n\n【29】Types of surgeries based on the specialty:\n\n【30】1.  **General Surgery** **-** A branch of surgery that involves major surgical treatments. It is used to treat diseases of the head and neck, chest, stomach, etc. and manage patients who are injured or have deformities in the body that need surgery.\n\n【31】2.  **Colon And Rectal Surgery** **-** A branch of surgery that involves intestine, stomach diseases, and other organs such as the liver.\n\n【32】3.  **Thoracic Surgery** **-** A branch of surgery that involves the treatment of pathological conditions involving the chest, such as lung cancer and esophagus (food pipe).\n\n【33】4.  **Neurologic Surgery** **\\-** A branch of surgery that involves treating the nervous system.\n\n【34】5.  **Ophthalmic Surgery** **-** A branch of surgery that involves the treatment of eyes and vision.\n\n【35】6.  **Gynecologic Oncology** **-** A branch of surgery that involves the management of cancer in the female reproductive system.\n\n【36】7.  **Orthopedic Surgery** **-** A branch of surgery that involves treating the musculoskeletal system, such as muscles, bones, joints, etc.\n\n【37】8.  **Oral And Maxillofacial Surgery** **-** A branch of surgery that involves the treatment of the head, neck, and face.\n\n【38】9.  **Pediatric Surgery** **-** A branch of surgery mainly concerned with treating children aged 0 to 18 years.\n\n【39】10.  **Urology** **\\-** It is a branch of surgery that involves the treatment of the adrenal gland, urinary system, and reproductive system.\n\n【40】11.  **Plastic/Cosmetic Surgery** **-** A branch of surgery that involves improving aesthetic appearance and repairing and replacing body defects involving skin and muscles.\n\n【41】12.  **Others** **-** Apart from the major specialties mentioned above, there are other specialties, such as vascular surgery, otolaryngology, etc. that include surgical care associated with other body parts such as ears, nose, blood vessels, etc.\n\n【42】What Is the Need for Surgery?\n-----------------------------\n\n【43】Surgery can be done for many reasons, such as -\n\n【44】*   Accident or emergency.\n\n【45】*   Explore the condition of a disease or diagnose a condition.\n\n【46】*   Repair or remove a diseased or damaged body part.\n\n【47】*   Restore body structures to their original positions and shape. For example, fixing fractured bones and fractured joints.\n\n【48】*   Remove obstructions. For example, urinary bladder stones.\n\n【49】*   Improve appearance physically. For example, cosmetic surgery.\n\n【50】*   Transplant or replace a damaged organ with a healthy organ.\n\n【51】*   Redirect flow of blood in blood vessels. For example, bypass heart surgery.\n\n【52】**Conclusion**\n\n【53】Surgery is never the first step in treating a disease or medical condition because it involves cutting tissues or removing organs or body parts that get diseased or damaged. In addition, the purpose, recovery time, success rate, pain level, and risks and benefits of the surgery type vary. Therefore, it is advisable to get complete and right information about the need for surgery, its type, possible risks, and benefits before undergoing any surgery.\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>*   Why safe surgery is important  \n    https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/patient-safety/research/safe-surgery\n*   general surgery  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/general-surgery\n*   General Surgery Types  \n    https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-treatments/g/general-surgery/types.html\n*   Electrosurgery  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/electrosurgery</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Though not serious, they can be tough on parents to see the babies suffer and are the biggest reason for pediatric visits. Common colds occur due to viruses or germs that infect the nose and throat. Babies can catch a cold almost eight times in the first year of their lives. When the parent knows how to make the child feel better and when to call a doctor, they can be more confident in handling the baby through the course of a cold.\n\n【2】Why Do Babies Catch Colds?\n--------------------------\n\n【3】There are more than 100 types of viruses that can cause common colds. As the baby's immune system that helps fight infections is still developing, they tend to catch a cold more often.\n\n【4】Cold causing viruses spread through the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs. These viruses can survive on objects and surfaces for several hours. When babies put toys or other objects in their mouth or touch other babies with colds, these viruses enter the body through their nose, mouth, or eyes.\n\n【5】Also, parents or caregivers who attend to the child can pass on the germs to them. Elder brothers and sisters may also carry the infection home from school. More commonly, babies catch a cold in fall or winter, especially in daycares, when the children play indoors and stay close by.\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Common Cold in Babies?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Symptoms of common cold start one to three days after the babies get infected and can last for about seven to ten days. Signs and symptoms which are noticed include:\n\n【8】*   Congested or runny nose.\n\n【9】*   Nasal discharge (which is watery and clear initially, later turns thick and green or yellow in color).\n\n【10】*   Sneezing.\n\n【11】*   Mild fever.\n\n【12】*   Sore throat.\n\n【13】*   Difficulty in swallowing.\n\n【14】*   Dry cough (that worsens at night).\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Can excess use of mosquito repellant cause frequent cause and cold in baby?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    My baby has loose motions and frequently vomits after a feed.

A doctor's visit needs to be planned in case of the following symptoms, that include:\n\n【23】*   High fever in an infant younger than two months.\n\n【24】*   Blue lips.\n\n【25】*   Dehydration.\n\n【26】*   Ear pain.\n\n【27】*   Difficulty in breathing like fast breathing or wheezing (rattle-like coarse sounds heard when breathing).\n\n【28】*   Excessive crankiness or sleep.\n\n【29】*   Cough lasting for more than three weeks.\n\n【30】*   The Baby gets even sicker.\n\n【31】How to Manage Common Colds in Babies?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【32】There is no cure for a baby cold. Most of them subside on their own within 7 to 10 days and do not turn into other serious conditions.\n\n【33】Antibiotics are generally not preferred for common colds, as these are caused by viruses and not bacteria. Some children who may develop bacterial infections causing ear pain or pneumonia (an infection of the lungs) may require treatment with antibiotics, as prescribed by the doctor. Babies should not be given over-the-counter (OTC) cold or cough medicines unless the doctor recommends using them. To reduce fever, the baby may be given Acetaminophen (Children's Tylenol) or Ibuprofen (Children's Advil or Motrin). However, medicines containing Aspirin should be avoided as they can cause side effects in young children.\n\n【34】The following steps can be followed to make the baby feel better, they include:\n\n【35】1.  Keeping the baby comfortable.\n\n【36】2.  Keep the baby hydrated. Infants less than six months old can be breastfed or formula-fed. Infants older than six months can also be given water and 100 percent fresh fruit juices based on age.\n\n【37】3.  Give the baby plenty of rest.\n\n【38】What Are the Tips to Ease a Stuffy Nose in Babies?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】Babies younger than four years cannot blow their noses. The below tips can help babies get relief from blocked noses.\n\n【40】*   **Use of Saline and Suction:** Use over-the-counter saline (saltwater) spray or drops 15 minutes before feeding. The drops help loosen mucus in the nose, which can then be suctioned out using a rubber bulb. This clears the mucus and helps the baby breathe and suck during feeding. This process can be followed a few times a day to make the baby feel better.\n\n【41】*   **Use of Petroleum Jelly:** Dabbing petroleum jelly on the outside of the nostrils helps reduce irritation. Care must be taken to prevent petroleum jelly from accidentally entering the nose. The use of any kind of nasal sprays must be avoided in babies, which can cause further complications like congestion.\n\n【42】*   **Use of Air Humidifier:** Humidifiers or vaporizers can be used in the baby's room. Humidifiers moisten the air by releasing a cool and clean mist that helps in soothing a baby with dry nasal passages. The humidifier has to be cleaned thoroughly with soap and water to clean up any bacteria or mold that could have accumulated in it. Also, hot water vaporizers have to be avoided as they pose a risk of skin burns.\n\n【43】*   **Sitting With the Baby in a Steamy Room:** In case a humidifier is not available, the child can be taken into the bathroom, turn on the hot water, close the door and sit with the baby in the steamy room for around 10 to 15 minutes. The baby must be handled safely around hot water and must not be left unattended. A warm water bath may also be given to soothe the baby.\n\n【44】*   **Extra Fluids:** Keeping the child well hydrated by offering them more water, milk, and fruit juices helps to keep the baby's mouth and nose moist. Breast milk offers the extra advantage of providing protection against viruses and bacteria.\n\n【45】The baby, if feeling well, can continue with their regular activities of going to the daycare. The caregiver at the daycare must be kept informed about the baby's symptoms. However, in cases of fever or other symptoms, it is better to make the baby stay at home with the parents.\n\n【46】How Can Colds Be Prevented in Babies?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【47】Though cold cannot be completely prevented, following a few simple steps can prevent catching cold frequently.\n\n【48】*   Hand washing is the best way to prevent the cold-causing virus from spreading. Adults and children must practice the healthy habit of washing hands with soap and water after coughing, sneezing, or returning home. In case of unavailability of soap and water, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or pre-moistened hand wipes can be used.\n\n【49】*   Babies must be kept up to date on the immunization chart. Taking recommended vaccines can help the child from contracting bacterial infections of the ears and lungs. Also, doctors recommend taking flu shots every year in babies older than six months of age to offer protection against flu viruses.\n\n【50】What Is Baby Summer Cold?\n-------------------------\n\n【51】Colds are thought to occur more commonly in winters due to a cool climate. However, that is not the case. Rhinovirus, the virus responsible for causing colds, is more active at lower temperatures. In summers, a virus named non-polio enterovirus causes cold, and the symptoms experienced are similar to those caused by rhinovirus. The symptoms include:\n\n【52】*   Fever 101 to 104 F.\n\n【53】*   Muscle aches.\n\n【54】*   Headaches.\n\n【55】*   Sore throat.\n\n【56】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【57】Symptoms usually clear up within a week. The best ways to prevent summer colds also include frequent hand washing and cleaning the baby stuff regularly.\n\n【58】When to Call a Doctor?\n----------------------\n\n【59】Babies older than three months with a common cold do not need a doctor's checkup. However, when the parents notice a few serious symptoms, a consultation at the doctor's office is necessary. The symptoms include:\n\n【60】*   Fever in infants younger than three months.\n\n【61】*   Fever in babies 102 F or higher.\n\n【62】*   Difficulty in breathing.\n\n【63】*   Signs of dehydration like fewer wet diapers or no tears.\n\n【64】*   Not taking any fluids or food.\n\n【65】*   Unusual sleepiness.\n\n【66】*   Symptoms that persist beyond a week or worsen with time.\n\n【67】**Conclusion:**\n\n【68】Baby cold is the common cold that occurs in babies younger than two years of age. The little ones have more encounters with different viruses that cause colds, as they are still in the process of building their immunities. Though cold can be rough on their noses, the good news is frequent bouts of cold can actually help babies build a strong immunity to help fight germs, making them less susceptible to infections gradually. Though it can be hard on parents to manage cranky children, a little bit of patience and following simple tips to ease the sick baby can help a lot.\n\n【69】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【70】* * *\n\n【71】#### **1.**删除换行**What to Do When a Baby Has a Cold?**\n\n【72】If the baby is suffering from a cold it is necessary to keep the nasal passage of the baby clear by suctioning or cleaning regularly. The child should be given lots of fluids to avoid dehydration in the body. If the cold gets severe the doctor should be consulted and nasal drops should be used.\n\n【73】#### **2.**删除换行**How Long Does a Baby Cold Last?**\n\n【74】If the cold has no complications such as fever, weakness, vomiting or anything else, it can resolve within 8 to 12 days. The maximum it may extend is 15 days. It is important to notice the symptoms carefully and if there are other signs, the doctor should be consulted.\n\n【75】#### **3.**删除换行**What Room Temperature Is Too Cold for a Baby?**\n\n【76】Babies are more sensitive to the temperature around them because their body is growing and gradually adapting to the environment. So it is advised to maintain a temperature between 20 to 23 degree celsius around the baby to prevent both heat or cold.\n\n【77】#### **4.**删除换行**How Can I Prevent My Baby From Getting a Cold?**\n\n【78】The precautions essential to prevent a baby from cold include washing hands before touching or feeding the baby, keeping the child away from anyone who is sick, cleaning of the objects and toys used by the baby while playing, avoiding food items which are cold in low temperature weather and avoiding very frequent temperature changes.\n\n【79】#### **5.**删除换行**How Do I Know the Baby Is Cold at Night?**\n\n【80】The best way to check whether the baby is too cold at night is by touching the neck of the baby. If the baby is too cold, lethargic and less responsive, the pediatrician should be consulted immediately.\n\n【81】#### **6.**删除换行**Can My Baby Suffocate From a Stuffy Nose?**\n\n【82】Congestion due to stuffy nose is very common in infants and is not a concern. It should be cleared regularly at home by the mother to avoid severe congestion which may involve lungs. Congestion which involves lungs can be suffocating as the airway passage is very small in babies and can block up easily. If this happens, a doctor should be consulted immediately.\n\n【83】#### **7.**删除换行**How Do I Know If My Baby’s Cold Is Serious?**\n\n【84】If the symptoms of the cold such as a runny nose, nasal congestion or mild fever does not improve and rather get severe, the cold is considered serious and a doctor should be consulted immediately.\n\n【85】#### **8.**删除换行**How Can I Help My Baby’s Runny Nose Due to a Cold?**\n\n【86】There are few remedies to treat a baby's runny nose at home, this involves suction technique with the help of a bulb suction. It helps to clear the nasal passage.

It plays a crucial role in keeping vital organs safe. The chest wall is made of sternum and ribs. Chest wall tumors are sometimes primary tumors originating from the chest or secondary tumors spreading (metastasizing) to the chest from other sites.\n\n【2】Primary tumors can be either benign or malignant. However, the secondary is malignant and needs surgical excision to prevent further spread and damage to other organs. Generally, bones, soft tissue, or cartilage tumors are called sarcomas. These sarcomas are malignant, and patients might experience swelling, pain, and difficulty breathing depending on the severity of the tumor.\n\n【3】How Common Are Chest Wall Tumors?\n---------------------------------\n\n【4】*   Chest walls are generally rare and difficult to treat.\n\n【5】*   Chest walls are usually less than five percent of all malignancies.\n\n【6】Who Is Affected By Chest Wall Tumors ?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【7】*   It is common in all age groups.\n\n【8】*   Few sarcomas are more common in children when compared to adults.\n\n【9】*   Treating chest walls is comparatively easy at a young age compared to adults.\n\n【10】What Are Different Types of Chest Wall Tumors?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Different types of tumors that grow in the chest wall are-\n\n【12】*   **Chondrosarcoma-** Usually occurs in cartilage and is the most common type of chest wall. It is generally painful and keeps enlarging.\n\n【13】*   **Osteosarcoma-** Usually occurs in the bone and is typically seen in young children. It is painful and a rapidly enlarging tumor.\n\n【14】*   **Rhabdomyosarcoma-** Usually affects muscles, especially striated muscles affecting children and young adults. It is a painless growing tumor.\n\n【15】*   **Ewing's Sarcoma-** Usually affects bone and soft tissue. It is common in children and young adults and is very painful. Often the ribs are involved.\n\n【16】*   **Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma\\-** Usually affects the soft tissues and is common in individuals aged 40 to 60. They are slow growing and generally painless.\n\n【17】*   **Plasmacytoma-** It is a type of multiple melanomas affecting the plasma cells. It is usually painful and can be treated without surgical intervention. Common in individuals of age 40 and above.\n\n【18】*   **Fibrous Dysplasia-** It commonly affects the bones, mainly in the ribs. It is an excruciating and most common type of chest wall tumor.\n\n【19】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Will pleural thickening worsen with age?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Plastic Surgery Addiction - Signs, Risks, and Prevention</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Bone cancer - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【20】What Are the Common Symptoms of Chest Wall Tumors ?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Symptoms are rarely seen in the initial stages, and individuals experience few common symptoms in advanced stages. These include-\n\n【22】*   Fever and continuous tiredness.\n\n【23】*   Pain and swelling.\n\n【24】*   A feeling of a lump in the chest.\n\n【25】*   Atrophy of muscles.\n\n【26】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【27】*   Experiencing drastic weight loss.\n\n【28】*   Sluggish body movement.\n\n【29】How to Diagnose the Chest Wall Tumors ?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【30】The doctor will suggest a series of investigations to achieve a proper diagnosis and to know the severity of the tumor. These include:\n\n【31】*   Chest X-ray.\n\n【32】*   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) helps to provide information on soft tissues.\n\n【33】*   Computed tomography (CT) helps access calcification, bone destruction, and tumor severity.\n\n【34】*   Positron emission tomography (PET) scan along with CT scan.\n\n【35】*   Biopsy of a tumor (generally, a needle biopsy is done to assess the tumor).\n\n【36】How Are Chest Wall Tumors Managed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【37】After the preoperative evaluation, the surgeons advocate the following procedures to manage the chest wall.\n\n【38】**Radiation And Chemotherapy**\\-\n\n【39】*   Once the diagnosis is established, the surgeon may start chemotherapy, where different drugs are used to kill the cancer cell, and radiotherapy, which utilizes high-intensity rays to kill the cancer cells.\n\n【40】*   The disadvantage of radiation therapy is it kills even the normally growing cells. This procedure is helpful in the initial stages of the tumor.\n\n【41】**Resection**\\-\n\n【42】*   Resection is advocated in the advanced stages of the tumor.\n\n【43】*   Complete resection of the tumor is advocated without any compromise.\n\n【44】*   Chest walls are often challenging for thoracic and reconstructive surgeons as they have high chances of pulmonary dysfunction.\n\n【45】*   It is best to have a multidisciplinary approach to prevent postoperative complications.\n\n【46】**Reconstruction**\\-\n\n【47】*   After the resection, partial or full-thickness thoracic wall defects will need to be addressed.\n\n【48】*   Full-thickness wall defects involve soft tissues, muscles, and bone and should be reconstructed immediately after the resection.\n\n【49】*   Following are some of the options that facilitate the reconstruction and achieve a quick recovery.\n\n【50】**Reconstruction With Mesh**\\-\n\n【51】*   Different synthetic nets are available to increase the rigidity of the chest wall and protect the internal organs. These are durable, pliable, and radiolucent and help to achieve quick coverage.\n\n【52】**Reconstruction With Implants**\\-\n\n【53】*   Composite implants are generally used for reconstruction. These implants help to achieve the original contours of the chest and are usually indicated for anterior and lateral chest wall defects. They are found to produce good results with minimal chances of infection.\n\n【54】**Osteosynthesis**\\-\n\n【55】*   This procedure is recommended when a direct approximation of sternal edges is possible. In this procedure, the bony edges are stabilized using mechanical devices that help a proper union and adequate fixation.\n\n【56】    *   Once the rebuilding is complete, the wound is covered with a skin flap-like pectoralis major flap taken from the lower breast fold along with muscle. Thoracoepigastric flap from the abdominal region and latissimus doris muscular flap from the lateral side of the upper body helps in extensive coverage of the chest wall.\n\n【57】    *   Sore throat caused due to the tube placed in the windpipe for breathing during surgery.\n\n【58】    *   Nausea and vomiting from general anesthesia.\n\n【59】    *   Pain, swelling, and soreness around the reconstruction site.\n\n【60】    *   Increased thirst.\n\n【61】    *   Sleeplessness and restlessness.\n\n【62】    *   Tingling and numbness at the surgical site.\n\n【63】    *   Lethargy.\n\n【64】    *   Patients should continue the medications and should not miss follow-up appointments.\n\n【65】    *   Restrict physical activities.\n\n【66】    *   Continue the physiotherapy exercises to improve the flexibility of the chest.\n\n【67】    *   Adapting healthy lifestyle habits and quitting smoking and tobacco products if the practice is present.\n\n【68】    *   Screening tests should be performed yearly as suggested by the surgeon or health care provider.\n\n【69】**Reconstruction With Flaps**\\-\n\n【70】Once the rebuilding is complete, the wound is covered with a skin flap-like pectoralis major flap taken from the lower breast fold along with muscle. Thoracoepigastric flap from the abdominal region and Latissimus Doris muscular flap from the lateral side of the upper body helps in extensive coverage of the chest wall.\n\n【71】What Happens After Surgery?\n---------------------------\n\n【72】After the surgery, the patient may experience the following symptoms\n\n【73】*   Sore throat caused due to the tube placed in the windpipe for breathing during surgery.\n\n【74】*   Nausea and vomiting from general anesthesia.\n\n【75】*   Pain, swelling, and soreness around the reconstruction site.\n\n【76】*   Increased thirst.\n\n【77】*   Sleeplessness and restlessness.\n\n【78】*   Tingling and numbness at the surgical site.\n\n【79】*   Lethargy.\n\n【80】These symptoms usually reduce once the healing starts, and the patient can resume normal activities recommended by the surgeon.\n\n【81】What Are the Post-Operative Instructions Given to a Patient?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【82】*   Patients should continue the medications and should not miss follow-up appointments.\n\n【83】*   Restrict physical activities.\n\n【84】*   Continue the physiotherapy exercises to improve the flexibility of the chest.\n\n【85】*   Adapting healthy lifestyle habits and quitting smoking and tobacco products if the practice is present.\n\n【86】*   Screening tests should be performed yearly as suggested by the surgeon or health care provider.\n\n【87】**Conclusion**:\n\n【88】Surgical management of the chest wall varies from patient to patient, depending on the severity of the tumor. Early detection always helps to achieve more significant results with minimal resection. The earlier the detection greater the chances of success\n\n【89】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【90】无关删除-1:<u>*   Surgical treatment of chest wall tumors  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11338025/\n*   Chest Wall Tumors and Sarcomas  \n    https://www.mountsinai.org/care/thoracic-surgery/services/chest-wall-sarcomas\n*   Chest wall reconstruction in benign and malignant tumors with non-rigid materials: An overview  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsurg.2022.976463/full</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "b43e492f-1d33-4f3b-89db-a87dcbefd434", "title": "Pregnancy and Birth", "text": "【0】Pregnancy and Birth\n**Overview:**\n\n【1】Pregnancy is the time taken for a fetus to develop inside a woman’s womb. Sometimes, if more than one embryo develops inside the uterus at the same time, it is known as a multiple pregnancy. It typically lasts for 40 weeks from the last menstrual period (LMP). A woman can get pregnant through sexual intercourse or by Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART).\n\n【2】How to Get Pregnant Tips:\n-------------------------\n\n【3】1.  **Ovulation**: Ovulation is the process where an egg is released from the ovaries. Ovulation normally occurs between the 11th to 21st day of your menstrual cycle. If you have sexual intercourse around the ovulation period, the chances of sperm fertilizing the egg increase many folds. To know when you ovulate, chart your basal body temperature (BBT). You can also use over-the-counter ovulation predictor kit or ovulation calculator to know when you are ovulating.\n2.  **Weight**: Being overweight or underweight may affect the hormonal balance and disrupt ovulation. Your BMI (body mass index) should be between 18.5 to 24.9. Walking, swimming, yoga, etc. can be done to stay fit.\n3.  **Stress management:** Stress can make it harder for you to get pregnant. Try meditation, yoga, and acupuncture to de-stress yourself.\n4.  **Treat medical conditions:** Medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension, asthma, etc. can affect your chances of getting pregnant. So, consult your doctor and get them treated to increase your chance of conceiving.\n5.  **His health:** Men can also improve their reproductive health by quitting smoking, eating healthy, stress management, limiting alcohol consumption, etc.\n6.  **Folic acid:** Folic acid prevents neural birth defects. Neural birth defects like spina bifida affect the baby’s brain and spinal cord. So, taking 400 mcg of Folic acid from at least a month before conception might reduce the incidence of such defects.\n\n【4】Signs of Ovulation:\n-------------------\n\n【5】*   A rise in the basal body temperature. You can note the change in temperature by measuring your BBT every morning with a thermometer. Before ovulation, a women’s BBT is between 36.1 to 36.4 degree Celsius, and after ovulation, it rises to 37 degrees.\n\n【6】*   Levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) is higher. It can be measured using an ovulation kit.\n\n【7】*   The cervical mucus appears thin and clear.\n\n【8】*   Tender breasts.\n\n【9】*   Bloating.\n\n【10】*   Spotting.\n\n【11】Early Signs of Pregnancy:\n-------------------------\n\n【12】A few symptoms of pregnancy are noticeable early on, these symptoms include:\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-3:<u>Pregnancy tests are negative, but am still having pregnancy symptoms. Why?</u>\n\n【16】Pregnancy test had two mildly visible lines, but it is now negative. Please suggest.\n\n【17】I had sex with my partner last month and missed periods. Am I pregnant?\n\n【18】*   Missed period.\n*   Tiredness.\n*   Frequent urination.\n*   Tender breast.\n*   Nausea.\n*   Vomiting.\n*   Abdominal cramps.\n\n【19】Pregnancy Tests:\n----------------\n\n【20】If you develop any of the above symptoms, it is best you get a pregnancy test done. Pregnancy tests usually detect the presence of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) hormone in the blood and urine. This hormone is produced after implantation.\n\n【21】**The various pregnancy tests available are:**\n\n【22】1.  **Urine Test:** It can be either done at home or in a doctor’s office. It is best to wait a week after a missed period to take this test. A chemical in the pregnancy strip changes color when it comes in contact with hCG hormone. Many pregnancy test strips are available over-the-counter, and you can follow the instructions provided with the kit.\n2.  **Blood Test:** Blood tests are more accurate than the urine test, and can detect pregnancy as early as 6 to 6 days after ovulation. A quantitative or a qualitative hCG test can be carried out. **Qualitative Blood hCG Test** -This just detects the presence of hCG in the blood, and gives a yes or no result. **Quantitative Blood hCG Test** - It measures the levels of hCG hormone in the blood. This test is very accurate and can even detect smaller amounts of hCG in the blood.\n3.  **Ultrasound**: Depending on the blood test results, your doctor will conduct an ultrasound or sonogram around the 6 to 8 weeks of pregnancy. You can see the developing embryo in this ultrasound image.\n\n【23】Stages of Pregnancy:\n--------------------\n\n【24】Pregnancy is divided into three trimesters, the first, second, and the third trimesters.\n\n【25】### First Trimester:\n\n【26】Weeks 1 to 12 is the first trimester. It includes the process of fertilization, that is the process of sperm and ova forming an embryo in the fallopian tube. This embryo then travels down and reaches the uterus and gets attached to the wall of the uterus (implantation). This is the period where the embryo and placenta start to grow in the womb.By around 4 to 5 weeks, your baby’s heart, brain, and spinal cord start forming. Arm and leg buds can be seen. By 8 weeks, all major organs and external body structures start forming. The developing heart begins to beat in a regular rhythm. The umbilical cord is clearly visible, and the fetus is an inch long and looks more like a human. And by the 12th week, the nerves and muscles form and work together. The external sex organs start developing, and the eyelids close to protect the developing eyes. At the end of 12 weeks, the fetus is approximately 3 inches long.\n\n【27】#### Symptoms Experienced During the First Trimester:\n\n【28】Your body undergoes many changes, and hormonal changes affect almost all the organs of your body. The first sign of pregnancy is your periods stopping. The symptoms of pregnancy can start from the first week itself, but some women might not feel any discomfort at all.\n\n【29】**The signs are:**\n\n【30】*   Tiredness.\n\n【31】*   Swollen and tender breasts.\n\n【32】*   Morning sickness.\n\n【33】*   Mood swings.\n\n【34】*   Frequent urination.\n\n【35】*   Headache.\n\n【36】*   Abdominal cramps.\n\n【37】*   Heartburn.\n\n【38】*   Food cravings.\n\n【39】### Second Trimester:\n\n【40】Weeks 13 to 28 is the second trimester. Majority of pregnant women find this trimester easier than the first. The baby starts growing, and your abdomen and uterus expand with it. By the end of this trimester, you can feel your baby move inside you.Generally, by the end of the 16th week, muscle and bone grow and form a complete skeleton, and transparent skin begins to form. The baby’s first bowel movement (meconium) develops in their intestinal tract. By the 20th week, the developing fetus is covered with fine hair (lanugo). The baby becomes more active, and you can feel slight fluttering movements. Eyebrows, eyelashes, and nails form. At 24 weeks, the bone marrow starts making blood cells. Fingerprints, footprints, and taste buds develop. Hair starts growing, and the sex organs develop. By the end of the second trimester, the fetus is approximately 12 inches long.\n\n【41】#### Symptoms Experienced During the Second Trimester:\n\n【42】*   To make room for the growing baby, you may undergo the following body changes:Pain in the back, abdomen, and thigh.\n\n【43】*   Stretch marks.\n\n【44】*   The skin around the nipples darken.\n\n【45】*   A line can be seen from the belly button to the pubic hair.\n\n【46】*   The skin over the cheeks, lips, forehead, and nose get dark in patches.\n\n【47】*   Tingling feeling in the hands.\n\n【48】*   Itching of the palm, sole, and abdomen.\n\n【49】*   Your ankles, finger, and face might get swollen.\n\n【50】### Third Trimester:\n\n【51】Weeks 29 to 40 is the third trimester. It is the final stage of pregnancy. As the baby grows, it might put more pressure on your internal organs. You might have difficulty breathing and might urinate frequently. These problems should go away after you give birth.By the 32nd week, your baby’s bones are soft but fully formed. As a result, their kicks and jabs are more forceful. The fine hair covering their body falls off. The eyes open and close and can sense changes in light. At 36 weeks, the body fat increases and protective wax coating (vernix) gets thicker. Your baby is about 16 to 19 inches long. At 39 weeks, your baby is considered full-term. The baby’s organs are fully formed and can function on their own.\n\n【52】#### Symptoms Experienced During the Third Trimester:\n\n【53】The discomforts felt during the second trimester may continue, also the following symptoms may be present:\n\n【54】*   Frequent urination.\n\n【55】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【56】*   Heartburn.\n\n【57】*   Hemorrhoids.\n\n【58】*   Breasts may leak pre-milk called colostrum.\n\n【59】*   Contractions (false labor).\n\n【60】Labor and Delivery:\n-------------------\n\n【61】**Due Date:** The due date or estimated date of delivery (EDD) is the expected date of delivery for pregnant women. A normal pregnancy lasts for 280 days, and it is calculated from the last menstrual period (LMP).\n\n【62】Signs of Labor:\n---------------\n\n【63】Normal labor starts as early as three weeks before or two weeks after the due date. The following are the signs of labor:\n\n【64】1.  As the baby’s head drops down into the pelvis, your belly might look lower. You will find it easy to breathe.\n2.  Frequent urination as the baby presses on the bladder.\n3.  Brownish mucus plug is discharged from the cervix.\n4.  Frequent bowel movement.\n5.  When the amniotic sac surrounding the baby ruptures, fluid can be seen leaking from the vagina. It usually occurs 24 hours before women go into labor.\n6.  Contractions which occur less than 10 minutes apart is a sign of labor.\n\n【65】Types of Delivery:\n------------------\n\n【66】1.  **Vaginal Delivery** - Vaginal delivery is the oldest, most common, and the safest kind of birth. It may or may not be assisted with pain medications or epidural injection. In certain circumstances, when the baby is unable to emerge out entirely, and if the mother is tired, then vaginal delivery is assisted with the help of a forceps (forceps delivery) or vacuum (Vacuum extraction).\n2.  **Cesarean section (C-section)** - If any complications arise during vaginal delivery, c-section is done. In this method, the abdomen is surgically opened by placing a c shaped cut, and the baby is delivered by surgically cutting into the uterus.Once a woman has a cesarean delivery, all future deliveries are performed by c-section, as there is a change of the uterus rupturing during vaginal delivery. But nowadays, depending on how your previous c-section was performed, you might have a chance to give birth vaginally this time!\n\n【67】Complications During Pregnancy:\n-------------------------------\n\n【68】**Some of the difficulties seen during pregnancy are:**\n\n【69】*   **Gestational diabetes** – Women with no previous history of diabetes, develop high blood sugar during the gestational period.\n\n【70】*   **Hyperemesis gravidarum** – Severe and persistent vomiting is called hyperemesis gravidarum. It can cause dehydration and weight loss.\n\n【71】*   **Pelvic girdle pain** – It is a disorder that causes pain due to the instability and limited mobility of the pelvic joints.\n\n【72】*   **High blood pressure** – High blood pressure during pregnancy is called gestational hypertension. Blood pressure above 160/110 is called preeclampsia.\n\n【73】*   **Anemia** – The levels of hemoglobin is low in most of the pregnant women during the third trimester.\n\n【74】*   **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)** – DVT is the formation of blood clot in the deep veins, mostly the veins of the leg. It can be fatal.\n\n【75】*   **Peripartum cardiomyopathy** – It is the decrease in the heart function during the last months of pregnancy.\n\n【76】*   **Hypothyroidism** – Hashimoto’s disease causes the mother’s thyroid not to function properly and might cause severe congenital disabilities in the child.\n\n【77】*   **Ectopic pregnancy** – When the fertilized embryo gets attached outside the uterus, it is called ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【78】*   **Miscarriage** – Loss of pregnancy in the first 20 weeks is called a miscarriage.Placental abruption – The separation of the placenta from the uterine wall is called placental abruption.\n\n【79】*   **Placenta previa** – It is when the placenta gets attached near or over the cervical opening in the uterus.\n\n【80】*   **Placenta accreta**– It occurs when the placenta gets abnormally attached to the muscular layer of the uterine wall.\n\n【81】*   **Perinatal infections** – As the developing fetus has no immune system, pathogens can cross the placental barrier and cause infections.\n\n【82】*   **Premature labor** - If your cervix starts to dilate and you have regular contractions before you reach 37 weeks, it is known as premature labor.\n\n【83】Pregnancy is a significant time during a woman's life. It is crucial to take care of yourself during these 9 months, as any changes in the health will have a direct effect on the developing fetus. Always take medicines under medical supervision, as many drugs can cause side effects to the baby. Go for regular checkups and eat healthily!\n\n【84】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【85】* * *\n\n【86】#### **1.**删除换行**In Which Week of Pregnancy Does a Woman Give Birth?**\n\n【87】Typical childbirth occurs between 37 to 42 weeks. When a woman gives birth to a child before 37 weeks, it is considered preterm. On the other hand, it should also not be more than 42 weeks. Babies born at the 40th week are considered to be immune, strong, and with fewer complications.\n\n【88】#### **2.**删除换行**What Does Pregnant Mean?**\n\n【89】Fertilization happens when the sperm from a male meets the egg in the woman's ovaries. Later, the fused sperm and egg form or develop into a zygote with two genetic materials. The formed zygote gets implanted in the woman's uterus to develop as a fetus. Hence, a woman is considered pregnant when the implantation occurs in the uterus.\n\n【90】#### **3.**删除换行**What Does It Feel Like Hours Before Labor?**\n\n【91】The following features may occur to indicate the labor is nearing:  \n\\- Contraction or cramps in the back.  \n\\- Feeling tired.  \n\\- Pain near the pelvis.  \n\\- Changes in vaginal discharge.  \n\\- Diarrhea.\n\n【92】#### **4.**删除换行**Does It Pain While Giving Birth?**\n\n【93】Yes, giving birth to a baby is painful and bearable. The pain occurs because the uterus starts to contract at intervals to aid in childbirth. Women who give birth may feel cramps in the back, abdomen, and groin. In addition, excess pressure will be exerted over the bladder and intestine, thus aiding in the stretching of the vaginal opening.\n\n【94】#### **5.**删除换行**Do Women Deliver Their First Baby Soon?**\n\n【95】There is no data or research to prove that babies born first have arrived soon, that is, before 40 weeks of pregnancy. However, most of the first babies are delivered on the exact due date, or rarely, they may be premature also (before 37 weeks). However, childbirth between the weeks of 37 to 42 is considered safe.\n\n【96】#### **6.**删除换行**Is It Possible to Avoid Pain During Childbirth?**\n\n【97】In the case of cesarean section delivery, the specialist may use an epidural injection to offer a pain-free surgical procedure while you stay alert during the procedure. On the other hand, in vaginal delivery, relaxation techniques and massage may help relieve the pain to a certain extent.\n\n【98】#### **7.**删除换行**How Is Delivery Classified?**\n\n【99】Delivery is classified into two different types as follows:  \n\\- Cesarean section - A surgical procedure carried out under anesthesia. The surgeon surgically accesses the uterus to deliver the baby.  \n\\- Vaginal or natural - Safe procedure that does not necessarily require any kind of anesthesia. The procedure may sometimes be assisted with a vacuum or forceps.\n\n【100】#### **8.**删除换行**Is Pregnancy Divided Into Different Types?**\n\n【101】The different kinds of pregnancy are listed below:  \n\\- Ectopic  - Abnormal location of the fetus apart from the uterus, and the complications are high with ectopic pregnancy.  \n\\- Intrauterine - The classic type of pregnancy, where the fetus is positioned exactly in the uterus with placental attachment.  \n\\- Multiple - Presence of two or more fetuses in the uterus.  \n\\- Singlet - One fetus is present or developing in the womb.  \n\\- Tubal - When the fetus is implanted in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus, then it is known as tubal pregnancy.\n\n【102】#### **9.**删除换行**What Type of Delivery Is Good?**\n\n【103】Giving birth to the baby via the vagina or vaginal delivery is good. In addition, infection and other risks associated with a vaginal delivery are less. The woman who delivers a baby through the vagina is said to recover faster and can breastfeed their babies more quickly than with a cesarean section. In addition, the babies may have good immunity.\n\n【104】#### **10.**删除换行**Do Hot Water Cause Miscarriage?**\n\n【105】The sudden loss of a fetus during the initial weeks of pregnancy is considered a miscarriage. It may happen due to various reasons. However, using hot water (extremely hot) to take a bath may also lead to miscarriage. In addition, it may also lead to severe complications in pregnant women, such as low blood pressure, which gradually affects the baby.\n\n【106】#### **11.**删除换行**What Causes Miscarriages After Six Weeks?**\n\n【107】Miscarriage or sudden loss of fetus after six weeks may occur due to the following reasons:  \n\\- Severe systemic condition of the mother.  \n\\- Placental problems.  \n\\- Any fetal infection.  \n\\- Fetal abnormalities.\n\n【108】#### **12.**删除换行**Does It Take Long to Push a Baby Out?**\n\n【109】There is no actual time for labor, but commonly childbirth occurs within 1 to 2 hours. Pushing a baby out is painful; women find it hard for the first time. It involves contractions at intervals followed by the dilation of the cervix. During labor, pain and pressure may be felt on the legs, back, abdomen, and pelvis. Sometimes, pushing a baby out may take more than 4 hours.\n\n【110】#### **13.**删除换行**Which Method of Childbirth Is Considered Safe?**\n\n【111】Childbirth may be either vaginal or through cesarean section. In addition, giving birth via vagina is said to be safe with lesser complications. Babies born through vaginal delivery have a better immune system and are less prone to respiratory problems. Both mother and the baby may have a better postpartum life with vaginal delivery. Breastfeeding and childcare becomes easy with vaginal delivery.\n\n【112】#### **14.**删除换行**Do Boy Babies Be Overdue?**\n\n【113】When you cross the due date of pregnancy, and still there are no signs of labor, it may be overdue. It may happen in your first pregnancy, if you are obese, or, interestingly, if you have a boy baby in your womb. There are no facts or studies to justify the reason behind this, but genetics rarely may play a role. Therefore, it is vital to have regular check-ups with your gynecologist to know better.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the tissues and organs of the body.\n\n【2】It is a hereditary type of anemia. Certain genes undergo mutation and cause this disorder. These genetic alterations are responsible for determining the type and severity of symptoms experienced by the people. Every patient suffering from Diamond-Blackfan anemia experiences the symptoms of anemia. They may also be affected by other disorders that may affect their overall health and lifestyle. As the patients affected with Diamond-Blackfan anemia grow older, the risk of developing different forms of cancer also increases in these individuals.\n\n【3】Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a chronic disorder. People with this disorder require lifelong medical help and care so that healthcare professionals can treat the inherited medical condition, manage the side effects of the treatment, and monitor risks and complications effectively.\n\n【4】What Is the Epidemiology of Diamond-Blackfan Anemia?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】It is a rare disorder. Every year, approximately four in one million children in the United States of America are affected with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.\n\n【6】What Is the Pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan Anemia?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】People depend on red blood cells to transfer oxygen throughout the tissues and organs of their bodies. In Diamond-Blackfan anemia, the production of red blood cells by the bone marrow is disrupted due to the synthesis of abnormal stem cells that do not mature into healthy red blood cells.\n\n【8】*   Most children born with this disorder are diagnosed with anemia three to four months after birth.\n\n【9】*   Approximately 30 % of children affected with this condition do not develop fully and show growth retardation.\n\n【10】*   Several medical conditions can also affect their overall appearance, optical vision, and health of the heart and kidneys.\n\n【11】*   Approximately two percent and five percent of people suffering from Diamond-Blackfan anemia may develop certain hematological cancers like acute myeloid leukemia or malignant conditions like colon cancer, cervical cancer, or osteogenic sarcoma (cancer of the bones).\n\n【12】What Causes Diamond-Blackfan Anemia?\n------------------------------------\n\n【13】It is an inherited condition, with approximately 46 % of people affected with this condition carrying the inherited mutated genes from one of the parents. However, it is not clear what triggers these genetic mutations in people who do not inherit the condition. Researchers have linked the condition to more than 20 genes called ribosome protein (RP) genes responsible for causing the symptoms in Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients.\n\n【14】What Are the Symptoms of Diamond-Blackfan Anemia?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The most common clinical features include anemia symptoms, including:\n\n【16】*   **Tiredness:** The patient feels too fatigued and exhausted to carry out daily activities.\n\n【17】*   **Breathlessness:** There is shortness of breath.\n\n【18】*   **Skin Pallor:** The skin becomes paler than usual.\n\n【19】Other common clinical features include:\n\n【20】*   **Delayed Growth:** Children suffering from Diamond-Blackfan anemia are usually shorter than other children of their age.\n\n【21】*   **Microcephaly:** Healthcare professionals may observe small heads in children soon after birth.\n\n【22】Less common clinical features include:\n\n【23】*   Skeletal differences such as missing thumbs.\n\n【24】*   Heart diseases like atrial septal defect (a hole in the heart's chambers).\n\n【25】*   **Renal conditions:** Diamond-Blackfan anemia may cause horseshoe kidneys (when two are fused or joined together).\n\n【26】How Diamond-Blackfan Anemia Is Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【27】Healthcare professionals may suggest several tests to diagnose this condition:\n\n【28】*   **Complete Blood Count:** This test helps to measure hemoglobin, the iron-containing oxygen-carrying metalloprotein in red blood cells, the quantity and size of erythrocytes, and the count of white blood cells and blood platelets.\n\n【29】*   **Reticulocyte Count:** This test evaluates the immature red blood cells in the bone marrow. If the reticulocyte count is low, the bone marrow cannot produce enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body.\n\n【30】*   **Bone Marrow Aspiration and Bone Biopsy:** Healthcare professionals may advise these tests to obtain bone marrow samples to examine under a microscope. These tests help to identify signs of low red blood cell levels.\n\n【31】What Is the Treatment for Diamond-Blackfan Anemia?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Allogeneic stem cell transplantations are the only known treatment modality for Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation allows abnormal stem cells to be replaced with healthy stem cells to boost red blood cell synthesis.\n\n【33】Healthcare professionals may use the following treatment modalities:\n\n【34】*   **Corticosteroid Medications:** This drug will help the bone marrow to boost the production of more red blood cells.\n\n【35】*   **Blood Donation:** This treatment involves blood transfusion and boosts the production of blood cell levels with donated red blood cells.\n\n【36】What Is the Prognosis of Diamond-Blackfan Anemia?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Diamond-Blackfan anemia makes people suffer in many ways, making it tough for healthcare professionals to predict a prognosis. Some people who suffer from this condition may have medical diseases with mild clinical symptoms that do not affect their survival rate. Other patients may have more severe conditions, such as anemia and cardiac or renal issues that could be fatal.\n\n【38】**Conclusion:**\n\n【39】Diamond-Blackfan disease disrupts the synthesis of red blood cells. Living with an illness that does not go away is difficult. Living with a very rare disease is the most challenging aspect of people living with this disorder. People with Diamond-Blackfan anemia may feel they are on their own. The patient should immediately seek medical help.\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>*   Diamond-Blackfan anemia  \n    https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6274/diamond-blackfan-anemia\n*   Diamond Blackfan Anemia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545302/\n*   Diamond-Blackfan anemia  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/diamond-blackfan-anemia/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Hence, in effect, the HPV vaccines can prevent 70 percent of cervical cancers before exposure to HPV (during sexual activity). The risk of developing cervical cancer can be decreased by performing screening tests regularly and getting vaccinated against HPV infection.\n\n【2】What Is Cervical Cancer?\n------------------------\n\n【3】The cervix comprises the lower part of the uterus. Cervix connects the body of the uterus to the vagina. It is differentiated into two parts:\n\n【4】*   Endocervix.\n\n【5】*   Exocervix (ectocervix).\n\n【6】**Endocervix:**\n\n【7】Endocervix is the opening of the cervix which leads into the uterus, and it is covered with glandular cells.\n\n【8】**Exocervix:**\n\n【9】It is the outer part of the cervix, and it is covered with squamous cells. The location where both types of cells meet in the cervix is called the transformation zone. Cervical cancers arise in the cells lining the cervix. Most cervical cancers start in this transformation zone. The cells in the transformation zone do not directly become cancerous, but instead, these normal cells undergo some abnormal changes and become precancerous lesions and later turn cancerous. Not all precancerous lesions change into cancer. Only some become cancerous. Other precancerous lesions go away without any treatment.\n\n【10】What Are the Causes of Cervical Cancer?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【11】The development of normal human cells depends on the information present in the DNA. The DNA contains all the information and instructions the cell needs to perform. Normal healthy cells grow, multiply and eventually die over time. But in the case of cancer, the cells grow abnormally out of control and form a mass. Then they may even spread to various parts of the body. In the case of cervical cancer, HPV (human papillomavirus) plays a major role. But not all people infected with HPV develop cancer. There are also other factors like environmental and lifestyle factors that contribute to the development of cervical cancer.\n\n【12】What Are the Symptoms of Cervical Cancer?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【13】Cervical cancer symptoms include:\n\n【14】*   Heavy vaginal bleeding.\n\n【15】*   Bleeding in between cycles.\n\n【16】*   Bleeding after sex.\n\n【17】*   Watery, blood-stained, or pus-like vaginal discharge.\n\n【18】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Can HPV be transmitted by kissing?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Can HPV in sexually active individual cause throat cancer?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Is this brown spot I developed, a wart or a symptom of HPV?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Pelvic pain.\n\n【19】*   Pain during intercourse.\n    </u>\n\n【20】What Are the Major Risk Factors For Cervical Cancer?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The major risk factors for developing cervical cancer are:\n\n【22】*   Multiple sexual partners.\n\n【23】*   Having sex at an early stage.\n\n【24】*   Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV/AIDS.\n\n【25】*   Weak immune system.\n\n【26】*   Smoking.\n\n【27】*   Exposure to Diethylstilbestrol (miscarriage prevention drug) during pregnancy.\n\n【28】What Are the Different Types of Cervical Cancer?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Cervical cancers are classified based on how they appear under the microscope. Some of the types of cervical cancer are:\n\n【30】*   Squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【31】*   Adenocarcinomas.\n\n【32】*   Mixed carcinomas.\n\n【33】**Squamous Cell Carcinoma:**\n\n【34】In most instances, cervical cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. The squamous cell carcinomas begin in the transformation zone between the exocervix and the endocervix.\n\n【35】**Adenocarcinomas:**\n\n【36】Cancers that develop from the glandular cells are the adenocarcinomas. Cervical adenocarcinomas arise from the mucus-producing gland cells of the endocervix.\n\n【37】**Mixed Carcinomas:**\n\n【38】Cancers having features of both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinomas are called mixed carcinomas. It is also called adenosquamous carcinomas. Mixed carcinomas are less common.\n\n【39】How Are Cervical Cancers Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【40】**Screening Tests:**\n\n【41】Screening tests are recommended to detect cervical cancer and other precancerous cells that can change into cervical cancer over time. Some of the screening tests include:\n\n【42】*   Pap test.\n\n【43】*   HPV DNA test.\n\n【44】**Pap Test:**\n\n【45】Simple, quick, and painless tests called Pap smear tests done in the clinic can pick up early cancers and precancer while they are still asymptomatic (silent). This involves a gynecological internal examination and testing at the same time.\n\n【46】Pap smear is often confused with cervical biopsy, a test where a small bit of tissue is taken from the cervix. There can be some bleeding during the biopsy, and is done under local anesthesia, so that there is no pain. On the other hand, Pap tests are not painful.\n\n【47】Women are recommended to get Pap smear tests done yearly right after three years from the onset of sexual activity. If three consecutive annual smears are normal, then they can be done once in 3 years until the age of 50 years, after which they can be done once in 5 years till the age of 65 years.\n\n【48】**HPV DNA Test:**\n\n【49】This HPV DNA test is done to check for infections with any type of HPV, which are more likely to develop into cervical cancer.\n\n【50】Other recommended tests are:\n\n【51】*   Punch biopsy.\n\n【52】*   Endocervical curettage.\n\n【53】*   Electric wire loop.\n\n【54】*   Cone biopsy.\n\n【55】If cervical cancer is diagnosed, then the doctor may recommend few other tests to determine the stage in which the cancer is progressing. The tests include:\n\n【56】*   Imaging tests like X-ray, CT (computed tomography) scan, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and PET (positron emission tomography). These diagnostic tests are performed to check whether cancer has spread beyond the cervix.\n\n【57】*   Visual examination using special scopes to check inside the bladder and the rectum.\n\n【58】How Are Cervical Cancers Treated?\n---------------------------------\n\n【59】Cervical cancers are treated depending on several factors like the stage of cancer, health condition of the individual, age, and other factors. The common treatment options are:\n\n【60】*   Surgery.\n\n【61】*   Radiation.\n\n【62】*   Chemotherapy.\n\n【63】**Surgery:**\n\n【64】Based on the extent to which the cancer has spread, surgery can be performed to remove,\n\n【65】*   Only Cancerous Growth - In this surgery, cervical cancer is removed entirely with a cone biopsy. In this surgical procedure, a cone-shaped piece of cervical tissue is cut, leaving the rest of the cervix intact.\n\n【66】*   The Cervix - The surgery in which the cervix and some surrounding tissues are removed called the trachelectomy is done.\n\n【67】*   Both the Cervix and the Uterus - The surgery in which the cervix and the uterus are removed is called the hysterectomy. This surgery involves the removal of the cervix, uterus, part of the vagina, and some nearby lymph nodes.\n\n【68】**Radiation:**\n\n【69】In radiation therapy, high-powered energy beams such as X-rays or protons are used to kill the cancer cells. Radiation therapy is mostly used along with chemotherapy as a combination therapy. It can also be used after the surgical procedure.\n\n【70】**Chemotherapy:**\n\n【71】Chemotherapy means treating cancer using drugs. Drugs are administered either through a vein or given in pill forms. In certain cases, both forms are used.\n\n【72】How to Prevent Cervical Cancers?\n--------------------------------\n\n【73】The chances of developing cervical cancer can be lowered by following these ways:\n\n【74】1) Getting Vaccinated With the HPV Vaccine:\n\n【75】These vaccines can be taken from the age of 9 years to 45 years. The course consists of three injections given over a period of 6 months. The only situation where the injection is to be avoided is during pregnancy. If you have had allergic reactions to the previous HPV vaccine, subsequent doses should be avoided.\n\n【76】2) Having a routine Pap test.\n\n【77】3) Practicing safe sex.\n\n【78】4) Avoiding habits like smoking.\n\n【79】**Conclusion:**\n\n【80】The best and effective way to prevent cervical cancers is by getting screened regularly, as screening picks up the precancerous cells before they turn into cancer. Getting vaccinated can also help lower the risk of developing cervical cancer. Also, cancers diagnosed earlier have a chance of better prognosis and are well treatable.\n\n【81】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【82】* * *\n\n【83】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Symptoms of Cervical Cancer?**\n\n【84】\\- Spotting between periods.  \n\\- Heavy and more extended menstrual bleeding.  \n\\- Vaginal discharge.  \n\\- Bleeding and pain after sexual intercourse.  \n\\- Unexplained pelvic and back pain.\n\n【85】#### **2.**删除换行**What Causes Cervical Cancer?**\n\n【86】Genetic mutations in the DNA cause the normal cells to multiply and grow invariably and prevent cell death, resulting in tumor mass growth.

A pair of long bones are articulated against one another, separated by a capsular ligament and articular cartilage. Like any mechanical component, the joint is prone to wear and tear depending upon its use or abuse, especially with sports and athletics, as well as old age and arthritis. This article discusses the injuries to one of the principal knee ligaments, known as the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the type of treatments done, and the potential risks and possible chances of its recurrence.\n\n【2】Knee reconstruction surgeries have been in vogue since the early 1970s. The technique has been perfected and modernized over the years to provide for minimal surgical dissection and longer-lasting implants to improve the quality of life for patients as a whole.\n\n【3】What Are the Components of the Knee Joint?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【4】The knee joint consists of three main bony components and an array of ligaments, cartilage, blood, nerve, and muscle supply. The components can be sub-classified as follows;\n\n【5】1\\. Bony Components.\n\n【6】*   The thigh bone or femur.\n\n【7】*   The shin bone or tibia.\n\n【8】*   The kneecap or patella.\n\n【9】2\\.

Muscles.\n\n【24】2.  Blood vessels.\n\n【25】3.  Nerves.\n\n【26】When Does Knee Pain Occur?\n--------------------------\n\n【27】The knee joint is among the most used parts of the body, prone to heavy stress and wear and tear for decades. The quality of the bone and the nature of the exertions subjected to it cause significant stress to its components, resulting in a wide array of problems leading to knee pain. The common causes behind this are;\n\n【28】1.  Tear in the ligaments.\n\n【29】2.  Arthritis or inflammation of the joints.\n\n【30】3.  Tear of cartilage meniscus.\n\n【31】4.  Loss of blood supply to the bone.\n\n【32】5.  Trauma or injury to the joint.\n\n【33】6.  Increased body weight.\n\n【34】7.  Fracture of the joint.\n\n【35】8.  Infections.\n\n【36】9.  Repetitive strain or common overuse.\n\n【37】When to Consult a Specialist?\n-----------------------------\n\n【38】Knee pain is the principal cause for patients turning up to consult specialists in the field. Other symptoms may include;\n\n【39】1.  Crackling sounds.\n\n【40】2.  Discomfort while performing menial tasks like walking, climbing stairs, or getting up from a chair.\n\n【41】3.  Swelling of the joints, which is not relieved by medication.\n\n【42】4.  Locking of the joints.\n\n【43】5.  Instability of the joint.\n\n【44】6.  Loss of range of motion.\n\n【45】7.  Stiffness.\n\n【46】8.  Bow-legged knee deformity.\n\n【47】How Is It Diagnosed?\n--------------------\n\n【48】After taking clinical and personal history, the specialist conducts a local physical examination of the affected areas, followed by medical imaging such as X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and computed tomography (CT) scans to identify the location of the underlying pathology. The treatment plan is then devised accordingly.\n\n【49】How Is It Treated?\n------------------\n\n【50】Treatment plans depend upon the extent of the damage to the joint and may warrant one of the following procedures;\n\n【51】1.  Ligament reconstruction.\n\n【52】2.  Partial knee replacement.\n\n【53】3.  Total knee replacement.\n\n【54】How Are Knee Surgeries Performed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【55】Knee surgeries are typically performed either under general or spinal anesthesia. First, an incision is made on the affected joint's surface skin. The damaged portion of the bone or cartilage is then removed, and suitable grooves are created to house the implants necessary. Following this, the implants are stabilized using either screw plates or cement. A plastic liner insert is placed between the two articulating bone surfaces to act as the cartilage.\n\n【56】In the case of ligament reconstruction surgeries, the hamstring tendon is used as a graft, coupled with drilling holes in appropriate places of the knee joint surfaces, then pulled through it. This is followed by stabilization, using screws or plates, and suturing to allow healing of the cartilage into the bone.\n\n【57】How Is Rehabilitation Done Postoperatively?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【58】Rehabilitation postoperatively follows almost immediately. A physical therapist is appointed to train the patient with suitable exercises to help strengthen the joint to somewhat original capacity and restore adequate knee movements. Prosthetic devices such as a walker, crutches, or cane may be prescribed for a while until the joint regains its functionality. A continuous passive motion (CPM) machine may passively move the joint while the patient relaxes. An exercise program at home will also be prescribed to keep joint functionality intact.\n\n【59】What Are the Postoperative Complications?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【60】1.  Infection of the operative site.\n\n【61】2.  Knee stiffness.\n\n【62】3.  Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis).\n\n【63】4.  Damage to nerve and blood vessels.\n\n【64】5.  Implant loosening.\n\n【65】6.  Wearing out of plastic liners.\n\n【66】7.  Kneecap dislocation.\n\n【67】8.  Injury to ligaments.\n\n【68】9.  Addiction to narcotic pain relief medication is usually provided short-term.\n\n【69】What to Do at Home?\n-------------------\n\n【70】Surgical efficiency, however perfect, must be complemented with adequate home care for the patient during and after the recovery phase. The safeguards and measures taken at home can be as follows;\n\n【71】*   Create a living space restricted to one floor at home.\n\n【72】*   Install guard rails and handles wherever needed, such as in showers and stairways.\n\n【73】*   Stable chair with cushion and footstool to elevate the joint.\n\n【74】*   Arrange for a toilet seat riser with handles if the toilet height is short.\n\n【75】*   Remove loose rugs and cords.\n\n【76】What Is the Rate of Success?\n----------------------------\n\n【77】For most patients, knee reconstruction provides pain relief and improved quality of life for over 10 to 15 years, provided no debilitating postoperative complications crop up. Bed-rest of three to four weeks also may allow for easier discharge of menial tasks such as walking up an incline or driving. However, repetitive strain such as athletic activities like swimming, jogging, and running should be avoided.\n\n【78】**Conclusion**\n\n【79】Knee reconstruction is considered a somewhat risk-free surgical procedure intended to eliminate knee pain, damaged tissue, and reconstruction of injured ligaments from repetitive strain and overuse. Recovery usually takes a few weeks with certain precautions, occupational therapy, and pain management. Care must be taken to prevent addiction to opioids prescribed for pain management.\n\n【80】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【81】无关删除-1:<u>*   Knee Reconstruction and Replacement Surgery  \n    https://utswmed.org/conditions-treatments/knee-reconstruction-and-replacement-surgery/\n*   Total Knee Replacement  \n    https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/treatment/total-knee-replacement/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Long, narrow trenches, usually occupied by infantry for several weeks, were dug into the frontline to protect World War I soldiers from machine gun fire and aerial bombardment. The soldiers were exposed to terrible conditions like fevers, parasites, and infections rampant on the war front, killing thousands of troops living in the trenches. The most common diseases and viruses include influenza, typhoid fever, trench foot, and trench fever.\n\n【2】What Is Trench Nephritis?\n-------------------------\n\n【3】Nephritis is a condition in which the tissue of the kidneys becomes inflamed, making it difficult for them to filter waste products from the blood. Nephritis can be caused by infections, inflammatory conditions (such as lupus), certain genetic conditions, and other diseases or conditions. During World War I, nephritis was prevalent among soldiers, especially in the trenches. Unlike post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, it was characterized by atypical features such as proteinuria, hypertension, edema, sudden onset of dyspnea, bronchitis, early mortality, and frequent relapse.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Trench Nephritis?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【5】There was a debate as to whether it was a new condition or strep nephritis, and the research has shown that it was a new condition. Studies have suggested that the origin of the disease is infectious rather than toxic, but no clear cause has been found till now. Causes that could have led to trench nephritis in soldiers are:\n\n【6】*   Infections or toxins.\n\n【7】*   Autoimmune diseases induced by the stress of the war.\n\n【8】*   Strenuous work without water.\n\n【9】*   Poor diet.\n\n【10】*   Unhygienic conditions.\n\n【11】*   Urinating less frequently.\n\n【12】What Are the Risk Factors of Trench Nephritis?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Certain people are at elevated risk of trench nephritis. Risk factors for trench nephritis include:\n\n【14】*   Family history of kidney disease and infections.\n\n【15】*   Have an immune system disorder such as lupus.\n\n【16】*   Excessive use of antibiotics or painkillers.\n\n【17】*   Recent urinary surgery.\n\n【18】What Are the Symptoms of Trench Nephritis?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The symptoms of trench nephritis that world war I soldiers presented with were:\n\n【20】*   Albuminuria. (excess albumin in the urine).\n\n【21】*   High blood pressure.\n\n【22】*   Casts in urine.\n\n【23】*   Difficulty breathing.\n\n【24】*   Bronchitis.\n\n【25】*   Pain in the pelvis.\n\n【26】*   Pain or a burning sensation while urinating.\n\n【27】*   A frequent need to urinate.\n\n【28】*   Cloudy urine.\n\n【29】*   Blood or pus in the urine.\n\n【30】*   Pain in the kidney area or abdomen.\n\n【31】*   Swelling of the body, commonly in the face, legs, and feet.\n\n【32】*   Vomiting.\n\n【33】*   Fever.\n\n【34】What Are the Possible Complications of Trench Nephritis?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】The possible complications of trench nephritis are:\n\n【36】*   Accumulation of waste products or toxins in the bloodstream.\n\n【37】*   Misregulation of essential minerals and nutrients.\n\n【38】*   Loss of red blood cells.\n\n【39】*   Loss of blood protein.\n\n【40】The following conditions can arise with uncontrolled trench nephritis:\n\n【41】*   **Acute Renal Failure -** Acute renal failure is a sudden, rapid decline in renal function and is often associated with infectious causes of trench nephritis. Accumulation of waste products and fluids can be life-threatening if not treated quickly with an artificial filter (dialysis). Kidneys often restore normal function after recovery.\n\n【42】*   **Chronic Kidney Disease -** Persistent inflammation leads to long-term kidney damage and decreased function. Chronic kidney disease is described as kidney damage or loss of function lasting more than three months. Chronic kidney disease can progress to renal failure, requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\n【43】*   **Hypertension -** Glomerular damage due to inflammation and scarring can lead to increased blood pressure.\n\n【44】*   **Nephrotic Syndrome -** Nephrotic syndrome is a condition wherein excess blood protein is found in the urine and too little in the bloodstream. These proteins play a role in regulating fluid and cholesterol levels.\n\n【45】**When to Get Help for Trench Nephritis?**\n\n【46】Urine that contains blood appears brown or pink. People with this sign should see a doctor as soon as possible.\n\n【47】It is recommended to see a doctor for other urine-related symptoms, like painful and frequent urination. Early treatment can prevent permanent kidney damage and more serious complications of trench nephritis.\n\n【48】How Is Trench Nephritis Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【49】Doctors can sometimes diagnose trench nephritis with routine blood or urine tests. Detection of protein in the urine may indicate that the kidneys are not working properly. A blood test measuring the waste product in the blood called creatinine can also provide information about kidney health. However, a biopsy is the best way to confirm the presence of trench nephritis. In this procedure, a doctor removes part of the kidney with a needle and sends it to a laboratory for analysis.\n\n【50】How Is Trench Nephritis Treated?\n--------------------------------\n\n【51】Treatment of nephritis depends on the cause and type of nephritis:\n\n【52】*   Acute nephritis may go away without treatment. However, it usually requires medications and special treatments to remove excess water and dangerous proteins.\n\n【53】*   Treatment of chronic nephritis usually includes regular kidney tests and blood pressure monitoring. The doctor may prescribe water pills to control blood pressure and reduce swelling.\n\n【54】*   Drugs that prevent the immune system from attacking the kidneys are also sometimes beneficial.\n\n【55】*   Doctors can also refer people with kidney infections to a nutritionist to advise them on what to eat to protect their kidneys. A proper diet is usually low in protein, salt, and potassium.\n\n【56】How to Prevent Trench Nephritis?\n--------------------------------\n\n【57】Although it is not always possible to prevent trench nephritis, certain lifestyle practices can reduce the risk for many people. These practices include:\n\n【58】*   Drinking plenty of water regularly.\n\n【59】*   Urinating frequently.\n\n【60】*   Maintaining proper hygiene and sanitation.\n\n【61】*   Maintaining a healthy body weight.\n\n【62】*   Cessation of smoking.\n\n【63】*   Maintaining a check on blood pressure.\n\n【64】*   Regularly exercising.\n\n【65】*   Eating a balanced diet can also help protect renal health.\n\n【66】**Conclusion:**\n\n【67】Trench nephritis is an inflammation of the kidneys along with respiratory symptoms. Causes are varied and can be acute or chronic. Early symptoms include a change in urine color, swelling of the limbs, and breathlessness. People who notice changes in their urine should see a doctor to check for kidney damage. If left untreated, it can also lead to renal failure. Acute episodes of trench nephritis often respond well to treatment, but chronic glomerulonephritis can develop years later. A cure for trench nephritis may not always be available, but proper treatment can control the condition and protect the kidneys. Following the physician’s instructions are important to prevent and limit kidney damage. If kidney failure develops, dialysis or a kidney transplant may be required. Dialysis is a medical procedure that regulates safe levels of blood chemicals by mimicking how healthy kidneys remove waste products and excess water.\n\n【68】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【69】无关删除-1:<u>*   The medical response to trench nephritis in World War One  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16820794/\n*   Clinical Observations on the early stages of trench nephritis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1523766/\n*   Observations ON TRENCH NEPHRITIS, ITS LATER STAGES AND TREATMENT  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2355364/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Dysfunctional labor is a term used to describe abnormal or difficult childbirth or delivery. This can occur when the labor slows down, which is known as protraction, or when the labor comes to a complete stop, which is referred to as an arrest of descent.\n\n【2】The stages of labor begin before the delivery. In the first stage, the contractions start till the mother is fully dilated. After that, the cervix becomes ready for the child's birth. Finally, the second stage begins with complete dilation of the cervix and ends with the baby's birth. Many pregnant women go through these stages without facing any issues. But some women may experience abnormal labor during any of these stages.\n\n【3】What Is the Arrest of Descent?\n------------------------------\n\n【4】The arrest of descent is when the head of the fetus is in the same place in the birth canal during the first and second examinations, which the doctor has performed an hour previously apart. It means the fetus's body has not moved the birth canal downwards within the last hour. The arrest of descent is diagnosed in the second stage when the cervix is completely dilated. The abnormal delivery can be corrected to vaginal delivery by administering oxytocin to promote the labor. This type of medication helps to stimulate uterine contraction by enhancing labor. The oxytocin can be given through a vein using a medication pump to start and maintain the regular contractions of the uterus. These contractions help the mother dilate the cervix and also help push the baby out of the uterus. The dose of oxytocin varies from one woman to another.\n\n【5】What Are Different Types of Abnormal Labor?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The following types of abnormal labor can happen in any of the stages of labor:\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】Cerebral Aneurysm- Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【10】Right Aortic Arch With Aberrant Left Subclavian Artery - An Overview\n\n【11】Kindly evaluate my daughter's ECG report.\n\n【12】*   **Uterine Hypocontractility -** It is most common in women going into labor for the first time. The labor may begin well, but it can stop later if the uterus cannot contract sufficiently. This type of labor is called uterine hypercontractility or uterine inertia. It can be because of the medications that lessen the frequency or intensity of the contractions.\n\n【13】*   **Macrosomia** \\- This condition occurs when the fetus is much larger than average and weighs more than eight pounds and 13 ounces. Around 9 % of babies born have macrosomia. This condition can cause injury and problems during childbirth. In addition, there is an increased risk of health problems for the child after birth. Also, the mother and the baby are at high risk if the baby weighs more than 9 pounds and 15 ounces.\n\n【14】*   **Shoulder Dystocia** - Shoulder dystocia is a condition where the baby's head is delivered through the vagina of the mother, but the shoulders are stuck inside the mother's body. This cannot be discovered until the labor has begun, it can only be found at the time of labor, so there is no way to prevent or predict it. This condition is risky for both the mother and the baby. There can be injuries, which include excessive tearing or bleeding of the vagina, cervix, and rectum. In addition, the baby can experience a lack of oxygen supply to the brain and brain damage. In many cases, the babies are delivered safely as doctors can ease the baby out by turning the baby's shoulder and applying pressure to the mother's lower belly.\n\n【15】*   **Uterine Rupture** \\- The uterine rupture is tearing in the wall of the uterus, especially at the site of the previous injection. This condition is rare and is seen in women who have had uterine surgery or women who have a history of cesarean delivery. However, uterine rupture is seen when an emergency cesarean delivery is necessary to prevent severe problems in the mother and the child. The serious problems include heavy bleeding in the mother and brain damage in the child. So in some cases, a hysterectomy is necessary to stop the mother's bleeding.\n\n【16】*   **Cephalopelvic Disproportion (CPD)** \\- CPD is very rare. If the labor is slow even after receiving oxytocin, the baby's head might be too large to fit through the pelvis, and this condition is called cephalopelvic disproportion. Women who experience CPD can give birth by cesarean delivery.\n\n【17】*   **Precipitous Labor** \\- The three labor stages last about six to 18 hours. Precipitous labor is also called rapid labor. With this labor, the stages progress more quickly, lasting about three to five hours. This may occur for several reasons. When the woman has a history of precipitous labor, the baby is smaller than average, and uterus contractions are powerful.\n\n【18】*   **Umbilical Cord Prolapse** \\- This condition occurs when the umbilical cord slips out of the cervix in the vagina, ahead of the baby. This can lead to compression of the umbilical cord or increased pressure on the umbilical cord.\n\n【19】*   **Retained Placenta** - The placenta is formed in the uterus and attaches to the uterine wall during pregnancy. It helps in providing nutrients and helps to remove the waste created by the baby's blood. The retained placenta develops when the placenta is left behind in the cervix or remains attached to the uterine wall. If the condition is untreated, it causes complications.\n\n【20】*   **Postpartum Hemorrhage** - Postpartum hemorrhage occurs when there is an excessive bleeding after childbirth, especially after the delivery of the placenta. The women will lose 500 milliliters of blood after birth, while the postpartum hemorrhage will cause them to lose double the blood. This condition occurs after the cesarean delivery if an organ is cut or the blood vessels are not appropriately stitched. This condition can be extremely dangerous for the mother, as too much blood loss can cause a steep drop in blood pressure, leading to severe shock if not treated. The women experiencing postpartum hemorrhage are given blood transfusions to replace blood loss.\n\n【21】What Are the Risk Factors For the Arrest of Descent?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Major risk factors for the arrest of descent are:\n\n【23】*   Fetal macrosomia.\n\n【24】*   Epidural analgesia.\n\n【25】*   Hydramnios.\n\n【26】*   Hypersensitive disorders.\n\n【27】*   Gestational diabetes mellitus.\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】Labor is a unique and natural process. It is different for every woman. It can be a matter of hours for some women, but it could test their emotional and physical stamina. The arrest of descent is when the baby stops descending through the birth canal despite adequate contractions and pushing efforts. It can be due to fetal malposition, a large baby, a narrow pelvis, or weak contractions. Interventions like changing positions, forceps, vacuum extraction, medication, or cesarean section may be necessary. Close monitoring and early identification of potential issues are crucial.\n\n【30】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>*   Risk factors for arrest of descent during the second stage of labor  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11929650/\n*   Abnormal Labor  \n    https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/273053-overview</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It may be caused by lung neoplasm, necrotizing pneumonia, empyema, blunt, penetrating trauma to the lung tissues, or as a complication of surgical procedures. Out of which, lung resection is the most common cause of bronchopleural fistula. It is usually seen one week to three months post-lobectomy or pneumonectomy.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Bronchopleural Fistula?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Bronchopleural fistula is of two types:\n\n【4】*   Central bronchopleural fistula.\n\n【5】*   Peripheral bronchopleural fistula.\n\n【6】Central bronchopleural fistula can be defined as the communication between the pleura and the trachea or lobar bronchus. It can be seen in the early postoperative period. It can be easily diagnosed with bronchoscopy or after a large air leak.\n\n【7】Peripheral bronchopleural fistula can be defined as the communication between the pleura and the airway distal to the segmental bronchi or the lung parenchyma. It can be seen when there is an air leak, prolonged pneumothorax with air-fluid levels within pleural effusion or empyema, history of a chest drainage tube into the thorax, gas-producing bacteria, or aspiration pneumonia due to backflow of pus into the bronchial tree.\n\n【8】Another classification of Bronchopleural fistula is based on the time of onset:\n\n【9】*   Early-onset.\n\n【10】*   Late-onset.\n\n【11】The early onset of bronchopleural fistula can be defined as the fistula occurring within one month of the surgery.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【14】Pulmonary Gangrene\n\n【15】Lung Lobectomy: An Overview\n\n【16】One Lung Ventilation - Indications, Contraindications, and Complications\n\n【17】The late-onset of bronchopleural fistula can be defined as the fistula occurring one month after the surgery. It is typically associated with patient-related factors and coexists with empyema. It usually involves a more complex and long-term treatment approach.\n\n【18】What Are the Risk Factors Associated With the Bronchopleural Fistula?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The most common risk factors associated with bronchopleural fistula can be classified as\n\n【20】**Patient-Related Factors:**\n\n【21】*   Age over sixty years.\n\n【22】*   More common in males than females.\n\n【23】*   Radiation therapy.\n\n【24】*   Smoking.\n\n【25】*   Patients on immunosuppressive agents.\n\n【26】*   Diabetes mellitus patient.\n\n【27】*   Post-operative mechanical ventilation patient.\n\n【28】**Surgeon-Related Factors:**\n\n【29】*   Poorly secured knots.\n\n【30】*   Stapler misfiring.\n\n【31】*   Increased anastomotic tension.\n\n【32】*   Extensive mediastinal lymphadenectomy and peribronchial dissection.\n\n【33】*   Long bronchial stump.\n\n【34】*   Non-coverage of bronchial stumps with viable tissue.\n\n【35】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Bronchopleural Fistula?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】The most common signs and symptoms of bronchopleural fistula are\n\n【37】*   Fever.\n\n【38】*   Persistent cough with purulent sputum production.\n\n【39】*   Night sweats.\n\n【40】*   Chills.\n\n【41】*   Expectorations.\n\n【42】*   Muscle wasting.\n\n【43】*   Dullness to percussion on the affected side.\n\n【44】*   Respiratory symptoms may worsen if the patient lies on the contralateral side of the fistula.\n\n【45】*   Pooling of the infected contents of the pleural cavity to the contralateral lung can be seen, usually resulting in pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n【46】What Are the Diagnostic Tests to Be Carried Out?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】The diagnostic tests that can be carried out are:\n\n【48】*   **Regular Complete Blood Count:** It will reveal a marked increase in white blood cells. Also, systemic inflammatory mediators may be seen.\n\n【49】*   **Chest X-Ray:** It may reveal a steady increase in intrapleural air. There may be an intrapleural air-pleural fluid collection which can result in hydropneumothorax. Changes in the gas fluid level can be observed. A decrease in the air-fluid level exceeding two cm can be appreciated.\n\n【50】*   **Computed Tomography:** It is considered the gold standard diagnostic tool for bronchopleural fistula. It may reveal pneumothorax, hydropneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum. It may also help diagnose the underlying pulmonary pathology and fistulous communication.\n\n【51】*   **Radioaerosol Scanning:** It can identify the bronchopleural fistula by visualization of the radioactive isotopes in the pleural cavity. The most common radioactive tracers used in the scanning are technetium 99m labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetate, xenon 133, and single photon emission tomography using radiolabeled aerosol inhalation. Although it is a non-invasive diagnostic procedure, it is not a practical and easy-to-use method with no additional benefit for underlying lung disease.\n\n【52】*   **Bronchoscopy:** A characteristic feature that may be revealed is the presence of air-fluid leakage and air bubbling originating in the bronchial stump. The fistulous patency may not be appreciated.\n\n【53】What Is the Management of Bronchopleural Fistula?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【54】Bronchopleural fistula management involves managing life-threatening situations such as sepsis, tension pneumothorax, and respiratory failure. To decrease the risk of pneumonia and respiratory failure, it is important to protect the contralateral healthy lung from aspiration of the pleural fluid. Therefore, a chest tube must be applied to ensure the drainage of the pleural cavity. Also, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage should be initiated immediately.\n\n【55】Early bronchopleural fistulas are mostly associated with failure in surgical management. The best treatment approach may require surgical repair of the bronchial stump.\n\n【56】Late bronchopleural fistulas are mostly associated with the poor medical condition of the patient. In such cases, surgical approaches are contraindicated, and a more conservative approach is required, like drainage and reduction of the pleural space, pleural irrigation, antibiotic coverage, and nutritional supplementation.\n\n【57】Several surgical procedures can be used to treat bronchopleural fistulas, such as:\n\n【58】*   **Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS):** is a useful method to drain and debride the infected pleural content with surgical instruments. Small fistulas of less than three mm can be managed with fibrin glue.\n\n【59】*   **Thoracostomy:** In the case of empyema, drainage of the pleural space becomes essential to control the septic status of the patient. The procedure involves segmental resection of two to three ribs with the creation of a skin flap, marsupialization of the cavity, and a thoracostomy window is obtained, and effective drainage is ensured. Later the wound is packed with gauze and moistened with normal saline.\n\n【60】Large bronchopleural fistulas can cause a loss in the tidal volume, aspiration of the infected pleural content, and respiratory distress. Therefore, the bronchial defect must be managed with a transpleural approach. The fistula must be identified, and aggressive dissection and devascularization of the proximal bronchus must be avoided because of the increased risk of repair failure and recurrence rate. Staplers may be used if there is a sufficient length in the bronchial stump to repair. After repair, the stump must be bolstered with well-vascularized tissue such as a diaphragmatic flap.\n\n【61】**Conclusion**\n\n【62】Bronchopleural fistulas are mostly associated with high mortality and morbidity. Multiple options can be used for these patients. The best treatment is to prevent the disease. Robust surgical technique and bronchial stump coverage are the major steps in treating bronchopleural fistula.\n\n【63】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【64】* * *\n\n【65】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the Cause of Bronchopleural Fistula?**\n\n【66】Various factors, such as trauma, lung surgery, or lung infections, can cause a bronchopleural fistula. Other causes of bronchopleural fistula include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, and lung cancer. In rare cases, bronchopleural fistula can be a congenital condition.\n\n【67】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is the Pathophysiology of Bronchopleural Fistula?**\n\n【68】Bronchopleural fistula occurs when abnormal communication between the bronchial tree and the pleural space occurs. This can be due to a breach in the integrity of the bronchial or pleural tissue, allowing air to escape from the lungs into the pleural cavity. The pathophysiology of bronchopleural fistula involves the loss of negative pressure within the pleural space, leading to lung collapse and impaired gas exchange.\n\n【69】#### **3.**删除换行**What Causes a Fistula in the Lungs?**\n\n【70】Various factors, including lung infections, lung cancer, or chest trauma, can cause lung fistulas. Specific medical procedures, such as lung surgery or placement of a chest tube, can also cause a fistula in the lungs. Other causes may include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, and tuberculosis.\n\n【71】#### **4.**删除换行**What Are the Clinical Findings of Bronchopleural Fistula?**\n\n【72】Clinical findings of bronchopleural fistula can include shortness of breath, coughing, and chest pain. Other symptoms may include fever, chills, and increased production of sputum. Subcutaneous emphysema and decreased breath sounds on the affected side may be seen on physical examination.\n\n【73】#### **5.**删除换行**What Is the Best Treatment for Fistula?**\n\n【74】The treatment for fistula depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. In some cases, conservative management with antibiotics and chest physiotherapy may be sufficient. In more severe instances, surgical intervention might be required, mainly when respiratory distress or sepsis is present\n\n【75】#### **6.**删除换行**Can TB Cause Bronchopleural Fistula?**\n\n【76】Tuberculosis can cause a bronchopleural fistula, particularly in cases of cavitary tuberculosis. The formation of cavities in the lungs can lead to the development of a fistula. This can result in air and fluid leakage into the pleural space.\n\n【77】#### **7.**删除换行**How Does Central and Peripheral Bronchopleural Fistula Differ?**\n\n【78】Central bronchopleural fistula occurs when communication between the mainstem bronchus and the pleural space occurs. In contrast, peripheral bronchopleural fistula occurs when contact between the peripheral lung tissue and the pleural space occurs. Central bronchopleural fistula is more commonly associated with lung surgery, while peripheral bronchopleural fistula is most widely associated with lung infections.\n\n【79】#### **8.**删除换行**How Do You Prevent Bronchopleural Fistula?**\n\n【80】Preventative measures for bronchopleural fistula may include:  \n - Minimizing the extent of lung surgery.  \n - Ensuring proper placement and management of chest tubes.  \n - Optimizing treatment of lung infections.  \n - Proper management of chronic lung conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema, can also play a role in preventing the occurrence of bronchopleural fistula. Close monitoring and prompt management of any signs or symptoms of respiratory distress may also be necessary.\n\n【81】#### **9.**删除换行**Is Bronchopleural Fistula an Emergency?**\n\n【82】Bronchopleural fistula can be a medical emergency, particularly in respiratory distress or sepsis cases. Prompt management and treatment of bronchopleural fistula are necessary to prevent complications such as lung collapse and impaired gas exchange. In instances of severe bronchopleural fistula, surgical intervention may be required.\n\n【83】#### **10.**删除换行**How Do You Ventilate a Bronchopleural Fistula?**\n\n【84】Ventilation strategies for bronchopleural fistula depend on the severity and location of the fistula. Noninvasive ventilation may be used in mild cases, while invasive mechanical ventilation may be necessary in severe cases. In some cases, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be necessary to provide adequate ventilation.\n\n【85】#### **11.**删除换行**How Does Pneumothorax Cause Bronchopleural Fistula?**\n\n【86】Pneumothorax can cause bronchopleural fistula by creating communication between the lung tissue and the pleural space. A ruptured bulla or bleb can lead to the development of a fistula, which can result in air and fluid leakage into the pleural space. Pneumothorax can also occur as a complication of bronchopleural fistula.\n\n【87】#### **12.**删除换行**What Is the Incidence of Bronchopleural Fistula?**\n\n【88】The incidence is higher in lung surgery patients, with reported rates ranging from 0.5% to 8%. The incidence of bronchopleural fistula in patients with lung infections or chronic lung conditions is lower. However, the incidence depends on the underlying cause.\n\n【89】#### **13.**删除换行**What Is the Mortality of Bronchopleural Fistula?**\n\n【90】The mortality risk linked to bronchopleural fistula is affected by various factors, including the underlying cause, the extent of the condition, and the promptness of medical intervention. Mortality rates range from 10% to 40%, with higher rates reported in sepsis or respiratory distress cases. Prompt command and treatment can improve outcomes and reduce mortality rates.\n\n【91】#### **14.**删除换行**What Is the Treatment for Pulmonary Fistula?**\n\n【92】Treatment for pulmonary fistula depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. Conservative management with antibiotics and chest physiotherapy may be sufficient in mild cases. Surgical intervention may be required in circumstances that are more severe and lead to respiratory distress or sepsis.\n\n【93】#### **15.**删除换行**What Is Bronchopleural Fistula in COVID?**\n\n【94】Bronchopleural fistula can occur as a complication of COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in patients who require mechanical ventilation. The risk of bronchopleural fistula may increase in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Management and treatment of bronchopleural fistula in COVID-19 patients may be challenging due to the underlying respiratory compromise and risk of transmission.\n\n【95】#### **16.**删除换行**Is Bronchopleural Fistula a Complication of Lung Abscess?**\n\n【96】Yes, bronchopleural fistula can occur as a lung abscess complication, particularly in necrotizing pneumonia cases. The formation of a fistula can lead to the development of pleural effusion and empyema. Management and treatment of bronchopleural fistula in lung abscesses may require surgical intervention.\n\n【97】#### **17.**删除换行**What Is Bronchopleural Fistula in Children?**\n\n【98】Bronchopleural fistula can occur in children, particularly those with congenital lung anomalies or undergoing lung surgery. Clinical findings in children with bronchopleural fistula may include coughing, wheezing, and respiratory distress. Management and treatment of bronchopleural fistula in children may require a multidisciplinary approach and close monitoring of respiratory status.\n\n【99】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【100】无关删除-1:<u>*   Bronchopleural Fistula  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534765/\n*   Bronchopleural fistula  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bronchopleural-fistula-2</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "8266d0f9-d8bd-479f-b43d-1b54097e4e12", "title": "Voyeuristic Disorder: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Voyeuristic Disorder: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】The voyeuristic disorder is considered a form of the paraphilic disorder. Voyeurism is when people are sexually aroused by watching them indulge in sexual activities while unaware of it. While some people enjoy the act, some may be traumatized after observations of voyeurism. However, most people do not report significant emotional harm due to their voyeuristic experience.\n\n【2】Though, people with voyeuristic behavior often become concerned that their compulsive need to spy on others indicates that they may be repressing the impulse to watch people engage in sexual acts; or that their feelings about watching other people having sex make them deviant. Repeated uncontrolled behavior turns the condition into a disorder.\n\n【3】What Is Voyeuristic Disorder?\n-----------------------------\n\n【4】Voyeuristic disorder is a psychological condition that causes sufferers to develop an uncontrollable desire to watch other people in the act of being intimate, like when they are sleeping or having sex. It involves secretly observing (the act of looking at someone without their knowledge or consent) others without their permission, usually while naked or engaged in sexual activity.\n\n【5】According to a study with 60 college men concluded that 54 percent had voyeuristic fantasies and 42 percent had tried voyeurism (spying, peeping, or watching someone indulge in sexual behaviors, peeping when someone is taking a bath or changing clothes without their consent), suggesting that the idea more easily arouses young adults.\n\n【6】Though men are more likely than women to be diagnosed with voyeurism, this does not mean women do not suffer from the disorder. Some studies also concluded that about five percent of men and two percent of women experience this condition.\n\n【7】What Causes Voyeuristic Disorder?\n---------------------------------\n\n【8】The disorder can be due to any number of factors, including:\n\n【9】*   Watching someone spy on others while they were growing up.\n\n【10】*   Being bullied or harassed by others.\n\n【11】*   Peers performing the same act.\n\n【12】*   Trying to find out if someone else is seeing something that you are not.\n\n【13】*   Being aroused by the idea of someone else being aroused.\n\n【14】*   Excessive consumption of alcohol and drugs is also associated with voyeuristic behaviors.\n\n【15】*   Hypersexuality (sex addiction).\n\n【16】*   People who are suffering from OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder).\n\n【17】*   Abnormal sexual drive.\n\n【18】*   Mental health conditions like depression.\n\n【19】*   Early childhood trauma or history of child sexual abuse.\n\n【20】*   Incidences of watching someone undress or have sex accidentally in the past.\n\n【21】*   Overwatching of pornographic content.\n\n【22】*   History of paraphilic disorder or sexual disorders in the past.\n\n【23】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Voyeuristic Disorder?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】1\\. Strong and persistent sexual interest or urges to spy on people indulging in sexual intercourse without their consent.\n\n【25】2\\. Many people enjoy voyeurism, merely watching and being aroused by another person performing a sexual act. But this is not considered as voyeuristic disorder or voyeurism. Voyeurists (people who exhibit voyeuristic behaviors) will typically not engage in sexual activity with the person they observe.\n\n【26】3\\. Excessive voyeuristic thoughts make people distressed and unable to function or act on their urges.\n\n【27】4\\. Some alarming concerns include the following:\n\n【28】*   Violating privacy norms in other people’s homes.\n\n【29】*   Watch a person performing sexual activities without their consent.\n\n【30】*   Non-consented filming or photographing another person without their permission.\n\n【31】*   Entering an area illegally to watch people (trespass or peep in bedroom windows).\n\n【32】*   Using binoculars to watch people without their consent.\n\n【33】*   Feeling guilty after engaging in these behaviors.\n\n【34】*   Unable to get satisfied or sexually aroused without watching others.\n\n【35】*   Cannot resist voyeuristic activities even if it is affecting mental health.\n\n【36】What Is the Voyeuristic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】A qualified medical doctor (psychologist) or a licensed therapist only is eligible to confirm the diagnosis of voyeuristic disorders. Therapists diagnose the condition and conclude a person is suffering from voyeuristic disorder; only if the person feels distressed or is unable to function due to voyeuristic thoughts.\n\n【38】Diagnosis for the voyeuristic disorder is made when:\n\n【39】*   There are recurrent episodes of sexual arousal by watching a person undressed, changing clothes, or engaging in sexual activities without their consent.\n\n【40】*   These sexual urges and fantasies impair normal functioning and affect the daily activities in their lives (voyeuristic disorder psychology).\n\n【41】*   A person finds indulging in sexual conversations interesting and often indulges in dirty talking.\n\n【42】*   A person cannot divert sexual thoughts and urges, causing severe frustration and distress.\n\n【43】*   The disorder has been present for more than six months.\n\n【44】*   A person must also be at least 18 years old before being diagnosed with the voyeuristic disorder to rule out genuine sexual curiosity in children.\n\n【45】How to Treat Voyeuristic Disorder?\n----------------------------------\n\n【46】Voyeuristic disorders, just like other paraphilic disorders, can be treated with a combination of medications, psychological therapies, a combination of both, and by adopting healthy activities.\n\n【47】**1\\. Medications -**\n\n【48】*   Medications like serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Fluoxetine and Escitalopram are used to suppress impulsive behaviors.\n\n【49】*   Drugs to reduce testosterone levels in the body, such as Leuprolide acetate, are also given to reduce sexual urges.\n\n【50】*   Reduced testosterone levels also reduce the sex drive, reducing the frequency of voyeuristic behavior.\n\n【51】**2\\. Psychotherapy -** Therapists and psychiatrists usually use psychotherapy mechanisms to help the person become more aware of his doings and prevent him from doing something regretful and offensive in nature.\n\n【52】**3\\. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy -** This method is adopted to make the person understand why these behaviors are socially unacceptable and help cope with their sexual urges. It also helps in understanding the root cause of these behaviors.\n\n【53】**4\\. Coping Mechanisms -** Recognizing the condition and knowing that one needs help is the first step towards coping with the voyeuristic disorder. One should not feel ashamed of seeking help from loved ones and family members or friends. Conscious efforts to control the urges and self-reminders of the consequences are another way to cope with the disorder.\n\n【54】**5\\. Practicing Sexual Abstinence -** Refraining from indulging in sexual activities or taking a break from sexual activities could help divert unhealthy thoughts and reduce the symptoms of voyeuristic disorder.\n\n【55】**6\\. Limit or Quit Watching Pornographic Content -** Limiting watching pornographic content also reduces sexual urges and keeps the mind healthy.\n\n【56】**7\\. Adopting Healthy Habits -** Exposing oneself to various other activities like exercising, meditation, yoga, focusing on professional work, and indulging in hobby classes could help divert the mind from voyeuristic thoughts and sexual activities.\n\n【57】**Conclusion:**\n\n【58】It is essential to remember that this disorder involves an invasion of privacy. The consequences of this behavior can be detrimental and considered an offense. In conclusion, there are some tangible and intangible effects of voyeurism. While the tangible effects include humiliation, arrests, and fines, the intangible effects refer to the psychological well-being of the person suffering from it. People should recognize and adopt early intervention (self-control and professional treatment) on the occurrence of the first incidence itself. This also prevents undesired impacts on the individual and society.\n\n【59】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【60】* * *\n\n【61】#### **1.**删除换行**Is Hypersexuality a Paraphilia?**\n\n【62】Hypersexuality or compulsive sexual behavior is a disorder that causes sexual addiction.

Dermatoses of pregnancy are also known as 'polymorphic eruptions of pregnancy.' These dermatoses occur specifically during pregnancy due to various hormonal and physiological changes in a pregnant woman. Most of these skin conditions resolve after childbirth and only require symptomatic treatment.\n\n【2】Dermatoses of pregnancy include -\n\n【3】1.

No risk of early abortion is present.\n\n【92】*   Weekly checkups, ultrasounds, and serum bile acid levels must be monitored throughout pregnancy.\n\n【93】*   Breastfeeding can be done.\n\n【94】**Conclusion:**\n\n【95】Skin conditions during pregnancy are common and are generally self-limiting and benign. Dermatoses of pregnancy are usually associated with abrupt skin eruptions that are inflammatory and pruritic. However, symptoms of dermatoses may appear in some women during pregnancy or postpartum, which can be associated with severe outcomes such as fetal distress, premature birth, or stillbirth. Therefore, proper clinical diagnosis and early management are essential to achieve a better result for both the mother and the fetus.\n\n【96】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【97】无关删除-1:<u>*   Dermatoses of Pregnancy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430864/\n*   DERMATOSES OF PREGNANCY  \n    www.aocd.org/resource/resmgr/meeting\\_resources/OMED17/wiedersum.pdf\n*   Dermatoses of pregnancy  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18454263/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Since the imperfections are present at the time of delivery, it is referred to as a congenital defect or congenital disorder. The result of these conditions is a drastically low oxygen level in the blood. Cyanosis means a bluish discoloration of the skin as well as mucous membranes. In many cases of cyanotic congenital heart disease, there is an absence of cyanosis. Generally, there are additional defects in congenital cyanotic disease other than heart defects. Healthcare professionals use multiple imaging tests in order to confirm the presence of cyanotic congenital heart diseases, such as chest X-rays and echocardiograms. To some extent, medication may aid in relieving symptoms of cyanosis. Ultimately, the majority of infants need to undergo surgery to correct all the defects caused by the disease. The success of the surgery is highly dependent on several factors, such as the following,\n\n【2】*   The severity of the defect.\n\n【3】*   An interruption in the aorta.\n\n【4】*   Abnormalities in the large blood vessels of the cardiovascular system.\n\n【5】What Are the Causes of Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】In standard cases, blood returns from the body and smoothly flows all through the heart and the lungs. This flow is altered in children and adults suffering from cyanotic congenital heart disease leading to less flow of blood to the lungs as well as the heart.

This generally affects the lips, toes, or fingers. Another common clinical manifestation is a great difficulty in breathing. Mentioned below are some of the common signs and symptoms of cyanotic congenital heart disease.\n\n【35】*   Rapid heartbeat.\n\n【36】*   Rapid breathing.\n\n【37】*   Breathing difficulty, becoming very severe with time.\n\n【38】*   Chronic respiratory infections.\n\n【39】*   Hyperventilation.\n\n【40】*   Anxiety.\n\n【41】*   Drastically low oxygen levels.\n\n【42】*   Tiredness.\n\n【43】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【44】*   Difficulty feeding.\n\n【45】*   Slow growth.\n\n【46】*   Chronic respiratory infections.\n\n【47】*   Slow weight gain.\n\n【48】*   Heavy sweating.\n\n【49】*   Low birth weight.\n\n【50】*   Clubbed, or rounded, large fingers.\n\n【51】*   Delayed growth.\n\n【52】*   No cognitive development.\n\n【53】*   Abnormal heart rhythm.\n\n【54】*   Abnormal heart murmurs.\n\n【55】How to Diagnose Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】Early diagnosis is critical in cyanotic congenital heart disease. Cyanosis, rapid heartbeat, abnormal heart sounds, and other clinical manifestations may lead to several complications if not treated.\n\n【57】Mentioned below are some of the diagnostic tools that may help evaluate cyanotic congenital heart disease.\n\n【58】*   Chest X-ray.\n\n【59】*   Electrocardiogram.\n\n【60】*   Ultrasound of the heart.\n\n【61】*   Cardiac catheterization.\n\n【62】How to Treat Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【63】The treatment for cyanotic congenital heart disease depends on the severity and onset of the symptoms and the risks and complications they pose to the patient. In the majority of the cases, surgical intervention in order to correct the present defects in the cardiovascular system is necessary. Such surgeries have proven to be successful to a great extent. Surgical intervention is not delayed in case the deficiency is severe in nature. In other instances, the surgery can be postponed until the child is older. There are occasions when more than one kind of surgery may be required in order to completely correct the defects produced by cyanotic congenital heart disease. Mentioned below are some of the necessary goals of any treatment modality given forward for cyanotic congenital heart disease.\n\n【64】*   Eliminate excessive fluid accumulation from the body.\n\n【65】*   Get the heart pumping and functioning better.\n\n【66】*   Keep all the blood vessels open.\n\n【67】*   Regulate abnormal heart rhythms.\n\n【68】**Conclusion**\n\n【69】Cyanotic congenital heart disease is a disorder that results in bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membrane. It affects both children and adults but is primarily seen in children. The outlook and prognosis of cyanotic congenital heart disease vary because it is dependent on the severity of the underlying defects and clinical manifestation of the disease. It also is based on how quickly the diagnosis and treatment occur. In mild cases of cyanotic congenital heart disease, the individual is able to continue living a normal lifestyle.\n\n【70】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【71】无关删除-1:<u>*   Diagnosis and management of cyanotic congenital heart disease  \n    https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12098-009-0030-4\n*   Congenital heart disease in adults  \n    https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm200002033420507\n*   Pregnancy in cyanotic congenital heart disease  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.cir.89.6.2673\n*   Adults with cyanotic congenital heart disease  \n    https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/0003-4819-109-5-406\n*   Cerebrovascular events in adult patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0735109796001969</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The abnormal cells do not cross beyond the breast lining, hence the name 'in situ,' which means 'in place.' It is not breast cancer, but the abnormal cells within the lobules increase the risk of developing cancer in either of the breasts.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Lobular Carcinoma in Situ?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a benign (non-cancerous) condition. The three different types of this condition include:\n\n【4】1.  **Classic LCIS -** The cells in the lobules are small and uniform in size.\n\n【5】2.  **Pleomorphic LCIS -** The cells are larger and abnormal in size.\n\n【6】3.  **Florid LCIS -** This type refers to a large group of cells with dead cells in the center.\n\n【7】What Are the Causes of Lobular Carcinoma in Situ?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The exact cause of this condition is unknown. It is believed that genetic mutation in the breast cells makes them turn into abnormal cells that remain within the confines of the breast tissue. The individuals who are at risk of developing LCIS include:\n\n【9】*   A familial history of breast cancer.\n\n【10】*   Those above forty years of age.\n\n【11】*   Women who are under any hormone replacement therapy for more than three years after menopause.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Meyerson Nevus - Clinical Presentation, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognosis.</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【13】Women with the factors mentioned above are more prone to develop LCIS. Hence, regular check-ups and imaging studies must be done to prevent such conditions early.\n\n【14】What Are the Symptoms of Lobular Carcinoma in Situ?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】LCIS usually does not cause any symptoms. It is an incidental finding on performing a biopsy to detect any other abnormality in the breast. It is found only on microscopic evaluation of breast tissue. Any signs or changes in the breast must be noticed and checked with the physician as soon as possible. Some signs included under self-examination of the breast are:\n\n【16】*   Visible changes in the shape and size of the breast.\n\n【17】*   Feeling a lump in the breast on touching.\n\n【18】*   Feeling of lump in the armpit.\n\n【19】*   Inverted nipples.\n\n【20】*   Presence of rash on the nipples.\n\n【21】*   Any discharge from the nipples.\n\n【22】*   A thicker skin of the breast.\n\n【23】*   Any discomfort in the breast region that persists for a long time.\n\n【24】The presence of any of these changes does not mean cancer. There might be any abnormality that is benign and can be treated by medications or minor surgery.\n\n【25】How to Diagnose Lobular Carcinoma in Situ?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Diagnosis of LCIS is made only by a biopsy. The mammogram does not show any findings related to this condition. The biopsies that show LCIS include:\n\n【27】*   **Needle Biopsy -** A small portion of the breast tissue is removed using a needle. This tissue sample is sent to the laboratory to detect any presence of abnormal cells in the breast.\n\n【28】*   **Excisional Biopsy -** A larger portion of the breast tissue is removed to rule out breast cancer. It is a minor surgery that is done under general anesthesia or sedation.\n\n【29】How to Treat Lobular Carcinoma in Situ?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【30】The treatment option for the individual depends on the type of LCIS and any other underlying medical illness.\n\n【31】1.  **Observation -** Any signs of changes observed in the breast must be notified to the doctor. Medical examination by a doctor, self-examination, and yearly mammogram (X-ray of the breast) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan is performed regularly to observe any abnormalities in the breast.\n\n【32】2.  **Prevention -** Chemoprevention or chemotherapy (a treatment using drugs to kill cancer cells) reduces the risk of developing cancer.\n\n【33】3.  **Surgery -** Surgical breast removal is the only option when an excisional biopsy does not entirely remove the affected tissues. Surgery is usually a treatment option in a pleomorphic variant of LCIS. After confirming with a biopsy that it is a pleomorphic (varying size and shape of cells) type, surgical removal of the breast tissue is done depending on the extent of abnormalities detected. If only a small portion is affected, then only that part is removed. In rare cases, the whole breast is removed by a procedure called mastectomy as a preventive operation.\n\n【34】The surgeon only decides on the surgical option as a preventive measure when there is any serious underlying illness, strong family history of breast cancer, gene mutation, or any other factor that increases the risk of breast cancer.\n\n【35】How to Prevent the Development of Lobular Carcinoma in Situ?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】There is no exact preventive strategy available for this condition. Certain lifestyle modifications are adopted to reduce the risk of developing cancer. Some ways to lower the risk of breast cancer include:\n\n【37】*   Regular exercising.\n\n【38】*   Having a healthy diet.\n\n【39】*   Weight must be maintained according to the age of the patient.\n\n【40】*   Avoid taking hormone replacement medications as it increases the risk of developing breast cancer. The doctor is consulted if the patient is under hormone replacement therapy, and regular breast screening must be done.\n\n【41】*   The habit of alcohol consumption must be avoided or at least reduced.\n\n【42】*   If the patient has children, they must be breastfed.\n\n【43】*   Find out if there is a family history of breast cancer, as it increases the risk of developing cancer in their children.\n\n【44】*   A regular follow-up with the physician to find any cancer-like abnormalities with screening and imaging studies.\n\n【45】How to Lower the Risk of Breast Cancer in Those With Lobular Carcinoma in Situ?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】Women diagnosed with Lobular Carcinoma in situ have a seven to twelve times increased risk of breast cancer than those without LCIS.\n\n【47】*   Medications are available that can be used to reduce the risk. In premenopausal women, a drug called Tamoxifen is taken for five years to lower the risk. In postmenopausal women, Tamoxifen or Raloxifene is prescribed.\n\n【48】*   Lifestyle changes.\n\n【49】*   Prophylactic (as an indent to prevent a disease) mastectomy (breast removal) prevents cancer spread.\n\n【50】Both these drugs block the action of estrogen, which is responsible for the tumor cells to multiply. But, these medications are effective only against estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. It is not effective against estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer. Hence, the doctor must be consulted for the proper treatment to lower the risk of breast cancer.\n\n【51】**Conclusion:**\n\n【52】Lobular carcinoma in situ is rare but has a high risk of breast cancer. It does not always carry the risk of breast cancer being developed. There are some women with LCIS who have never developed cancer at all. It all depends on how the individual maintains a healthy life, self-examining the breast to look out for changes, and regular follow-ups with the doctor. The doctor must discuss all the risk-reducing options for a perfect life without cancer.\n\n【53】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【54】* * *\n\n【55】#### **1.**删除换行**Is Lobular Carcinoma in Situ Severe?**\n\n【56】Lobular carcinoma in situ is a rare condition in which abnormal cells form in the breast lobule, and not severe as it does not spread beyond the affected lobule. However, it can increase the risk of developing breast cancer later.\n\n【57】#### **2.**删除换行**Does Lobular Carcinoma in Situ Require Surgical Removal?**\n\n【58】Surgery is not recommended in all cases of lobular carcinoma, but in specific cases of pleomorphic type as it increases the risk of developing breast cancer more than other classic types.\n\n【59】#### **3.**删除换行**What Is the Survival Rate of Lobular Carcinoma in Situ?**\n\n【60】Women diagnosed with lobular carcinoma have a 20 % chance of developing breast cancer. For example, out of 100, only 20 have a cancer risk. Hence lobular carcinoma in situ, as such, is not so severe but can be life-threatening if the carcinoma spreads to other parts of the body.\n\n【61】#### **4.**删除换行**Can Lobular Carcinoma in Situ Be Treated With Mastectomy?**\n\n【62】Mastectomy is the surgical removal of breast tissue to reduce the cancer risk. Hence lobular carcinoma in situ can be treated by mastectomy, as it involves the complete removal of the breast tissue but not only the affected part.\n\n【63】#### **5.**删除换行**Which Stage Does Lobular Carcinoma in Situ Belong To?**\n\n【64】Lobular carcinoma in situ is considered pre-cancerous, similar to ductal carcinoma in situ. However, whether it is a pre-cancerous state or a risk factor for breast cancer is still unclear. Therefore, it is included in stage 0, which includes non-invasive cancer.\n\n【65】#### **6.**删除换行**Is Lobular Carcinoma in Situ a Life-Threatening Condition?**\n\n【66】Lobular carcinoma in situ is not life-threatening but increases breast cancer risk. Hence, women with lobular carcinoma in situ must schedule regular checkups and undergo a physical examination of their breasts.\n\n【67】#### **7.**删除换行**Is Lobular Carcinoma in Situ Hereditary?**\n\n【68】Lobular carcinoma in situ occurs in women between 40 and 50 years, usually bilateral (affecting both the breasts) and multicentric (occurring at different centers). Evidence shows that it increases the risk of breast cancer among families.\n\n【69】#### **8.**删除换行**Can Tamoxifen Treat Lobular Carcinoma in Situ?**\n\n【70】Women with lobular carcinoma in situ should take breast cancer risk-lowering drugs. They include Tamoxifen and Raloxifene. They are approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to lower cancer risk in women who do not have breast cancer.\n\n【71】#### **9.**删除换行**How Is Lobular Carcinoma in Situ Treated?**\n\n【72】Lobular carcinoma is not so severe and can be treated by  \n\\- Monitoring regularly.  \n\\- Taking cancer-preventive medications.  \n\\- Surgery.\n\n【73】#### **10.**删除换行**Do Breast Lobules Produce Milk?**\n\n【74】Breasts consist of fatty tissues and milk-producing glands called lobules. These lobules are connected to the nipples through a series of tubes called ducts. Hence breasts produce milk through the lobules.\n\n【75】#### **11.**删除换行**What Is the Classic Type of Lobular Carcinoma in Situ?**\n\n【76】Classic lobular carcinoma in situ is characterized by the monomorphic proliferation of round to oval cells in the lobules. These cells show indistinct cell borders with nuclei at the center of the cells with a smooth nuclear membrane.\n\n【77】#### **12.**删除换行**Is Chemotherapy Recommended for Lobular Carcinoma in Situ?**\n\n【78】Lobular carcinoma in situ is characterized by abnormal cells in the breast lobules and is not considered cancer. Hence it usually does not respond to chemotherapy, and alternative treatment options must be considered.\n\n【79】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【80】无关删除-1:<u>*   Lobular Carcinoma in Situ  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5841603/\n*   Lobular Carcinoma in Situ (LCIS) and Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia  \n    https://www.breastcancer.org/benign-breast-conditions/lobular-carcinoma-in-situ-atypical-lobular-hyperplasia\n*   Breast Cancer Treatment  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-treatment-pdq#section/all</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is often considered an important organ that is responsible for maintaining reproductive and sexual health. The vagina is a muscular passage that is lined with mucus membranes and nerves. The vagina is a significant part of the external genitalia or vulva which helps in experiencing sexual pleasure. Some people may refer vagina as “innie” while others as “outie” based on the external appearance. However, these are not medically accepted terms.\n\n【2】What Are Innie and Outie Vagina?\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】All external genitalia differ in their appearance. The vagina is located inside the body. When people use the terms “innie” and “outie” to refer vagina, they are describing the vulva which is the external portion of the genitalia. The vulva is the outer region of the female genitalia that protects the vagina, sexual organs, and urinary opening. Vulva consists of labia minora, labia majora, and clitoris. Labia majora are the outer or larger lips of the vulva and labia minora are the inner or smaller lips. When labia majora covers the clitoris and labia minora resulting in a hidden labia minora it is known as an “innie” vagina. When the labia minora is visible and larger than the labia majora, it is known as an “outie” vagina.\n\n【4】Are All Innie and Outie Vaginas the Same?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【5】All innie vaginas differ from each other. They can vary in size, color, shape, and length of the labia. Hair Growth and odor can also vary from each other. Labia may be either close or away from the opening.\n\n【6】Outie vaginas also differ from each other like innie vaginas. They differ from one another in length, size, color, and shape of the labia. They may be symmetrical or asymmetrical in appearance. Some outer vaginas may be longer, while others may be wider.\n\n【7】What Is Vagina Composed Of?\n---------------------------\n\n【8】The vagina consists of different types of cells and tissues that secrete fluids to maintain moisture content, elasticity, and health of the vaginal walls. High amounts of estrogen hormone are produced in the body during reproductive years than menopause. As vaginal cells are highly sensitive to estrogen, less estrogen production after menopause can lead to drying and thinning of the vaginal walls.\n\n【9】What Is the Structure of the Vagina?\n------------------------------------\n\n【10】*   **Vaginal Opening:**\n\n【11】The vaginal opening, also known as the vaginal vestibule is the opening into the vagina and is situated between the urethra and the anus. The vaginal opening plays an important role in menstrual blood leaving the body, sexual intercourse, and baby birth.\n\n【12】*   **Vaginal Wall:**\n\n【13】The vaginal wall is covered by a mucous membrane and contains tissue layers with elastic fibers. The surface change insists on extra folds of tissues that help in the expansion of the vagina during sex and childbirth. The tissues present in the vaginal wall undergo changes during the menstrual cycle. The outer layer of the tissues is made up of cells that store glycogen. Bacteria help in breaking down glycogen and maintaining a pH (potential of hydrogen) level to protect the vagina against harmful fungi and bacteria.\n\n【14】*   **Hymen:**\n\n【15】The hymen is a thin membrane that surrounds the vaginal opening. Most hymens are half-moon shaped which provides a smooth pathway for the menstrual blood to leave the vagina. In most people, the hymen may tear during the first intercourse.\n\n【16】Does Having an Innie or Outie Vagina Affect Sexual Function?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Even though external genitalia plays an important role in sexual satisfaction, the size or shape of the labia does not affect sexual function. Generally, having both innie and outie vaginas are normal and does not interfere with sexual functions. However, in some people, having disproportionately larger labia minora may cause certain problems. They are as follows:\n\n【18】*   Increased risk of infection.\n\n【19】*   Difficulty in maintaining hygiene in the labial area.\n\n【20】*   Pain during sports and other vigorous activities.\n\n【21】*   Irritation.\n\n【22】*   A feeling of self-consciousness due to the appearance of a bulge under clothing.\n\n【23】Does the Looks of Labia Matter?\n-------------------------------\n\n【24】Having an outie or innie vagina is completely normal. However, if a woman does not feel confident about the appearance of her genitalia, talking to a doctor who specializes in vaginal health would help her in feeling comfortable and accepting the body as it is. Even though the appearance of the vulva does not need medical attention, women with large labia minora experiencing discomfort or pain during sex or sports activities should undergo treatment.\n\n【25】How to Change the Appearance of Innie and Outie Vaginas?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Women who seek to improve the appearance and function of the labia with age can undergo a surgical procedure called labiaplasty. Labiaplasty or vaginal rejuvenation surgery is a cosmetic procedure that helps in restoring the shape of labia or vaginal lips. In case of minor defects, laser treatment is used for labial reduction.\n\n【27】What Is Labiaplasty?\n--------------------\n\n【28】Labiaplasty is a surgical procedure that involves reducing the labia minora or labia majora (tissue folds that surround the vagina) to improve the appearance of the female genitalia. The procedure is done under general anesthesia or sedation and may take up to two hours. During the procedure, a device called iris scissors is used to remodel the inner folds of the labia. The size of the vaginal lips is reduced by making a “V”-shaped wedge in the labia and removing it. The vaginal lips are then reshaped and reconstructed according to the patient’s esthetic goals followed by closing the incision using dissolvable sutures.\n\n【29】What Are the Indications of Labiaplasty?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【30】Generally, women with the following physical and cosmetic conditions choose to undergo labiaplasty. They are as follows:\n\n【31】*   Asymmetric labial folds.\n\n【32】*   Pain or soreness during exercise or intercourse.\n\n【33】*   Elongated labial tissue.\n\n【34】*   Difficulty in washing the vagina due to stretched or delicate labial tissue.\n\n【35】*   Discomfort for a period after the maladjustment of labial tissue.\n\n【36】What Are the Complications of Labiaplasty?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【37】The potential complications of labiaplasty are as follows:\n\n【38】*   Swelling for the first few days after the procedure.\n\n【39】*   Bleeding.\n\n【40】*   Infection.\n\n【41】*   Scars.\n\n【42】*   Delayed wound healing.\n\n【43】*   Over or under-correction can occur if the surgeon removes too much tissue or does not remove enough tissue.\n\n【44】*   Sometimes additional surgery may be required to rectify unresolved issues.\n\n【45】*   Asymmetry of the vaginal lips.\n\n【46】**Conclusion:**\n\n【47】Both the terms \"innie\" and “outie” vaginas indicate the external look of the vulva. Women who are worried about the appearance of the vulva should familiarize themselves with the various shapes and sizes of the vulva. As the vagina plays an important role in sexual life, pregnancy, and childbirth, undergoing regular pelvic examinations by a healthcare provider is important to ensure vaginal health. Hence women should give priority to vaginal health rather than appearance and should learn to feel comfortable with their bodies.\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【49】无关删除-1:<u>*   Vagina  \n    https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22469-vagina\n*   Indications, Techniques and Complications of Labiaplasty  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4544281/\n*   Have you ever wondered “Is my vagina normal?”  \n    https://www.labialibrary.org.au/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The scientific name for asparagus veggie is Asparagus Officinalis. Asparagus Racemosus, on the other hand, is also known as the Shatavari herb, which is native to the Himalayan region in India and in Australia. Shatavari, also a member of the asparagus family, is equally beneficial as the original form of Asparagus but is used as a root and is an adaptogenic herb. Often the Asparagus vegetable is confused with Shatavari; the latter is the root of Asparagus racemosus and is used as an herb in traditional ayurvedic medicines in a powdered form. Asparagus Officinalis has a plethora of health benefits and is hailed as an excellent source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. It contains several nutrients, including large amounts of vitamin K and folate, that are essential for systemic health. Researchers have linked the consumption of Asparagus with multiple health benefits like pain relief, as a diuretic, cancer prevention, boosting immunity, and in pregnancy, as a rich source of folic acid, etc.\n\n【2】What Are the Nutritional Contents of Asparagus?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Approximately a few stems or even half a cup of cooked asparagus (90g) can provide up to 20 calories and almost 2.2 grams of protein. Asparagus is a great source of vitamins K, A, and zinc. The USDA provides the following nutritional information on asparagus (134 grams or one cup):\n\n【4】*   Energy: 26.8 calories.\n\n【5】*   Protein: 3 g.\n\n【6】*   Vitamin K: 45.5 mcg\n\n【7】*   Calcium: 32.2 mg.\n\n【8】*   Fat: 0.2 g\n\n【9】*   Sodium: 13mg\n\n【10】*   Carbohydrates: 5.2 g (including sugar).\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Health Benefits of Low-FODMAP Diet</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Diet for Adenomyosis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Rhabdomyolysis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Fiber: 2.8g.\n\n【12】*   Sugars: 2.5 g.\n\n【13】*   Iron: 2.9 g.\n\n【14】*   Magnesium: 18.8 mg.\n\n【15】*   Phosphorus: 69.7 mg.\n\n【16】*   Potassium: 271 mg.\n\n【17】*   Zinc: 0.7 mg.\n\n【18】*   Manganese: 0.2 mg.\n\n【19】*   Choline: 21.4 mg.\n\n【20】*   Selenium: 3.0 mcg.\n\n【21】*   Vitamin C: 7.5 mg.\n\n【22】*   Folate: 69.7 mcg.\n\n【23】*   Vitamin E: 1.5 mg.\n\n【24】*   Vitamin K: 5.7 mcg.\n\n【25】*   Vitamin A: 50.9 mcg.\n    </u>\n\n【26】What Is the Recommended Daily Intake of Asparagus?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Asparagus is commonly recommended by nutritionists in most low-carb or ketogenic diets. This is because only a small portion of the carbohydrate is derived from simple carbs, so asparagus has very little impact on blood sugar. With a low glycemic index (GI) of less than 15 and only trace amounts of polyunsaturated fats, asparagus benefits overall systemic health. These essential fatty acids are responsible for brain functions and cell maintenance, and growth. Popular asparagus preparations, like butter-braised asparagus or Hollandaise sauce, may contain both fats and calories. Hence it is better to consume asparagus as a direct vegetable. If used by sauces or toppings, one can drizzle a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil over the asparagus to add flavor and incorporate healthy fats. Based on a 2,000-calorie diet, vitamin content breakdown from a single serving of asparagus is as enlisted below:\n\n【28】*   Riboflavin (vitamin B2): up to 11 % of the RDI (reference daily intake).\n\n【29】*   Thiamine (vitamin B1): up to 13 % of the RDI.\n\n【30】*   Vitamin K: present up to 51 % of the RDI.\n\n【31】*   Folate (vitamin B9): up to 34 % of the RDI.\n\n【32】What Are the Systemic Health Benefits of Asparagus?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】The systemic benefits of asparagus are as follows:\n\n【34】**Excellent Source of Vitamins A and C:** These vitamins are abundantly present in asparagus and are powerful antioxidants that can eliminate free radicals circulating within the blood, enhancing the immune system.\n\n【35】**Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease And Blood Pressure:** Research indicates that asparagus reduces harm to the circulatory system by reducing the risk of hardening of the arteries or atherosclerosis. Artherosclerosis is currently one of the leading causes of developing cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【36】**Anthocyanins:** Anthocyanins present in purple asparagus contain potent antioxidants that add richness to their vibrant color and have known cardioprotective properties.\n\n【37】**Diuretic:** Asparagus is known to exert diuretic properties to lower blood pressure. This is possible by promoting the excretion of excess fluids from the body.\n\n【38】**Pregnancy:** Most obstetricians and gynecologists recommend that pregnant women should consume at least 600 micrograms of folate daily. Folic acid is an essential prenatal vitamin given in the dynamic phase of pregnancy in order to promote healthy fetal growth and also reduce the risk of neural tube defects like spina bifida. Asparagus is a rich source of folate.\n\n【39】**Digestion:** Asparagus is a key source of inulin. It contains a type of fiber that promotes healthy gut bacteria. The insulin release inhibits bacterial endotoxins called polysaccharides. Hence it is an extremely good prophylactic food against polysaccharide-related diseases like Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, and Helicobacter pylori infections.\n\n【40】What Are the Possible Allergies With Asparagus?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Individuals who are averse to trithiane-5-carboxylic acids may suffer from potential allergy with asparagus consumption. These components are found in higher concentrations, especially in the stalks. People who pick or eat the slender, early-season stalks would be prone to contact dermatitis.\n\n【42】What Are the Types, Usage, And Storage Methods of Asparagus?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】White and green asparagus are two common varieties available, out of which the white variety tends to be thicker than the tender green variety. White asparagus has a nutty flavor and is less stringy in consistency than the green variety. However, both forms are equally nutrient-dense. Thicker, late-season stalks should be peeled, and the woody stem ends snapped from the asparagus before cooking, washing, or consuming. It is better to seal or put the asparagus bundle in a rubber band to extend its shelf life. The stalks should not be washed until the time it is to be cooked. When selecting fresh asparagus, a stalk with tightly closed buds, which are firm and rich colored, should be chosen. The matured stalks are plump and usually straight. It is better to avoid asparagus available in the market in mushy, blemished, dull-colored, or limp states as they can possibly be contaminated or spoilt.\n\n【44】Asparagus can also be purchased either in frozen or canned forms. Frozen vegetables retain the same nutrients as fresh varieties. If canned asparagus is purchased, then it is always better to rinse the canned stalks to wash off the excess sodium that is commonly used as a preservative. Asparagus can be steamed, boiled or stir-fried, or grilled for meals. It needs to be thinly sliced when it is to be eaten raw in salad preparations.\n\n【45】**Conclusion**\n\n【46】Asparagus Officinalis is a vegetable that is a rich source of dietary fiber, vitamins, folate, and a regular intake of this vegetable can be helpful in boosting the immune system.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is performed on saliva or blood, while in pregnant women, it is done on amniotic fluid. Early detection of disease can reduce the risk of any cancer possibilities. Genetic screening provides information about any abnormalities during pregnancy.\n\n【2】What Is Genetic Screening?\n--------------------------\n\n【3】The medical process of testing a person for the existence of any genetic disease is called genetic screening. This voluntary process which is a part of genetic consultation assesses the changes in the following:\n\n【4】**a) Chromosomes -** Analysis of genetic changes in the whole chromosome or a part of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or the presence of an extra copy of chromosomes.\n\n【5】**b) Genes -** Analysis of variation in DNA sequences that might increase the risk of developing a genetic disorder. The scope of gene tests varies from detecting changes in a single nucleotide to the entire genome.\n\n【6】**c) Proteins -** Any abnormality in the amount or activity level of biochemical proteins or enzymes suggests changes to the DNA.\n\n【7】When Is Genetic Screening Recommended?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【8】Although some genetic disorders are not hereditary and thus cannot be identified by screening of parents, genetic screening is particularly recommended when:\n\n【9】*   One or both partners have a genetic abnormality.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What Is Genetics?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Will IVF help in avoiding chromosomal abnormality in future pregnancy?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Genetic Testing During Pregnancy</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Family members with a genetic abnormality.\n\n【11】*   Partners who belong to a high-risk group.\n    </u>\n\n【12】How Is Genetic Testing Done?\n----------------------------\n\n【13】The test is usually requested by a person’s doctor or genetic counselor. Before the tests, the individual is informed thoroughly about the benefits, limitations, and possible consequences of the test, known as informed consent. The tests are done on samples from hair, skin, amniotic fluid, blood, and other tissues like the inner surface of the cheek (buccal smear). The sample is then sent to a laboratory where depending on the suspected disorder, the technician looks for specific changes in chromosomes, DNA, or proteins. Screening tests for newborns are usually done using a small blood sample from the baby’s feet. The direct-to-consumer testing option is also available for people who do not need to go to a healthcare provider to obtain a test and, therefore, can directly contact the testing company.\n\n【14】What Are the Various Types of Genetic Tests?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Depending on what condition is suspected in a person, the healthcare provider or genetic counselor selects the appropriate test. If a diagnosis is non-conclusive, a test that looks at multiple genes or chromosomes may be used. However, if a specific condition is suspected, a more focused test is usually preferred.\n\n【16】**1\\. Molecular Tests:** Assess changes in one or more genes. They determine the order of nucleotides in one's genetic code, known as DNA sequencing. Types of molecular tests are:\n\n【17】*   **Targeted Single Variant -** Identifies a specific variant in one gene known to cause the disorder. Example testing for HBB (hemoglobin subunit beta) gene for sickle cell anemia.\n\n【18】*   **Single Gene Test -** Identify mutational changes in one gene. They are helpful in ruling out a diagnosis when there are multiple variants in the suspected gene.\n\n【19】*   **Gene Panel -** Identify variants in more than one gene. Often useful to delineate a diagnosis when the symptoms fit a wide array of conditions. For example, epilepsy has multiple genetic causes.\n\n【20】*   **Whole Exome Sequencing -** They analyze a significant amount of a person’s DNA to find the genetic variation. Usually done when single gene tests provide inconclusive results.\n\n【21】**2\\. Chromosomal Tests:** They analyze whole chromosomes or DNA to identify large-scale changes, like an extra or a missing copy of a chromosome. For example, William’s syndrome is caused by the deletion of a section of chromosome 7.\n\n【22】**3\\. Gene Expression Tests:** Identifies which genes are expressed or active in different types of cells. They study the mRNA (messenger RNA (ribonucleic acid)) in cells. Overexpression or underexpression of a certain gene may be responsible for various types of cancer.\n\n【23】**4\\. Biochemical Tests:** These tests study the quantity as well as the quality of proteins as well as enzymes that are transcribed and translated by the genes.\n\n【24】What Are the Diseases Which Can Be Detected by Genetic Screening?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】The diseases which are detected by genetic screening are as follows:\n\n【26】*   **Obesity:** It is one of the most common conditions or diseases in people with a basal metabolic index (BMI) higher or equal to 30 who are characterized as obese.\n\n【27】*   **Bipolar Disease:** It is a disorder associated with multiple mood variations and severe mental illness. It is one of the common hereditary diseases.\n\n【28】*   **Breast and Ovarian Cancer:** It is associated with uncontrolled growth of cells in the breast. Women are 15 to 40 times at risk of developing ovarian cancer due to hereditary issues.\n\n【29】*   **Vision Loss:** Age-related vision disorder after the age of 60 years. The brain stops transmitting clear images to the brain in loss of vision. About 30% of people are diagnosed with vision loss as a result of hereditary reasons.\n\n【30】*   **Psoriasis:** It is symptomized with scaly and red lesions that appear on any part of the body and causes skin inflammation and irritation.\n\n【31】*   **Dyslexia:** Dyslexia is difficulty in reading faced by an individual and is a neurological condition. Its prevalence has been seen since early childhood.\n\n【32】*   **Parkinson's Disease:** It is a neurological disease caused by reduced brain cells that produces dopamine. The symptoms include shaking the face, hands, legs, and jaw, inability to form a firm grip, and dropping things.\n\n【33】*   **Down’s Syndrome:** It is a disorder that causes distinctive physical features, intellectual disabilities, and various other problems. It is a chromosomal disorder that can be detected by genetic screening.\n\n【34】*   **Huntington's Disease:** It is a disorder that affects the brain and usually occurs between the age group of 30 and 50 years.\n\n【35】*   **Cystic Fibrosis:** It is an inherited disease that causes thick and sticky mucosa that builds up in the organs, including the pancreas and lungs.\n\n【36】*   **Sickle Cell Anemia:** It is a disorder that affects red blood cells and is often found in Americans, Hispanics, and Africans. Genetic screening is the best option to detect sickle cell anemia.\n\n【37】*   **Phenylketonuria:** It is a disorder in which levels of phenylalanine level build up in the blood. If left untreated can cause brain damage and heart attack.\n\n【38】**Conclusion:**\n\n【39】Genetic screening benefits high-risk individuals with prevention and early treatment. Advancements in the field of genetics have made it possible to detect numerous genetic conditions. A balanced and informed approach to the development of genetic policies and regularizations must be followed to promote greater equality and support vulnerable groups susceptible to various hereditary diseases.\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>*   Genetic screening  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2860823/\n*   Genetic Testing  \n    https://patient.info/treatment-medication/genetic-testing\n*   Genomic newborn screening: current concerns and challenges  \n    https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)01513-1/fulltext</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

They are caused by the collection of melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) in the skin. They are usually light brown in color and can darken on sun exposure. The lesions typically have irregular borders, and the size and number can vary. They are usually the early signs of neurofibromatosis (a genetic disorder that results in benign growth in nerve tissues). Café au lait macules are very light in infants and can be challenging to diagnose. These lesions grow larger and become noticeable after two years of age.\n\n【2】These macules are harmless in some, but in most, it indicates an underlying genetic disorder. Almost 95% of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients have café au lait spots, but they can also be seen in patients without NF1. Café au lait macules also occur in Coffin-Siris syndrome, McCune-Albright syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and tuberous sclerosis. These macules do not undergo malignant change. They are benign and do not cause mortality or morbidity, but the associated syndromes might cause severe complications.\n\n【3】What Causes Café Au Lait Spots?\n-------------------------------\n\n【4】An increase in melanin production and the presence of giant melanosomes results in café au lait spots. The density of melanocytes in the café au lait spots is more in patients with NF1 than patients with isolated lesions without NF1.\n\n【5】These spots or macules are associated with the following genetic syndromes:\n\n【6】1.  **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) -** Almost 50% of people with NF1 inherit a mutated gene on chromosome 17. This gene codes for neurofibromin, which suppresses tumors.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Is it possible to have white spots even after I finished the antibiotics?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What is the chance of multiple sclerosis in pars planitis?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Should I be worried for the red spots on my chest?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n2.  **Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) -** Similar to NF1, genetic mutations of the NF2 gene can also occur. This gene codes for Merlin protein (the function is still unknown).\n\n【8】3.  **Legius Syndrome -** A syndrome caused by the mutation of the SPRED gene, which results in problems in the way cells of the body communicate.\n\n【9】4.  **McCune-Albright Syndrome -** It is a syndrome caused by the mutation of Gs protein, which affects the skin, bones, and several endocrine tissues.\n\n【10】5.  N**oonan Syndrome With Multiple Lentigines -** Also known as LEOPARD syndrome, is caused by mutation of the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12.\n    </u>\n\n【11】The other rarer syndromes linked to café au lait spots include Watson syndrome, Bloom syndrome, and Silver-Russell syndrome.\n\n【12】How Does a Café Au Lait Spot Look Like?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【13】Café au lait spots are light brown in color, and the pigment is evenly distributed. These spots have well-demarcated borders, which are mostly irregular but can also be smooth. They can be oval or round.\n\n【14】The characteristics of café au lait spots can also help identify the underlying syndrome. For example:\n\n【15】1.  **NF1 -** Six or more café au lait spots present in the trunk or extremities, the diameter of which should be greater than 5 mm in children and more than 15 mm in adults. Small café au lait spots in the axillary or inguinal regions.\n\n【16】2.  **NF2 -** The main symptom includes unilateral or bilateral vestibular schwannoma. The primary skin lesion seen in NF2 is a firm subcutaneous neurilemmoma, and café au lait spots are less common.\n\n【17】3.  **Legius Syndrome -** People with this syndrome have multiple café au lait spots, which measure more than 5 mm (children) and more than 15 mm (adults).\n\n【18】4.  **McCune-Albright syndrome -** Café au lait spots seen with this syndrome are less than in NF1, and the borders are more irregular. These spots are usually found in the midline of the body.\n\n【19】5.  **Noonan Syndrome With Multiple Lentigines -** Multiple brown macules with well-demarcated borders measuring less than 5 mm are seen on the skin. They usually appear at birth and increase in number until puberty. These patients also develop café au lait spots.\n\n【20】When to Consult a Doctor for Café Au Lait Spots?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】In case you notice light brown color skin patches, make an appointment with your doctor to confirm if the spots are café au lait spots or some other pigmented lesion.\n\n【22】How Are Café Au Lait Spots Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【23】There are no specific tests available to diagnose café au lait spots. Your doctor can diagnose the condition based on the appearance of these patches and physical examination.\n\n【24】The doctor might not suggest any additional tests if you have one to three patches. But, if the spots are more than six (at least one measures 1 cm) and you have freckles in the groin and under the arms, the doctor might suspect neurofibromatosis or other genetic syndromes and will suggest getting genetic testing done. In case you test positive for a genetic disorder, further testing might be needed (X-ray, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), ear examination, eye tests, etc.) to rule out other complications of the syndrome.\n\n【25】What Are the Treatment Options for Café Au Lait Spots?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Treatment is usually not required for café au lait spots as they are benign and harmless. You can make these spots less noticeable by getting laser treatment using a pulsed-dye laser, Er: YAG (erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser) laser, Q-switched Nd: YAG laser (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet), etc. But, they can recur even after treatment.\n\n【27】If you have been diagnosed with neurofibromatosis or any other genetic syndromes, there is no cure. The doctor will suggest various treatment options based on the complications and symptoms you develop. And benign or malignant tumors due to any syndrome might need surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.\n\n【28】**Conclusion:**\n\n【29】Café au lait spots are generally present at birth, permanent, and can increase in number or grow in size over time. These spots are benign and do not cause any complications. But, the associated syndromes can result in severe complications, including malignant tumors. So, never ignore these spots, more importantly, if you have multiple patches on your body. They do not need treatment, but if you decide to get them removed, consult a dermatologist online now.\n\n【30】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>*   Cafe Au Lait Spots  \n    https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/911900-overview\n*   Multiple café-au-lait spots  \n    https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3967/multiple-cafe-au-lait-spots</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "e86a49f3-a8e0-496a-9680-f5de8e009b38", "title": "Diabetic Foot Limb Salvage: Risk Factors, Diagnosis and Treatment", "text": "【0】Diabetic Foot Limb Salvage: Risk Factors, Diagnosis and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Diabetes is a chronic condition caused by either insufficient insulin production by the pancreas or inefficient insulin use by the body. A hormone called insulin controls blood sugar levels. Diabetes patients frequently have foot issues. When the nerves and blood arteries in the foot get damaged by high blood sugar levels, different diabetic pedal conditions may eventually take place. Diabetic neuropathy, the term for nerve damage, can make the feet numb, tingly, or painful. Moreover, diabetic patients have a multitude of problems such as microvascular angiopathy, poor metabolic control, neuropathy, and nephropathy leading to chronic bacterial colonization, ischaemic wounds, osteomyelitis with recurrent cellulitis (bacterial skin infection), and bony deformity.\n\n【2】The complications of diabetes, including peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease, particularly on the legs and feet, make it harder for people to heal cuts and sores. If the sores or ulcers don't heal after considering other non-surgical therapies, they may become infected and spread to the nearby skin and underlying bone in chronic situations. Diabetic foot limb salvage refers to a medical procedure in which doctors try to prevent amputation due to a diabetic foot while maintaining limb function and stability. As a result, patients can avoid infection, maintain limb function, and reduce potential consequences.\n\n【3】What Is Diabetic Foot?\n----------------------\n\n【4】Diabetes can cause a wide range of typical foot issues. Diabetic neuropathy, which can cause tingling, discomfort, and a loss of feeling in the feet, is the most prevalent pathological condition that diabetics experience. Diabetes patients may lose sensation in their feet, making it difficult for them to detect a stone in their sock or a blister on their foot, which can result in cuts and sores. If not treated properly, cuts and sores may ultimately become infected. Diabetes can also reduce the quantity of blood flow to the feet, which can hinder the healing of a sore or an infection. Gangrene (death of tissue due to lack of blood flow) can sometimes result from a severe infection that never settles. A toe, foot, or portion of the leg may need to be amputated if gangrene or foot ulcers are not healed after therapy. An amputation may be done by a surgeon to preserve life and stop a serious infection from spreading to the rest of the body. To avoid gangrene and dangerous infections, it's crucial to take good care of the feet.\n\n【5】Diabetes can cause nerve injury, which is uncommon but can result in foot alterations like Charcot's foot. An initial sign of Charcot's foot may be redness, warmth, and swelling. Later, the bones in the feet and toes may move or fracture, giving the feet a strange form like a rocker's bottom.\n\n【6】As a result, a diabetic foot is a side effect of chronic hyperglycemia (long-term increases in blood glucose levels). It may be asymptomatic or result in severely ischemic (tissue death due to lack of oxygen) limbs that require amputation. Inflammation, deformity, neuropathy (damage to the nerves outside of the spinal cord), and external trauma are all risk factors for the development of diabetic foot ulcers. Additionally, if the patient has additional illnesses, such as hypertension or chronic renal disease, the chances are greatly raised. There may always be an effect on the patient's quality of life. It may be asymptomatic or result in severely ischemic limbs that require amputation.\n\n【7】What Is Diabetic Foot Limb Salvage?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【8】The best way to treat a foot ulcer depends on the wound. The majority of the time, the goal of the treatment is to clear away any dead tissue or debris, maintain the area clean, and promote healing. At least once every one to four weeks, wounds should be examined. The only option for therapy may be an amputation if the ulcer results in significant tissue loss or a life-threatening infection. A surgeon will carefully remove the injured tissue while preserving as much of the healthy tissue as they can. People affected need to stay in the hospital for a few days following surgery. The wound may require four to six weeks to heal completely. However, diabetic foot limb salvage is a technique that involves removing the dead tissue, covering the debrided area with flaps, and repairing the fractured bone with metal implants, synthetic bone grafts, or a combination of metal and bone transplants. Diabetic foot limb salvage is seen to be the greatest option for a patient who faces the possibility of having an amputation.\n\n【9】What Are the Risk Factors for Diabetic Foot Limb Amputation?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The risk factors of having a diabetic foot limb amputation are:\n\n【11】*   Peripheral sensory neuropathy.\n\n【12】*   Peripheral vascular diseases.\n\n【13】*   Chronic non-healing foot ulcers.\n\n【14】*   People who had undergone amputation.\n\n【15】*   Diabetic patients who are dependent on insulin.\n\n【16】When Is a Diabetic Foot Limb Salvage Needed?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【17】If patients with chronic, persistent, and non-healing foot ulcers and infections satisfy one condition as below, who must have their feet amputated to avoid further problems can still choose to have their limbs saved. Having loss of soft tissue and bone with preserved sensitivity.\n\n【18】How Can Diabetic Foot Limb Salvage Be Planned?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【19】To diagnose diabetic foot and assess the severity of the condition, the following imaging techniques can be used:\n\n【20】*   **X-ray -** To determine the health of the bone in the affected region.\n\n【21】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** **\\-** To evaluate the soft tissues.\n\n【22】*   **Ultrasound -** To determine the brachial pressure.\n\n【23】*   **Computed Tomography (CT)- Angiogram -** To evaluate the blood vessels and their texture and whether it is constricted or narrowed.\n\n【24】How Is Diabetic Foot Limb Salvage Done?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【25】Surgery to remove an infected bony and soft tissue in a limb (arm or leg) without removing the whole limb. The bone and tissue around the infected site may also be removed, and an implant may be used to replace the part of the limb removed.

When one fallopian tube is absent, the attached ovary is also missing. When both tubes are absent, the ovaries on either side of the female reproductive system are also not developed. Fallopian tubes are also called uterine tubes or oviducts. The tubes are about 3.9 inches long and lined with ciliated epithelia. There are issues with fertility in women who have fallopian tube agenesis.\n\n【2】What Are the Parts of the Fallopian Tube?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】The fallopian tube consists of four parts, and they are as follows:\n\n【4】*   **Infundibulum:**\n\n【5】The infundibulum part is found in the ovarian end. This is a funnel-shaped opening. There are finger-like projections called fimbria.\n\n【6】*   **Ampulla:**\n\n【7】The ampulla is the widest section of the fallopian tube. The fertilization of the egg and the sperm occurs in this part.\n\n【8】*   **Isthmus:**\n\n【9】The isthmus is a narrow part of the fallopian tube. The isthmus connects the ampulla to the uterine cavity.\n\n【10】*   **Intramural Portion:**\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Menstrual Disorders in Adolescent Girls</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Can spillage of dye from fallopian tubes during laparoscopy and dye test indicate female infertility?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Can right fallopian tube blockage cause delayed pregnancy?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【12】The intramural portion is the continuation of the fallopian tube through the uterine wall.\n\n【13】There are three layers of the fallopian tubes:\n\n【14】*   **Mucosa:**\n\n【15】The mucosa is highly folded. The mucosa consists of ciliated columnar epithelium and secretory cells.\n\n【16】*   **Muscularis Externa:**\n\n【17】The muscularis externa consists of inner circular and outer longitudinal smooth muscle.\n\n【18】*   **Serosa:**\n\n【19】The serosa consists of loose connective tissue.\n\n【20】What Role Do Fallopian Tubes Play in the Female Reproductive System?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The fallopian tubes play a significant role in conception and pregnancy.\n\n【22】*   **Holds a Place for the Released Egg:** One of the ovaries discharges an egg every month as a part of the menstrual cycle. Fimbria is finger-like projections near the ovarian end. They sweep the released egg from the ovary into the fallopian tube.\n\n【23】*   **The Site for Fertilization:** When the male ejaculates sperm during intercourse, the sperm moves through the vagina, cervix, uterus, and then to the fallopian tubes. Fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube after the fusion of the egg and sperm.\n\n【24】*   Plays the role of transporting the fertilized egg to the uterus. The uterus (womb) is where the fertilized egg develops into the fetus. The fetus grows in the uterus during gestation and increases in size.\n\n【25】What Are the Causes of Non-functioning Fallopian Tubes?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】*   **A Congenital Birth Defect** - The absence of one or two fallopian tubes is one of the reasons for fallopian tube agenesis.\n\n【27】*   A prior history of infections that led to damage or scarring of the fallopian tube.\n\n【28】*   A medical condition is a reason for the removal of fallopian tubes.\n\n【29】*   **Ectopic Pregnancy:** Ectopic pregnancy means the fertilized egg implants on the outer surface of the uterus (womb), which results in permanent tube damage or removal.\n\n【30】*   **Endometriosis:** Endometriosis means the cells similar to those which line the uterus develop on the outer side of the uterus, The fallopian tubes, and ovaries; on these surfaces, the cells grow, causing pelvic pain and scarring of the fallopian tube.\n\n【31】*   **Fibroids:** Fibroid tumors block the fallopian tubes and also the entrance to the uterus.\n\n【32】*   The history of abdominal or pelvic surgery that causes scarring or damage to the fallopian tube,\n\n【33】*   **Hydrosalpinx:** Hydrosalpinx means the fallopian tubes are blocked due to the accumulation of fluids. The fluid deposition is due to infection or injury to the tubes. The chances of getting pregnant are difficult in such cases.\n\n【34】*   **Paratubal Cysts:** The fluid-filled masses develop near the fallopian tubes and ovaries. They are noncancerous. They degenerate without any treatment.\n\n【35】*   **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease:** Pelvic inflammatory disease means they cause inflammation of the fallopian tubes because of infection. The pelvic inflammatory disease leads to infertility if not treated.\n\n【36】What Are the Diagnostic Tests to Check the Health of Fallopian Tubes?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】*   **Hysterosalpingography:** This is most commonly done to check fallopian tube abnormalities. This X-ray dye test is used to detect the problems. During an HSG, an X-ray captures images of the uterine chamber and fallopian tubes while they are filled with a specific dye. The test is done seven days after the periods stop and before the ovulation (discharge of an egg from the ovary). This test does not require anesthesia.\n\n【38】In most cases, it gives false positive results of blockage of the fallopian tubes. Detects the structural disorders and reason for the blockage. The fertility in young women appears to be slightly improved if the results are normal. The procedure widens the tubes and also clears the fallopian tube of mucus and debris. There is an observation period after this test.\n\n【39】*   **Sonohysterography:** Sonohysterography is used to detect problems within the fallopian tubes. A saline solution is injected into the interior of the uterus through the cervix during the ultrasonography, so the interiors are distended, and the abnormalities can be visualized easily. They are not blocked if the solution flows freely into the fallopian tubes.\n\n【40】This procedure is quick, and there is no need for anesthesia. This procedure is safer than hysterosalpingography because it does not require radiation or injection of a contrast agent. The accuracy of the sonohysterography depends on the skill of the clinicians who performs this test.\n\n【41】*   **Laparoscopy:** In this procedure, a tube with a camera laparoscope is inserted into the pelvic cavity through a small incision below the navel. General anesthesia is used. The laparoscopy lets clinicians directly view the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.\n\n【42】*   **Hysteroscopy:** A hysteroscope is placed through the vagina and cervix into the uterus. If polyps or fibroids are in the uterus, they are removed with the help of a hysteroscope.\n\n【43】Will the Menstrual Periods Occur in Fallopian Tube Agenesis Cases?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】The menstrual cycle does not have any effect on the condition of the fallopian tubes. The periods depend on the hormones and ovulation (egg discharge from an ovary).\n\n【45】Is There a Chance of Pregnancy in Fallopian Tube Agenesis Cases?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】There are chances of conceiving in the absence of one fallopian tube. But if both the fallopian tubes are absent, the chances of getting pregnant are less.\n\n【47】What Is the Treatment for Fallopian Tube Agenesis?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】*   Unblocking a blocked or scarred fallopian tube through surgery.\n\n【49】*   Using fertility medications if ovulating through one tube. This increases the number of eggs released by the ovary (the ovulation process).\n\n【50】**Conclusion:**\n\n【51】Fallopian tube agenesis can cause infertility in women when both the fallopian tubes are absent. Hence proper diagnosis and early treatment can reduce complications. In instances of fallopian tube agenesis, early detection, and urgent medical intervention are required. These malformations are rare and are occasionally seen clinically, and some complications, such as ectopic pregnancy, can lead to death if not diagnosed. There are plenty of different types of fallopian tube abnormalities, considering their rarity.\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>*   Unilateral ovarian and fallopian tube agenesis in an infertile patient with a normal uterus  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4113523/\n*   Incidental Finding of Unilateral Ovarian and Fallopian Tube Agenesis During Cesarean Delivery in Patient With Recurrent Pregnancy Loss  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7888686/\n*   Ovarian agenesis  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ovarian-agenesis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

If the urine is abnormally colored, it might have red, blue, brown, green, or orange tints. Abnormalities in urine color might be noticed for various reasons. Sometimes medications and pigments present in certain food change the urine color. For example, if a person stays dehydrated for prolonged periods, his urine might turn amber or brown-colored. However, it is difficult for the patient to decide the exact cause of the change in urine color. Therefore, he must consult the doctor the earliest to know about the underlying medical condition responsible for the change in urine color. Beet, fava beans, berries, over-the-counter, and prescription drugs are some components that make the urine color abnormal.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Abnormal Urine Color?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Due to medications, foods, and dyes, discolored urine or abnormalities in the urine color might be observed. Sometimes, the change in the urine color is harmless, whereas, in other situations, it might be due to some medical condition. The causes of abnormal urine colors according to the color changes are described below:\n\n【4】*   **Dark Yellow Urine -** The urine might appear darker than normal if the person is dehydrated. When the patient does not drink sufficient water, the compounds in the urine become more concentrated, making the urine dark. Sometimes, the presence of large quantities of vitamin B in the urine might change its color.\n\n【5】*   **Red or Pink Colored Urine -** The urine might appear red or pink due to the following reasons:\n\n【6】    *   **Foods -** The urine appears pink if the patient consumes fruits having deep pink or magenta pigment.

This dye is specifically used in candies and some medicines. The dyes used in kidney or bladder tests can change urine color.\n\n【40】    *   **Medications -** The medications that make the urine blue or green are listed below:\n\n【41】        *   Cimetidine.\n\n【42】        *   Amitriptyline.\n\n【43】        *   Indomethacin.\n\n【44】        *   Promethazine.\n\n【45】        *   Vitamin B supplements.\n\n【46】    *   **Medical Conditions -** The following medical conditions make the urine blue or green:\n\n【47】        *   Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial infection (it is caused by a type of bacteria that can cause infections in the lungs, blood, and other body parts).\n\n【48】        *   Familial benign hypercalcemia (it is an inherited medical condition wherein the patient has high calcium levels in the blood).\n\n【49】*   **Dark Brown or Cola-Colored Urine -** Dark brown urine might result from the following:\n\n【50】    *   **Medications -** The following medications change the urine color to dark brown:\n\n【51】        *   Metronidazole.\n\n【52】        *   Nitrofurantoin.\n\n【53】        *   Chloroquine.\n\n【54】        *   Methocarbamol.\n\n【55】        *   Senna-based laxatives.\n\n【56】    *   **Foods -** People consuming foods rich in rhubarb, aloe, or fava beans can change urine color.\n\n【57】    *   **Medical Conditions -** The medical condition named porphyria can cause an accumulation of natural chemicals in the bloodstream, making the urine rusty or brown. Dark brown urine might also be seen due to liver diseases or the entry of bile pigments into the urine.\n\n【58】    *   **Exercises -** Sometimes, running and other intense physical activities might change the urine color, known as exertional hematuria. However, this is not considered an abnormality because the condition resolves after the patient takes rest for a few hours. If the condition does not resolve within 48 hours, the patient must consult the doctor.\n\n【59】*   **Cloudy or Murky Urine -** Cloudy urine is usually a sign of urinary tract infection. It can also be one of the symptoms of chronic or long-standing kidney disease. Some studies suggest that cloudy urine is a sign of dehydration. If a female is pregnant and has cloudy urine, it might be a sign of preeclampsia which is a life-threatening condition. The condition is pneumaturia if the cloudy urine is accompanied by foam or bubbles. It could be one of the symptoms of diverticulitis or Chron’s disease.\n    </u>\n\n【60】How Will the Doctor Diagnose the Cause of the Change in Urine Color?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】It is challenging to diagnose the exact cause of abnormal urine color because several medical conditions are responsible for it. However, the diagnostic methods are listed below:\n\n【62】1.  **Medical History -** It is a simple procedure in which the doctor communicates with the patient to know about his general health, the symptoms, the duration of onset and progression, and if he experienced pain.\n\n【63】2.  **Urinalysis -** It is a simple procedure in which the patient collects urine in a container and sends the urine sample to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. If the urine shows high levels of proteins and minerals, the urologic disease can be suspected.\n\n【64】3.  **Blood Test -** The doctor might recommend the patient undergo a blood test to detect the levels of waste products in the blood. People having abnormal urine color usually show high levels of creatinine.\n\n【65】4.  **Ultrasound -** It is an imaging procedure in which the doctor moves a device known as the transducer over the patient’s abdomen. The transducer sends sound waves into the body tissues to obtain images of the kidneys and other body organs. This test helps to detect the abnormalities that might have changed the urine color.\n\n【66】5.  **Cystoscopy -** Cystoscopy allows the doctor to view the urinary tract organs with the help of a special camera known as the cystoscope. In this procedure, a tube known as a cystoscope is inserted to examine the walls of the bladder and urethra.\n\n【67】When Should the Patient Consult the Doctor?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【68】If the patient’s urine develops abnormal color, not due to exercise, the food he has eaten, or dehydration, he must immediately consult his doctor. Sometimes, the causes of changes in urine color are harmless, whereas some changes might occur due to serious illnesses that require medical attention at the earliest. The doctor will help identify the causes of the problems and diagnose the condition at the earliest. For example, if the patient presents with blood in the urine, the doctor might suspect a urinary tract infection or kidney stones and start the antibiotics immediately.\n\n【69】**Conclusion**:\n\n【70】Abnormalities in the urine color might be seen due to several reasons and underlying medical conditions. The patient must not get worried if the urine color changes due to strenuous exercises or eating food that contains dyes and pigments. However, if the change in urine color is due to some urologic conditions or congenital diseases, the patient must immediately consult the doctor.\n\n【71】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【72】* * *\n\n【73】#### **1.**删除换行**When Should One Get Worried About the Urine Color?**\n\n【74】Amber color urine is produced in severe dehydration. However, one should get worried about the color of the urine when it is cloudy, brown, blue, or green and has not returned to a pale straw color. \n\n【75】#### **2.**删除换行**What Were the Signs Seen in Abnormal Urine?**\n\n【76】Normal urine color ranges from pale yellow to deep gold. Urine that is abnormally colored may have colors such as,  \n\\- Red.   \n\\- Orange.   \n\\- Green.  \n\\- Blue.  \n\\- Brown. \n\n【77】#### **3.**删除换行**What Is the Color of Healthy Urine?**\n\n【78】The color of healthy urine is pale yellow. The dark yellow or orange color is a sign of becoming dehydrated. Orange color urine may indicate a severe form of liver disorder. The dark brown color may be caused by medication or food.\n\n【79】#### **4.**删除换行**What Is the Urine Color When It Has More Sugar Content?**\n\n【80】If the sugar is excreted in the urine, the excess sugar may cause the urine to appear as cloudy or even smell sweet or fruity. If one has more glucose in their urine, one may go for a blood test to check whether they have diabetes, which may help with the diagnosis. If one has a normal blood glucose level and only more glucose content is seen in the urine, that may be a sign of uncommon kidney disease.\n\n【81】#### **5.**删除换行**What Will the Cancerous Urine Look Like?**\n\n【82】Bladder cancer may show signs of blood in the urine, which appears bright red or cola-colored. Sometimes the urine appears normal, and blood present in the urine may be detected in laboratory tests.\n\n【83】#### **6.**删除换行**Why Does the Urine Appear Orange After Drinking Excess Water?**\n\n【84】In some cases, the orange color of the urine may indicate a problem with the liver or the bile duct, especially if one has light-colored stools. Dehydration may cause concentrated urine, make it much deeper in color, and make the urine appear orange.\n\n【85】#### **7.**删除换行**How Does the Urine With Excess Protein Appear?**\n\n【86】One may also have more protein when the body produces more protein. Kidney disease is mostly seen without early symptoms. Proteins in the urine may be the first sign. Urine with more protein may appear foamy, frothy, or bubbly.\n\n【87】#### **8.**删除换行**What Is the Color of the Urine in a Dehydrated Individual?**\n\n【88】Fluids in the body dilute the yellow-colored pigments in the urine. If one drinks more water, the urine appears clear. If one consumes less water, the urine may be more concentrated. Severe dehydration can produce amber-colored urine.\n\n【89】#### **9.**删除换行**What Causes the Morning’s First Urine to Be So Dark?**\n\n【90】The darker the color of the urine, the more concentrated it is. Since most people tend to sleep for several hours without drinking water, the urine is normally dark in the morning.\n\n【91】#### **10.**删除换行**Is the Clear Color of the Urine Healthy?**\n\n【92】Clear urine is one of the signs of good hydration and a healthy urinary tract. One should consult the doctor if one continuously notices clear urine and has unusual or extreme thirst. \n\n【93】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【94】无关删除-1:<u>*   Abnormal urine color: differential diagnosis  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3393939/\n*   Abnormal urine color  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22189666/\n*   Urine - abnormal color  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003139.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "b04b6ab7-cca8-464f-bc0b-51bc26f26b67", "title": "Aortic Valve Regurgitation - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Aortic Valve Regurgitation - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】The heart comprises four valves that regulate blood flow, and the aortic valve is one of them. It has three sections or leaflets (the left, right and posterior), the aortic valve separates the ascending aorta from the left ventricle (lower left chamber), which is the heart's main pumping chamber. The aortic valve typically opens three to five square centimeters during the heart's contraction (systole). Then, as the heart relaxes (diastole), this valve closes and prevents leakage of blood from the ascending aorta backward to the heart. Throughout one's lifespan, the aortic valve opens and closes an average of several billion times.\n\n【2】**What Is Aortic Valve Regurgitation?**\n---------------------------------------\n\n【3】The aortic valve ensures a one-way flow of oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the aorta of the body. It opens when the left ventricle contracts, pumps blood and closes when the left ventricle refills to prevent blood from flowing back to the left ventricle. Aortic regurgitation, also known as aortic insufficiency, is a valvular heart disease that occurs when the valve does not close tightly, causing backward flow to the ventricle. In order to compensate for the low blood output, the left ventricle grows larger to generate higher pressures and pump harder. This enlargement may help to relieve symptoms at first, but eventually, it leads to the weakening and malfunctioning of the ventricle.\n\n【4】What Are the Other Names of Aortic Regurgitation?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Aortic regurgitation (AV) is also known as aortic valvular regurgitation and aortic insufficiency.\n\n【6】What Signs and Symptoms Are Associated With Aortic Valve Regurgitation (AV)?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Signs and symptoms usually develop slowly over decades. The following signs and symptoms are associated with aortic valvular regurgitation-\n\n【8】*   Dyspnea (shortness of breath, especially with increased physical activity.).\n\n【9】*   Fatigue and tiredness.\n\n【10】*   Weakness.\n\n【11】*   Heart murmur.\n\n【12】*   Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat).\n\n【13】*   Lightheadedness.\n\n【14】*   Exertional angina (chest pain or tightness is observed with increased physical activity).\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Heart Valve Regurgitation</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Valvular Heart Disease - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    There is a slight drop in my ejection fraction from last year.

It is a classical sign of aortic valve regurgitation. It peaks at the beginning of diastole (relaxation of the heart) when the flow is largest, then rapidly decreases as the ventricles are filled.\n\n【19】What Are the Causes of Aortic Valve Regurgitation (AR)?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】There are several causes of aortic valvular regurgitation, such as:\n\n【21】*   **Myocardial Infarction (MI)-** It is commonly known as heart attack. It is a severe medical condition that usually occurs when an artery or blood vessel supplying the heart has plaque (fatty and waxy substance) built up within its walls and that plaque suddenly breaks. It causes injury to the walls of the blood vessels and leads to bleeding within the blood vessels. In order to stop this bleeding, platelets act together and form a blood clot. It prevents the blood from flowing through and reaching the heart muscles. This reduced or diminished blood flow further starves the heart tissue of nutrients and oxygen, causing cardiac ischemia. Eventually, the heart tissue dies, leading to a heart attack.\n\n【22】*   **Endocarditis-** A disease characterized by the inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chamber and valves which can be life-threatening.\n\n【23】*   **Rheumatic Fever-** An inflammatory disease that affects the heart that arises from infection with group A Streptococcus bacteria, which are commonly found on the surface of the skin and throat. This group of bacteria is responsible for various diseases, ranging from mild illnesses such as strep throat to severe conditions such as cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis.\n\n【24】*   **Aortic Dissection-** A medical condition in which the tunica intima (innermost layer) of the aorta (blood vessel) is ripped off. A tear forms within the innermost layer of the aorta, and when the high-pressured blood flows through the aorta, it begins to tunnel between the muscular layers of the aorta.\n\n【25】*   **Valvular Heart Disease Like Aortic Sclerosis and Aortic Stenosis-** Although thickening the aortic valve characterizes both conditions, they differ. Aortic valve sclerosis is a condition wherein the aortic valve thickens but does not obstruct blood flow, unlike aortic valve stenosis, wherein the blood flow is completely blocked.\n\n【26】*   **Aortic Damage-** This can occur due to a traumatic injury to the chest.\n\n【27】How Is Aortic Valve Regurgitation Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Along with physical examination, aortic valve regurgitation or aortic insufficiency can be diagnosed by the following tests:\n\n【29】*   **Echocardiogram:** The heart and surrounding blood vessels are examined using an echocardiogram or echo scan. It is a cardiac ultrasound test in which a tiny probe emits high-frequency sound waves that make echoes once they bounce off different body parts. While the scan is being done, the probe picks up these echoes and transforms them into a moving image on a monitor.\n\n【30】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging:** It is a comprehensive imaging test that gives great details of the heart and its associated structures. Images of the heart are created using a giant magnet and a computer. It can help the clinician identify the type and severity of the heart disease in a patient.\n\n【31】*   **Chest Radiograph (X-Ray):** A diagnostic test that records images of the lungs, heart, and airways using special beams of radiation called the X-ray beam. It is the most widely used diagnostic procedure for acquiring pictures of the heart, lungs, airways, and bones in the spine and chest. It is a painless, non-invasive procedure that uses special radiation beams (X-ray beams) to create black-and-white images of the chest cavity.\n\n【32】*   **Cardiac Catheterization:** Cardiac catheterization, or a traditional angiogram, has been a gold standard test for assessing the health of a human heart. A conventional coronary angiogram is an invasive procedure that involves passing a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) into the blood vessel (arteries). At times, doctors may advise a contrast angiography. It involves using a special dye (also known as contrast) injected that helps in amplifying the images.\n\n【33】*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG):** With the help of numerous electrodes (tiny sensors that are adhered to different parts of the body), it records the electrical signals from the heart, which helps in identifying the extra heartbeats and helps locate the origin of the extra heartbeat too. It is a rapid and painless test.\n\n【34】*   **Stress Test:** A test that analyzes the response of a heart during an intense level of activity. It is done with the help of an EKG (electrocardiograph) machine and a treadmill or stationary bike.\n\n【35】What Is the Treatment for Aortic Valve Regurgitation (AV)?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】Aortic valvular regurgitation (AR) or aortic insufficiency is managed on the presence of signs and symptoms and their severity. The patient is regularly monitored (routine echocardiograms) for mild symptoms. The physician may also advise the following medications:\n\n【37】*   Calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers regulate high blood pressure.\n\n【38】*   Antiarrhythmics for regulating the heart's rhythm.\n\n【39】*   Diuretics (also known as water pills) for minimizing peripheral swelling.\n\n【40】Surgical intervention is done if:\n\n【41】*   There are severe signs and symptoms.\n\n【42】*   Aortic regurgitation leads to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.\n\n【43】Surgical methods for valve repair include either the traditional open-heart aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is a relatively new and minimally invasive procedure that does not emphasize opening the chest cavity, as in traditional open-heart surgery. Instead, the surgeon uses a catheter (a thin tube that is highly flexible) to replace the damaged aortic valve with a biological tissue valve. The biological valve is a valve that is made from a cow's or pig's tissue.\n\n【44】What Are the Risk Factors Associated With Aortic Valve Regurgitation?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】The following factors make an individual vulnerable to developing aortic valve regurgitation.\n\n【46】*   **Increased Age:** Aortic valve regurgitation is more common in elderly individuals.\n\n【47】*   **Hypertension:** It is defined as increased blood pressure, which makes an individual susceptible to heart disease. It is a severe condition that can lead to the wear and tear of blood vessels, consequently causing cardiac problems like myocardial infarctions (MI or heart attacks), aneurysms (weakening or ballooning of the blood vessels), or strokes (brain damage occurring due to disruption in the blood supply of the brain). Hypertension could either be primary or secondary.\n\n【48】*   **Congenital Heart Diseases:** Individuals born with abnormal heart structures have an increased risk of valvular dysfunction. For example, Individuals with an aortic valve having two leaflets (bicuspid valve) instead of three (tricuspid valve) are more susceptible to aortic valve insufficiency or aortic valve regurgitation.\n\n【49】*   **Valvular Heart Diseases:** For example, aortic sclerosis and aortic stenosis.\n\n【50】What Are the Complications Associated With Aortic Valvular Regurgitation?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【51】If not treated aptly, aortic valve regurgitation can lead to:\n\n【52】*   Heart failure.\n\n【53】*   Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).\n\n【54】*   Death.\n\n【55】What Measures Can an Individual Take To Prevent Aortic Valve Regurgitation?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】No guaranteed health plan could prevent aortic valve regurgitation, but the following measures can help to some extent-\n\n【57】*   Keeping blood pressure within acceptable ranges.\n\n【58】*   Making healthy dietary choices.\n\n【59】*   Managing body weight.\n\n【60】*   Avoid smoking.\n\n【61】**Conclusion**\n\n【62】Aortic regurgitation, also known as aortic insufficiency, is a valvular heart disease characterized by leakage in the aortic valve, which separates the aorta from the left ventricle. Symptoms usually develop slowly over decades but can be acute as well. As long as proper care is given as needed, aortic valve regurgitation has a positive outlook.\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>*   Valvular heart disease: aortic regurgitation  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15998697/\n*   A Case of Severe Aortic Regurgitation Caused by Takayasu's Arteritis Showing End-Diastolic Opening of Aortic Valve  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6301981/\n*   Aortic Regurgitation  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK555944/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It can range from simple coughing to airway obstruction leading to death. Breathing is the most important and essential process of life. When a person inhales, oxygen with a mixture of other gasses is carried into the lungs, and when a person exhales, carbon dioxide is released. During choking, due to the complete blockage of the airway, no level of oxygen is carried into the lungs. The brain is so sensitive, and the response to the lack of oxygen results in brain death within a duration of ten minutes. In order to prevent this, the first aid measure should be given as early as possible.\n\n【2】How Is Choking Caused?\n----------------------\n\n【3】*   The primary cause of choking is when a piece of food material or other foreign material gets blocked in the upper airway.\n\n【4】*   At the posterior part or back of the mouth, there are two openings, one opens into the esophagus, which enters into the stomach, and the other opening is called the trachea, through which the air passes into the lungs.\n\n【5】*   During swallowing, the opening of the trachea is covered with a flap called epiglottis to prevent the entry of food particles into the air passage. If food particles enter the epiglottis, it results in choking.\n\n【6】*   Most of the foreign objects get stuck in the trachea at the level of vocal cords as it is narrower in this region.\n\n【7】*   In adults, it is caused mainly due to improper chewing of food. While eating, talking, or laughing can cause the food to enter into the wrong passage and cause choking.\n\n【8】*   This can occur in persons with slow swallowing mechanisms, in the case of taking drugs, consuming alcohol, or in patients affected with Parkinson's disease.\n\n【9】*   In children, choking is commonly caused by improper chewing of food, attempting to consume large pieces of food, or when eating big and hard candies.\n\n【10】*   While playing, there are more chances of putting harmful things such as nuts, pins, coins, tiny toy materials, and marbles inside the mouth which can result in choking hazards.\n\n【11】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Choking?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【12】In adults, choking causes following signs and symptoms and these include-\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【15】I have a chronic dry cough and mild heartburn from the last five days. Please help.\n\n【16】I feel like something is stuck in my throat, and I get a metallic taste. What to do?\n\n【17】Is something wrong with my 4-month-old daughter, or am I overreacting?\n\n【18】*   Gagging or coughing.\n\n【19】*   Inability to talk suddenly.\n\n【20】*   Panic reactions with hand signals pointing to the throat.\n\n【21】*   Clutching the throat is the typical sign of choking. It can be shown by grabbing the throat with one or both hands.\n\n【22】*   Difficulty in breathing.\n\n【23】*   Squeaky sounds while breathing.\n\n【24】*   Wheezing.\n\n【25】*   Passing out or lack of consciousness suddenly.\n\n【26】*   Cyanosis occurs due to the lack of oxygen. A bluish discoloration of the skin around the face, lips, and nail beds can be seen.\n\n【27】*   In the case of infants, weak cough, weak cry, or both can occur, and difficulty in breathing is noticed as they cannot show the universal sign of clutching the throat.\n\n【28】What Are the Possible Objects That Cause Choking?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】In children, certain objects can commonly cause the incidence of choking frequently, and these include-\n\n【30】*   Hard candies.\n\n【31】*   Popcorn.\n\n【32】*   Pencil erasers.\n\n【33】*   Carrots.\n\n【34】*   Peanuts.\n\n【35】*   Chewing gum.\n\n【36】*   Cherry tomatoes.\n\n【37】*   Large pieces of vegetables and fruits.\n\n【38】*   Whole grapes.\n\n【39】.\n\n【40】How to Rule Out the Cause of Choking?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【41】In the hospital, various investigations are carried out to rule out the cause, nature, and position of the foreign material. These include-\n\n【42】*   **X-ray:** Through chest X-ray, it can be helpful in finding the position of foreign objects. The object can be shown as radiopaque. These radiopaque objects (for example, nails and coins) which get blocked in the airway are easily identified on the neck or chest X-rays.\n\n【43】*   **Bronchoscopy**: Bronchoscopy is performed by inserting a flexible fiberoptic scope into the trachea or airway so that it provides a clear view of any foreign objects. In the case of the presence of any objects, the scope has an attachment that helps to remove the object.\n\n【44】How to Prevent Choking?\n-----------------------\n\n【45】**In Children:**\n\n【46】*   Cut foods such as sausages, hot dogs, and grapes into small pieces before serving them to children.\n\n【47】*   Avoid giving hard foods or objects that can be blocked in the smaller airways. Certain small-sized foods such as nuts, peas, chewing gum, tough meats, and seeds are not recommended to give to children younger than four years of age.\n\n【48】*   As kids are tempted to place everything in their mouth, check for small pieces of toys (for example, eyes or noses of small animal toys, tiny broken pieces of toys).\n\n【49】*   Store small batteries or buttons away from the children.\n\n【50】*   Instruct children well to chew the food properly before swallowing.\n\n【51】*   One of the leading causes of death is due to choking on a rubber balloon. Keep balloons after parties immediately out of the child's reach.\n\n【52】**For Adults:**\n\n【53】*   Chew food thoroughly before swallowing.\n\n【54】*   Avoid talking or laughing while eating.\n\n【55】*   Consumption of alcohol can diminish chewing and swallowing ability, which can increase the risk of choking.\n\n【56】*   Keeping pins or nails in the mouth should be avoided.\n\n【57】How to Manage Choking?\n----------------------\n\n【58】The treatment for choking generally varies with age. In adults and children more than one year of age, abdominal thrusts or the Heimlich maneuver are attempted. Through this procedure, pressure or thrusts are given to create an artificial cough. These thrusts are given with enough force to clear the airway.\n\n【59】Quick abdominal upward thrusts are given to force the diaphragm upward suddenly to make the chest cavity smaller, which in turn compresses the lungs by forcing air out. The rapid force of air moving out forces out the lodged object in the airways.\n\n【60】How to Perform Abdominal Thrusts?\n---------------------------------\n\n【61】*   The initial step is to lean the person forward slightly and stand behind the person.\n\n【62】*   Make a fist using one hand and surround both arms around the person by grasping the fist with the other hand in the midline just below the ribs.\n\n【63】*   In an attempt to cough up the blocked object, make quick and hard inward and outward movements.\n\n【64】*   This procedure can be repeated till the person is able to breathe clearly or loses consciousness.\n\n【65】**With Loss of Consciousness:**\n\n【66】*   If a person is not in a conscious state, lay the person on their back on the floor.\n\n【67】*   Kneel down next to the person and place the heel of the hand against the middle of the abdomen, just below the ribs.\n\n【68】*   Later, place the other hand on the top and press inward and upward up to five times using both hands.\n\n【69】*   If the airway clears but the person is not responding, start with cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n\n【70】**Conclusion:**\n\n【71】Choking with a lack of oxygen can result in brain damage or death in four to six minutes. Hence, immediate first-aid measures should be taken to avoid any serious complications. The chance of survival and recovery is faster when necessary actions are taken immediately. Quick response and immediate action save the life of the affected persons.\n\n【72】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【73】* * *\n\n【74】#### **1.**删除换行**How Do You Treat a Person Who Is Choking?**\n\n【75】Abdominal thrust can be administered to a person choking.

{"seq_id": "fb3682ca-519c-45f3-af8f-c7012224023c", "title": "The Sputnik V vaccine", "text": "【0】The Sputnik V vaccine\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Sputnik V, the vaccine against COVID-19, was created in Russia by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. Sputnik V vaccine is also called as Gam-COVID-Vac. The vaccine uses two different viruses, adenovirus 26 (Ad26) and adenovirus 5 (Ad5). It follows a heterologous recombinant adenovirus procedure. These two component-based adenoviruses help fight against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and are administered three weeks apart. These are aimed at getting over any preceding adenoviruses, making them weak so they cannot cause the disease. Unlike the other approved COVID vaccines, the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine uses a different virus for both shots.\n\n【2】What Is Sputnik V Vaccine?\n--------------------------\n\n【3】At the time when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic, the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia, was working on a prototype of Sputnik V. The COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac) is an adenoviral-based, two-dose vaccine that uses a non-potential virus to spread a small volume of pathogen thereby inducing an immune response in a quick time frame.\n\n【4】It is a vector-based vaccine that uses adenovirus stereotypes 5 and 26 as a vessel to deliver the coronavirus gene to our body, thereby making the body develop immunity against the virus. The antigen insert is an unmodified full-length S protein, and there is no tissue-type plasminogen. The HEK293 cell line is used for Sputnik V vaccine production. This vaccine was developed by the same laboratories that created an effective vaccine against Ebola (Zaire ebolavirus) and MERS virus (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and has an efficiency of 91.6 % based on three phases of trial with very minimal side effects.\n\n【5】What Are the Ingredients Used in the Sputnik V Vaccine?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine does not contain any of the ingredients prohibited by the Gamaleya Center. This vaccine does not have any animal components. The ingredients used for the Sputnik V vaccine are:\n\n【7】*   Modified replication-defective adenovirus.\n\n【8】*   Tris-(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane.\n\n【9】*   Sodium chloride.\n\n【10】*   Serotype 26 (for the first component).\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Coronavirus: Strictly Avoid Self-Medication</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    COVID-19 Testing</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Coronavirus - Parenting In Quarantine</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Magnesium chloride hexahydrate.\n\n【12】*   Disodium EDTA dihydrate.\n\n【13】*   Serotype 5 (for the second component).\n\n【14】*   Polysorbate 80.\n\n【15】*   Sucrose.\n\n【16】*   Protein S-expressing gene.\n\n【17】*   Ethanol.\n\n【18】*   Water.\n    </u>\n\n【19】What Is Sputnik Light Vaccine?\n------------------------------\n\n【20】The main aim of the lighter version of the Sputnik V Vaccine is that this vaccine avoids the two-component vaccine, which will be administered only once rather than two separate vaccinations (21 days apart). This reduces time and avoids multiple visits to the clinic. It produces immunity after a week, and an increase in immunity is visible after four weeks of vaccination. Sputnik Light is also built on the same special structure as in Sputnik V and does not contain the coronavirus and hence avoids the possibility of falling ill or spreading the virus.\n\n【21】Is Sputnik V COVID-19 Vaccine Safe?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【22】An open and non-randomized trial on 76 people was conducted in two phases: phase I and phase II. The result showed that all the participants developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There were no serious events as a side effect, but 50% of the participants had small irritations like pain in the area of injection. Phase III trial consisted of 22,000 adults who were above 18 years of age across 25 different hospitals in Moscow. The phase III trial of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine has given a constant forceful shielding impact throughout all age categories. Every participant received two doses of the vaccine at a 21-day interval, and the result of the study showed 91.6% effectiveness. In between the two doses, no cases of COVID-19 were reported in the vaccinated group, and the reported side effects were very mild and non-adverse.\n\n【23】What Countries Are Using Sputnik V COVID-19 Vaccine?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Russia was the first to approve this vaccine and promoted it beyond the borders. It also got approved for emergency use in India. Total production of 1.4 billion doses of Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine has been manufactured as it has been contracted in more than ten countries all over the world, says the Russian direct investment fund. At that time, 29 countries were given emergency approval to use the Sputnik V vaccine apart from Russia. The European Medical Agency said that it started to study the Russian Sputnik V vaccine. According to various reports, the Sputnik V vaccine has been introduced in Argentinaand Montenegro.\n\n【25】Sputnik V Vaccine is authorized and administered in the following countries - Albania, Algeria, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chile, Congo, Egypt, Ecuador, Gabon, Ghana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Maldives, Mali, Mauritius, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Palestine, Paraguay, Republic of Guinea, Republika Srpska, Russia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, Serbia, Seychelles, Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Syria, The Kingdom of Morocco, The Philippines, The Republic of Djibouti, The Republic of Iraq, The Republic of Panama, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, UAE, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, and Vietnam.\n\n【26】Based on the trial studies in Argentina, a combination of the Sputnik Light vaccine with vaccines by Oxford-AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, and Moderna demonstrated a high safety profile with no serious adverse effects.\n\n【27】What Are the Indications of the Sputnik V Vaccine?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine is administered to healthy age groups first. The vaccine is used in people between 18 to 60 years of age. The first priority access to vaccines is doctors, health care workers, teachers, etc. Research is still being carried out to vaccinate younger and older age groups. The Russian COVID-19 vaccine trials indicate that the vaccine builds immunity against the disease-causing virus. But still, an indication regarding younger individuals, oncology, and pregnancy vaccine efficiency is yet to be reported as their WBCs, and infection-fighting antibodies are at a lower level of defense. According to the manufacturer, pregnant women can get the vaccine if the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\n【29】**What Are the Requirements for the Sputnik V Vaccine?**\n\n【30】Sputnik V vaccine makes distribution and storage easier. The preparation manual says that there is a possibility to store the temperature of the household fridge. It is very easy to be transported and distribute as it is available in a lyophilized (dry) form. Sputnik V vaccine requires a simple storage requirement as it does not want to be invested in additional cold-chain infrastructure. It can be stored at -18° Celsius in its liquid form and 2 to 8 degree Celsius in its freeze-dried form. It can be shipped at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for two months, but the Russian Healthcare Ministry that developed this vaccine says that there are plans and hope to extend the storage of this vaccine to six months.\n\n【31】How Is the Dosage Given?\n------------------------\n\n【32】During the research, common cold viruses were used as a prototype, and they chose two different adenovirus vectors (rAd5 and rAd26) to be delivered in two shots. The individuals were given the first dose, known as the \"prime dose\" (rAd26), followed by a \"booster dose\" (rAd5-S), which is given after 21 days. These adenoviruses were combined with SARS-CoV-2 protein, and hence they were administered in 2 doses at 21 days apart, which makes the body develop an immune response against the virus and develop antibodies. Reports say that the usage of different adenovirus helps to create a powerful immune response and minimizes the risk.\n\n【33】What Is the Efficacy of the Sputnik V Vaccine?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Sputnik V vaccineuses two different vectors for each of the two shots in vaccination, which provides a higher vaccine efficacy. Russian scientists say that the phase 3 trial of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine has given a constant forceful shielding impact throughout all age categories. In phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials, it included 38 participants in each study, and it studied safety, immunogenicity, and tolerability. In the phase 3 clinical trial, over 18,000 participants received both vaccine doses at a three-week interval, claiming 91.6 % of efficacy. A new study says that the Sputnik V vaccine is also effective against the embodiment of the B.1.1.7 and the B.1.351 variants. It also says that the Sputnik V vaccine shows 70 % efficacy against the Delta variant during the first three months after the vaccination.\n\n【35】What Are the Side Effects of the Sputnik V Vaccine?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】The side effects of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine are,\n\n【37】*   Redness at the site of the injection (seen in 15 % of the population).\n\n【38】*   Dizziness.\n\n【39】*   Mild headache within 24 hours of vaccination.\n\n【40】*   Breathing difficulties.\n\n【41】*   Muscle weakness.\n\n【42】*   Fever.\n\n【43】*   High blood pressure.\n\n【44】*   Convulsions.\n\n【45】*   Swelling in the vaccinated area.\n\n【46】The Gamaleya Center announced that the Sputnik V vaccine does not show any cerebral venous sinus thrombosis cases. Studies say that there were four deaths that occurred shortly after taking the Sputnik V vaccine in Russia. Three of them were women of ages 51, 69, and 74, and the death was related to blood sugar, heart, and lung. It might or might not be associated with the Sputnik V vaccine.\n\n【47】**Conclusion:**\n\n【48】Sputnik V vaccine helps fight against the coronavirus, as it tries to infect the body, leading to serious life-threatening signs and symptoms. This vaccine provides immunity for a longer duration than the vaccines, following the same delivery mechanism for both doses. Thus, India has approved this vaccine, and Indian companies, such as Gland Pharma, Dr. Reddy's laboratory, Hetero Biopharma, Virchow Biotech, Panacea Biotec, and Stelis Biopharma, the biopharmaceutical arm of the Bengaluru-headquartered Strides Pharma Science, have partnered with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).\n\n【49】Even though people get vaccinated, it is important to follow the COVID-19 safety rules such as wearing masks, the social distancing of one meter, frequently washing hands, avoiding frequent outings, and avoiding frequent contact of hands on the eyes and face.

It is not able to bind to the oxygen. It does not have enough capacity to carry oxygen. The normal range of methemoglobin is 0-3%. Higher levels of methemoglobin can reach up to 15%. When your body is producing too much of methemoglobin, it will start replacing the normally present hemoglobin. This can cause oxygen to be removed from the cells. The level of methemoglobin can be determined by blood cell count and examination of the color.\n\n【2】What Is Methemoglobinemia?\n--------------------------\n\n【3】Methemoglobinemia is a blood disorder. An abnormal amount of methemoglobin is produced in this condition. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells (RBCs) that carries and distributes oxygen to the body. In methemoglobinemia, the hemoglobin is still able to carry the oxygen but cannot release it efficiently to the tissues of the body.\n\n【4】What Are the Symptoms of Methemoglobinemia?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The symptoms might change based on the variant of methemoglobinemia. When the level of methemoglobin rises, symptoms begin to get worse. The common symptoms are:\n\n【6】*   Cyanosis. It involves the bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membrane. This occurs due to the deoxygenation of the blood. There will be an elevation in deoxyhemoglobin levels. This will be most prominently evident in lips and fingers. Because of the cyanosis in methemoglobinemia, this condition is referred to as “Blue baby syndrome.” The connection between high nitrate levels and the blue baby syndrome is the water level crossing the standard limit of 10 mg/L\n\n【7】*   Blood becomes chocolate brown in color.\n\n【8】*   Rapid heart rate.\n\n【9】*   Dyspnea (Shortness of breath).\n\n【10】*   Nausea.\n\n【11】*   Headache.\n\n【12】*   Lethargy.\n\n【13】*   Fatigue.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Rasburicase - An Overview</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Methylene Blue Toxicity - Causes, Symptoms, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Confusion.\n\n【15】*   Loss of consciousness.\n    </u>\n\n【16】**Based on the concentration, the signs and symptoms shown may vary.**\n\n【17】0-3 % - No symptoms will be shown.\n\n【18】10-20 % - Mild symptoms.\n\n【19】20-50 % - Decreased exercise tolerance, tachycardia, fatigue, and dyspnea.\n\n【20】Higher than 50 % - Seizure, hypoxia, coma, and metabolic acidosis.\n\n【21】Higher than 70 % - Severe hypoxia and death.\n\n【22】What Are the Types of Methemoglobinemia?\n\n【23】*   Depending on the duration of the condition, it may be classified as acute or chronic.\n\n【24】*   Depending on the cause of the condition, methemoglobinemia is of different types. The congenital methemoglobinemia is divided into two types. It is hereditary or acquired. This genetic defect is accompanied by a deficiency of either an enzyme or a protein responsible for converting methemoglobin to hemoglobin.\n\n【25】*   Type 1: It occurs when there is a lack of enzymes in the red blood cells. It is also called erythrocyte reductase deficiency. In type 1, both the parents are just the carriers of the gene involved.\n\n【26】*   Type 2: It occurs when the enzymes do not work so well in your body. It is also called generalized reductase deficiency. A poor activity of the reductase enzyme is noted. The abnormal gene is inherited from one parent only.\n\n【27】The acquired type is due to the problem in hemoglobin itself. The acquired type is more common than the inherited type. It is an acute condition.\n\n【28】What Are the Causes?\n--------------------\n\n【29】The acquired type occurs in some people due to the exposure of harmful chemicals and medicines. The commonly involved chemicals, food, and medications are:\n\n【30】*   Nitrates: Babies who are younger than six months may develop acquired methemoglobinemia from the excess of nitrites present in the contaminated water. The bacterial flora present in the baby’s digestive system adversely reacts with the nitrates and causes methemoglobinemia. Completely developed digestive systems can avoid this kind of nitrate poisoning.\n\n【31】*   Nitrobenzene.\n\n【32】*   Benzocaine: Benzocaine over-the-counter product. It is used to soothe sore gums of the baby. The U.S.Food and Drug Administration organization has advised the baby-sitters, parents, and caregivers not to use them.\n\n【33】*   Medications like Dapsone. This medication is used to treat dermatitis, acne, and blisters in the arms and buttock region. It is also known to be useful for fungal infections in the lungs of HIV patients.\n\n【34】*   Antimalarial drugs like Chloroquine.\n\n【35】*   Solid foods: Certain home foods, including fruits and vegetables like beetroot, carrots, spinach, and beans, are known to have high nitrates. So, these kinds of solid foods are not advised for children. Parental counseling therapy includes food that can be fed to babies. In this therapy, parents are advised not to give babies solid foods before they are four months old.\n\n【36】What Are the Risk Factors?\n--------------------------\n\n【37】The risk increases when the patient is suffering from comorbid conditions such as anemia, lung disease, sepsis, and cardiovascular disease. It is also associated with the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, such as sulfhemoglobin and sickle hemoglobin.\n\n【38】What Are the Complications?\n\n【39】*   Seizures.\n\n【40】*   Bronchitis.\n\n【41】*   Asthma.\n\n【42】*   Emphysema.\n\n【43】*   Heart arrhythmias.\n\n【44】*   Death. (This can occur in patients having methemoglobin level more than 70%).\n\n【45】How Is It Diagnosed?\n--------------------\n\n【46】1.  The Potassium Cyanide Test: This test is used for differentiating methemoglobin and sulfhemoglobin. When a few drops of potassium cyanide is added, methemoglobin turns to bright red, but sulfhemoglobin does not change color and remains dark brown.\n\n【47】2.  Clinical Examination: The characteristic chocolate brown color blood is noted.\n\n【48】3.  Blood Examination: Complete blood count is done to note the nitrates level in the blood and other drugs.\n\n【49】4.  Arterial Blood Gas Analysis: This is a method used to periodically check the saturation levels of oxygen, carbon-dioxide, and bicarbonate.\n\n【50】5.  Pulse Oximetry: This is used to identify the level of oxygen saturation in the blood. It is a non-invasive diagnostic method.\n\n【51】6.  DNA Sequencing: It is the process in which determining the nucleic acid sequence is done. It identifies the order of nucleotides in DNA molecules. It includes various technological methods to find the order of the four bases, such as adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine.\n\n【52】What Is the Treatment?\n----------------------\n\n【53】*   Chronic methemoglobinemia requires medications to reduce cyanosis. Methylene blue and Citric acid are known to be helpful. Treatment involves infusion with the drug Methylene blue. In congenital conditions, Methylene blue cannot be used. Such patients might require Aspirin therapy.\n\n【54】*   Severe and acute conditions are life-threatening and require additional therapeutic methods. It is a medical emergency.\n\n【55】How Is the Prognosis?\n---------------------\n\n【56】The prognosis level decides the prediction level to show whether the condition will improve or not. The prognosis for methemoglobinemia is relatively very poor.\n\n【57】What Is the Differential Diagnosis?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【58】*   Heart failure.\n\n【59】*   Sulfhemoglobinemia.\n\n【60】*   Argyria.\n\n【61】Are you facing similar symptoms? Call a doctor online.\n\n【62】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【63】* * *\n\n【64】#### **1.**删除换行**How Common Is Methemoglobinemia?**\n\n【65】Methemoglobinemia is a rare condition, and the prevalence is below 0.035%.

In this condition, plaque buildup blocks and narrows more than one artery. This can cause increased chest discomfort and can lead to heart attacks and other complaints like heart failure and arrhythmia. Surgeries can treat this condition. The two main procedures include percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting. The below article briefs about the most misdiagnosed complication of percutaneous coronary interventions, the renal injury.\n\n【2】What Is a Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Percutaneous coronary intervention is the treatment done to open a blocked artery. The arteries are the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood through the body. Percutaneous coronary intervention is needed if the arteries have fatty buildup and waxy substances.\n\n【4】*   Percutaneous coronary intervention is done to clear blockages after a heart attack. It is also known as coronary angioplasty.\n\n【5】*   It is a minimally invasive procedure and can be done with a stent. In this procedure, a small balloon reopens the blocked artery to increase blood flow.\n\n【6】*   A cardiologist places a small stent (permanent tube) that keeps the artery open for the long term. This stent usually contains medications that release directly into the artery and reduces the risk of re-narrowing within the stent.\n\n【7】What Are the Indications of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Percutaneous coronary intervention is the procedure to remove plaque buildup from the arteries. This plaque buildup results in the hardening of the arteries, known as atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and blocks the blood flow through the heart, and if the heart fails to pump blood efficiently, chest pain can be felt. Therefore, percutaneous coronary intervention is the primary treatment for heart attacks. This procedure opens the blood vessels and helps minimize heart damage.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【11】Pyonephrosis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【12】Right Ventricular Dysfunction: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\n\n【13】Functional Coronary Angiography (FCA) - Advantages, Procedure, and Uses\n\n【14】What Are the Contraindications of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Percutaneous coronary intervention, medical therapy, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery usually depend on several factors, and if the factors do not fit the criteria applicable, the surgery is contraindicated. The factors are:\n\n【16】*   Number and characteristics of the blockages present.\n\n【17】*   Heart muscle function and age.\n\n【18】*   Cardiac and noncardiac medical conditions.\n\n【19】What Is Renal Injury After the Percutaneous Coronary Intervention?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Acute kidney injury is defined as a 0.3 mg/dl increase from the reference value within 48 hours or a 1.5-fold relative elevation in blood creatinine within seven days from a reference value established 30 days before PCI. A serious complication is associated with an increased risk of dialysis, myocardial infarction, and death. Renal injury post percutaneous coronary intervention shows initial worsening of renal function, with clinical manifestation that ranges from a minimal increase in serum creatinine to anuric renal failure that requires renal replacement therapy. An acute injury that frequently co-exists with acute coronary syndrome due to hemodynamic instability by often precipitating factors that can improve percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\n【21】What Are the Risk Factors for Getting Renal Injury After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】There are many independent predictors of acute renal failure and dialysis, each risk factor with many contributors. The risk factors are best classified into modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Modifiable risk factors are for the individuals or procedure-related.\n\n【23】**Non-Modifiable Risk Factors:**\n\n【24】*   **Age:** Advance age is the main risk factor for getting a renal injury.\n\n【25】*   **Diabetes Mellitus:** Diabetes is another risk factor for the development of acute renal injury that also leads to the need for dialysis. Diabetes and chronic renal injury appear to act synergistically.\n\n【26】*   **Cardiac Risk Factors:** Acute decompensated heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and acute coronary syndrome are associated with an increased risk of acute kidney failure.\n\n【27】*   **Chronic Kidney Disease:** Pre-existing chronic kidney disease is the most important risk factor for renal injury post-percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\n【28】**Individual-Related Modifiable Risk Factors:**\n\n【29】*   **Anemia:** Individuals with chronic kidney disease are more likely to worsen the renal injury. The incidence is higher in anemic individuals than in non-anemic individuals.\n\n【30】*   **Volume Depletion and Hemodynamic Instability:** Volume depletion occurs when sodium-containing fluids are lost in the urine from the gastrointestinal tract or skin or by acute sequestration. Hemodynamic instability occurs when there is abnormal or unstable blood pressure that causes inadequate blood flow.\n\n【31】*   **Nephrotoxicity Drug Use:** Concomitant use of nephrotoxic agents like NSAIDs like Tacrolimus, Cyclosporine, and diuretics increases the risk of renal injury by interfering with the autoregulatory responses of renal circulation.\n\n【32】**Procedure-Related Modifiable Risk Factors:**\n\n【33】*   **Timing of Angiography and Urgency of the Procedure:** The timing of the renal injury is related to contrast exposure and plays an important role in developing acute renal failure. Individuals who undergo coronary artery bypass surgery within one day of coronary angiography have an approximately twofold increase in the risk of major adverse renal and cardiac events compared with those who waited more than five days.\n\n【34】*   **The Osmolality of Contrast Media:** Acute renal injury increases with high osmolar contrast use in individuals with chronic kidney disease.\n\n【35】*   **The Volume of Contrast Media:** Higher volume contrast use significantly increases the risk of acute renal injury. A creatinine clearance ratio of more than two is an independent predictor of individuals with renal injury.\n\n【36】*   **Hemodynamic Support:** Value of mechanical circulatory support in reducing the risk of acute kidney injury in hemodynamically unstable individuals. The use of left ventricular assist devices, mainly Impella, to maintain hemodynamic stability and end-organ perfusion has a role in reducing acute kidney injury.\n\n【37】**Conclusion:**\n\n【38】Many acute coronary syndrome patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine values show stabilization and improvement in serum creatinine values rather than worsening after successful percutaneous coronary intervention. However, all patients with impaired basal serum creatinine show worsening renal function post-percutaneous coronary intervention. Individuals with radial access suffered less acute kidney injury. In most cases, the access site is not independently associated with a lower incidence of acute kidney injury in individuals with myocardial infarction in non-matched and matched cohorts. The results suggest a lower incidence of acute kidney failure in individuals with radial access in unmatched cohorts, at least influenced by confounding factors, mainly bleeding. The overall incidence of renal injury after a percutaneous coronary intervention is low. Still, the risk factors increase the risk of renal injury and short or long-term mortality.\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>*   Renal failure after percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with high mortality  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15789398/\n*   Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions logo  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/circinterventions\n*   Acute kidney injury – A frequent and serious complication after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction  \n    https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0226625</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "d4568900-3912-41b0-a5ad-ffe5ec007c43", "title": "Argininosuccinate Lyase Deficiency - Clinical Presentation and Management", "text": "【0】Argininosuccinate Lyase Deficiency - Clinical Presentation and Management\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (argininosuccinic aciduria) is a rare, genetically inherited disorder that occurs due to the deficiency of the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase, which plays a vital role in the removal and breakdown of nitrogen from the body (urea cycle). It occurs in nearly 1 in 70,000 to 218,000 individuals.\n\n【2】Argininosuccinate lyase deficiency can be identified in the first few days after birth because of the elevated levels of ammonia in the blood. In later stages, the affected individuals show characteristic brittle or sparse hair with tremors and development delay. Children born with argininosuccinic aciduria may show unwillingness to eat, lethargy, poor breathing rate, unusual body movements, and seizures. In some cases, skin lesions, liver damage, mental retardation, and developmental delay are also seen.\n\n【3】What Is Argininosuccinate Lyase?\n--------------------------------\n\n【4】Argininosuccinate lyase (argininosuccinase) is a liver enzyme involved in the breakdown of argininosuccinate (ASA) into dicarboxylic acid fumarate and amino acid arginine. Argininosuccinate lyase acts as an intermediate enzyme in urea synthesis. Mutations in the argininosuccinate gene may cause alterations in the enzyme activity, leading to the accumulation of citrulline, ammonia, and argininosuccinate in the blood and side effects including vomiting, lethargy, hyperventilation (rapid breathing due to anxiety), abnormal hair growth, hepatomegaly (liver enlargement), hypothermia (drop in body temperature to dangerous levels), hepatic fibrosis (connective tissue accumulation in the liver), and developmental delay.\n\n【5】What Is Argininosuccinate Lyase Deficiency?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (argininosuccinic aciduria) is a genetic disorder that results in high ammonia and argininosuccinic acid (ASA) levels in the body. It is characterized by a lack of the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) that is part of the urea cycle. The lack of this enzyme causes nitrogen accumulation as ammonia in the blood. Excessive levels of ammonia in the body cause neurotoxicity and disrupt the normal functioning of the central nervous system. The affected infants may have lethargy, learning disability, vomiting, feeding refusal, and behavioral abnormalities.\n\n【7】What Are the Causes of Argininosuccinate Lyase Deficiency?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Mutations involving the argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) gene cause argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (argininosuccinic aciduria). This condition is included in genetic diseases and urea cycle disorders. The urea cycle consists of a sequence of reactions in the liver cells to convert nitrogen generated during protein breakdown into urea that is eliminated through the kidneys. In people with argininosuccinate lyase deficiency, the conversion of argininosuccinate to arginine is blocked, and thus the urea cycle is disrupted. Thus, excess nitrogen is accumulated in the blood as urea, causing liver damage and neurological problems. Argininosuccinate lyase deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive pattern. Thus the affected individuals have two copies of the altered gene in each cell. However, individuals with one normal gene and one altered gene will be considered carriers of the disease and usually do not show any symptoms of argininosuccinic aciduria.\n\n【9】What Are the Symptoms Associated with Argininosuccinate Lyase Deficiency?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The severity of the symptoms associated with argininosuccinate lyase deficiency varies from person to person. In severe form, there will be a complete lack of the enzyme, which occurs shortly after birth. Some individuals develop milder argininosuccinic aciduria during late infancy or adulthood due to a partial lack of argininosuccinate lyase enzyme. The symptoms associated with argininosuccinate lyase deficiency are:\n\n【11】*   Lethargy.\n\n【12】*   Lack of appetite.\n\n【13】*   Vomiting.\n\n【14】*   Refusal to eat.\n\n【15】*   Irritability.\n\n【16】*   Respiratory abnormalities.\n\n【17】*   Cerebral edema (swelling in the brain).\n\n【18】*   Seizures (fits or epilepsy).\n\n【19】*   Hepatomegaly.\n\n【20】*   Liver cirrhosis (liver healthy tissues replaced by scar tissues).\n\n【21】*   Rapid breathing.\n\n【22】*   Hair loss.\n\n【23】*   Delayed developmental milestones.\n\n【24】*   Cognitive impairment (trouble with learning, memory, decision making, etc.).\n\n【25】*   Brittle hair.\n\n【26】*   High blood pressure.\n\n【27】*   Learning disabilities.\n\n【28】*   Liver dysfunction.\n\n【29】*   Ataxia (balance impairment).\n\n【30】*   Intellectual disability.\n\n【31】How Can We Diagnose Argininosuccinate Lyase Deficiency?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Diagnosis of argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (argininosuccinic aciduria) can be made through specialized tests, detailed family history, and evaluation of characteristic findings.\n\n【33】The common diagnostic tests are :\n\n【34】*   Plasma ammonia concentration greater than 150 micromoles per liter.\n\n【35】*   Elevated argininosuccinic acid levels in the plasma or urine.\n\n【36】*   Elevated citrulline levels.\n\n【37】*   Molecular genetic testing.\n\n【38】*   Gene-targeted testing.\n\n【39】*   Comprehensive genomic testing (exome array and exome sequencing).\n\n【40】What Are Treatment Options for Argininosuccinate Lyase Deficiency?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】*   Dietary restriction of oral proteins.\n\n【42】*   Intravenous administration of glucose, lipids, and insulin to promote anabolism (a metabolic pathway that makes complex molecules).\n\n【43】*   Intravenous sodium phenylacetate or sodium benzoate ingestion to normalize ammonia levels (nitrogen scavenging therapy).\n\n【44】*   Arginine base supplementation.\n\n【45】*   Lifelong dietary management.\n\n【46】*   Orthotopic liver transplantation.\n\n【47】*   Use of calcium supplements.\n\n【48】*   Hemodialysis (a blood purification process when an individual's kidney does not properly).\n\n【49】*   Oral nitrogen scavenging therapy.\n\n【50】*   Use of multivitamins.\n\n【51】*   Physical, occupational, and speech therapies to improve developmental disabilities.\n\n【52】*   Antihypertensive drugs and salt restriction to control high blood pressure.\n\n【53】*   Electrolyte supplementation to manage hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood).\n\n【54】What Are the Complications of Argininosuccinate Lyase Deficiency?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】*   **Neurocognitive Deficiencies** - Individuals with argininosuccinate lyase deficiency have a higher incidence of neurological abnormalities and developmental delay. In severe cases, there will be neurological defects like behavioral abnormalities, learning disabilities, and seizures.\n\n【56】*   **Liver Disease** - In severe cases of argininosuccinic aciduria, hepatomegaly, liver fibrosis, and liver damage will occur.\n\n【57】*   **Electrolyte Imbalance** - Some patients develop electrolyte imbalance (hypokalemia) due to increased renal wasting.\n\n【58】*   **Trichorrhexis Nodosa** \\- It involves nodular swellings in the hair shaft with loss of cuticle and frayed fibers. About 50 percent of the individuals with argininosuccinate lyase deficiency have brittle, dull hair and partial alopecia (hair loss).\n\n【59】*   **Hypertension** \\- Argininosuccinate lyase deficiency results in hypertension and endothelial dysfunction.\n\n【60】**Conclusion**\n\n【61】Argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (argininosuccinic aciduria) is a genetic disorder that results in the accumulation of ammonia and argininosuccinic acid (ASA) in the body. It occurs due to the lack of the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase, which functions as an important enzyme in the urea cycle that promotes the conversion of excess nitrogen in the body to ammonia, excreted through urine.\n\n【62】Treatment of argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (argininosuccinic aciduria) aims to prevent the accumulation of excessive ammonia in the body and the resulting side effects. Excessive ammonia levels in the body result in neurologic complications such as mental retardation, seizures, and developmental disabilities. Argininosuccinate lyase deficiency may cause liver damage, respiratory difficulties, renal diseases, skin lesions, and hair loss. To reduce complications, long-term dietary restriction for proteins is done in individuals with argininosuccinate lyase deficiency.\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH - Argininosuccinate Lyase Deficiency  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK51784/\n*   NORD - argininosuccinic aciduria  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/argininosuccinic-aciduria/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

New body concepts can be extremely different from traditional esthetic concerns. Tongue-splitting practice is considered body modification by some people or an action causing disfigurement or damage by others. It involves splitting the tongue from the tip toward the central part of the base. The resultant forked tongue appearance may resemble that of a snake. The appearance may also be referred to as ‘lizard tongue’ and has become popular recently. Getting a tongue split is considered a part of being trendy and up-to-date.\n\n【2】How Is Tongue Splitting Done?\n-----------------------------\n\n【3】Tongue splitting, also known as tongue bifurcation or tongue forking, may be done using a scalpel or other methods. A surgeon or body modification practitioner usually does the procedure. Some people try doing it on their own. Some of the ways in which tongue bifurcation can be done are:\n\n【4】*   **Scalpel:** Tongue splitting can be done using a scalpel. By this method, the tongue will be cut down using a scalpel from the tip to the middle portion to create a bifurcation. The cut edges of each half will then be sutured or stitched. To prevent excessive bleeding, the scalpel may be heated before use.\n\n【5】*   **Cauterization:** Cauterization is the use of temperature changes to destroy tissues or cells. Using a heated scalpel will be beneficial as it decreases bleeding by cauterization. An argon laser or a cautery unit may be used by the surgeon for tongue splitting. By this method, the tongue will be split, and the blood vessels will be closed to prevent bleeding from the site. The surgeon will suture the partially sealed areas after the procedure.\n\n【6】The person may have difficulty speaking and eating during the healing period. It usually takes one to two weeks for the tongue to heal. Due to the limitations it offers, tongue splitting is banned in many countries.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-3:<u>Will removal of tonsils help to get rid of recurrent tonsil stones and pain?</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-3:<u>Can the mild pain I experience after tooth extraction indicate a dry socket?</u>\n\n【11】I have pain with a burning sensation on my right rib cage away from the armpit. Please help.\n\n【12】What Are the Complications of Tongue Splitting?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Tongue splitting is a highly specialized form of body modification procedure and can be extremely dangerous. The risks associated with the tongue-splitting practice are the following:\n\n【14】*   Inflammation.\n\n【15】*   Bleeding or hemorrhage.\n\n【16】*   Infection due to following an unhygienic practice or not doing it under a medical professional.\n\n【17】*   Muscle damage.\n\n【18】*   Nerve or artery damage, especially if the procedure is done by an inexperienced person or the self.\n\n【19】*   Speech abnormalities due to the creation of bifurcation.\n\n【20】*   Pus or fluid discharge from the area.\n\n【21】*   Blood infections, lead to heart problems.\n\n【22】*   Scar tissue formation, which gradually affects speech.\n\n【23】Since the legality of the practice is restricted, the availability of healthcare professionals practicing the same will be minimal or nil. This motivates the people seeking tongue-splitting practice to get assistance from less experienced ones. They will also try to satisfy their desire by doing it on their own. In such cases, the chances for complications like nerve and artery damage, muscle problems, and related risks increase.\n\n【24】What Happens After Healing?\n---------------------------\n\n【25】Some of the risks of tongue splitting persist for a long time or even for the rest of the life. Since the tongue surface contains taste buds that help in detecting taste, tongue bifurcation may affect the taste buds, leading to a lack of taste sensation. Due to the damage caused to the muscles, some may find it tedious to move the tongue as they used to do previously. In some cases, tongue movement will become completely impaired. In addition, faulty techniques can cause damage to the tooth, gums, and other oral structures. In some cases, healing may take more time, and in the postoperative period, individuals may present with symptoms like severe pain, bleeding, or infection. It is necessary to seek medical help if serious complications develop. The surgeon will also be helpful in cases in which the surgical site opens up or the stitches fall apart.\n\n【26】Why Is Tongue Splitting Performed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【27】People opt for tongue splitting to improve their strength. Some consider it a part of self-empowerment, especially after facing extreme life trauma. The people choosing tongue bifurcation usually like the 'lizard tongue' appearance. Some consider it a method of healing, while others consider it an act to increase sensation, by doubling the number of tongues. Even if some groups consider it as a part of beauty modification, another group may consider it as a method to create a scary or 'animal-like' appearance in order to get the population's attention. Tongue splitting may also be considered as an identity for a specific group of people in some regions. Some may do it to improve their sexual experience by enhancing the methods of kissing and performing oral sex.\n\n【28】Can Tongue Splitting Be Reversed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【29】Since tongue splitting causes many undesirable changes, people may opt to reverse the procedure. Tongue bifurcation can be reversed surgically. The surgery may usually be performed under local anesthesia. The surgeon will cut out the healed portion of the tongue halves and place sutures uniting the two halves. It is necessary to choose an experienced surgeon for the procedure, which will otherwise cause severe complications. In addition, proper post-operative care is important to avoid the causation of further risks.\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】Tongue splitting is a body modification procedure done by people to achieve various sorts of desires. Some may be completely related to aesthetic enhancement and some may be for weird satisfaction. Whatever the reason is, the procedure has many disadvantages, including serious functional or physiological impairment. Due to this reason, it is made illegal to split the tongue, in many countries.\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>*   Tongue Splitting  \n    https://www.padental.org/Online/Public/Patient\\_Resource\\_Center/Tongue\\_Splitting.aspx\n*   The piercing truth about tongue splitting and oral jewelry  \n    https://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177%2814%2961131-4/pdf</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

While boys and girls typically begin puberty between the ages of nine and fourteen and between the ages of eight and thirteen, central precocious puberty affects both genders before the age of nine. Puberty symptoms include the growth of pubic and underarm hair, a sudden increase in height (known as a \"growth spurt\"), acne, and stench beneath the arms. In addition to getting breasts, girls also start having periods. Boys' penis, testicles, and voice depth develop as they age.\n\n【2】Children who experience central precocious puberty may grow taller than their peers as a result of the early growth spurt, but they may also stop growing unusually early. Some affected people grow to maturity shorter than other family members if they do not receive the right treatment. For those affected, growing emotionally faster than their peers can be challenging and might even result in behavioral and psychological issues.\n\n【3】What Causes Idiopathic Sexual Precocity?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【4】Precocious central puberty frequently has no known reason. MKRN3 gene mutations are the most frequent genetic factor implicated in central precocious puberty. The disorder can occasionally be caused by abnormalities in other genes, and scientists believe that central precocious puberty may also be caused by changes in unidentified genes. In addition to genetics, dietary habits, socioeconomic position, and exposure to specific environmental toxins all have an impact on when a person reaches puberty.\n\n【5】The MKRN3 gene produces a protein that is involved in controlling the beginning of puberty. Puberty begins when the hypothalamus, a brain gland, is triggered to release bursts of the hormone known as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Other hormones that control sexual development are released due to this hormone. According to studies, the MKRN3 protein prevents (inhibits) the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, delaying the start of puberty.\n\n【6】It is believed that the MKRN3 gene mutations responsible for central precocious puberty result in the synthesis of an inactive MKRN3 protein. Researchers hypothesize that, even if the exact mechanism is unknown, the absence of the MKRN3 protein, which normally prevents gonadotropin-releasing hormone release from the hypothalamus, causes the onset of puberty to occur earlier than usual.\n\n【7】**Additional Factors Include**\n\n【8】*   An inheritance of central precocious puberty.\n\n【9】*   An uncommon genetic issue.\n\n【10】*   A benign tumor of the pituitary gland or brain.\n\n【11】*   Brain damage.\n\n【12】*   A brain infection, such as meningitis.\n\n【13】*   Chemotherapy or radiation for the treatment of cancer.\n\n【14】What Are the Symptoms Associated With Idiopathic Sexual Precocity?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The following can appear before the age of eight in girls and before the age of nine in boys, which are premature puberty symptoms.\n\n【16】*   For boys, facial hair as well as hair in the genitals and underarms.\n\n【17】*   Breast growth and first period in girls.\n\n【18】*   Acne.\n\n【19】*   Adults' odor.\n\n【20】*   The growth of the testicles or the development of breast buds.\n\n【21】*   A change in emotions.\n\n【22】*   Mood changes.\n\n【23】*   Children occasionally develop hair on their genitalia and beneath their arms, but this does not necessarily indicate that they are fully mature adolescents.\n\n【24】How Is Idiopathic Sexual Precocity Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【25】It is believed that using the age cutoffs for evaluation will reduce the possibility of overlooking a serious medical issue:\n\n【26】1\\. Male breast development occurs before pubic hair or testicular growth in boys.\n\n【27】2\\. In boys, gonadarche, or pubic hair, appears before age nine.\n\n【28】3\\. The appearance of pubic hair (pubarche) before the age of eight or the beginning of breast growth (the larche) in girls before the age of seven.\n\n【29】4\\. Girls' menstruation (menarche) before the age of ten.\n\n【30】Sometimes a medical evaluation is required to distinguish the few children with serious issues from the majority of kids who have already reached puberty but are still healthy physiologically. Early sexual development needs to be examined because it could:\n\n【31】1\\. Promote early bone development and decrease final adult height.\n\n【32】2\\. Reveal the existence of a tumor or another critical issue.\n\n【33】3\\. Turn the children, especially a female, into a sexual object for an adult.\n\n【34】In addition to watching for puberty symptoms, they might also:\n\n【35】1\\. Hormone amounts.\n\n【36】2\\. Blood testing for bone aging measures hormone levels.\n\n【37】3\\. If your child's bones are maturing too quickly, X-rays can detect this.\n\n【38】4\\. Tumors can be ruled out using magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scans.\n\n【39】What Are the Treatments Associated With Idiopathic Sexual Precocity?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】1\\. Anastrozole is one therapy option.\n\n【41】2\\. Other viable treatments include gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists like Histrelin, Triptorelin, or Leuprorelin. A histrelin implant, which can last up to a year, is another option for treating central precocious puberty. Although it necessitates a minor surgical procedure, this treatment is helpful for central precocious puberty without the discomfort and inconvenience of frequent injections. The implant is inserted beneath your child's skin through a cut on the inside of the upper arm. The implant is removed after a year and, if necessary, replaced with a fresh one.\n\n【42】3\\. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists stimulate the pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone when used intermittently.\n\n【43】4\\. Most children with central precocious puberty can be successfully treated with medication if there is no underlying medical issue. This therapy, known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog therapy, often entails a monthly injection of a drug that prevents further development, such as Leuprolide acetate or Triptorelin. Longer intervals can be used with some newer formulations. The child continues to take this medicine up until the time that they typically enter puberty. The process of puberty recurs around 16 months after the patient stops taking medicine.\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】Central precocious puberty. It occurs when the body matures earlier than anticipated, possibly years earlier. Puberty typically begins in girls around the age of eight and in boys around the age of nine. Normal puberty may begin in some kids as early as age six for girls and eight for boys, especially if they are African-American or Hispanic. The onset of puberty symptoms, such as developing breast tissue and body hair, occurs substantially earlier with central precocious puberty. Girls experience it more often.\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>*   Sexual precocity and its treatment  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23677828/\n*   Idiopathic sexual precocity in the female; report of three cases  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13237387/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The store bile may get hardened to form stones in a few instances. These stones may clear up gradually, but the larger ones cause severe complications. One such complication is Bouveret syndrome. Read below to know more.\n\n【2】What Is Bouveret Syndrome?\n--------------------------\n\n【3】Bouveret syndrome denotes a gastric outlet blockage that occurs due to the impaction of a large gallbladder stone in the stomach or small bowel. Due to various reasons, a large stone may form in the gallbladder, which may enter the small bowel or stomach through an abnormal passage (fistula). It leads to obstruction of the gastric outlet.\n\n【4】Is Bouveret Syndrome Common?\n----------------------------\n\n【5】M. Beassier, a French Surgeon, first reported the disorder in 1770. Later, a French physician named L. Bouveret published two reports on this condition in 1896. However, reports show that only 315 cases were noted between 1967 to 2016. It indicates the rare nature of Bouveret syndrome. In addition, it accounts for 1 to 3 % of all gallstone obstructions.\n\n【6】What Are the Risk Factors for Bouveret Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Bouveret syndrome is considered to be a severe complication of a gallbladder stone (cholelithiasis).\n\n【8】However, the following factors increase the risk of it:\n\n【9】*   Female gender.\n\n【10】*   Advanced age (above 60 years).\n\n【11】*   History of cholelithiasis, jaundice, and gallstone in the bile duct.\n\n【12】*   Gallstones larger than 2 cm to 8 cm.\n\n【13】What Are the Signs and Symptoms?\n--------------------------------\n\n【14】The intensity of the symptoms keeps fluctuating, and it includes:\n\n【15】*   Nausea.\n\n【16】*   Vomiting.\n\n【17】*   Abdominal swelling.\n\n【18】*   Pain mainly in the right upper portion of the abdomen.\n\n【19】*   Weight loss.\n\n【20】*   Dehydration.\n\n【21】*   Vomiting blood may happen less frequently.\n\n【22】How Is Bouveret Syndrome Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【23】**1) Physical Examination -** The physician may look for abdominal swelling, pain, dry mucous membranes, and other signs of jaundice. But, these findings do not confirm the diagnosis, and the following investigations are necessary.\n\n【24】**2) Plain Radiograph -** The abdominal radiographs are not so specific and accurate in diagnosing Bouveret syndrome. The other findings that are less noticed include:\n\n【25】*   Bowel obstruction.\n\n【26】*   Enlarged stomach.\n\n【27】*   Abnormal location of gallstone.\n\n【28】*   Accumulation of gas in the gallbladder and bowel.\n\n【29】**3) Computed Tomography -** A particular and accurate imaging technique in detecting Bouveret syndrome. It gives a detailed view of the following:\n\n【30】*   Number and size of gallstones present.\n\n【31】*   Fistula.\n\n【32】*   Any abscess, if present.\n\n【33】*   Surrounding tissues.\n\n【34】The classic triad of Bouveret syndrome, Rigler’s triad, is usually visualized in 40 to 50 % of cases. It consists of the following:\n\n【35】*   Ectopic location of gallbladder.\n\n【36】*   Bowel obstruction.\n\n【37】*   Presence of gas within the bile ducts and bowel.\n\n【38】**4) Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)** is a type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that does not require a contrast agent like the typical MRI. It is highly efficient in differentiating stones from other fluids and provides a detailed image of the fistula.\n\n【39】**5) Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)** - The healthcare specialist may insert a flexible tube into the mouth, passing the food pipe to the stomach. It provides a detailed image of the stomach and small bowel. It also aids in treating other conditions of the upper gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【40】What Are the Similar Conditions?\n--------------------------------\n\n【41】*   The inflammation of the digestive tract characterizes Crohn’s disease. It produces symptoms like fatigue, abdominal pain, fever, loss of weight, etc. Similar to Bouveret syndrome, the symptoms occur in episodes.\n\n【42】*   Peptic ulcer disease causes ulcers on the stomach and small bowel lining. Stress, smoking, alcohol consumption, certain medications, and bacteria are responsible for causing peptic ulcers.\n\n【43】*   Erosive gastritis refers to the inflammation of the stomach's mucosal lining that leads to the formation of sores on it. Severe ulcers require immediate treatment.\n\n【44】*   The obstruction of the small bowel characterizes the duodenal web. The affected individual may have upper abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal swelling.\n\n【45】Can Bouveret Syndrome Be Treated?\n---------------------------------\n\n【46】**1) Endoscopy -** It is the most preferred treatment as it is minimally invasive. The first endoscopic technique for visualizing and removing gallstones was successful in 1985. But, endoscopy is productive in removing stones of smaller sizes. In addition, the prognosis of treatment is less compared to surgery.\n\n【47】**2) Lithotripsy** is a non-surgical method that involves crushing the stone and then removing them with nets, baskets, or other instruments.\n\n【48】*   Electrohydraulic lithotripsy is also used to remove large stones, whereas high-intensity shock waves are used to break the storm into smaller particles and remove them. Stones larger than 2.5 cm are effectively removed by lithotripsy procedure. However, the main drawback is that bleeding and perforation may occur if shock waves are focused on the bowel wall during the procedure.\n\n【49】*   Laser lithotripsy is considered safe in treating gallstones as it focuses the high energy on the stone, and the tissues are less damaged. It provides excellent access for the healthcare specialist to control the laser application. Holmium and Neodymium lasers are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used in the laser lithotripsy technique.\n\n【50】**3) Surgery -** In the past decades, surgery was the primary procedure in treating Bouveret syndrome. However, it is not advisable in elderly patients and is considered only if the endoscopic procedure did not help the effective removal of gallstones.\n\n【51】*   Cholecystectomy: If there is a high risk and complications associated with the gallstones, the doctor may suggest the surgical removal of the gallbladder. The fistula is also repaired, along with removing the gallbladder if required.\n\n【52】What Are the Complications of Bouveret Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】The severe obstruction of the gastric outlet leads to the following complications if left untreated:\n\n【54】*   Dehydration (loss of body fluids).\n\n【55】*   Anorexia.\n\n【56】*   Electrolyte imbalance.\n\n【57】*   Nutritional deficiency.\n\n【58】*   Bowel perforation (development of a hole in the intestine wall).\n\n【59】**Conclusion:**\n\n【60】Bouveret syndrome is an infrequent complication of gallstones, and it requires high knowledge of the healthcare specialist in diagnosing such conditions. The obstruction of the gastric outlet is a critical feature in diagnosis. However, with the help of endoscopy, the doctor may confirm Bouveret syndrome. In addition, the use of endoscopy and lithotripsy in gallstone retrieval has shown high success rates. Surgery is also an alternate option if the other mentioned procedures have not worked.\n\n【61】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【62】无关删除-1:<u>*   Bouveret Syndrome (Bilioduodenal Fistula)  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430738/\n*   Bouveret syndrome: current management strategies  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5819584/\n*   Bouveret syndrome  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bouveret-syndrome-1</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This can potentially lead to the development of life-threatening cancers. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a hamartomatous gastrointestinal disease most commonly prevalent in the small intestine. But there can also be an extra-intestinal involvement as in the bronchi of the lungs, the gallbladder, the nasal cavity passageway, the renal tubules, or the urinary bladder and ureter.\n\n【2】These hamartomatous polyps make the individual predisposed to cancerous lesions or instead pose a definitive risk if left untreated, paving the way for potential malignancies.\n\n【3】Gastrointestinal polyposis and pigmentation of mucocutaneous membranes is a main characteristic feature of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Though gastrointestinal polyposis mostly affects the jejunum part of the small intestine, the stomach and the large intestine also need to be checked diagnostically for the growth of polyps as it is not uncommon for them to grow there.\n\n【4】What Is the Role of Genetics In Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The STK11 pathogenic variant is said to play an important role in the autosomal transmission of genes from the affected parent to the progeny. The proband identification of the STK11 gene in even one affected parent can make the genetic transmission chances of the child inheriting this variant (approximately around 50%) and, in turn, being affected by the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome again. Prenatal screening for expecting mothers in family members with a history of this syndrome can help identify the pathogenic component causing Peutz-Jeghers syndrome earlier.\n\n【6】Women are slightly more prone to this syndrome than men, and most people who are affected by this disease usually need surgical intervention by 18 to 21 years of age. Because of the predisposition to certain cancers, be it of the breasts, cervix, uterus, or ovaries, women affected by Peutz-Jeghers syndrome need immediate intervention to prevent the complications arising by timely intervention or surgical modalities.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】Hereditary Cancer Syndrome - Diagnosis, Symptoms, and Prevention\n\n【10】Do I need to get radiotherapy for breast cancer?\n\n【11】From the photos, kindly tell me if the fibroma on my soft palate is cancerous.\n\n【12】*   Cancer screening for susceptible or suspected individuals should be done especially in boys and girls as early as around 8 years of age with the right diagnostic modality like endoscopy, colonoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and breast examination can prove very beneficial in preventing the continuing complication of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome mainly increasing the risk of these cancers (listed as per the approximate or estimated risk for these individuals to develop cancer):\n\n【13】*   Breast cancer (most prevalent) ranges from 30 to 50%.\n\n【14】*   Colon or rectal cancers range up to 40%.\n\n【15】*   Pancreatic cancer (the third most prevalent subtype for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome individuals) ranges from 10 to 35%.\n\n【16】*   Stomach cancer range up to 30%.\n\n【17】*   Ovarian cancer range up to 20%.\n\n【18】*   Other cancers are small intestine cancer, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, testicular cancer, and lung cancers, usually ranging between 3 to 13% of the individuals chronically affected by Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.\n\n【19】What Are the Clinical Features and Prevalence of Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The clinical features of this syndrome mainly include vomiting, frequent nausea, abdominal pain, and may be accompanied by rectal bleeding. This is caused due to the intestinal obstruction created by gastrointestinal polyp formation or hamartomas that start growing within the gastrointestinal tract. The affected individuals also, as mentioned previously, have been prone to the development of skin freckling or freckled skin (melanocyte macules) inside the oral, anal, orbital, and nasal cavities or around the fingers.\n\n【21】These clinical symptoms can be observed as early as in the first decade of life. A characteristic oral diagnosis by the dental surgeon in recognizing this syndrome is that even though in adulthood these macules tend to fade, they persist in the oral mucosal membranes. Similarly, young adults or children developing gynecomastia as a consequence of Sertoli cell or testicular tumors need to be assessed by the physician for other clinical features to identify this syndrome, or the later complications may be life-threatening and severe.\n\n【22】If the clinical features of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are not recognized, it may result in testicular cancer in males (Sertoli cells of the testes would be impacted or affected by tumors) and benign neoplasms or benign tumors of the ovaries in females. Cases of cervical malignancies are also reported in females who have left Peutz-Jeghers syndrome untreated. Men also can be prone to the development of gynecomastia and short stature, affecting skeletal growth, age, and development in these individuals suffering from this syndrome.\n\n【23】Apart from gender-related complications that arise due to ignorance of the clinical symptoms of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, the folding of the intestine into itself altering its morphology, also termed medically as intussusception, is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires surgical intervention almost immediately when the patient presents with severe abdominal pain.\n\n【24】How Are Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Features Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】MRE (magnetic resonance enterography) and VCE (video capsule endoscopy) are diagnostic surveillance techniques to confirm Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Testicular examination in suspected male individuals and gynecologic and breast examination in females will be of paramount importance in preventing the aggravation of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.\n\n【26】How Are the Symptoms of Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Managed?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】1.  Endoscopic surgery techniques and polypectomy or the surgical resection or removal of gastrointestinal polyps is the main modality to relieve the clinical symptoms of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (for all polyps greater than 1 cm).\n\n【28】2.  Mastectomy or hysterectomy (cancer surgery for breast or uterus removal) is preferable for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome patients suffering from cancers. Similarly, ovarian cancers need to be treated by oophorectomy.\n\n【29】3.  As the brown and freckled skin, that is, the melanocytic pigmentation of macules, leaves a chronic psychological impact on the patient, laser surgery after consulting with the dermatologist would be appropriate in partially clearing the pigmentation.\n\n【30】4.  For prevention of cancers in those individuals who have remained unaffected by any of these malignancies, yearly examination by the physician or gynecologist with a Pap test, a biopsy from the uterine tissues or transvaginal ultrasound in females above 25 years, and testicular examination in males with testicular ultrasound beginning as early as possible in childhood is a useful cancer-preventive intervention.\n\n【31】**Conclusion:**\n\n【32】There is a need for individuals suffering from Peutz-Jeghers syndrome to undergo diagnostic screening for cancer and also trace the genetic component by the physician or from the family history of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. These affected individuals can be promptly saved from the long-term psychosomatic impact on their health. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, though a chronic medical condition, needs to be assessed in a timely surgical and preventive manner, especially after observing the clinical features to prevent the risk of aggravation to cancers and gastrointestinal complications that can increase the mortality rate in these individuals.\n\n【33】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【34】* * *\n\n【35】#### **1.**删除换行**How Do You Know If You Have Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?**\n\n【36】Peutz-Jeghers syndrome manifests as dark-colored spots on various parts of the body such as the mouth, lips, eyes, nose, anus, hands, and feet. Other symptoms include gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, stomach pain, and small bowel obstruction.\n\n【37】#### **2.**删除换行**Is Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Curable?**\n\n【38】Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is not curable. Since there is no cure, the treatment is mainly focused on controlling the symptoms. The patients are under lifelong surveillance for monitoring their organs to prevent secondary complications.\n\n【39】#### **3.**删除换行**Is Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Premalignant?**\n\n【40】People with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are more likely to develop cancer during their lifetime. The polyps developed during the syndrome are premalignant, but there is a strong association between the syndrome and gastrointestinal carcinoma.\n\n【41】#### **4.**删除换行**How Do You Control Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?**\n\n【42】There is no permanent cure for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. The patients are under lifelong surveillance to prevent secondary complications. It was stated that patients who are under continuous surveillance could avoid the need for emergency surgery, and they also do not develop any cancer. This is because the polyps are removed before they can cause any obstruction or before they develop into cancer.\n\n【43】#### **5.**删除换行**What Cancers Are Associated With Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?**\n\n【44】People with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are at high risk for developing polyps in the digestive tract as well as cancers of the breast, colon, rectum, pancreas, stomach, testicles, ovaries, lung, cervix, and uterus.\n\n【45】#### **6.**删除换行**Why Does My Baby Have a Black Spot on Her Lip?**\n\n【46】Dark-colored black spots on the skin are a hallmark sign of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. It is commonly seen in 95% of children within the first two years of birth. These spots can also be developed in other parts of the body.\n\n【47】#### **7.**删除换行**How Common Is Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome?**\n\n【48】Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a rare condition that can affect both males and females. It is calculated that around 1 in 50,000 to 3,00,000 are affected by this syndrome. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome goes undiagnosed in many cases because the spots are often not visible in adulthood.\n\n【49】#### **8.**删除换行**At What Age Can Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Cause Cancer?**\n\n【50】The risk of cancer increases with age. There is around 1 to 2% risk by 20 years, 30% risk by age 50, and the risk is more than 80% around the age of 70 years. And in women with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, the risk of breast cancer is estimated to be 8% at the age of 40 and 31% at the age of 60.\n\n【51】#### **9.**删除换行**How Is Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS) Inherited?**\n\n【52】Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and can be passed from generation to generation. An autosomal dominant pattern means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is enough to increase the risk of developing non-cancerous polyps and cancerous tumors.\n\n【53】#### **10.**删除换行**What Is Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Mutation?**\n\n【54】Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a genetic condition that is caused by inheriting a mutation in the STK11 gene from one affected parent.

This also helps establish the natural state and flow of cerebrospinal fluid. The brain is enclosed in the skull (cranium) and is present floating on the cerebrospinal fluid, which also helps in providing cushioning for the brain. The brain is further covered by three membranes, known as meninges which help protect the central nervous system.\n\n【2】What Is the Origin of This Therapy?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】During the 1970s, John E. Upledger, an osteopathic physician, found out about the rhythmic movement of the craniosacral system. The cranial bone motion was scientifically proven during the 1900s. His continued work led to the development of this new therapy, craniosacral therapy (CST), which involves the manipulation of the bones and soft tissues. Following this, Dr. William Garner Sutherland further modified this research and found out that the bones are not fully fused, and some amount of rhythmic movements can be felt in the cranium. This was the basis of craniosacral therapy.\n\n【4】How Is It Done?\n---------------\n\n【5】Craniosacral therapy (CST) is a non-invasive therapy that helps in relieving pain and stress due to compression. This session can last up to two hours, and the number of sessions differs on the needs and results of the individual. The therapist will ask the patient to lie on a table and help in healing through gentle touches by placing the hands on the head and sacrum. A weight of five grams, which is approximately the weight of nickel, is used for this treatment. Tissue-release methods are done to restore the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluids. During the treatment, the following sensations can be expected:\n\n【6】*   A deeply relaxed feeling after therapy.\n\n【7】*   There might be some pulsating sensations in the therapeutic area.\n\n【8】*   A numbing or a pin and needle sensation will be felt by the individual.\n\n【9】*   Sometimes, a hot or cold sensation may also be felt by the individual.\n\n【10】*   Some tend to sleep during this therapy.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Pierre Robin Sequence- Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Exploratory Tympanotomy - Indications, Contraindications, Procedure, and Outcome</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Pain and Its Management in Orthodontics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【12】How Does It Work?\n-----------------\n\n【13】Generally, massaging helps improve blood circulation to the applied area, and this is the basis of craniosacral therapy. To improve circulation, any compression present in that area will be relieved. The patient experiences a pleasant and soothing feeling, and therefore problems like stress and anxiety are also relieved.\n\n【14】What Are the Fundamental Principles of Craniosacral Therapy?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】1.  **Placing the Hands:** The therapist places the hands over the cranium or the sacrum and waits to feel the impulse or the rhythmic sensation.\n\n【16】2.  **Projecting Into the Body:** The therapist now slowly feels musculoskeletal elements of the cranium through light touches. Sometimes the therapist will drop in deep inside the cranium to provide a dynamic massage that will help relieve tension.\n\n【17】3.  **Palpation:** The therapist then will wait and palpate the tissue tension, fluid pressure, and rhythm, and manipulation is done accordingly.\n\n【18】4.  **Restrictions to Normal Motion:** There are varied factors that may affect the mobility of the tissues either actively or passively, including active inflammations, swollen tissues, and hard and soft fixations of the tissues.\n\n【19】5.  **Interpretation of Craniosacral Rhythm:** The cranial respiratory impulse is evaluated in terms of frequency, amplitude, symmetry, and characteristics. It will help the therapist in diagnosing the underlying problems and provide appropriate levels of therapy.\n\n【20】6.  **Releasing Tissues:** There are two types of tissue releases, direct and indirect release. The direct release will directly interfere with the distorted tissue, and the tight muscles are stretched. But indirect release involves a corrective effort that will help aggregate the distortion and wait for the patient’s response to the same.\n\n【21】7.  **Proprioceptive Listening:** Listening to the neurological rhythms and refraining from stimulating the patient can be a powerful therapeutic modality. After therapy, the body comes alive pulsating, processing, and revealing a mind of its own.\n\n【22】8.  **Unwinding:** Unwinding is the corrective physiologic motion that will be induced by the central nervous system. It is a spontaneous release by positioning, in which the position keeps changing.\n\n【23】What Are the Indications?\n-------------------------\n\n【24】*   **Chronic Back and Neck Pain:** Individuals who have long-standing cases of neck and back pain due to musculoskeletal problems can be treated.\n\n【25】*   **Irritable Bowel Syndrome:** It is a disorder of the intestine causing stomach pain, diarrhea, and constipation.\n\n【26】*   **Migraine Headaches:** Migraine headaches can cause severe throbbing or pulsating sensations, and there will be extreme sensitivity to light.\n\n【27】*   **Stress:** Stress can be relieved by craniosacral therapy.\n\n【28】*   **Insomnia:** It is a sleep disorder in which the individual finds it difficult to fall asleep.\n\n【29】*   **Sinus Infections:** Sinuses are air-filled spaces in the face, and any infection in the sinuses can cause pain, and this pain can be relieved through craniosacral therapy.\n\n【30】*   **Constipation:** It is a condition in which there is inability or difficulty to excrete, and craniosacral therapy has helped treat this condition.\n\n【31】*   **Autism:** It is a developmental disorder in which the affected individual has behavioral problems and difficulty in communication.\n\n【32】*   **Dementia:** It is a condition that affects the memory of the patient, and then cognitive skills like thinking, reasoning, and remembering are lost.\n\n【33】*   **Temporomandibular Joint Pain:** Temporomandibular joint helps in the opening and closing of the jaw, and pain can occur due to musculoskeletal problems or infection.\n\n【34】*   **Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):** It is a developmental disability that will create problems in attention, and the affected individuals may be hyperactive and impulsive.\n\n【35】*   **Learning Disabilities:** Many learning disabilities have been treated through craniosacral therapy.\n\n【36】*   **Colic:** Colic is a condition occurring in babies, often accompanied by crying more than three times a day, that may look like an expression of pain.\n\n【37】*   **Motor Coordination Problems:** Motor coordination problems can be rectified through craniosacral therapy.\n\n【38】*   **Chronic Fatigue:** Fatigue and tiredness that is consistent for a long time can be treated through craniosacral therapy.\n\n【39】*   **Fibromyalgia:** It is a musculoskeletal condition that causes pain and mood disorders.\n\n【40】*   **Post-traumatic Stress:** Stress causes post-trauma can be healed through this therapy.\n\n【41】What Are the Benefits of Craniosacral Therapy?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【42】*   Craniosacral therapy (CST) has helped patients alleviate chronic pain.\n\n【43】*   It has helped improve the quality of life of the patients affected with central nervous system disorders.\n\n【44】*   Severe migraines can be cured through craniosacral therapy.\n\n【45】*   It helps relieve stress and anxiety and promotes sleep.\n\n【46】*   In patients with developmental disorders, it has significantly helped alleviate symptoms drastically.\n\n【47】What Are the Contraindications?\n-------------------------------\n\n【48】Craniosacral therapy (CST) is contraindicated in head injuries, hydrocephalus, intracranial hemorrhage, brain aneurysm, and blood clotting disorders. Young children below two years of age are also contraindicated for this therapy due to incomplete development of bones.\n\n【49】**Conclusion**\n\n【50】The efficacy of craniosacral therapy (CST) is still being tested, and much research is being done to prove its effectiveness. However, the side effects and risks of this therapy are pretty low in people who do not have bigger complications. The individual can feel a sense of relief due to the stress and anxiety reduction at the end of this therapy. Positive patient outcomes have been documented after craniosacral therapy.\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>*   Craniosacral Therapy  \n    https://www.craniosacral.co.uk/\n*   Craniosacral Therapy  \n    https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/craniosacral-therapy\n*   Craniosacral Therapy  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/craniosacral-therapy</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

There are several causes of constipation, and changes in lifestyle can help in managing the condition. While constipation can be treated easily, there are instances where it is considered an emergency.\n\n【2】What Is Constipation?\n---------------------\n\n【3】Constipation is a digestive problem characterized by a reduced bowel movement and difficulty passing stool. With constipation, there are fewer than three bowel movements in a week with hard or dry stools.\n\n【4】What Causes Constipation?\n-------------------------\n\n【5】Constipation occurs as a result of an imbalance in the normal digestive process. The digestive system is responsible for processing and eliminating waste products in the form of stools. When this process is disrupted, it results in constipation. Constipation is caused by several factors, including:\n\n【6】*   **Change in Diet:** A high-fiber diet promotes bowel movement by adding bulk. A diet that is low in fiber causes constipation.\n\n【7】*   **Dehydration:** Reduced water content due to dehydration can cause constipation and the stool becomes hard and dry.\n\n【8】*   **Sedentary Lifestyle:** A sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity can reduce bowel movement and result in constipation.\n\n【9】*   **Aging:** Aging causes reduced bowel movement and weakness in the muscles of the digestive system. This results in constipation.\n\n【10】*   **Other Medical Conditions:** Individuals with other medical conditions like diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, and pelvic floor disorders can experience constipation.\n\n【11】*   **Diseases of the Digestive System:** Diseases involving the digestive system like celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colon cancer, intestinal obstruction, and inflammation can cause constipation.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Is it normal to experience sudden stomach aches after consuming Ponnaavaarai chooranam for constipation?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    How to treat chronic dyspepsia, bloating, and constipation in my husband?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What could be the reason for nausea, constipation, and prolonged periods after taking the tablet Ulipristal Acetate?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【13】*   **Hormonal Changes:** Hormonal changes during pregnancy, menstruation, or menopause can cause constipation.\n\n【14】*   **Medications:** People who are under medicines like anticholinergics, antacids, anticonvulsants, iron supplements, or calcium channel blockers can experience constipation as a side effect of the medications.\n\n【15】What Are the Types of Constipation?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】Primary constipation is caused by a dysfunction in the muscles or nerves of the digestive tract that control bowel movements. This includes:\n\n【17】*   **Slow Transit Constipation:** This occurs when the muscles in the colon contract too slowly, causing stool to move through the colon and leading to constipation.\n\n【18】*   **Pelvic Floor Dysfunction:** This occurs when the muscles in the pelvic floor that are responsible for controlling bowel movements are weakened or damaged, leading to difficulty in passing stool.\n\n【19】*   **Anorectal Disorders:** These include conditions such as anal fissures, hemorrhoids, and rectal prolapse, which can cause pain or discomfort during bowel movements and lead to constipation.\n\n【20】Secondary constipation is caused by underlying medical conditions or medications that affect the normal functioning of the digestive system. Some examples include:\n\n【21】*   **Endocrine Disorders:** Hormonal imbalances, such as hypothyroidism, can slow down the digestive system and lead to constipation.\n\n【22】*   **Neurological Disorders:** Conditions such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease can affect the nerves that control bowel movements, leading to constipation.\n\n【23】*   **Medications:** Certain medications, such as opioids or anticholinergics, can slow down the digestive system and cause constipation.\n\n【24】*   **Inflammatory Bowel Disease:** Conditions such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis can cause inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to constipation.\n\n【25】When Is Constipation Considered an Emergency?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Constipation is generally not considered a medical emergency and is usually managed with lifestyle changes or over-the-counter medicines. However, there are certain instances where constipation is an emergency. This includes:\n\n【27】*   **Abdominal Pain:** Severe or worsening abdominal pain with constipation could indicate diseases of the abdomen like bowel obstruction, appendicitis, pancreatitis, or perforation, which is considered an emergency. Abdominal pain is accompanied by symptoms like nausea, vomiting, bloating, and inability to evacuate the bowel.\n\n【28】*   **Black-Colored Stool:** Black stools can indicate bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract and indicate a medical emergency.\n\n【29】*   **Blood In the Stool:** Blood in the stool indicates conditions like colon or rectal cancer, Crohn’s disease, hemorrhoids, or fissures and should be consulted immediately with a medical professional.\n\n【30】*   **Nausea and Vomiting:** Nausea and vomiting accompanied by constipation could indicate a bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal infection, or fecal impaction.\n\n【31】*   **Bloating:** Bloating with constipation can be due to bowel obstruction or irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n【32】It is important to note that constipation may be a symptom of an underlying medical condition, and prompt medical attention is required to prevent further risks and complications.\n\n【33】How Is Constipation Diagnosed?\n------------------------------\n\n【34】A thorough evaluation of medical and personal history helps in the diagnosis of any underlying medical condition associated with constipation.\n\n【35】In cases where constipation is considered an emergency, additional investigations may be necessary to help diagnose the underlying cause of the condition. Some diagnostic tests that may be performed include:\n\n【36】*   **Blood Tests:** Blood tests may be done to check for underlying medical conditions that can cause constipation, such as hypothyroidism or diabetes.\n\n【37】*   **Imaging Tests:** Imaging tests, such as X-rays or CT scans, may be done to evaluate the colon and rectum for signs of obstruction or other abnormalities.\n\n【38】*   **Colonoscopy:** A colonoscopy may be performed to evaluate the colon for signs of inflammation, polyps, or other abnormalities that may be causing constipation.\n\n【39】*   **Anorectal Manometry:** This test evaluates the function of the muscles and nerves in the rectum and anus to determine if any underlying issues may be contributing to constipation.\n\n【40】*   **Balloon Expulsion Test:** This test evaluates the functioning of rectal muscles by measuring the time taken for a balloon filled with water to be expelled from the rectum.\n\n【41】*   **Transit Study:** A transit study may be done to evaluate the duration for food to pass through the digestive tract and identify areas where there may be delays.\n\n【42】If there is an underlying medical condition, it is important to identify and treat it appropriately.\n\n【43】How Is Constipation Treated in an Emergency?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Treatment for constipation in an emergency depends on the etiological factor. The primary goal is to relieve the obstruction and associated symptoms. Here are some common treatments for emergency constipation:\n\n【45】*   **Bowel Decompression:** This is a medical procedure where a tube is inserted through the rectum and into the colon to relieve the obstruction and release gas and stool.\n\n【46】*   **Manual Disimpaction:** In some cases, a medical professional may need to manually remove the stool from the rectum or anus to relieve the obstruction.\n\n【47】*   **Medications:** Depending on the underlying cause of constipation, medications may be given to help relieve symptoms and improve bowel function. These may include laxatives, stool softeners, or medications that help stimulate the bowel.\n\n【48】*   **Surgery:** In some cases, emergency surgery may be required to remove an obstruction or address an underlying condition that is causing constipation.\n\n【49】In addition to these treatments, it is important to treat any other underlying medical condition like infection, diabetes mellitus, or medications that may contribute to causing constipation.\n\n【50】**Conclusion**:\n\n【51】Identifying and treating the cause for constipation is important in an emergency. It is always advisable to seek the advice of a medical professional when there are symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, bloody stool, or vomiting along with constipation. Prompt medical treatment can prevent further complications and improve the prognosis.\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>*   Symptoms & Causes of Constipation  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/constipation/symptoms-causes\n*   Constipation  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/constipation\n*   ASK THE DOC: WHEN IS CONSTIPATION AN EMERGENCY?  \n    https://nafc.org/bhealth-blog/ask-the-expert-when-is-constipation-an-emergency/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The joint may lose stable circulation due to inflammatory, traumatic, idiopathic, or congenital abnormalities. Several theories are available. Often seen in adolescents.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Atlantoaxial Dislocation?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The causes include:\n\n【4】**Traumatic Causes:**\n\n【5】A traumatic atlantoaxial dislocation is when there is an absence of another predisposing risk factor which is rare. Traumatic atlantoaxial dislocation is caused due to forced displacement of the neck leading to disruption of the transverse ligament. Rarely may this cause simultaneous disruption of the apical and alar ligaments. Such injuries are commonly seen in sports like football and rugby. Traumatic osseous injuries also lead to atlantoaxial instability.\n\n【6】**Congenital Causes:**\n\n【7】*   **Down Syndrome:** It is a chromosomal disorder caused due to the inflammatory process or an intrinsic defect in collagen fibers that form ligaments. The rate of incidence is 15 % to 20 %.\n\n【8】*   **Goldenhar Syndrome:** It is a skeletal dysplasia caused due to hypoplasia of the dens with atlantoaxial instability. Incidence is three out of eight cases.\n\n【9】*   **Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia:** It is a type of skeletal dysplasia caused due to abnormal growth of the spinal vertebrae and epiphysis, hypoplasia of the dens, or ligamentous laxity.\n\n【10】*   **Morquio Syndrome:** It is a type of skeletal dysplasia caused due to autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, which leads to odontoid dysplasia. Incidence rates are 42 % to 90 %.\n\n【11】*   **Occipitalization of the Atlas:** It is a congenital osseous abnormality caused due to abnormal motility in the joint region.\n\n【12】**Inflammatory Causes:**\n\n【13】Atlantoaxial dislocation is commonly seen in individuals with chronic rheumatoid arthritis. The cervical spine may be involved early in the course of rheumatoid arthritis, which leads to different patterns of instability, such as:\n\n【14】1.  Atlantoaxial dislocation.\n\n【15】2.  Atlantoaxial impaction.\n\n【16】3.  Subaxial subluxation.\n\n【17】Chronic systemic inflammation in these individuals leads to chronic synovitis that causes bony erosions and ligamentous laxity, followed by atlantoaxial dislocation. In individuals with chronic atlantoaxial dislocation, anterior atlantoaxial dislocation is common, and it is due to the laxity of ligamentous restraints.\n\n【18】What Is the Clinical Presentation of Atlantoaxial Dislocation?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Atlantoaxial dislocation presentation ranges from minor axial neck pain to death. Approximately 50 % of the individuals complained of neck pain and movement restriction. 70 % of the cases present with weakness or numbness, and 90 % with pyramidal signs. Other presentations include sphincter disturbances, respiratory distress, and lower cranial nerve dysfunction.\n\n【20】Other severe sequelae include respiratory failure, myelopathy, vertebral artery dissection, neurologic compromise, quadriplegia, or death. The differential diagnosis involves atlantoaxial rotatory fixation, torticollis, and odontoid fractures without dislocation. An atlantoaxial dislocation should be considered in children who cannot turn their heads when there is no evidence of torticollis.\n\n【21】In children, congenital atlantoaxial dislocation presents as chronically progressive spinal canal compression associated with neurologic and respiratory symptoms. Atlantoaxial dislocation in adults is mainly seen as a result of rheumatoid arthritis. Some individuals experience few symptoms; others may experience instability and neurologic compromise.\n\n【22】How Is Atlantoaxial Dislocation Classified?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Wang classification for atlantoaxial dislocation:\n\n【24】*   **Type I: Instability-** can be treated by posterior fusion procedure.\n\n【25】*   **Type II: Reducible-** Treated by posterior fusion procedure.\n\n【26】*   **Type III: Irreducible-** Treated by transorally released anteriorly before posterior fusion.\n\n【27】*   **Type IV: Bony Dislocations-** Treated by transoral adenoidectomy.\n\n【28】What Are the Treatment Modalities for Atlantoaxial Dislocation?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Treatment of atlantoaxial dislocation is based on the correction of the upper cervical spine sagittal alignment and the stabilization in the close anatomical alignment. The suggested procedures include posterior occipitocervical or C1 to C2 fusion after transoral odontoidectomy or periodontoid tissue release.\n\n【30】**Nonoperative Treatment:**\n\n【31】Nonoperative treatment includes cervical halter traction in the supine position and active range of motion exercises for 24 to 48 hours, followed by ambulatory orthotic immobilization and active range of motion exercises. Nonoperative treatment in symptomatic individuals is not recommended without surgical contradictions.\n\n【32】Certain individuals predisposed to atlantoaxial dislocation are advised for preventive treatment and screening. For individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, treatment is aimed at permanent neurologic injury while avoiding potentially dangerous and unnecessary surgery. Strategies include counseling the individual, lifestyle modification, regular radiographic follow-up, and early prompt surgical intervention.\n\n【33】Magnetic resonance imaging is indicated in myelopathic symptoms. Individuals with golden hair syndrome should get cervical flexion-extension films every six months and avoid contact sports.\n\n【34】**Surgical Treatment:**\n\n【35】A surgical approach for symptomatic individuals is highly recommended to prevent potential respiratory failure, progressive neurologic symptoms, and death. Different recommendations exist for asymptomatic individuals depending on the patient's age and underlying diagnosis. A surgical approach is recommended for adults if the atlantodental interval is greater than 5 mm.\n\n【36】Surgical fusion is indicated in children when the following is present:\n\n【37】*   Neurologic involvement.\n\n【38】*   Persistent anterior displacement.\n\n【39】*   Atlantodental interval greater than 4 mm.\n\n【40】*   The deformity was present for more than three months.\n\n【41】*   Recurrence of deformity following six weeks of immobilization.\n\n【42】In adults, fusion is recommended when there is moderate displacement seen in flexion and extension of cervical radiographs or instability with or without pain is present. In individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, surgery is considered promptly in an asymptomatic individual with atlantoaxial dislocation for any of the following:\n\n【43】*   Chronic neck pain in the setting of radiographic instability that does not respond to pain medication.\n\n【44】*   Degree of atlanto axial impaction or cord stenosis.\n\n【45】*   Space available for the spinal cord is less than or equal to 14 mm.\n\n【46】There is no clear surgical approach for individuals with Down syndrome or odontoideum. Still, it is monitored with annual lateral flexion or extension due to sudden changes from spinal cord compression. Surgical treatment methods include an attempt at converting irreducible to reducible atlantoaxial dislocation through traction. This involves anterior and posterior methods.\n\n【47】Posterior methods further include:\n\n【48】*   Transarticular screw fixation with sublaminar wiring.\n\n【49】*   Transarticular screw fixation with C1 hook.\n\n【50】*   Transarticular screw fixation with morselized autograft.\n\n【51】**Conclusion**\n\n【52】Atlantoaxial dislocation is a rare and potentially fatal disturbance to the cervical occipital anatomy. It is a rare but dangerous condition. It involves numerous etiological contributions. Treatment involves surgical and nonsurgical approaches.\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>*   Atlantoaxial dislocation  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22406773/\n*   A Review of the Diagnosis and Treatment of Atlantoaxial Dislocations  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/\n*   Atlantoaxial Dislocation  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/atlantoaxial-dislocation</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

A skull is a bony covering that protects the brain from trauma. Cerebrospinal fluid provides a cushioning effect to the brain. The brain moves freely in the cerebrospinal fluid inside the skull. It moves back and forth when something hits the skull hard or in response to a shock.\n\n【2】What Is a Concussion?\n---------------------\n\n【3】A concussion is explained as follows:\n\n【4】*   A concussion is a traumatic brain injury caused by a blow or jolt to the skull that shakes the brain against the skull's hard bone.\n\n【5】*   The skull contains the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. The cerebrospinal fluid cushions the brain. This sudden movement causes the brain to twist around.\n\n【6】*   The blow or hit changes the chemical nature of the brain cells. They can damage the nerves and blood vessels associated with the brain.\n\n【7】*   These chemical changes cause many side effects. Sometimes they resolve spontaneously, but later the symptoms arise very strongly.\n\n【8】*   A single concussion does not have a sufficient threshold to cause severe symptoms. After multiple concussions, there can be a noticeable level of threshold to produce severe symptoms and structural changes in the brain.\n\n【9】*   The symptoms can last for days, weeks, or months. A concussion occurs after a traumatic head injury on the head and neck.\n\n【10】*   Not every hit will cause a traumatic brain injury, but if the symptoms are intense, they should immediately be noted and treated. It is not life-threatening, but medical intervention is required as soon as possible.\n\n【11】Who Are Toddlers, and What Are the Risk Factors for Concussion?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Children between the age of 1 and 3 are called toddlers. After the baby’s first birthday, they are considered toddlers. Toddlers can perform activities such as climbing, jumping, gross motor skills, walking, crawling, running, squatting, playing games, etc. Toddlers can walk or crawl, roll, and fall. They can carry out so many activities that they have a high risk of concussion. It is very common for them to get hit on their heads. Playful activities can lead to severe head injuries. It is the age when they learn to be independent without others' help. They carry out many activities on their concussions do not happen only to athletes or youths. It can happen to anyone, including small children. Concussions are common at any age, for both girls and boys.\n\n【13】The risk factors for concussion include:\n\n【14】*   A fall from the hands of their parents or anyone.\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Constipation - Danger Signs in Toddlers</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I have post-concussion symptoms.

Children must be promptly evaluated after a potential injury to their head and provided with necessary accommodations at school during their recovery. Children recovering from a concussion need more rest and time away from sports activities and classes. The following signs and symptoms should be noted if the child had a recent traumatic event. They should be taken for immediate evaluation and treatment. The signs and symptoms include:\n\n【21】*   The baby starts crying when someone tries to move its head.\n\n【22】*   The child gets irritated on moving their head.\n\n【23】*   Bruise on the head.\n\n【24】*   Disturbance in sleeping.\n\n【25】*   Behavioral changes and mood swings.\n\n【26】*   Crying more than usual or excessive crying.\n\n【27】*   Disinterest in playing and other activities.\n\n【28】*   Lack of concentration and focus.\n\n【29】*   Confusion.\n\n【30】*   Dizziness.\n\n【31】*   Drowsiness.\n\n【32】*   Balance problems or trouble in waking.\n\n【33】*   Slurred speech.\n\n【34】*   Persistent vomiting.\n\n【35】*   A bruise on the baby's head.\n\n【36】*   Crying when the baby's head or neck moves.\n\n【37】*   Seizure.\n\n【38】*   Dilated pupils.\n\n【39】Immediate medical assistance is required if the baby has a concussion with the following symptoms:\n\n【40】*   Trouble waking up or if they can't wake up on their own.\n\n【41】*   Seizures.\n\n【42】*   Persistent vomiting.\n\n【43】*   A history of multiple concussions.\n\n【44】*   Slurred speech.\n\n【45】What Are the Post-Concussion Symptoms in a Child?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】Children could develop complications or delayed healing if reinjured at the same spot. A second blow to the head in the same region while the initial concussion is healing can result in longer-lasting or more-severe symptoms. The potential long-term effects of concussions are still under research. Some risks are identified, but it is still unclear why few people have the symptoms and others do not. Repeated concussions can impact the post-concussion symptom risk. If the child develops any of the above-mentioned signs or symptoms after a head injury, it is essential to seek medical attention immediately. Appropriate and properly fitted protective equipment, such as helmets, should be given during sports and other activities. Proper protective gear is an excellent option to help prevent concussions. The child's sports coach should know about the child's concussion history. The child can play the sport only if the sports coach allows it. After a proper medical consultation, the child is allowed to resume the sport and other activities. In case of doubts regarding the child's concussion, it is always better to seek professional help.\n\n【47】What Are the Diagnostic Tests Done for Concussion?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】The following tests can help diagnose concussions:\n\n【49】*   Neurological Examination - It evaluates vision, hearing, strength and sensation, balance, and coordination.\n\n【50】*   Cognitive Testing - It involves the evaluation of memory and concentration.\n\n【51】*   Computerized Tomography (CT) - It is a standard test to examine the brain after injury. The cross-sectional images of the skull and brain are taken for evaluation.\n\n【52】What Is the Treatment for a Toddler Who Has a Concussion?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】The following treatments are followed in a child with a concussion:\n\n【54】*   The child should rest completely and avoid sports or other physical activities.\n\n【55】*   Mental rest is also very essential after a concussion event.\n\n【56】*   They should not do anything that needs a lot of concentration, such as schoolwork.\n\n【57】*   They should limit their screen time, such as video games and television.\n\n【58】*   Many children experience disturbed sleep after a concussion.\n\n【59】*   Regular sleep routines should be followed. Parents should ensure their child is getting enough sleep.\n\n【60】*   Headaches are a very common problem after a concussion.\n\n【61】*   A hematoma is a blood collection that forms in the brain and squeezes it against the skull. Concussions can cause a hematoma. Haematoma is a medical emergency, and the child should be immediately rushed to a hospital.\n\n【62】*   Repetitive concussions can be dangerous.\n\n【63】**Conclusion:**\n\n【64】The children should be advised to rest after an event. Slowly normal activities can be carried out. The parents should take care of the child while playing sports to prevent a second concussion attack. Follow-up with a doctor once a month for a year because it would help a great deal for the cognitive assessment of the child and ensure everything is normal.\n\n【65】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【66】无关删除-1:<u>*   Concussion  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537017/\n*   Concussion Signs and Symptoms  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/basics/concussion\\_symptoms.html\n*   Concussion  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000799.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

But a successful weight loss program focuses on a healthy, calorie-controlled diet and increased physical activity or exercise. One must permanently change the lifestyle and adopt healthy habits to gain long-term weight loss.\n\n【2】Being overweight or obesity is a growing problem in most developing and developed countries. Initially, this problem emerged after the fifth decade of life, but now it is seen from the second decade itself. The magnitude of this problem is consistently underestimated as, most of the time, the complications of being overweight bring the patient to medical attention.\n\n【3】Overweight is when an individual's BMI (body mass index) is more than 24. Hence the best tool to detect obesity is calculating the body mass index in all patients coming for a consultation, irrespective of their problem. People are more inclined towards rapid results, but adverse effects are associated with it. The concept of physiological weight reduction must be understood. Weight reduction, just like weight gain, should be gradual and sustained. The basic principle in weight reduction is: to burn more calories than you consume but not overdo it.\n\n【4】What Can Be Done for a Safe and Steady Weight Reduction?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】*   **Set Realistic Goals:** Most of the time, lifestyle changes can reduce weight. But the goal has to be realistic. People should have a goal of reducing 0.3 to 0.5 kg per month.

Though both are important, emphasis on exercise should be given more as it helps improve stamina, provides a sense of well-being and good cardiac status, and improves cholesterol and blood sugar control. Exercise must be aerobic,i.e. brisk walking, jogging, running, cycling, swimming, and playing outdoor games like football and badminton. It should be started gradually, initially at low intensity and around ten to fifteen minutes per day, and then gradually increase the intensity and duration of exercise.\n\n【7】*   **Exercise Regime:** Exercise has to be done daily. If not possible, an exercise regime must be followed at least five days a week. Never rest your body for more than two days.\n    </u>\n\n【8】What Are the Various Strategies to Permanently Lose Weight?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】**1\\. Make Sure You Are Self-Motivated:** Long-term weight loss is time-consuming and requires lots of effort. Make sure you put on healthy changes permanently, such as eating habits and exercising. Ask yourself:\n\n【10】*   Am I motivated enough to lose weight?\n*   Am I doing this out of pressure?\n*   Do I overeat when in stressful situations?\n*   Am I willing to adopt healthy habits?\n*   Do I have time to spend on making these healthy changes?\n\n【11】2\\. **Find Your Inner Motivation:** No one can help you lose weight but yourself. Understand what will drive you to stick to your weight loss program. Make a list of things that motivates you, and keep you focused. Find ways that can keep you motivated during moments of temptation or stress. If thoroughly motivated, you will be willing to adapt to a healthy diet and exercise regime without pushing yourself much.\n\n【12】3\\. **Set a Healthy Routine:** Focus on realistic goals. Work smartly, exercise daily, check your calorie intake, and walk at least 30 minutes daily.\n\n【13】4\\. **Enjoy Healthy Food Habits:** Adopt an eating lifestyle that promotes weight loss, lowers the total calorie intake, and focuses more on plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which keeps you full and less carving. You can follow some of the tips such as:\n\n【14】*   Daily, eat three to four servings of fruits and vegetables respectively.\n*   Eat whole grains instead of refined grains.\n*   Use a modest amount of healthy fats.\n*   Cut back on sugars.\n*   Choose low-fat dairy products in limited amounts.\n\n【15】5\\. **Stay Active:** Regular physical activity and a restricted diet can help you lose weight. Exercise helps burn excess calories that you cannot cut through diet alone. It also has numerous other health benefits, such as boosting your mind, strengthening your body, reducing blood pressure, and maintaining weight.\n\n【16】6\\. **Change Your View:** Habits such as a healthy diet, lifestyle, and exercise must become a part of life. Lifestyle changes come with eating habits and daily routines. Have an occasional setback but do not give up entirely after a setback. Always remember that this will change your life, and the results are worth working for.\n\n【17】7\\. **Do Not Skip Meals and Eat Regularly:** Skipping meals will not help you lose weight. Eating regularly helps you in burning calories faster. It also reduces the temptation to eat sugary foods.\n\n【18】8\\. **Drink Plenty of Water:** Drinking enough water also helps in managing weight. People often confuse thirst with hunger. They consume extra calories when a glass of water is what they need.\n\n【19】9\\. **Read Food Labels:** Read your food labels, and use that calorie information to determine how that food fits your daily calorie needs according to your weight loss plan.\n\n【20】10\\. **Use a Smaller Plate:** Using a smaller plate helps you eat smaller portions. Eat slowly and chew properly. Stop eating before you feel full, and do not overeat. It takes around 20 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it is complete.\n\n【21】11\\. **Do Not Ban Any Food:** Banning your favorite food will only make you carve them more.\n\n【22】12\\. **Do Not Stock Junk Food:** Stocking junk foods such as biscuits, crisps, chocolates, and drinks will bring more attention to them, and you will end up eating them.\n\n【23】13\\. **Limit Alcohol:** Drinking alcohol can contribute to weight gain. A glass of wine equals as many calories as a piece of chocolate.\n\n【24】**Conclusion:**\n\n【25】It is natural for those trying to lose weight to lose it very quickly. But people who lose weight gradually and steadily are more successful in keeping it for long. Healthy weight loss is not just about diet or joining a program. It is about lifestyle, healthy diet patterns, and regular physical activity. Once you get the desired weight, maintain those healthy habits to attain long-term benefits. Losing weight is not easy. It takes commitment, effort, and self-motivation. Weight loss aids in various health benefits, such as it improves blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar. See weight loss as a journey and focus on the final destination. This will not only make you physically fit but will also help you live a healthier life.\n\n【26】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【27】* * *\n\n【28】#### **1.**删除换行**How to Safely and Effectively Lose Weight?**\n\n【29】To safely and effectively lose weight:  \n\\- Do not miss breakfast.  \n\\- Eat regular meals.  \n\\- Include plenty of fruits and vegetables.  \n\\- Increase activities.  \n\\- Drink plenty of water.  \n\\- Include high-fiber food.  \n\\- Read labels to keep caloric intake in check.  \n\\- Use smaller plates.  \n\\- Avoid banning foods.  \n\\- Avoid stocking junk food.  \n\\- Reduce alcohol consumption.  \n\\- Take planned meals.\n\n【30】#### **2.**删除换行**How to Safely and Easily Lose Weight?**\n\n【31】To safely and easily lose weight:  \n\\- Keep healthy food around.  \n\\- Reduced processed food.  \n\\- Increase protein in the diet.  \n\\- Eliminate sugar consumption.  \n\\- Black coffee intake.  \n\\- Stay hydrated.  \n\\- Reduce high-caloric beverages.  \n\\- Avoid refined carbohydrates.  \n\\- Intermittent fasting.  \n\\- Calorie counting.  \n\\- Brushing.   \n\\- Increasing regular cardiovascular and resistance training.\n\n【32】#### **3.**删除换行**What to Drink to Burn Fat?**\n\n【33】To burn fat, drink:  \n\\- Water.  \n\\- Green tea.  \n\\- Lemon water.  \n\\- Ginger tea.  \n\\- Fennel water.  \n\\- Apple cider vinegar.   \n\\- Black tea.   \n\\- Ajwain water.  \n\\- Protein shakes.  \n\\- Vegetable juice.  \n\\- Cumin tea.  \n\\- Coffee.  \n\\- Coconut water.  \n\\- Psyllium husk in water.  \n\\- Tart cherry juice.\n\n【34】#### **4.**删除换行**How Does Water Help in Losing Weight?**\n\n【35】According to studies, resting energy expenditure (the number of calories burned while still) can increase by 24 % - 30 % within 10 minutes of drinking water. Drinking water before meals can help in feeling more satisfied and aid in promoting portion control and weight loss. Adequate hydration also improves energy levels and mood.\n\n【36】#### **5.**删除换行**Does Stopping Food Help to Lose Weight?**\n\n【37】Stopping food triggers the body into “starvation mode,” which slows down the metabolism. Slower metabolism leads to slower weight loss. Intermittent fasting, rather than complete starvation, is helpful in weight loss.\n\n【38】#### **6.**删除换行**From Which Part Does Weight Loss Begin?**\n\n【39】When someone starts their weight loss journey, they first start losing hard fat settled around the organs like the liver and kidneys, and then soft fat is lost from around the waistline and thighs.\n\n【40】#### **7.**删除换行**How Does Lemonade Facilitate Weight Loss?**\n\n【41】Lemon contains vitamin C and antioxidants that promote good digestion. Lemon water has diuretic properties, detoxifying the body and thereby losing fat. Lemonade also promotes hydration and increases metabolism and a sense of fullness, promoting weight loss. Although there is no solid evidence proving lemonade is better than regular water. Still, it can be a great alternative to high-calorie beverages in terms of taste and calorie count.\n\n【42】#### **8.**删除换行**How to Remove Fat Rapidly?**\n\n【43】To lose fat rapidly, include the following:  \n\\- Strength training.  \n\\- Start a high-protein diet.  \n\\- More sleep.  \n\\- Add vinegar to the diet.   \n\\- Eat healthy fats.  \n\\- Drink healthier beverages.   \n\\- Increase fiber intake.  \n\\- Reduce refined carbs.  \n\\- Drink coffee.  \n\\- High-intensity training.  \n\\- Introduce probiotics into the diet.  \n\\- Increase iron intake.  \n\\- Intermittent fasting.\n\n【44】#### **9.**删除换行**How Does the Body Eliminate Fat?**\n\n【45】The body eliminates 84 % of the burnt fat through sweat and the rest as water. The liver is the primary site for fat metabolism and is recruited only when glucose and glucagon are deficient. Fat is broken via a cascade of complex metabolism procedures which, produces two excretory byproducts- carbon dioxide (exhaled out) and water (sweated out or urinated).\n\n【46】#### **10.**删除换行**Does Stool Contain Fat?**\n\n【47】The body removes a small amount of fat through the stool, but it is not an efficient way of eliminating fat. It is called steatorrhea when the stool contains an increased amount of fats. Steatorrhea is a sign of gastrointestinal malabsorption and can appear for various reasons, including pancreas and liver dysfunction.\n\n【48】#### **11.**删除换行**How Does Weight Loss First Show on the Body?**\n\n【49】Weight loss is seen first in the body by  \n\\- Not feeling hungry.  \n\\- Clothes fit loosely.  \n\\- Changing body measurements.  \n\\- Improvement of chronic pain.  \n\\- Improved blood pressure.\n\n【50】#### **12.**删除换行**How Do You Stop Accumulating Fat in the Body?**\n\n【51】To stop fat accumulation, one should:  \n\\- Reduce foods with high glycemic indices.  \n\\- Reduce the quantity of cooking oil.  \n\\- Avoid crash dieting.  \n\\- Remove refined carbs.  \n\\- Eat more protein.  \n\\- Eat an early dinner.  \n\\- Avoid frequent snacking.  \n\\- Eat healthy fats.  \n\\- Avoid transfat.  \n\\- Increase fiber content in the diet.\n\n【52】#### **13.**删除换行**Does Weight Loss Make the Person Stink?**\n\n【53】Combining exercise and a calorie-deficit lifestyle helps people lose weight by burning fat.

These cranial nerves control the muscles that move the eyeball. Due to this condition, a person suffers from orbital pain or headache. These symptoms usually subside on their own without any treatment. It is a rare condition that is only seen in around one in a million cases. Idiopathic swelling of the cavernous sinus can also be associated with this condition which typically affects only one side. This causes a myriad of symptoms such as double vision, paralysis, and numbness. Moreover, the affected eye is usually seen abruptly bulging due to this condition. Although the condition is believed to be benign, there are higher chances of recurrence along with neurological defects. Patients with this condition are recommended immunosuppressants for longer periods. Also, the condition is known as\n\n【2】*   Ophthalmoplegia syndrome.\n\n【3】*   Painful ophthalmoplegia.\n\n【4】*   Recurrent ophthalmoplegia.\n\n【5】What Are the Causes of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The etiological factor affecting this condition is still unknown. However, the following is the theory behind its possible association with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome:\n\n【7】*   **Autoimmune Response:** Inflammation of the orbital fissure and cranial sinus occurs due to the accumulation of granulomatous cells. It is the result of the body’s weak immune system, which cannot defend against the foreign organism and causes generalized inflammation of the blood vessels and the body.\n\n【8】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The following are the signs and symptoms associated with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome:\n\n【10】*   Severe periorbital headache.\n\n【11】*   Dropping of the upper eyelid.\n\n【12】*   Large pupil.\n\n【13】*   Numbness of the face.\n\n【14】*   Chronic fatigue.\n\n【15】*   Pain.\n\n【16】*   Reduced eye movements.\n\n【17】*   Double vision.\n\n【18】*   Paralysis.\n\n【19】*   Fatigue.\n\n【20】How to Diagnose Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【21】There are the following diagnostic methods used for Tolosa-Hunt syndrome:\n\n【22】*   **Diagnostic Criteria Are Given by the International Headache Society:** International headache society has given some criteria for diagnosing this condition, such as:\n\n【23】    *   Unilateral headache.\n\n【24】    *   Inflammation of cavernous sinus or orbital fissure.\n\n【25】    *   Paralysis of one or more cranial nerves on the same side.\n\n【26】    *   If the headache is localized around the eye.\n\n【27】*   **Neuroradiological Studies:**\n\n【28】    *   **Computed Tomography (CT Scan):** CT scan is used with a high resolution to see the abnormal soft tissue changes.\n\n【29】    *   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** MRI is an excellent diagnostic tool used for getting a good coronal view. With the help of this tool, the thickening of soft tissue in the cavernous sinus can be evaluated. Moreover, it also shows the lateral wall convexity of the cavernous sinus and its extension into orbit.\n\n【30】*   **Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Study:** This evaluation method is used to test ophthalmoplegia and its possible involvement.\n\n【31】    *   **Hematological Tests:**\n\n【32】        *   Complete blood count.\n\n【33】        *   Serum chemistry (glucose, electrolytes, liver, and renal function).\n\n【34】        *   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\n\n【35】        *   C-reactive protein.\n\n【36】        *   Hemoglobin A1c.\n\n【37】        *   Fluorescent treponemal antibody test.\n\n【38】        *   Antinuclear antibody.\n\n【39】        *   Anti-dsDNA antibody.\n\n【40】        *   Anti-Sm antibody.\n\n【41】        *   Serum protein electrophoresis.\n\n【42】        *   Antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody.\n\n【43】        *   Angiotensin-converting enzyme. \n\n【44】    *   **Cerebrospinal Fluid:**\n\n【45】        *   Opening pressure.\n\n【46】        *   Cell count and differential.\n\n【47】        *   Protein.\n\n【48】        *   Glucose.\n\n【49】What Are the Complications Associated With Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】The following are the complications associated with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome:\n\n【51】*   Paralysis of an eyelid or face.\n\n【52】*   Double vision.\n\n【53】*   Severe headache.\n\n【54】How to Manage Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【55】Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is usually managed with short-term steroid drug therapy.

The following is the management option for Tolosa-Hunt syndrome:\n\n【56】*   **Glucocorticoids:** An ophthalmologist gives glucocorticoids according to the patient's condition and physical capacity. The dose of this medication varies from person to person. Usually, with this medication, the patient might feel an immediate effect on the pain. However, cranial nerve palsies may or may not improve with it. The treatment involves high-dose steroid therapy with a gradually decreasing dose over a month or week.\n\n【57】*   **Immunosuppressant Therapy:** This is the second line of treatment, and not every patient requires it. This medication can be given along with steroid therapy. Additionally, Azathioprine, Methotrexate, or Cyclosporine are the medication that can be used for this condition.\n\n【58】What Are the Differential Diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【59】The following are the differential diagnoses associated with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome:\n\n【60】*   **Ischemic Disease:** Such as ischemic hemorrhage (when the blood vessel to the brain is clogged and leaks) or diabetic mononeuropathy.\n\n【61】*   **Syphilis:** It is a sexually transmitted disease caused by bacterial infection.\n\n【62】*   **Basal Meningitis:** This condition usually develops due to the rupture of the intracranial tuberculoma.\n\n【63】*   **Aneurysm:** Aneurysm is an unusual elevation of the blood vessel caused by high blood pressure. Usually, this condition is seen in the brain, behind the knee, intestine, or spleen.\n\n【64】*   **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula:** It is the abrupt joining between the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus.\n\n【65】*   **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis:** It is a fatal condition caused by a blood clot in the cavernous sinus.\n\n【66】*   **Sarcoidosis:** Sarcoidosis is a condition caused by an overgrowth of inflammatory cells in the body. It is usually seen in the lungs, skin, or eyes.\n\n【67】*   **Varicella Zoster:** It is a fatal viral infection caused by the herpes virus.\n\n【68】*   **Polyarteritis Nodosa:** It is a rare condition that causes arterial inflammation and its weakening. It affects multiple systems and organs of the body.\n\n【69】*   **Neurosarcoidosis:** It is the condition where any part of the nervous system has abrupt cell accumulation.\n\n【70】*   **Bechet’s Disease:** It is a rare condition that causes abrupt inflammation of any part of the body.\n\n【71】*   **Myasthenia Gravis:** It is an autoimmune disorder that majorly affects the skeletal muscles of the body.\n\n【72】*   **Lupus:** When the body’s immune system attacks its cells, this condition arises. Lupus affects multiple organs of the body, such as skin, lungs, joints, and blood cells.\n\n【73】*   **Migraine:** It is severe and unbearable throbbing pain of the head, which is usually seen as unilateral.\n\n【74】**Conclusion**\n\n【75】Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a condition that can cause many severe symptoms in the patient. Due to its idiopathic cause, the diagnosis of the condition is very difficult. However, due to the severity and recurrence of the condition, it is essential to follow regular treatment without skipping any dose of the medication. Also, regular follow-up is very important for patients with this condition.\n\n【76】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【77】* * *\n\n【78】#### **1.**删除换行**How to Recover From Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome?**\n\n【79】The first line of treatment involves high-dose oral steroid therapy with glucocorticoids for pain relief after which the dose is decreased gradually over a few weeks or months.

Through a collaborative agreement with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the asthma program has pledged to reduce asthma inequalities and improve access to comprehensive asthma control management.\n\n【2】What Is Asthma?\n---------------\n\n【3】Lung illness asthma, commonly known as bronchial asthma, damages the lungs. It is a chronic condition, which means that it requires ongoing medical care. The muscles surrounding the airways relax when one breathes regularly, allowing air to pass through them silently and effortlessly.\n\n【4】There are three possible outcomes during an asthma attack:\n\n【5】*   **Bronchospasm:** The muscles around the airways tighten in bronchospasm. The airways get more congested as they constrict. Constrictions in the airways prevent the free passage of air.\n\n【6】*   **Inflammation:** The airways' lining swells due to inflammation. Swollen airways restrict the air that may enter or exit the lungs.\n\n【7】*   **Mucus Production**: More mucus is produced by the body during an assault. These heavy mucus blocks airways.\n\n【8】What Signs and Symptoms Are Associated With Asthma?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Individuals who have asthma typically have specific symptoms. Several respiratory illnesses have symptoms and indications similar to these:\n\n【10】*   Pressure, discomfort, or tightness in the chest.\n\n【11】*   Coughing, especially at night.\n\n【12】*   Respiration difficulty.\n\n【13】*   Wheezing.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Asthma During Pregnancy - Signs, Treatment, and Prevention</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Acebutolol - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Drug Warnings, and Precautions</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Asthma and COVID-19</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【15】One might not experience all of these symptoms with every asthma attack. The signs and indicators might change over time when they have chronic asthma. The symptoms of asthma might also alter between bouts.\n\n【16】Why is it Necessary to Have Asthma Control Programs?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Asthma control programs help educate the community to optimize asthma symptom management, lower the likelihood of asthma flare-ups, and lessen side effects from medication. A person with well-controlled asthma should be able to:\n\n【18】1.  Engage in work.\n\n【19】2.  School.\n\n【20】3.  Play.\n\n【21】4.  Sports without experiencing any breathing restrictions.\n\n【22】The four crucial elements of managing asthma are:\n\n【23】1.  Pharmacologic medication.\n\n【24】2.  Controlling asthma triggers.\n\n【25】3.  Monitoring for changes in symptoms or lung function.\n\n【26】4.  Educating patients.\n\n【27】What Are the Goals of Asthma Control Programs?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【28】According to the latest statistics, around 25 million Americans, including over 6 million children, are affected by asthma. Diverse parties interested in bettering asthma management within the framework of current standards of care might come together through the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordination Committee (NAEPPCC).\n\n【29】The asthma control program objectives are to:\n\n【30】*   Increase awareness that asthma is a significant chronic illness among patients, healthcare providers, and the general public.\n\n【31】*   Ensure that patients, families, and the general public know the symptoms and signs of asthma and that medical professionals correctly diagnose patients.\n\n【32】*   Asthma can be effectively controlled by fostering a collaborative relationship between patients, doctors, and other healthcare providers through cutting-edge treatment and education initiatives.\n\n【33】*   Improve the quality of life for asthma patients, lessen the toll that asthma has on society, and decrease the number of fatalities brought on by asthma.\n\n【34】*   The program directs the creation of asthma recommendations, develops tools and resources to implement the standards, plans federal asthma-related initiatives and forges collaborations to achieve these objectives. Representatives from government agencies, medical associations, nonprofit health organizations, and community initiatives, a federal advisory group on asthma, which works to inform patients, medical professionals, and the general public.\n\n【35】*   Collaborating with community and health care systems to offer integrated asthma services that are effective and culturally acceptable to populations who are most impacted by asthma.\n\n【36】*   Enhancing the use of community health workers to address the socioeconomic determinants of health, overcome obstacles to treating asthma, and improve access to medical services.\n\n【37】*   Educating the public about asthma and increasing access to asthma home visiting programs.\n\n【38】*   Encourage medical staff to use guidelines-based asthma care in community health centers and educational institutions.\n\n【39】*   Reducing or eliminating exposure to environmental asthma triggers both indoors and outside.\n\n【40】*   Promote the adoption of and help in promoting the implementation of policies to enhance indoor and outdoor air quality, as well as policies to provide access to affordable and decent housing.\n\n【41】*   Promoting the CDC's EXHALE strategy framework and its all-inclusive approach to managing asthma.\n\n【42】*   Using information to identify and track how asthma management practices influence demographic groups disproportionately impacted by the disease.\n\n【43】*   Evaluating programmatic operations using the CDC's assessment methodology and implementing improvement suggestions.\n\n【44】What Is EXHALE?\n---------------\n\n【45】EXHALE is a collection of six tactics created by the CDC's National Asthma Control Program that help improve asthma control.\n\n【46】*   **Education**: Information about managing asthma.\n\n【47】*   **X- Tinguishing:** Avoiding secondhand smoke exposure and smoking.\n\n【48】*   **Home:** asthma self-management education and home visits for trigger reduction.\n\n【49】*   **Achievement:** Accomplishing medical management based on recommendations.\n\n【50】*   **Linkages:** connections and cross-setting care coordination.\n\n【51】*   **Environmental:** Environmental regulations or best practices to decrease indoor, outdoor, or workplace sources of asthma causes.\n\n【52】How Does the Framework for Asthma Control Programs Design?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】The CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion designed a framework to address risk factors for chronic illness at both the individual and population levels. To maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of public health efforts, the CDC stresses the need to collaborate at both levels.\n\n【54】There are four primary areas where preventative actions are advised. By doing this, public health initiatives are made more organized, focused, and stronger. Expertise is also improved, service gaps are filled, and collaboration is strengthened.\n\n【55】The following domains are being used to describe this strategic plan.\n\n【56】*   **Data and Surveillance:** Track progress, observe trends, and give information for taking action. Share information to enhance health outcomes.\n\n【57】*   **Environmental Strategies:** Encourage healthy habits and reinforce them in communities, childcare facilities, workplaces, and schools. Make people aware of the environmental elements that impact persons who have asthma and the triggers that cause it.\n\n【58】*   **Interventions in the Healthcare System:** Enhance the efficient use of clinical and other preventive services to treat better or ameliorate asthma symptoms, diagnose illness early, and prevent it from occurring in the first place.\n\n【59】*   **Community Initiatives with a Focus on Clinical Services:** Establishing a link between professional services and community initiatives and tools to aid in the prevention and treatment of asthma\n\n【60】How Will Asthma Control Programs Track Progress?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】CDC will use data from partners and itself to monitor the progress toward achieving the ultimate goal. Children with uncontrolled asthma go to the emergency room, urgent care, or are hospitalized. It helps to monitor gains in the health of children with asthma by recording drops in these visits and hospitalizations.\n\n【62】**Conclusion**\n\n【63】Asthma control programs seek to improve the health and quality of life for Americans with asthma. To strengthen asthma monitoring, educate people with asthma and their families, and inform the general public about asthma, the program provides funding to governments, territories, cities, school programs, and non-government groups.\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【65】无关删除-1:<u>*   CDC’s National Asthma Control Program  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/nacp.htm\n*   National Asthma Control Program  \n    https://aafa.org/advocacy/key-issues/federal-funding/national-asthma-control-program/\n*   National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee (NAEPPCC)  \n    https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/national-asthma-education-and-prevention-program-coordinating-committee-naeppcc</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is a BCL-2 inhibitor and works by inhibiting the restoring apoptosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. It is available as a 10 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg film-coated tablet. The U.S Food and Administration (FDA) approved Venetoclax with Rituximab and Obinutuzumab on May 15, 2019, to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The safety of Venetoclax in children is not yet established.\n\n【2】How Does Venetoclax Work?\n-------------------------\n\n【3】Venetoclax belongs to a group of drugs known as B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It functions by preventing the body from using a certain protein that aids in the survival of cancer cells. As a result, cancer cells are killed.\n\n【4】What Is Venetoclax Used For?\n----------------------------\n\n【5】*   To treat adult patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).\n\n【6】*   In patients newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, in combination with drugs Azacitidine, Decitabine, or low-dose Cytarabine, in adults 75 years or older or with comorbidities that hinder the use of intensive induction chemotherapy.\n\n【7】**Dosage:**\n\n【8】Venetoclax is available as 10 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg tablets. Venetoclax is initiated at 20 mg for the treatment of CLL. Over the course of five weeks, the dosage must be gradually increased until it reaches the daily amount of 400 mg.\n\n【9】Follow the instructions given by the doctor or pharmacist for administering the drug.\n\n【10】*   Venetoclax should be taken orally.\n\n【11】*   Administer the drug with a meal and water at about the same time each day.\n\n【12】*   Swallow the tablets as a whole.\n\n【13】*   Avoid chewing, crushing, or breaking the tablet.\n\n【14】*   **Missed dose:** If a dose of the medication is missed within eight hours of the usual time, take the dose at the earliest and resume the usual daily dosing schedule. If a dose is missed by more than 8 hours, do not take the missed dose and resume the usual dosing schedule the next day.\n\n【15】*   **Vomited Dose:** Do not administer a replacement dose; wait until the next scheduled dose is due.\n\n【16】**Warnings:**\n\n【17】*   **Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS):** A condition where a large number of malignant (cancerous) cells are destroyed within a short span resulting in the release of the contents of the destroyed cells into the blood. Symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased urine output, blood in urine, seizures, etc. These symptoms have to be reported immediately for necessary medical intervention. Anti-hyperuricemic medication and enough hydration should be taken in advance. As the overall risk rises, implement more extensive measures (intravenous hydration, frequent monitoring, hospitalization).\n\n【18】*   **Neutropenia:** Keep track of blood counts and look for infection symptoms; treat as a doctor prescribes.\n\n【19】*   **Infections:** Keep an eye out for early warning signs and symptoms of infection and treat immediately. Refrain from treating infections of Grade 3 or above until they have cleared up.\n\n【20】*   **Immunization:** Live attenuated vaccines should not be taken before, during, or after treatment with Venetoclax.\n\n【21】*   **Embryo-Fetal Toxicity:** This may be harmful to developing embryos. Mention the potential danger to a fetus to women who may become pregnant and encourage them to utilize reliable contraception while receiving therapy.\n\n【22】**For Patients:**\n\n【23】**What Is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)?**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia is a type of cancer where white blood cells called B-cells multiply out of control. The B-cells are responsible for making antibodies and fighting infections. In some cases, they may become malignant (cancerous). The exact cause of CLL is not known. However, researchers believe that genetics play a role.\n\n【25】Chronic lymphocytic leukemia occurs when the body produces abnormal B-cells. The symptoms of CLL vary depending on how advanced the disease is. Early symptoms include fatigue, fever, weight loss, night sweats, swollen glands, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms include coughing, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing. CLL can lead to complications, including infection, bleeding, organ failure, and others if left untreated.\n\n【26】To diagnose CLL, doctors use tests to check the number of B-cells in the blood and bone marrow. Doctors also look at the size of the spleen and lymph nodes. A CT scan or MRI may also help determine if the disease has spread outside the lymph nodes. The treatment options for CLL depend on the stage of the disease and include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem cell transplantation, and targeted therapies.\n\n【27】**Learn More About Venetoclax:**\n\n【28】What Are the Drug Warnings and Precautions?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Inform the doctor if any of the following conditions are present,\n\n【30】*   History of allergy to drugs.\n\n【31】*   Have liver diseases, as this may increase the risk for side effects.\n\n【32】*   Have any kidney diseases, as this may increase the risk for a side effect known as tumor lysis syndrome.\n\n【33】*   If currently on therapy with drugs Itraconazole, Posaconazole, Ketoconazole, or Voriconazole for fungal infections, antibiotic Clarithromycin for bacterial infections, or Ritonavir for HIV infection, as they may interact with the drug leading to adverse effects.\n\n【34】*   If an infection is suspected, or the patient has experienced a persistent infection or has experienced recurring infections, the doctor may need to lower the drug dose.\n\n【35】*   If a vaccine is due shortly.\n\n【36】**Starting Venetoclax:**\n\n【37】How Is Venetoclax Given?\n------------------------\n\n【38】The first week of Venetoclax medication will be at a low dose. Over the next four weeks, the doctor will progressively raise the dosage to the full recommended level.\n\n【39】*   Initially, 20 mg (two 10 mg pills) once daily for seven days.\n\n【40】*   **Week 1:** The dosage will be increased to 50 mg (one 50 mg tablet).\n\n【41】*   **Week 2:** The dosage will be increased to 100 mg (one 100 mg tablet).\n\n【42】*   **Week 3:** The dosage will be increased to 200 mg (two 100 mg pills) once daily.\n\n【43】*   **Week 4:** The dosage will be increased to 400 mg (four 100 mg pills).\n\n【44】*   While undergoing Venetoclax treatment alone, continue taking the recommended amount of 400 mg daily for as long as required.\n\n【45】*   Take 400 mg of Venetoclax every day for 24 months if Rituximab is also used as part of the treatment.\n\n【46】*   Take 400 mg daily for roughly ten months while receiving Obinutuzumab and Venetoclax therapy.\n\n【47】*   Due to possible side effects, the dose may need to be changed. The doctor will suggest the required dose.\n\n【48】**How to Take Venetoclax?**\n---------------------------\n\n【49】*   Take the tablets with a meal at around the same time each day.\n\n【50】*   Administer with a glass of water, whole.\n\n【51】*   Never chew, crack, or crush the tablets.\n\n【52】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    After the first chemotherapy session for CLL, my dad has a persistent fever.

Instead, take the next dose at the regular time the following day. Speak with the doctor regarding any queries regarding drug use.\n\n【54】*   Take in a lot of water. At least 1.5 to 2 liters of water should be consumed daily to help the body eliminate cancer cell breakdown components through urine and lower the risk of TLS.\n    </u>\n\n【55】**Things to Do After Starting Venetoclax:**\n\n【56】Following the initiation of Venetoclax medication, the doctor will keep track of the blood count. A decrease in the white blood cell count can raise the risk of infection. A few symptoms include coughing, pain or a burning sensation when passing urine, fever, chills, weakness or confusion, and feeling weak. There is a chance that some infections could be fatal. Report to the doctor if these symptoms arise.\n\n【57】What Are the Side Effects of Venetoclax?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【58】Adverse effects are quite common with chemotherapy. Report to the doctor if these symptoms are experienced.\n\n【59】**Very common :**\n\n【60】*   Pneumonia\n\n【61】*   Fatigue.\n\n【62】*   Upper respiratory tract infection.\n\n【63】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【64】*   Nausea.\n\n【65】*   Vomiting.\n\n【66】*   Constipation.\n\n【67】*   Low blood counts.\n\n【68】*   High potassium levels.\n\n【69】*   High calcium levels.\n\n【70】*   High phosphate levels.\n\n【71】**Common :**\n\n【72】*   Sepsis (severe infection in the blood).\n\n【73】*   Febrile neutropenia (low number of white blood cells with fever).\n\n【74】*   Urinary tract infection\n\n【75】*   High creatinine levels.\n\n【76】*   High urea levels.\n\n【77】**Dietary Alterations:**\n\n【78】Avoid taking grapefruit, starfruit, or their juices while taking Venetoclax, as it may alter the drug's efficacy. The drug should be taken at around the same time each day as instructed by the physician.\n\n【79】What Should Be Done if a Dose Is Missed?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【80】If a dose of the medication is missed within eight hours of the usual time, take the dose as soon as possible and resume the regular daily dosing schedule. If a dose is missed by more than 8 hours, do not take the missed dose and resume the usual dosing schedule the next day.\n\n【81】**What Should Be Done to Treat Venetoclax Overdose?**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【82】If Venetoclax is taken more than the recommended dosage, immediately report it to the doctor or nurse or contact the emergency department.\n\n【83】**How to Store the Venetoclax Tablet?**\n---------------------------------------\n\n【84】*   There are no unique storage requirements for this medication.\n\n【85】*   Keep the drug away from the reach of children and pets.\n\n【86】*   Avoid using the medication after the expiration date, noted on the carton and blister.\n\n【87】*   Never dispose of medications in wastewater or household garbage. Find out from the pharmacist how to dispose of expired medications. These actions will aid in environmental protection.\n\n【88】**Avoid Self-Medication:**\n\n【89】Venetoclax is a highly potent medication that impacts cell growth and proliferation and is only available on a doctor's prescription. Consequently, using this drug without a prescription can result in a number of severe side effects. It is not advisable to take this drug on the advice of another patient or with a prescription written for a different patient.\n\n【90】**For Doctors:**\n\n【91】**Indication:**\n\n【92】Venetoclax is indicated for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in adult patients who have 17p deletion and has received at least one prior therapy.\n\n【93】**Dosing:**\n\n【94】**Premedication:**\n\n【95】In all patients, initiate with Allopurinol or a xanthine oxidase inhibitor two to three days before taking Venetoclax. If a patient has a significant tumor burden, rasburicase should also be considered if their baseline uric acid level is elevated.\n\n【96】**Ramp-Up Dosage:**\n\n【97】The ramp-up schedule is as follows:\n\n【98】20 mg orally once daily for the first week, 50 mg once daily for the second week, 100 mg once daily for the third, 200 mg once daily for the fourth, and 400 mg once daily for the fifth week and above.\n\n【99】**Adult Dosing:**\n\n【100】**Monotherapy:** 400 mg orally once a day following the conclusion of the 5-week ramp-up regimen or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.\n\n【101】**Other Dosing Considerations:**\n\n【102】*   **Mild, Moderate to Severe Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustment is required.\n\n【103】*   **Mild to Moderate Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh A or B):** No specific dosage considerations are required.\n\n【104】*   **Severe Hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C):** Reduce the once-daily dosage by 50 % and monitor for adverse effects.\n\n【105】*   **Geriatric:** No specific recommendations are available.\n\n【106】*   **Hemodialysis:** Dosing information has not been determined.\n\n【107】**Hematologic Toxicity in Patients With CLL:**\n\n【108】*   In patients with Grade 3 neutropenia with infection or fever or Grade 4 toxicities, excluding lymphopenia- resume therapy at the same dosage after a break until resolution to Grade 1 or baseline.\n\n【109】*   The risk of tumor lysis syndrome is to be reassessed to see if dosing should be restarted with a lower dosage if it is halted for longer than a week during the ramp-up phase or for longer than two weeks after the ramp-up phase has ended. If a patient requires a dosage reduction to less than 100 mg once daily for more than two weeks, consider stopping the medication.\n\n【110】**Non-Hematologic Toxicity:**\n\n【111】*   **Grade 3 or 4:** Interrupt therapy until the first episode resolves to Grade 1 or baseline in patients with CLL, then restart at the same dosage.\n\n【112】*   **With Second And Subsequent Occurrences:** Resuming therapy at a lower dosage after a break in treatment till resolution. If the dosage at the time of interruption was 400 mg, start over with 300 mg; if it's 200 mg, start over with 100 mg; if it's 100 mg, start over with 50 mg; if it's 50 mg, start over with 20 mg; and if it's 20 mg, start over with 10 mg. The dose may be required to be reduced further. Continue the reduced dosage during the ramp-up period for a week before raising it.\n\n【113】*   Reassess the risk of tumor lysis syndrome to see if dosing should be restarted with a lower dosage if it is halted for longer than a week during the ramp-up phase or for longer than two weeks after the ramp-up phase has ended. If a patient requires a dosage reduction to less than 100 mg once daily for more than two weeks, consider stopping the medication.\n\n【114】**Tumor Lysis Syndrome in Patients With CLL:**\n\n【115】*   If the blood chemistry changes or symptoms point to TLS (tumor lysis syndrome ), then delay the dose for the following day; if symptoms go away in 24 to 48 hours, resume at the same dose. Continue at a lower dose if blood chemistries do not improve after 48 hours or the symptoms stop. If the dosage at the time of interruption was 400 mg, start over with 300 mg; if it's 200 mg, start over with 100 mg; if it's 100 mg, start over with 50 mg; if it's 50 mg, start over with 20 mg; and if it's 20 mg, start over with 10 mg. Continue the reduced dosage during the ramp-up period for a week before raising it.\n\n【116】*   Reassess the risk of tumor lysis syndrome to see if dosing should be restarted with a lower dosage if it is halted for longer than a week during the ramp-up phase or for longer than two weeks after the ramp-up phase has ended. If a patient requires a dosage reduction to less than 100 mg once daily for more than two weeks, consider stopping the medication.\n\n【117】**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n【118】Venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor. Studies indicate that the overexpression of BCL-2 in CLL cells mediates malignant cell survival and has been linked to chemotherapy resistance.\n\n【119】By directly binding to the BCL-2 protein and displacing pro-apoptotic proteins like BIM, causing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, and activating caspases, Venetoclax aids in the restoration of the apoptotic process. Venetoclax has also exhibited cytotoxic effects in tumor cells that overexpress BCL-2 in nonclinical investigations.\n\n【120】**Pharmacodynamics:**\n\n【121】**Cardiac Electrophysiology:** In an open-label, single-arm trial involving 176 patients, the impact of several doses of Venetoclax up to 1200 mg once daily on the QTc interval was assessed. The QTc interval was unaffected by Venetoclax, and there was no correlation between exposure to Venetoclax and changes in the QTc interval.\n\n【122】**Active Ingredients:**\n\n【123】The active ingredient in all the film-coated tablets is Venetoclax.\n\n【124】**Inactive Ingredients:**\n\n【125】The inactive ingredients in each tablet include,\n\n【126】*   **Tablet Core:** Copovidone, colloidal anhydrous silica, polysorbate 80, anhydrous calcium hydrogen phosphate, sodium stearyl fumarate.\n\n【127】*   **Film-Coating:** Iron oxide yellow, titanium dioxide, polyvinyl alcohol, macrogol 3350, and talc.\n\n【128】**Pharmacokinetics:**\n\n【129】**Absorption:**\n\n【130】Maximum plasma concentration of Venetoclax was attained 5 to 8 hours after dosing after several oral administrations under fed conditions. Over the 150 to 800 mg dosing range, the Venetoclax steady-state AUC increased proportionately. Compared to the fasting state, treatment with a low-fat meal raised Venetoclax exposure by around 3.4 times, and administration with a high-fat meal increased Venetoclax exposure by 5.1 to 5.3 times.\n\n【131】**Distribution:**\n\n【132】The drug is highly bound to human plasma protein, and the mean blood-to-plasma ratio was\n\n【133】estimated to be 0.57.\n\n【134】**Metabolism:**\n\n【135】Studies conducted in vitro showed that CYP3A4/5 is the primary metabolizer of Venetoclax. M27 was a significant plasma metabolite with a BCL-2 inhibitory activity at least 58-fold lower than Venetoclax in vitro.\n\n【136】**Excretion:**\n\n【137】Venetoclax is removed from the systemic circulation through hepatic elimination. Twenty-eight percent of the radioactive dose delivered was eliminated in feces as unchanged Venetoclax.\n\n【138】**Toxicity:**\n\n【139】*   **Carcinogenicity:** No investigations on Venetoclax's carcinogenicity have been reported.\n\n【140】*   **Mutagenicity:** In an in vitro chromosome aberration assay employing human peripheral blood lymphocytes, Venetoclax did not cause any structural or numerical mutations, and at doses up to 835 mg/kg in a mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, it did not have any clastogenic effects.\n\n【141】*   **Impairment of Fertility:** Based on tests in male and female mice, Venetoclax did not affect estrus cycles, mating, fertility, uterine implants, or live embryos per litter at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. However, testicular toxicity (loss of germ cells) shown in dogs at doses as low as 0.5 times the human AUC exposure at the advised dose suggests a potential risk to male fertility in humans.\n\n【142】*   **Animal Toxicology:** Venetoclax produced single-cell necrosis in various tissues, including the exocrine pancreas, the stomach, and the gallbladder, in dogs, although there was no sign of any damage to organ function or disruption of tissue integrity. Minimal single-cell necrosis was still visible in some tissues after a 4-week and 4-week recovery period, and longer dosing or recovery times were not tested for reversibility. Additionally, Venetoclax produced increasing white discoloration of the hair coat in dogs after around three months of daily treatment due to loss of melanin pigment.\n\n【143】**Warning and Precaution:**\n\n【144】*   **Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS):** TLS has been reported, including fatal events and renal failure requiring dialysis; it may happen as soon as 6 hours after the first dose and is most likely to occur during the initiation and dose ramp-up phase in all patients as well as during the reinitiation after dosage interruptions in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma; risk is based on tumor burden and type of malignancy and increases with reduced renal function. Evaluate the risk for TLS; prophylactic TLS treatment is advised, as is monitoring; treatment, dosage change, or interruption may be required.\n\n【145】*   **Hematologic:** Monitoring is advised, and treatment, dosage adjustment, or discontinuation may be required. Neutropenia has been recorded and may return with consecutive cycles of medication.\n\n【146】*   **Immunologic:** Serious and fatal infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, have been recorded; monitoring is advised; treatment, therapy cessation, and dose adjustment may be required.\n\n【147】*   **Reproductive:** The drug may cause heam to the fetus. Sexually active women should use effective contraception for treatment at least 30 days after the last dose.\n\n【148】*   **Concomitant Use:** Before, during, or after therapy, avoid giving live attenuated vaccinations until B-cell recovery occurs. Use with grapefruit products, Seville oranges, strong or moderate CYP3A inducers, P-gp substrates, and starfruit should be avoided.\n\n【149】**Contraindications:**\n\n【150】Venetoclax is contraindicated with potent CYP3A inhibitors simultaneously in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma throughout the first phase of the dosage regimen and during the ramp-up phase.\n\n【151】**Dosage Form:**\n\n【152】Venetoclax is a round, biconvex, light yellow film-coated tablet debossed with \"V\" on one side and \"dose\" on the other.\n\n【153】**Clinical Studies:**\n\n【154】A study was conducted with 432 individuals with previously untreated CLL and associated medical problems randomized (1:1), open-label, multicenter, actively controlled trial of Venetoclax combined with Obinutuzumab (VEN+G) versus Obinutuzumab combined with Chlorambucil (GClb).\n\n【155】**Results:**\n\n【156】Progression-free survival (PFS), as determined by an independent review committee, was the primary efficacy endpoint. The experiment showed that patients who received VEN+G compared to those who received GClb had significantly longer PFS. In the trial, rates of minimal residual disease negative (less than one CLL cell per 104 leukocytes) in the bone marrow and peripheral blood showed statistically significant improvements.\n\n【157】**Other Specifications:**\n\n【158】**Venetoclax in Pregnant Women:**\n\n【159】No information regarding Venetoclax safety in expectant mothers is available. For at least thirty days following treatment with the drug, women of reproductive age must take a highly effective form of contraception to prevent pregnancy.\n\n【160】**Venetoclax in Lactating Women:**\n\n【161】It is unknown if the active ingredient in the drug enters breast milk. Hence, advise the patient to avoid breastfeeding while using this medication.\n\n【162】**Venetoclax in Pediatric Patients:**\n\n【163】The efficacy and safety of the drug are not established in pediatric patients.\n\n【164】**Venetoclax in Geriatric Patients:**\n\n【165】There were no overall differences between older and younger patients regarding safety and efficacy.\n\n【166】What Are the Drug Interactions of Venetoclax?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【167】The drug interactions of Venetoclax are as listed below:\n\n【168】**1\\.

The bacteria causing the infection are salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, escherichia, and yersinia. The common symptoms include fever, severe abdominal pain, and tenesmus. Diagnostic tests include rectal swabs and stool culture. These infections are self-limiting; hence antibiotics are used for the treatment.\n\n【2】What Are the Bacterial Infections of the Colon?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Bacterial infections of the colon are known as bacterial colitis and are also referred to as acute infectious bacterial diarrhea. It is a common problem globally and in general practice. These infections occur in children, elderly people, and immunocompromised individuals. The transmission mode of infection is the fecal-oral route, ingestion of contaminated water and food, animal hosts, and close contact with an infected person.\n\n【4】Bacterial diarrhea is of two types - inflammatory and non-inflammatory.\n\n【5】*   **Inflammatory Diarrhea:** It is caused by salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, yersinia, chlamydia tuberculosis, Neisseria, and escherichia coli. It is characterized by bloody, mucopurulent stool associated with fever, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.\n\n【6】*   **Non-inflammatory Diarrhea:** It is caused by escherichia coli and staphylococcus pathogens that cause an alteration in the absorption and secretion process of the bowel, resulting in watery diarrhea without illness.\n\n【7】What Are the Bacteria Involved in Causing Infection and Its Symptoms?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】*   **Campylobacter:** They are gram-positive, microaerophilic, curved bacteria. The common species is Campylobacter jejuni. The transmission occurs through contamination and ingestion of undercooked chicken.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Respiratory Bacterial Infections in Cystic Fibrosis</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Understanding Antibiotics - How They Work, Side Effects, and Antibiotic Resistance</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Pasteurella Infection - A Bacterial Infection From the Pets</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    *   **Symptoms**: Dysentery, asymptomatic or watery diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and bloody stool. It resolves within a week or two. Chronic and recurrent diarrhea occurs in immunocompromised patients.</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    *   **Complications**: Pancreatitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemolytic uremic syndrome, toxic megacolon, meningitis, and purulent arthritis.</u>\n*   **Salmonella:** Salmonella is a rod-shaped, gram-negative bacterium. These bacteria are associated with enterocolitis, gastroenteritis, and focal infections such as meningitis, cholangitis, pneumonia, and septic arthritis. In addition, salmonella typhi and paratyphi are involved in typhoid fever. The infection through salmonella bacteria is usually food-borne, and the modes of transmission are flies, fingers, feces, food, and fomites. Salmonella enteritidis and salmonella typhimurium are the common species causing enterocolitis. The carriers of the bacteria are mostly poultry, household pets, and lizards. S.typhi causes typhoid fever, which is very common.\n\n【10】    *   Symptoms: Vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. The symptoms appear after 8 to 48 hours of ingesting contaminated food and last for three to five days in the case of gastroenteritis and two to three weeks in the case of enterocolitis.\n    *   Bacteremia is a salmonella infection complication resulting in meningitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, focal abscess, and arteritis.\n    *   Predisposing factors: Hemolytic anemia, sickle cell anemia, and immunosuppression (chemotherapy, corticosteroids, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).\n    *   Clinical manifestations of S. typhi are typhoid fever, abdominal pain, delirium, splenomegaly, skin rashes, and bacteremia.\n*   **Shigella:** Shigellais a gram-negative enteric group of organisms that causes gastrointestinal illnesses ranging from mild diarrhea to severe dysentery. It is an endemic disease affecting more than six lakh people yearly. Although shigella is contagious and needs a small number of inocula to yield its symptoms, it spreads rapidly from person to person with oral-anal and fecal-oral contacts. It is commonly seen in nursery schools, male homosexuals, and daycare centers.\n\n【11】    *   Symptoms: Dysentery with crampy abdominal pain, fever, rectal burning, and bloody mucoid stools.\n    *   Severe complications include intestinal proliferation, septic shock, hypoglycemia, seizures, profound dehydration, and encephalopathy. If left untreated, shigellosis is confused with ulcerative colitis.\n*   **Escherichia Coli:** These are normal microflora of the human intestine. They are harmless in the bowel. Five species cause infections, which are the primary reservoir of infection in cattle. The infection is caused by consuming contaminated food and undercooked beef.\n\n【12】    *   Its symptoms are similar to inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic colitis, or pseudomembranous colitis, such as diarrhea with or without blood, vomiting, fever, and thrombocytopenia.\n*   **Yersinia:** Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis are anaerobic gram-negative bacilli similar to E.coli. Yersinia enterocolitis resembles enteritis and appendicitis because of its prevalence, and it is essential to understand the infection. This infection occurs through hand-to-mouth transfer, fecal-oral route, or contaminated food or water.\n    *   Symptoms: Fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n*   **Chlamydia:** Chlamydia species are intracellular, obligate organisms and asymptomatic infected persons are the reservoir for infection transmission.\n\n【13】    *   Symptoms: Bloody diarrhea, mucopurulent anal discharge, tenesmus, and rectal pain. Mild to severe ulcerative proctocolitis. Perianal fistula formation and stricture formation.</u>\n\n【14】How to Diagnose the Infection of the Colon?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Diagnosis of bacterial infection:\n\n【16】*   Campylobacter infection in colitis is diagnosed by stool examination showing erythrocytes and leukocytes. Colonoscopy examination shows loss of vascular pattern with ulceration, segmental edema, and patchy colonic mucosa. In addition, the stool culture of C. jejuni shows the growth of enteric bacteria.\n\n【17】*   The isolation of bacteria detects salmonella infection. Blood cultures are positive for salmonella. Stool culture and rectal swabs, and endoscopic biopsies are influential in salmonellosis. Nontyphoidal infections show friability of mucosa, hyperemia, ulcerations, aphthous erosions, and deep fissures of the colon involved.\n\n【18】*   Shigella is diagnosed based on a history of symptoms like abdominal pain, rectal burning, and diarrhea. Stool culture shows red blood cells and leukocytes. A colonoscopy shows edema, erythema, hemorrhagic spots, mucosal friability, erosions, and ulcers.\n\n【19】*   Stool cultures confirm E.coli infection. A colonoscopy shows shallow ulcerations, marked edema, mucosal hyperemia, erosions, hemorrhage, and ulcer-like lesions throughout the colon. CT scan reveals a target sign of diffuse colon wall thickening.\n\n【20】*   Yersinia infection is diagnosed by stool examination. Hemagglutination is a specific test to diagnose Yersinia infection. Colonoscopy shows oval yellow aphthae of the colon, round or oval elevations with or without ulcerations in the ileum, similar to Crohn’s disease.\n\n【21】*   Diagnosis of chlamydia infection includes the culture of stool or rectal swabs onto McCoy cells. A colonoscopy shows inflammatory changes with mucosal friability and minor erosions in the distal rectum.\n\n【22】What Is the Treatment?\n----------------------\n\n【23】*   **Campylobacter Infection:** Treatment involves antibiotic therapy, although the disease is self-limiting. Quinolone is the drug of choice for campylobacter infection. In case of resistance to fluoroquinolones, Azithromycin is effective.\n\n【24】*   **Salmonella Infection:** Treatment includes using Amoxicillin, Quinolones, or Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole as first-line antibiotics. For severe infection, cases of third-generation cephalosporins or quinolones are prescribed.\n\n【25】*   **Shigella Infection:** Treatment is started with resuscitation and therapy for severe complications such as encephalopathy, seizures, and intestinal perforation. Quinolones are the drug of choice to treat shigella infection in adults and Azithromycin in children.\n\n【26】*   **E. Coli Infection:** Treatment depends on the severity of hemorrhagic colitis and the frequency of complications. Antibiotics such as Ciprofloxacin are used to treat infections.\n\n【27】*   **Yersinia Infection:** This infection is self-limiting. In prolonged cases, it is treated using antibiotics such as Doxycycline, aminoglycosides, or fluoroquinolones.\n\n【28】*   **Chlamydia Infection:** Treatment with Tetracycline or Doxycycline is the choice of treatment. For patients intolerant to Tetracycline; fluoroquinolones are used.\n\n【29】How to Prevent the Infection?\n-----------------------------\n\n【30】The bacterial infections are prevented by:\n\n【31】*   Safe handling of food.\n\n【32】*   Boiling and proper cooking of poultry, egg, beef, and pork.\n\n【33】*   Washing of hands after toilet use or diaper change.\n\n【34】**Conclusion:**\n\n【35】Salmonella, E.coli, shigella, yersinia, and campylobacter species cause bacterial infection of the colon. The infection is transmitted from one person to another, the fecal-oral route, and hand to mouth. The leading carriers are animals like cattle, pets, poultry, and humans. These are usually self-limiting infections that are treated with antibiotic therapy after proper examination and diagnosis. If not treated, they cause severe complications.\n\n【36】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>*   Bacterial Colitis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2780149/\n*   Bacterial gastroenteritis  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000254.htm\n*   Infections of the Small Intestine  \n    https://muschealth.org/medical-services/ddc/patients/digestive-diseases/small-intestine/infections-of-the-small-intestine</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Major bursae are in the shoulders, knees, elbows, and feet. Bursae provide a cushion-like effect and help reduce the friction between the tissues. Inflammation of the bursa is termed bursitis; it can be rapid in onset (acute) or occur slowly over time (chronic). Acute bursitis is due to injury or infection, and chronic bursitis may occur following repetitive use, movement, or compression.\n\n【2】What Is Knee Bursitis?\n----------------------\n\n【3】Inflammation of the bursa located near the knee joint or the tendons of the hamstrings is termed knee bursitis. It is also known as Pes Anserine bursitis or goosefoot bursitis. Most commonly affected are the bursae over the kneecap or below the knee joint.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Knee Bursitis?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【5】Causes of knee bursitis include:\n\n【6】*   Trauma or any injury, such as a fall or a hit, may be associated with bleeding.\n\n【7】*   Infection in the affected area leads to the penetration of the microorganism into the deeper tissues, known as septic bursitis.\n\n【8】*   Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.\n\n【9】*   Sitting for long periods can put prolonged pressure on the knee.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Physical Therapy for Pain</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Overuse, repeated movements, or strain on the bursa.\n\n【11】*   Abnormal posture or walking manner can result in joint stress leading to inflammation of the bursa.\n    </u>\n\n【12】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Knee Bursitis?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The signs and symptoms vary depending on the bursa affected and the cause of inflammation. It includes:\n\n【14】*   Pain on movement and rest.\n\n【15】*   Increase in the intensity of pain over time.\n\n【16】*   Tender and warm on touch.\n\n【17】*   Swelling and redness of the affected area.\n\n【18】*   Fever and chills.\n\n【19】*   Stiffness and limited range of motion.\n\n【20】*   Inability to kneel or bend.\n\n【21】What Are the Risk Factors of Knee Bursitis?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【22】There are several risk factors associated with knee bursitis, which include:\n\n【23】*   **Joint Diseases:** Diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, etc. are disorders that affect the joints causing pain and inflammation; these may increase the risk of bursitis or aggravate if the patient is already suffering from bursitis.\n\n【24】*   **Previous Surgery:** Prosthetic joint implants or previous joint surgeries can irritate the tissues, or a restricted range of motion post-surgery can lead to the development of bursitis.\n\n【25】*   **Obesity:** In some elderly, obesity can be a problem; lack of activity and increased pressure on the hips and knees can result in bursitis.\n\n【26】*   **Physical Activity:** Repetitive motion during any physical activity, occupation, or hobby, such as gardening, painting, etc. can result in bursitis.\n\n【27】*   **Medical Conditions:** People suffering from spinal diseases, limb discrepancies, and metabolic disorders such as diabetes are at risk of developing bursitis.\n\n【28】*   **Bone Spurs:** Excessive calcium deposits, bone spurs (bumps or projections of bone) near a bursa can irritate, leading to bursitis and affecting movement.\n\n【29】How Is Knee Bursitis Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------\n\n【30】Knee bursitis can be diagnosed by medical history, signs and symptoms, and certain diagnostic procedures, which include:\n\n【31】*   **Radiological Examination:** Diagnostic tests, such as X-rays, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are considered in cases of trauma and can help rule out swelling or tears, or joint abnormalities, which in turn cause knee bursitis. Ultrasound is recommended to visualize the fat tissues overlying a bursa, which helps differentiate cellulitis from infectious bursitis.\n\n【32】*   **Joint Aspiration:** During this test, the fluid from the swollen joints is aspirated using a fine needle and sent to the laboratories to check the cell count and cell culture and detect the presence of infection in cases of suspected septic bursitis and rule out conditions such as gout or other infectious diseases.\n\n【33】How Can Knee Bursitis Be Managed in Older People?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Most cases of bursitis heal themselves; however, various modalities have been tried to reduce the patient's suffering, especially pain in the affected area. Suppose pain and swelling persist for a long duration. In that case, it is recommended to consult a healthcare provider, as untreated bursitis can lead to permanent thickening or enlargement of the bursa leading to chronic pain and muscle atrophy (decreased use of the joint, leading to loss of surrounding muscle). Treatment options:\n\n【35】*   **Ice Packs:** The most common initial approach in managing knee bursitis in older people is conservative treatment by using compression or ice packs and elevation of the affected parts, relieving pain. It is important to explain to the patients to rest adequately and not to move the affected area vigorously. This type of treatment is known as RICE therapy.\n\n【36】*   **Medications:** Drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Naproxen, etc. are the first choice in managing pain. Corticosteroid injections can be administered alone or with local anesthetics for inflammation of the bursa in the deeper tissues. Corticosteroids are often avoided for superficial bursa as they may be associated with a risk of complications such as injury to the local tendon, septic bursitis, atrophy of the skin, or the development of sinus tracts. Oral or systemic antibiotics can be administered in patients with septic bursitis caused by gram-negative organisms.\n\n【37】*   **Surgery:** In cases of septic bursitis that are not resolved by either oral or systemic antibiotics, it may require surgical excision. The procedure involves placing the patient's supine position and applying a tourniquet on the thigh. After the surgical area is cleaned under aseptic precautions, local anesthesia is administered. Surgery can be either open or laparoscopic, wherein a motorized shaver is introduced through a portal, and total bursa removal is done, known as bursectomy. This is followed by the application of surgery ports, which will be sutured with the help of adhesive tapes.\n\n【38】*   **Physical Therapy:** It includes stretching and other range-of-motion exercises, which can help reduce pain and improve the patient's condition.\n\n【39】*   **Padding:** If the bursa is superficial in location, sufficient protection can be provided by pads, cushions, and custom-fitted braces to prevent pressure on the knee.\n\n【40】How Can Knee Bursitis Be Prevented?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【41】Patients must be educated to avoid activities that cause pain; or repetitive motions during physical activities and take frequent breaks in between. In addition, following a healthy diet and maintaining body weight can reduce pressure in the areas where bursitis may develop.\n\n【42】**Conclusion**\n\n【43】Inflammation of small fluid sacs called bursa near the knee joint is called knee bursitis. It is caused due to infection, trauma, overuse, or conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is associated with pain, inflammation, fever, stiffness, and limited range of motion. It is usually managed conservatively; however, some severe cases may require surgical intervention. Physical exercises and a healthy lifestyle can help prevent knee bursitis in older adults.\n\n【44】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【45】* * *\n\n【46】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Symptoms of Knee Bursitis Felt Like?**\n\n【47】When one applies pressure to the affected area of the knee, it may generally feel warm, sensitive, and swollen. In addition, pain can occur even while at rest or during activity. The symptoms of a knee injury may manifest quickly. The discomfort is typically not as severe as knee joint inflammation (arthritis), though. It typically results in more discomfort when kneeling and can make walking painful and stiff.\n\n【48】#### **2.**删除换行**How Is Knee Bursitis Treated?**\n\n【49】Given enough rest and rehabilitation, most knee bursitis cases recover quickly. Moreover, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, are frequently used to treat the symptoms of knee bursitis. In addition to the foregoing more conservative therapies, the doctor may advise corticosteroid injections if the knee bursitis persists or becomes chronic.\n\n【50】#### **3.**删除换行**What Are the Three Primary Signs of Bursitis?**\n\n【51】The three primary signs of knee bursitis are warm, tender, and swollen knees when applying pressured to them.\n\n【52】#### **4.**删除换行**How to Know if Knee Bursitis Is Serious?**\n\n【53】Severe joint discomfort, abrupt immobility of a joint. Extreme redness, bruising, swelling, or rash in the afflicted area can manifest. In addition, it can result in serious and fatal consequences, including septic shock, if left untreated.\n\n【54】#### **5.**删除换行**How Can One Know if Knee Pain Is Bursitis?**\n\n【55】Knee bursitis symptoms include pain, swelling, redness, and warmth near the affected area. The presence of a lump the size of a lime or grapefruit in the front of the knee may indicate knee bursitis. The pain may get worse with activities and might be extremely intense. Additionally, one can have trouble bending or straightening the knee.\n\n【56】#### **6.**删除换行**How Long Does Knee Bursitis Take To Heal?**\n\n【57】Knee bursitis can typically be resolved with the right care in two to eight weeks. For a quick recovery, one must engage in the appropriate strengthening, stretching, and exercising. It is advised not to engage in any activity or apply any pressure on the affected area that could hurt.  \nIt is recommended to apply ice or cold packs when one feels discomfort in their muscles or close to a joint. One may also take painkillers, perform daily range-of-motion exercises, and are advised to refrain from smoking. Medical attention could be required if symptoms last longer than 2 or 3 weeks after starting rest and home treatment.\n\n【58】#### **7.**删除换行**Would Knee Bursitis Resolve on Its Own?**\n\n【59】Bursitis typically heals on its own. Uncomfortable symptoms can be reduced with conservative methods like rest, ice, and pain medication. With rest and at-home care, the swelling and other symptoms may subside in a few weeks. Medical attention could be necessary if symptoms persist for more than two or three weeks after beginning rest and home treatment.\n\n【60】#### **8.**删除换行**Is It Safe to Walk With Knee Bursitis?**\n\n【61】Being in one position for an extended period or taking long walks can irritate the bursa and exacerbate discomfort by placing pressure on it. Walking can worsen knee bursitis symptoms, so paying attention to the body and resting if discomfort arises is crucial. On the other hand, walking is not likely to worsen the condition of the joints and might even aid in lessening inflammation.\n\n【62】#### **9.**删除换行**Which Conditions Trigger Knee Bursitis?**\n\n【63】Adults frequently get bursitis, especially beyond the age of 40. It's typically caused by repeatedly applying pressure to the same spot or overusing a joint, especially when kneeling on hard surfaces. Vigorous activity, overuse, or a forceful hit to the knee.\n\n【64】#### **10.**删除换行**What Kind of Exercise Is Best for Knee Bursitis?**\n\n【65】The best exercises to perform for knee bursitis are heel slides, straight-leg lifts, and quad sets. It is advised to stay away from impact-heavy activities like running, jumping, and engaging in sports. If one engages in these kinds of activities, it is advised to be careful to stretch well before and after. People with knee bursitis should choose low-impact exercises such as walking, swimming, and biking.\n\n【66】#### **11.**删除换行**What to Anticipate After Receiving a Knee Cortisone Injection for Knee Bursitis?**\n\n【67】Injections into the bursa are a secure way to alleviate bursitis pain. A day or two after the injection, one can suffer pain, bruising, or swelling in the joint. Infection is also a small but real possibility. For about 48 hours, one should avoid engaging in strenuous activity involving the knee.

They are open bumps on the skin filled with excess oil and dead skin. They may look as if dirt is in the bumps, but they do not signify poor hygiene or dirt on the skin. They frequently occur on the face, particularly on and around the nose. They can also appear on other body parts, such as the back, chest, neck, arms, and shoulders. Blackheads affect almost everyone during their lives. However, they are more frequent among teenagers and young adults undergoing hormonal changes. Blackheads are not contagious and cannot spread from one person to another through skin-to-skin contact.\n\n【2】What Causes Blackheads?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】Blackheads are open comedones that occur when a hair follicle or sebaceous gland becomes inflamed due to the following reasons:\n\n【4】*   Increased sebum production by the sebaceous gland.\n\n【5】*   Abnormal keratin build-up.\n\n【6】*   Increased hormones can cause increased sebum production during teenage, menstruation, or while taking birth control pills.\n\n【7】*   The build-up of the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes on the skin causes acne.\n\n【8】*   Certain drugs, like corticosteroids, lithium, or androgens.\n\n【9】What Are the Symptoms of Blackheads?\n------------------------------------\n\n【10】The other common symptoms of blackheads include:\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>There are lots of scars and blackheads on my face.

Please advice.\n\n【16】*   The main characteristics of blackheads are dark, open bumps on the skin. They appear black due to the oxidation of debris, like oil, dirt, dead skin, and bacteria. They are easy to spot because of their dark color.\n\n【17】*   They are not painful like pimples and do not cause discomfort like whiteheads.\n\n【18】How Are Blackheads Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------\n\n【19】Blackheads are often easy to recognize from their appearance, so seeing a healthcare professional to diagnose them is not needed.\n\n【20】How Are Blackheads Treated?\n---------------------------\n\n【21】Over-the-Counter Medications: Various non-prescription medications can treat blackheads. They work by killing bacteria, removing excess oil, and forcing the skin to shed dead skin cells. These drugs contain ingredients such as:\n\n【22】*   **Salicylic Acid:** This is available as a cleanser or lotion. It effectively removes the top layer of damaged skin. In addition, the acid dissolves dead skin cells to prevent the hair follicles from clogging.\n\n【23】*   **Azelaic Acid:** Barley, wheat, rye, and various grains naturally contain azelaic acid. It kills microorganisms on the skin and helps reduce swelling.\n\n【24】*   **Benzoyl Peroxide:** This over-the-counter product is a leave-on gel or wash. It works by targeting the surface bacteria which aggravate acne. However, these formulations may irritate the skin.\n\n【25】*   **Retinoids (Vitamin A Derivatives):** Retinoids break up blackheads and help prevent clogged pores. There may be a slight change in skin color or peeling. Using retinoids every alternate day or simultaneously as a moisturizer can lessen these side effects.\n\n【26】If the blackheads do not go away with over-the-counter medications, the healthcare provider may recommend stronger prescription medications, like:\n\n【27】*   **Prescription-Strength Retinoids:** Prescription-strength retinoids are stronger than non-prescription retinoids. These medications contain vitamin A, keep plugs from forming in the hair follicles and promote a more rapid turnover of skin cells.\n*   **Oral Antibiotics:** Oral antibiotics help reduce the blackhead-causing bacteria.\n\n【28】*   **Microdermabrasion:** This procedure involves using a special instrument to sand the top layers of the skin. Sanding the top layers of the skin removes clogs that contribute to blackheads.\n\n【29】*   **Chemical Peels:** These peels use a mild chemical solution to eliminate clogs and dead skin cells that cause blackheads. While mild peels are available over the counter, dermatologists or other medical professionals perform stronger chemical peels. Over time, the skin's top layers get shed, revealing smoother skin underneath.\n\n【30】*   **Laser Skin Resurfacing:** This procedure directs short, concentrated, pulsating tiny light beams at the blackheads to reduce the oil produced by sebaceous glands and kill bacteria.\n\n【31】**Home Remedies:** A few home remedies may help get rid of blackheads, such as:\n\n【32】*   **Tea Tree Oil:** Tea tree oil is known to prevent or stop the growth of bacteria.\n\n【33】*   **Sugar or Salt Scrubs:** They scrape away the dead cells on the skin's surface.\n\n【34】*   **Green Tea:** It is an excellent antioxidant. Wet green tea leaves effectively reduce oil production in the skin.\n\n【35】A dermatologist should remove deep blackheads. They use a small instrument with rigid metal loops on the ends called a blackhead or comedo extractor and apply even pressure to the blackheads. These tools safely remove the entire blackhead and reduce the risk of returning.\n\n【36】How Long Does a Blackhead Take To Go Away?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Blackheads can go away on their own. It typically depends on how deep the blackheads are in the skin. Blackheads close to the skin's surface are more likely to go away naturally. However, deeply embedded blackheads are less likely to resolve on their own. A dermatologist can help get rid of these deeply embedded blackheads. In the meantime, be patient and do not try self-medication. Blackheads can take six to eight weeks to go away completely. Apply the products that suit the face because certain cosmetic products may cause the skin to break out. Contact a dermatologist if the blackheads do not go away even after two months of at-home treatments or if they worsen or become painful. The dermatologist may prescribe medications or recommend in-office procedures, such as microdermabrasion, chemical peeling, or laser treatment.\n\n【38】How Are Blackheads Prevented?\n-----------------------------\n\n【39】Preventing blackheads is difficult. But a few things can help, like:\n\n【40】*   Thoroughly cleanse the face with warm water and a gentle facial cleanser that does not irritate the skin.\n\n【41】*   Routinely use moisturizer.\n\n【42】*   Choose oil-free or noncomedogenic makeup or other skin care products to avoid worsening the problem. Skin products that contain oil can contribute to new blackheads.\n\n【43】*   Remove makeup at the end of the day, and wash your face with a gentle cleanser.\n\n【44】*   Keep the hands away from the face.\n\n【45】**Conclusion**\n\n【46】Blackheads are a common skin concern, especially among teenagers and young adults. They frequently occur on the face, particularly on and around the nose, and other body parts, such as the back, chest, neck, arms, and shoulders. While they do not cause harm, they can be annoying. Certain prescription and non-prescription medications and in-office procedures can help eliminate blackheads. In addition, a good skincare routine can help avoid blackheads.

During constipation, your child may have a hard poop and may not go to the toilet regularly. They are more frequent, particularly when they begin to take solid foods and around the time of toilet training. Let us get into the article for detailed information about constipation and its warning signs that may help the parents to take care of their constipated child.\n\n【2】What Is Constipation?\n---------------------\n\n【3】Constipation is when a child experiences hard, dry stools with fewer bowel movements that may be painful and difficult to pass out. Normally, a breastfed baby may poop after each meal, whereas bottle-fed and older children will poop once a day or two. Generally, during the first month after birth, bowel movements tend to be once daily.\n\n【4】Before learning more about constipation, many may wonder what is the meaning of bowel we are talking about?\n\n【5】What Is Meant by Bowel and What Is the Normal Pattern?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Here is the answer to this question. Bowel patterns or movements define how and when the stools are passed. It may vary in each child, like the adults. Some children may have one or two bowel movements a day, and some have once every two days or three days.\n\n【7】What Causes Constipation in Your Baby?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【8】When the stool or feces remains in the colon for a longer time, it absorbs more water and leaves the stool dry and hard. This causes difficulty in passing through the colon, causing constipation. Some of the other causes are:\n\n【9】*   Not taking adequate water and fluids.\n\n【10】*   Lack of fiber-rich food in your child's diet. Also, due to soft drinks, junk foods, etc.\n\n【11】*   Switching to solid foods or from breastmilk to formula milk.\n\n【12】*   Lack of physical activity in your baby. Exercises help to move the digested food through the intestines.\n\n【13】*   Your child may ignore the urge to poop as they may be engaged in play or uncomfortable using public toilets.\n\n【14】*   Sometimes the child withholds the painful bowel movements and hard stools.\n\n【15】*   Some children may be allergic to cow’s milk. Consumption of too many dairy products may result in constipation.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Is my 8 months old baby suffering from Hirschsprung's disease or severe constipation?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I have biloma, stomach pain and hard stools post gallbladder removal.

They are:\n\n【18】*   Bowel diseases affect the bowel muscles, intestinal tract, anus, and rectum.\n\n【19】*   The use of certain medications such as antidepressants and iron supplements can cause constipation.\n\n【20】*   Neurological problems, cerebral palsy, etc.\n\n【21】How to Identify Constipation in Your Baby?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Some children may strain and cry when they have a bowel movement. This does not mean it is constipation. As long as the stool is soft, there is likely no problem.\n\n【23】Some signs that help you to identify constipation in your baby are:\n\n【24】*   Hard and dry stools.\n\n【25】*   Difficulty in passing out stools. Pain during bowel movements.\n\n【26】*   Being very restless, changing their body positions and clenching their buttocks during bowel movements.\n\n【27】*   Belly pain, cramps, and bloating.\n\n【28】*   Liquid or stool traces in their underwear. It is a sign of stool backed up in the rectum.\n\n【29】*   Blood in the stool.\n\n【30】*   Not feeling hungry.\n\n【31】*   Having less than three bowel movements in a week.\n\n【32】*   Anal fissures are caused due to strainful passage of large stools.\n\n【33】What Is Encopresis?\n-------------------\n\n【34】When your child faces constipation for a longer duration, it causes them to soil their pants with poop. This occurs when the child's rectum gets full with stools and is stretched. This makes them poop in their pants even without their awareness. This is called \"encopresis\" or \"fecal incontinence.\"\n\n【35】How Does the Doctor Diagnose Constipation?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【36】The doctor diagnoses constipation in your baby from the history you provide them. So keep a record of all the things you notice during constipation. Things to be told to the doctor are\n\n【37】*   If there was any dietary change, you made it for your baby.\n\n【38】*   Frequency of bowel movements.\n\n【39】*   Pain felt while pooping.\n\n【40】*   Were there any toilet training practices done recently?\n\n【41】*   Were there any stressful events in your child's life recently?\n\n【42】This history helps the doctor to provide a clear diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n【43】What Are the Tests Done to Know the Cause of Constipation in Your Child?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】1.  **Abdominal X-Ray:** To check the amount of stool present in the large intestine.\n\n【45】2.  **Digital Rectal Examination (DRE):** The doctor puts his gloved, greased finger into the child's rectum to detect any abnormalities.\n\n【46】3.  **Barium Enema:** It is an X-ray examination of the rectum, large intestine, and lower parts of the small intestine. Barium is a metallic fluid taken in a tube and inserted into the child's rectum. This barium coats the organs and can be examined. It shows any narrow areas, blockage, or any other problems.\n\n【47】4.  **Anorectal Manometry:** This test checks the strength of the bowel muscles and your child’s ability to sense that rectum is full.\n\n【48】5.  **Sigmoidoscopy:** Sigmoidoscope is a short, flexible, lighted tube inserted into the child's rectum. This blows air into the rectum causing it to swell for easier examination.\n\n【49】6.  **Colonoscopy:** This test checks the full length of the large intestine for any abnormal growth, tissues, etc.\n\n【50】7.  **Lab Tests:** Certain investigations rule out conditions such as celiac disease, urinary tract infection, blood lead level, thyroid, and metabolic problems.\n\n【51】When to See the Doctor?\n-----------------------\n\n【52】Constipation is not a serious condition. However, chronic constipation can be a sign of any underlying medical condition. When constipation continues for more than two weeks, and if any of the following signs are present, then it is time to take your child to the doctor. They are :\n\n【53】1.

Although various physical activity forums, like gym, aerobics, gymnastics, and yoga, help maintain a good posture, it is a conscious decision that could be challenging for some individuals. Sitting up straight for a longer duration in awkward positions may become a habit affecting the spinal cord and its health. Sometimes, it may result in a condition called straight-back syndrome that affects an individual's overall health and causes walking disabilities.\n\n【2】**What Is the Spinal Cord?**\n----------------------------\n\n【3】The spinal cord is a long column of nerve tissues extending from the skull's base to the center of the back and is commonly referred to as the backbone. Maintaining the body's overall posture can help distribute the weight of an individual. The spinal cord forms the vital part of the central nervous system that helps send commands to the brain and coordinates reflexes. The three main parts of the spinal cord are\n\n【4】*   Cervical or the neck region.\n\n【5】*   Thoracic or the chest region.\n\n【6】*   Lumbar or the lower back region.\n\n【7】The spinal cord is also protected by three layers of tissue: the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater.\n\n【8】What Is Straight-Back Syndrome?\n-------------------------------\n\n【9】A thoracic deformity that is characterized by abnormal changes in the shape of the spine is called straight-back syndrome. This syndrome could affect the internal organs like the lungs and heart, causing symptoms like shortness of breath. In some cases, it may result in compression fractures or ankylosing spondylitis. The condition has to be cared for properly to prevent the syndrome from progressing and help maintain good posture.\n\n【10】Most patients with spinal deformity may require the aid of walking devices to assist with their walking, as their weight is not centered, and they may constantly stoop forward. It can cause significant pain and frustration.\n\n【11】What Causes Straight-Back Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【12】There are various causes for straight-back syndrome, which is characterized by an abnormally straight thoracic spine leading to respiratory and cardiovascular complications. Some of them are mentioned below.\n\n【13】*   **Congenital Malformations:** Some patients may have birth defects like a malformed spine or chest wall that affect the alignment and curvature of the spine, leading to a straight or flat appearance.\n\n【14】*   **Surgical Procedures:** Individuals who have undergone open-heart surgery and spinal fusion have been reported with straight-back syndrome. Some surgical procedures tend to alter the spinal alignment resulting in a straight appearance.\n\n【15】*   **Postural Abnormalities:** Some personal habits and postures may contribute to this syndrome. For example, a rigid posture could cause a straight back.\n\n【16】*   **Acquired Disorders:** Individuals with osteoporosis or spinal muscular atrophy causes degeneration and weakening of the spine, causing a straight back.\n\n【17】What Happens if the Back Is Straight?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【18】*   A good posture has many benefits, like reducing muscle and joint strain. It also helps to distribute the body weight evenly and reduces strain in particular areas, thereby preventing injury.\n\n【19】*   It improves breathing and increases the oxygen level by allowing complete expansion of the lungs.\n\n【20】*   It helps increase the mental focus of an individual and boosts energy levels.\n\n【21】*   It also helps with better digestion and allows the organs to function optimally.\n\n【22】*   A good posture can make a person look taller and boosts self-confidence.\n\n【23】Maintaining an abnormally straight posture could interfere with the normal lifestyle of an individual, causing severe pain and spine rigidity. It may also affect the muscle attachments and their contraction and expansion.\n\n【24】What Are the Symptoms of Straight-Back Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】A person with a straight back or a flattened appearance could have the following symptoms.\n\n【26】*   Shortness of breath occurs due to lung compression caused by straight-back syndrome.\n\n【27】*   Constant pressure in the chest wall results in chest pain.\n\n【28】*   Irregular heartbeat or palpitations due to displaced heart in a flat spine.\n\n【29】*   Fatigueness or decreased energy levels.\n\n【30】*   Dizziness and fainting due to compressed blood vessels.\n\n【31】*   Back pain.\n\n【32】What Are the Complications of Straight-Back Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Some of the potential complications are listed below\n\n【34】*   Palpitations.\n\n【35】*   Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat).\n\n【36】*   Degenerative disc diseases like spinal instability and compression of the spinal nerve.\n\n【37】*   Postural problems.\n\n【38】*   Dizziness.\n\n【39】*   Back pain.\n\n【40】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【41】How Is Straight-Back Syndrome Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【42】Diagnosing this condition could be challenging as it has symptoms similar to other conditions. Some methods to diagnose the condition are listed below.\n\n【43】*   A thorough physical examination checks the signs of a flattened spine and heart abnormalities.\n\n【44】*   Imaging tests like X-rays and computed tomography help visualize the spine's shape and related changes.\n\n【45】*   An electrocardiogram is done to check the heart functions and visualize the heart structures.\n\n【46】*   Pulmonary function test to evaluate the efficacy of the respiratory system and to diagnose related damages.\n\n【47】*   Sometimes straight back could be caused due to genetic reasons; hence genetic testing may be required.\n\n【48】How Is Straight-Back Syndrome Treated?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【49】Depending on the severity and associated symptoms, the doctor may decide the treatment plan to prevent complications.\n\n【50】*   If no significant complications are associated, the healthcare provider may recommend regular monitoring of the condition to prevent any progress or complications.\n\n【51】*   Medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms like chest pain and palpitations. Some medications to reduce blood pressure may also be recommended.\n\n【52】*   Physical therapy to manage back pain and improve posture.\n\n【53】*   In severe cases, surgery may be recommended to correct the spinal curvature and to reduce the pressure on the heart and lungs. It is only recommended for individuals whose benefits outweigh the risks and complications.\n\n【54】*   Managing underlying conditions like osteoporosis will also help to manage the symptoms of this syndrome.\n\n【55】Consulting the healthcare provider gives a clear idea of the best treatment approach and helps to manage the signs and symptoms accordingly. Early diagnosis helps treat and manage symptoms to prevent complications.\n\n【56】**Conclusion**\n\n【57】The straight-back syndrome affects the posture of an individual and may be caused due to various factors like genetics, postural abnormalities, and congenital malformation. The syndrome could affect vital organs like the heart and lungs. This could result in blood pressure and shortness of breath. The condition can be treated by managing the symptoms, physical therapy, and medications. In severe cases, surgery may be recommended.

Burn is a type of wound that arises from skin burns. Skin burns can occur from various sources such as electricity or current, mechanical, chemical, etc. It may affect the superficial layer, middle layer, or all the layers of the skin. Based on this, there are three types of skin burns. In addition, based on the causative agents, there is a different classification of burns.\n\n【2】When a burn occurs, removing the dead tissues and reducing the bacterial load is essential, allowing quick healing and providing an appropriate wound bed for skin grafts. Traditionally, sharp knives are used for surgical debridement to remove dead tissues from the wound. However, nowadays, hydrosurgical debridement is preferred over traditional techniques. This method uses a high-pressure jet of water and saline to remove the dead tissues and reduce the bacterial load.\n\n【3】What Is a Burn?\n---------------\n\n【4】It is a wound caused by different types of energy such as chemical, electrical, thermal, and electromagnetic.\n\n【5】What Are the Types of Burns?\n----------------------------\n\n【6】Burns are classified as:\n\n【7】1.  **Physical Burn -** It is caused by physical force or friction.\n\n【8】2.  **Thermal Burn -** It is caused by a heat source that increases the skin temperature resulting in tissue charring or death. For example, hot metals, steam, flame, and hot liquid. There are two types:\n\n【9】    *   Dry heat.\n\n【10】    *   Wet heat.\n\n【11】3.  **Electrical Burn -** An electrical current causes it. The source of the current can be alternate or direct. There are two types of current sources:\n\n【12】    *   High voltage.\n\n【13】    *   Low voltage.\n\n【14】4.  **Radiation Burn -** It is caused by prolonged standing exposure to ultraviolet rays or X-rays.\n\n【15】5.  **Laser Burn -** The exposure of a laser beam causes it.\n\n【16】6.  **Chemical Burn -** It is caused by strong acids, detergents, or other solutions that come in contact with the skin and cause damage. The chemicals can be of three types:\n\n【17】    *   Acid.\n\n【18】    *   Alkali.\n\n【19】    *   Others.\n\n【20】What Is the Classification of Burn Wounds?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【21】There are three types of burn wounds:\n\n【22】1.  **First Degree Burn -** It is also called superficial burn. The external layer of skin is burned and occurs as a red, dry, and painful wound - for example, sunburn.\n\n【23】2.  **Second Degree Burn -** It is also called partial thickness burn. The superficial layer (epidermis) and middle layer (dermis) are damaged or burned. The skin becomes red and swollen, and blisters develop on the wound.\n\n【24】3.  **Third Degree Burn -** It is also called full-thickness burn. All the skin layers are damaged and may also involve underlying bones and muscles. The affected area becomes numb due to damage to the nerves. It appears white and charred.\n\n【25】What Is Burn Debridement?\n-------------------------\n\n【26】It is the removal of damaged tissues followed by wound dressing. It allows the healing of the burn. There are various debridement techniques, as mentioned below:\n\n【27】**1\\. Surgical Debridement:**\n\n【28】*   It is the standard gold treatment.\n\n【29】*   The foreign bodies and dead tissues, and skin are removed.\n\n【30】*   It helps in reducing the bacterial load in the wound.\n\n【31】*   It is performed with different surgical knives such as Weck knives or Blair knives.\n\n【32】*   It is indicated for partial-thickness and full-thickness burns.\n\n【33】*   It aids in wound healing and less scarring.\n\n【34】**2\\. Hydrosurgical Debridement or Hydrosurgery:**\n\n【35】*   It is a new tool used for wound debridement and is a minimally invasive procedure.\n\n【36】*   The water jet and saline with high pressure are used to remove the foreign bodies and dead tissues.\n\n【37】*   The jet comes out through a small, narrow nozzle.\n\n【38】*   It creates a Venturi effect (decrease in fluid pressure while going through a narrow passage, such as the nozzle of the jet).\n\n【39】*   This jet removes the damaged tissue and skin. It is then collected through a suction attached next to the jet.\n\n【40】*   The jet is angled at 45 degrees, attached to a console, and handled through a foot pedal.\n\n【41】*   The pressure of the jet is adjustable based on the requirement.\n\n【42】What Are the Advantages of Hydrosurgical Debridement?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】1.  Cost-effective.\n\n【44】2.  Decreases the number of debridements.\n\n【45】3.  Preserve underlying skin.\n\n【46】4.  The tool used in this method is relatively small and quickly reaches hard-to-reach areas.\n\n【47】5.  Provides more accurate debridement.\n\n【48】6.  Results in fast operating time.\n\n【49】7.  Less blood loss.\n\n【50】8.  Healing time is fast, generally seven to 11 days.\n\n【51】9.  Low rate of infection after the surgery.\n\n【52】What Are the Disadvantages of Hydrosurgical Debridement?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】1.  The high pressure may cause irregularity in the tissues or skin surface.\n\n【54】2.  Requires special equipment.\n\n【55】**What Are the Other Methods of Wound Debridement?**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】1.  **Autolytic Debridement -** It occurs through a natural process in which specific cells and enzymes break down the damaged tissues. It is used only in non-infected wounds. It is generally used as an adjunct to other therapies.\n\n【57】2.  **Biological Debridement -** It is also called larval therapy, in which a sterile larva removes damaged tissues.\n\n【58】3.  **Enzymatic Debridement -** It uses collagenase enzymes to digest the collagen present in the damaged tissues. It is a slow method of debridement.\n\n【59】What Are the Complications of Wound Debridement?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【60】1.  High risk of bleeding or blood loss from the wound.\n\n【61】2.  Increased pain.\n\n【62】3.  Allergic reaction to anesthesia.\n\n【63】What Are the Indications of Hydrosurgical Debridement?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【64】1.  To remove the dead tissues.\n\n【65】2.  To reduce bacterial load in the wound.\n\n【66】3.  To reduce the infection rate.\n\n【67】4.  To obtain appropriate samples for culture.\n\n【68】5.  To aid in the healing process.\n\n【69】6.  To provide a proper wound bed for placing a skin graft or flap.\n\n【70】What Are the Contraindications of Hydrosurgical Debridement?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【71】1.  Dry eschar (dead tissues that are shed off from the skin).\n\n【72】2.  Absence of infection in the wound.\n\n【73】**Why Is Wound Debridement Done?**\n----------------------------------\n\n【74】The main aim of wound debridement is to obtain a clear wound bed for the placement of skin grafts and to fasten the healing process.\n\n【75】**Conclusion**\n\n【76】Burns are the most crucial and complicated wound that requires immediate care. The cleaning of the burn wound is essential to support the healing process. It is called debridement, in which the dead tissues are removed. There are various techniques available to perform the debridement. Surgical debridement is the gold standard and a traditional method done with sharp knives. Newer techniques include hydrosurgery or hydrosurgical debridement. The newer techniques are more effective and minimally invasive.\n\n【77】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【78】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507882/\n*   NIH  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551717/\n*   Hopkins Medicine  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/burns</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It not only plays a major role in physical development but also in psychiatric development.\n\n【2】Month by month, women’s bodies go through hormonal changes during menstruation cycle. Until women conceive, the cycle goes on every month. Few eggs are released from the ovary, and this phase is called ovulation. When a single egg is fertilized with sperm, it further grows and moves to the fallopian tube to get attached to the endometrium, which confirms the pregnancy as a fertilized egg gets implanted into the uterus wall. On the other hand, when the egg is not fertilized, the thin lining sheds off. Hence the beginning of another menstruation cycle occurs.\n\n【3】When the embryo is formed, the first few weeks are very important for pregnant women. However, once the embryonic period is over, it is now considered a growing fetus. Thus, the first day of the last menstruation cycle is counted as the start of the pregnancy, and it plays an important role in determining the due date for the baby. Every woman has a genetic combination of XX chromosomes, and every man is born with XY chromosomes. Thus, the genes of women (XX) give a single X to an egg, and men give either X or Y to an egg. If the fertilized egg has the XX combination, it is a girl; if it has the XY combination, it is a boy.\n\n【4】What Are the Fetal Developmental Stages?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【5】There are the following fetal developmental stages seen:\n\n【6】**Week 3:**\n\n【7】*   From three weeks of implantation into the endometrium, nerve formation begins in the embryo.\n*   The body releases the hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) hormone (pregnancy hormone), which stops the formation of eggs.\n\n【8】**Week 4:**\n\n【9】*   The embryo develops the structures that are responsible for face and neck formation. At this phase, the embryo develops into a fetus.\n*   The heart and circulatory systems have started developing.\n*   Pregnant women may feel symptoms like dizziness, nausea, swollen breast, and discomfort.\n\n【10】**Week 5:**\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】Skeletal Dysplasia - Types, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【14】What can be the reason for cramps during pregnancy?\n\n【15】What is the ventricular echogenic focus seen in pregnancy scan?\n\n【16】*   It is also known as the “embryonic period,” where the fetus develops blood cells, kidney cells, and external features.\n*   The development of the brain and spinal cord starts during this week, and there is a higher risk of babies born with birth defects if there is any injury, drug abuse, or adverse effect of any medicine taken by the mother.\n\n【17】**Week 6 to 7:**\n\n【18】*   The fetus grows into a bud that further develops extremities like arms and legs.\n*   The brain and nervous system are formed along with the electrical activity.\n*   The fetus begins to straighten up slightly.\n*   Other features like lip and nose are formed. Ears also start forming with a small indented mark on each side of the head.\n\n【19】**Week 8:**\n\n【20】*   The head of the fetus is equal to half the size of the body.\n*   Arms, legs, ears, and neck are more identifiable now.\n*   A small movement of the baby starts in the womb.

Moreover, due to immature immunity, it is highly essential to take care of fetuses.\n\n【50】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【51】* * *\n\n【52】#### **1.**删除换行**Is That a Fetus or a Baby?**\n\n【53】The fetus is an unborn baby that, from the eighth week after fertilization, grows inside the mother's uterus until birth. The term baby, the kid, is typical and can refer to any child from birth to the age of four years old.\n\n【54】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is the Age of the Fetus?**\n\n【55】During or at the end of the tenth week of the pregnancy, the baby is no longer an embryo. Instead, it is now a fetus, the stage of development until birth. Fetal age is 37 to 39 weeks of pregnancy inside the mother's womb.\n\n【56】#### **3.**删除换行**How Is a Human Fetus Called?**\n\n【57】A newly developing human inside the mother's womb is referred to as an embryo until nine weeks after conception. Then it is then referred to as a fetus. However, in other multicellular organisms, the word embryo can refer more broadly to any early development or life cycle stage before birth or hatching.\n\n【58】#### **4.**删除换行**What Is it Called Before the Fetus?**\n\n【59】Generally, it is called an embryo from conception time until the eighth week of development. After the eighth week, that is called a fetus until it is born. The egg develops into:  \n - Blastocyst.  \n - Embryo.  \n - Fetus.\n\n【60】#### **5.**删除换行**What Is the Duration of the Fetal Period?**\n\n【61】A fetus is a prenatal human being developing between birth and the embryonic stage. The fetal stage starts from the beginning of the ninth week and after fertilization is about 38 weeks, which is the average time of birth. The fetal stage lasts a total of approximately 30 weeks.\n\n【62】#### **6.**删除换行**At Which Week Does the Fetus Develop?**\n\n【63】The fetus develops at the beginning of the 11th or ninth week of pregnancy. It is no longer called an embryo. Instead, a developing baby inside the mother's womb is officially described as a fetus.\n\n【64】#### **7.**删除换行**Which Is the Last Organ to Develop in a Fetus?**\n\n【65】Most babies move to a head-to-down position in the uterus towards the end, with the head placed on the mother's pubic bone. Because the lungs are the last major organ to finish developing, after 24 weeks, the baby will start building up his lungs by breathing amniotic fluid; lungs mostly would not be matured until the 34th week of pregnancy.\n\n【66】#### **8.**删除换行**In a Developing Fetus, What Is the First Thing to Form?**\n\n【67】Four weeks after conception, the neural tube development along the baby's back will be closing. The brain and spinal cord will develop from the neural tube. The heart and other organs also start to form. Structures that are necessary to the formation of eyes and ears.\n\n【68】#### **9.**删除换行**How Likely Does a Six-Week Fetus Look?**\n\n【69】By the time one is six to seven weeks pregnant, there is a prominent bulge where the heart is the bump at the headend in the neural tube. The embryo is curved, has a tail, and looks like a tiny tadpole.\n\n【70】#### **10.**删除换行**How to Know Whether the Fetus Is Healthy?**\n\n【71】A doctor will perform an ultrasound to track the baby's health and developmental growth. Generally, a fetus grows by 2 inches every month. So by the seventh month, the baby should be 14 inches long. By the end of the ninth month, a fetus weighs around 6.61 pounds (Ib) and is 18 to 20 inches long.\n\n【72】#### **11.**删除换行**How Does the Embryo Grow Inside the Mother's Womb?**\n\n【73】During fertilization, the sperm and the egg combine in one of the fallopian tubes to form the zygote. Then the zygote travels down to the fallopian tube to become morula. After reaching the uterus, the morula stage changes to a blastocyst. Finally, the blastocyst burrows into the uterine lining process called implantation.\n\n【74】#### **12.**删除换行**Inside a Woman, Where Does the Embryo Grow?**\n\n【75】The uterus, or womb, is a hollow or pear-shaped organ in a woman's lower stomach area between the bladder and rectum that will be shedding its lining each month during menstruation. A fertilized egg becomes implanted in the uterus, and the fetus starts developing.\n\n【76】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【77】无关删除-1:<u>*   FERTILIZATION  \n    https://ldh.la.gov/page/986\n*   Anatomy: Fetus in Utero  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/anatomy-fetus-in-utero\n*   Fetal development  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002398.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

AI is used in many sectors, including marketing, tourism, and banking, and has more recently acquired an interest in the healthcare field. Recent development in artificial intelligence may help healthcare professionals by treating patients more efficiently and accurately. For example, artificial intelligence (AI) is now being used to help diagnose, track development, and treat ophthalmologic diseases, most notably glaucoma. Over the last two decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of artificial intelligence applications in ophthalmology, together with various imaging data.\n\n【2】What Is Glaucoma?\n-----------------\n\n【3】The term \"glaucoma\" is used to describe a variety of eye conditions that harm the optic nerve. The most typical type of optic nerve injury causes visual loss. The fluid typically accumulates in the front of the eye, which exerts excessive pressure, also known as intraocular pressure, on the optic nerve and gradually injures it. Sometimes, glaucoma develops in adults with normal ocular pressure. However, untreated or improperly managed glaucoma may cause blindness or permanent vision loss.\n\n【4】Who Is at Increased Risk of Developing Glaucoma?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】People of all racial and gender backgrounds can get glaucoma, but the risk rises with advancing age. Compared to other races, African Americans and Latinos have a substantially higher incidence of glaucoma, which they also tend to experience earlier in life. The following individuals are at an increased risk of developing glaucoma:\n\n【6】*   Familial glaucoma history.\n\n【7】*   Several medical conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and migraines.\n\n【8】*   Various forms of eye surgery or eye injuries.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Does increased eye pressure result in glaucoma?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I have high eye pressure and glaucoma.

The test aids in the diagnosis of glaucoma. The doctor places the specialized numbing medications in the eye before holding a pencil-shaped instrument delicately against the outside of the eyeball. Some doctors may do procedures with an air puff tonometer without using numbing eye drops. The tonometer measures the amount of aqueous humor (a fluid-filled in between the colored part iris and cornea, the back side of the eye) produced inside the eye and how quickly it drains into the tissue around the cornea.\n\n【24】*   **Pachymeter -** A pachymeter is a piece of equipment used in science to measure the cornea's thickness using a laser, light waves, or ultrasound. This procedure is called a pachymetry test. The tool is used to evaluate the eyes routinely before procedures and to detect, evaluate, and track the number of ocular disorders, such as glaucoma.\n\n【25】*   **Perimeter -** Eye doctors use visual field perimeter testing equipment to check patients for symptoms of vision loss, and the test is known as a perimetry test or visual field test. A patient sits and looks at a screen within the device during the non-invasive test. The patient is told to press a button on a remote control each time they notice a flash of light. In this way, the patient's peripheral vision can be examined, and detect the loss of peripheral vision, which is a sign of glaucoma.\n\n【26】*   **Slit Lamp -** The slit lamp, also known as biomicroscopy, is a collection of equipment that functions as a single unit. It has a light source that can be adjusted, a binocular microscope with a movable base, and a frame for the patient's head to rest on while the examination is conducted. The doctor can use the light in several ways. For example, they can enlarge it, make it brighter, and apply a color filter. This allows the doctor to concentrate on specific areas of the eyes and face. Slit lamp equipment can evaluate any abnormalities or problems inside the eye.\n\n【27】*   **Genoscope -** Genoscope is a diagnostic equipment used to check eye drainage angle, whether blocked or closed can lead to glaucoma detection. This test is called the gonioscopy test. This test can be done using a particular lens and slit lamp.\n\n【28】*   **Optical Coherence Tomography -** Many eye professionals can use specialized equipment called optical coherence tomography to capture the images of the retina and optic nerve. This may lead to the detection of glaucoma.\n\n【29】What Are the Risks of the Glaucoma Test?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【30】Tests for glaucoma are risk-free and safe. After the test, the vision might be blurry or extremely sensitive, but it gradually improves throughout the day. Therefore, the results can be available immediately after the test.\n\n【31】What Are the Advantages of Ophthalmic Equipment?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Professionals can learn in-depth information about eye conditions and identify future problems according to the ophthalmic equipment. Ophthalmic tools also serve as assistants for doctors, aiding them in a variety of ways, such as :\n\n【33】*   **Early Detection of Serious Health Issues -** Serious problems can be avoided with early diagnosis of vision abnormalities and damage. For instance, modern ophthalmic technology helps identify several eye-related conditions, such as glaucoma, keratoconus, dry eye, and cataracts. In order to avoid serious consequences, doctors immediately offer treatment once the problems have been identified early.\n\n【34】*   **Better Prescriptions -** The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other cutting-edge technologies in these devices enable doctors to select the best treatments for each patient. Doctors can recommend solutions and treatment modalities from which the patient can benefit the most with the use of more advanced ophthalmic equipment.\n\n【35】*   **Accurate Diagnosis -** Artificial intelligence-based technology is so accurate and precise. These devices may help doctors by reducing the chances of making a wrong diagnosis or missing an issue.\n\n【36】**Conclusion:**\n\n【37】The eyes might seem identical, but our eyes are distinct. The eyes can be differentiated in several ways besides color. Monitoring eye pressure can help to evaluate problems like glaucoma. Regular eye exams can help to detect glaucoma earlier, which might save a life. An optometrist can measure eye pressure and the optic nerve condition. A proficient piece of ophthalmic equipment is needed for early detection and diagnosis of significant eye problems, enabling doctors to provide more effective treatment options.\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>*   Artificial Intelligence in Glaucoma  \n    https://eyewiki.aao.org/Artificial\\_Intelligence\\_in\\_Glaucoma\n*   Artificial intelligence in glaucoma  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35502116/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The expander is inserted under the skin near the area to be repaired and is gradually filled with saline or carbon dioxide, causing the skin to stretch and grow. This technique is commonly used in breast reconstruction following a mastectomy, but it can also be utilized to repair skin damaged by congenital disorders, scars, and certain cosmetic procedures. In addition, it is a useful tool for restoring the appearance and function of damaged skin.\n\n【2】What Is Tissue Expansion Surgery?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】Tissue expansion is a surgical procedure that helps create new skin tissues to replace damaged skin. This procedure is performed by plastic surgeons and can be used on almost any body area to repair skin damage due to congenital disabilities, injuries, or other acquired conditions.\n\n【4】It can also be used before reconstructive burn surgery to replace scar tissue at the burn injury site with new and healthy skin. During the procedure, a silicone balloon expander is placed under the skin around the area to be repaired. Tissue expansion is an effective way to restore the appearance and function of damaged skin.\n\n【5】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【7】Osseodensification and Ridge Expansion: Uses, Advantages, and Techniques\n\n【8】Fibrous Dysplasia - Types, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【9】Pain and Its Management in Orthodontics\n\n【10】What Are the Benefits of Tissue Expansion?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Tissue expansion is a surgical procedure that helps create new skin tissue by encouraging the growth of additional skin in different body areas. The procedure is often used in the face, neck, arms, hands, and legs, where the skin is thin and can stretch and grow quickly. Unlike skin flaps and grafts, tissue expansion carries fewer risks of side effects because the skin remains connected to the patient's blood and nerve supply, preserving the same color, texture, and hair-bearing qualities.\n\n【12】The scars from tissue expansion are also less visible because the skin is not moved from one area to another. This procedure is simple and safe for patients and can provide more benefits than traditional skin repair techniques because it allows for natural skin expansion. Tissue expansion can be an effective option for almost anyone who needs additional skin growth.\n\n【13】What Are the Limitations of Tissue Expansion?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Tissue expansion is not always the best option for skin repair. In areas of the body with thicker skin, such as the back and torso, tissue expansion may be less effective. It is also not suggested for utilization in severely damaged or scarred skin areas. One of the main drawbacks of tissue expansion is the time it takes for the new skin to grow, which can take several months, depending on the reconstructed area. Patients also need to visit the surgeon frequently to fill the expander, which can be inconvenient. Additionally, wearing an expander can be uncomfortable and highly visible in certain areas of the body, leading some patients to consider other options for skin repair.\n\n【15】What Are the Risks of Tissue Expansion Surgery?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【16】While tissue expansion is a highly beneficial procedure that can produce excellent results, it can also cause complications, as with any surgery. One concern with tissue expansion is the possibility of leaks in the silicone balloon expander. While all expanders are tested for safety, leakage can still occur. Most of the time, the body can absorb the saline solution to fill the expander without any issues, but leakage can still pose a safety concern. In addition, it may require removing and cleaning the balloon and surrounding tissue.\n\n【17】Another potential complication is an infection of the skin around the expander, which can occur within the first few weeks after the procedure. This can be treated with medication in mild cases, but in more severe cases, the expander may need to be removed and reinserted once the skin has fully healed from the infection. In case of any inflammation or other persistent manifestations after tissue expansion, it is important to consult the surgeon, who can provide the necessary therapy.\n\n【18】What Are the Preoperative Measures of Tissue Expansion Surgery?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】It is important for the surgeon to carefully evaluate whether the case is a good candidate for tissue expansion surgery before the procedure is performed, which may involve running tests to confirm the overall health and skin condition. The surgeon will also discuss the expectations for the surgery and provide all the necessary information to make an informed decision.\n\n【20】Preparing for tissue expansion surgery generally involves following the surgeon's specific instructions, such as quitting smoking for a few weeks before the procedure, following a specific diet, and avoiding certain vitamins and medications. During the initial consultation, the surgeon will also evaluate the medical history, perform a physical examination, take measurements and photographs for the medical record, and discuss the potential risks and complications of the procedure with the patient.\n\n【21】If the patient chooses to have surgery at a particular medical center, they may be given a preoperative information packet explaining everything they need to know before the surgery date. However, it is important to obey the surgeon's instructions carefully to ensure the best possible outcome from the procedure.\n\n【22】What Are the Procedures of Tissue Expansion Surgery?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Tissue expansion surgery is typically performed using local anesthesia and a sedative, although general anesthesia may also be used. The procedure takes one to two hours and involves making a small incision near the area to be treated and inserting a silicone balloon expander. The expander has a tube with a valve that can be accessed just beneath the skin surface, allowing the surgeon to gradually fill it with saline to promote the growth of new skin. Once the skin has stretched sufficiently, a second surgery is needed to remove the expander and insert a permanent implant. This second surgery may cause discomfort and pain, but these effects should not last long. During recovery, the patient may be advised to take medication, rest, and exercise as necessary. Most patients can return to normal activities within a week after the second surgery. However, following the surgeon's recommendations is important to ensure the best possible outcome.\n\n【24】**Conclusion:**\n\n【25】The tissue expansion procedure promotes the healthy supplement growth of the skin and is used to replace damaged skin. This procedure can be used in all the different body areas, enabling the plastic surgeons who are doing the procedure to rectify the skin defect that congenital and acquired defects may cause.\n\n【26】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【27】无关删除-1:<u>*   Growing skin: A computational model for skin expansion in reconstructive surgery  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3425448/\n*   Tissue Expansion  \n    https://www.plasticsurgery.org/reconstructive-procedures/tissue-expansion\n*   Growing skin: Tissue expansion in pediatric forehead reconstruction  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3425448/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is caused by the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV). This virus belongs to the large family of viruses called coronaviruses, which are responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【2】Like the other strains of coronavirus, MERS-CoV also causes fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The other not-so-common symptoms are pneumonia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. Some patients who tested positive for this infection did not show any symptoms or were asymptomatic.\n\n【3】Dromedary (Arabian camels) are thought to be the major reservoir host for MERS-CoV. The virus is believed to be spread to humans from infected camels and human-to-human transmission. The spread occurs through close contact, especially while giving unprotected care to patients. Healthcare-associated outbreaks are responsible for the outbreaks in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the Republic of Korea. MERS-CoV continues to cause localized outbreaks. This infection can be fatal if it progresses to respiratory or kidney failure. Data also shows 1 in 3 people (35 percent) die from MERS. The risk of severe illness is high in older adults and immunocompromised individuals. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms with the help of rest, painkillers, fluids, and oxygen therapy.\n\n【4】What Causes MERS?\n-----------------\n\n【5】As MERS-CoV is transmitted between animals and humans, it is called a zoonotic virus. This virus is said to have originated in bats, which then infect dromedary camels. Researchers have identified MERS-CoV in camels in many countries.\n\n【6】The modes of transmission are:\n\n【7】1.  **Animals to Humans** - As mentioned before, dromedary camels are the animal source of infection in humans. Scientists have isolated strains of MERS-CoV from Arabian camels in Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and many other countries.\n\n【8】2.  **Human to Human** \\- Providing unprotected care to an infected patient is the main source of human-to-human transmission. Many clusters of such cases have been reported in healthcare facilities.\n\n【9】How Does the Virus Spread?\n--------------------------\n\n【10】MERS spreads from one person to another through infected respiratory droplets. These droplets are generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes without covering his or her mouth. One can get infected if one breathes in these infected droplets, or if the droplet comes in contact with one’s mouth, nose, or eyes. Humans can get infected by camels through respiratory droplets, and their meat, milk, and urine.\n\n【11】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of MERS?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【12】The incubation period that is the time between exposure to the virus and symptoms is two to 14 days (usually five days). The symptoms of MERS range from asymptomatic to mild symptoms to severe respiratory disease. The typical symptoms include:\n\n【13】1.  Fever.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Menstrual Disorders in Adolescent Girls</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Menstrual Period Calculator</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    How to Improve Lung Health If You Get COVID-19?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n2.

This test is done on a sample of respiratory secretions or blood. If the doctor suspects that a person might be infected with MERS-CoV, based on the travel history and symptoms, he or she might be asked to get this test done. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and IFA (immunofluorescence assay) detect the antibodies to MERS-CoV. Apart from this, the doctor might suggest taking the following:\n\n【28】1.  **Chest X-ray** \\- To check for pneumonia.\n\n【29】2.  **CT (computed tomography) Scan** - To get detailed images of the lungs.\n\n【30】3.  **Blood Test** - To check how well kidneys are functioning.\n\n【31】How Is MERS Treated?\n--------------------\n\n【32】As of now, no cure or vaccine is available for MERS. Vaccines and treatments are under development. Doctors provide medicines and therapies focusing on specific symptoms, such as:\n\n【33】1.  **Paracetamol or Acetaminophen** - To relieve fever.\n\n【34】2.  **Analgesics** \\- To reduce pain.\n\n【35】3.  **Oxygen Therapy** - To ease breathing.\n\n【36】4.  **Antibiotics** - To treat superimposed bacterial infection.\n\n【37】5.  **IV (intravenous) Fluids and Electrolytes** - To prevent dehydration.\n\n【38】How Can MERS Be Prevented?\n--------------------------\n\n【39】One can reduce the risk of MERS by following these preventive tips:\n\n【40】1.  Hands should be washed regularly with soap and water (for 20 seconds), or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer should be used. Make sure to wash hands when they are visibly soiled, after using the toilet, before and after eating, or cooking.\n\n【41】2.  Avoid eating undercooked meats.\n\n【42】3.  Make sure to cover the mouth and nose with a tissue or forearm while sneezing or coughing.\n\n【43】4.  Wash fruits and vegetables properly before eating.\n\n【44】5.  If a person has a cough, cold, or other respiratory symptoms, he or she should avoid going out and remain at home.\n\n【45】6.  Do not come in contact with people who are exhibiting respiratory symptoms.\n\n【46】7.  When visiting crowded areas, use a mask.\n\n【47】8.  Do not consume raw camel meat or milk. It is safe to consume properly cooked camel meat and pasteurized camel milk.\n\n【48】What Is the Difference Between COVID-19 and MERS?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】*   Both COVID-19 and MERS are distinct respiratory illnesses. They are produced by various viruses in the coronavirus family. The SARS-CoV-2 viral infection causes COVID-19.\n\n【50】*   Researchers think that SARS-CoV-2 started in bats, similar to how MERS-CoV did. Researchers are currently attempting to determine how it spreads to people.\n\n【51】*   The SARS-CoV-2 virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO declared a worldwide pandemic.\n\n【52】*   According to research, COVID-19 and MERS share a clinical presentation, but COVID-19 has a much-reduced mortality rate (2.3 % compared to 35 % for MERS).\n\n【53】*   However, compared to MERS and SARS, COVID-19 reliably produces less severe symptoms, making it easier for the virus to spread within a population.\n\n【54】*   The incidence of COVID-19 complications is comparable to that of SARS complications and is lower than that of MERS complications.\n\n【55】**Conclusion:**\n\n【56】MERS is a serious respiratory disease brought on by the coronavirus MERS-CoV. It results in a fever, a cough, and breathlessness. As a precaution against MERS, the WHO does not presently advise any travel or trade restrictions. Localized MERS breakouts are rare but they do still occur. Official organizations are trying to create a vaccine and continue to track the prevalence of MERS.\n\n【57】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【58】* * *\n\n【59】#### **1.**删除换行**Which Organs Does MERS Affect?**\n\n【60】MERS is a viral infection of the lungs that causes breathing problems. It could also harm the kidneys and other organs. MERS is caused by a virus known as coronavirus. As a result, this virus is also referred to as MERS-coronavirus.\n\n【61】#### **2.**删除换行**Who Is Susceptible to MERS?**\n\n【62】   \nMERS is spread from person to person via infected respiratory droplets. These droplets form when an infected person coughs or sneezes without covering their mouth. One can become infected if one breathes in infected droplets or comes into contact with them through the mouth, nose, or eyes. Humans can get infected by camel respiratory droplets, meat, milk, and urine.\n\n【63】#### **3.**删除换行**Can MERS Affect the Brain?**\n\n【64】   \nMERS-CoV infection of the CNS causes complement activation, which causes inflammation-mediated brain tissue damage. Other complications include severe symptoms like kidney failure, pneumonia, and respiratory failure.\n\n【65】#### **4.**删除换行**Is There a Vaccine Available for MERS?**\n\n【66】There is currently no specific treatment or vaccine for MERS, but several vaccines are developing. Treatment is supportive and tailored to the individual's clinical condition, which includes:  \n\\- Paracetamol or Acetaminophen.  \n\\- Analgesics.  \n\\- Oxygen therapy  \n\\- Antibiotics  \n\\- IV (intravenous) fluids and electrolytes.\n\n【67】#### **5.**删除换行**Is MERS Associated With COVID?**\n\n【68】MERS and COVID-19 are caused by different coronavirus strains. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes COVID-19. Like MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in bats. Even though COVID-19 causes symptoms similar to MERS, the death rate is only 3 to 4 %.\n\n【69】#### **6.**删除换行**Can MERS Be Asymptomatic?**\n\n【70】The incubation period, or the time between virus exposure and symptoms, ranges from two to 14 days (usually five days). MERS symptoms range from asymptomatic to mild to severe respiratory disease. The following are typical symptoms:  \n\\- Fever.  \n\\- Cough.  \n\\- Breathing difficulty.  \n\\- Diarrhea.\n\n【71】#### **7.**删除换行**Is MERS-Cov Still Present?**\n\n【72】From April 2012 to October 2022, laboratories confirmed 2600 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) worldwide, with 935 deaths at a case-fatality ratio (CFR) of 36 %. Saudi Arabia reported most of these cases, with 2193 cases and 854 related deaths (CFR: 39 %).\n\n【73】#### **8.**删除换行**What Is the Outlook of MERS?**\n\n【74】Approximately 35% of MERS patients have died. The actual percentage could be lower because it excludes mild cases that go undiagnosed and unreported. Those with underlying medical conditions that weaken the immune system, such as cancer, are more likely to develop severe disease.\n\n【75】#### **9.**删除换行**Is MERS a More Serious Disease Than SARS?**\n\n【76】Both diseases are potentially fatal to humans. SARS is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV, whereas MERS is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV first appeared in China about two decades ago and quickly spread to other countries. On the other hand, SARS has a fatality rate of 9.5 %, which is significantly lower than MERS (34.4 %).\n\n【77】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【78】无关删除-1:<u>*   Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html\n*   Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-mers\n*   Middle East respiratory syndrome  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32145185/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Although the mechanism of the drug acts is unknown, it is still a potent drug that shows potential effects on mania with a very low dosage index. It stabilizes the mood and is commonly preferred for treating bipolar disorder.\n\n【2】How Does Lithium Carbonate Work?\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】The exact effect of lithium and its mechanism in the body is unknown, but some of the actions that are believed to be a hypothesis are the following effects:\n\n【4】*   It causes the depletion of brain cortisol (the primary stress-releasing hormone in the brain), resulting in a lack of responsiveness to alpha-adrenergic stimulation.\n\n【5】*   By reducing the responsiveness of the neurons to the neurotransmitters as it acts on adenylate cyclase and G protein, causing an inhibitor effect that prevents the opening of the ionic channels.\n\n【6】*   Stimulates the release of serotonin from the hippocampus of the brain.\n\n【7】*   Shows similar effects on sodium and potassium, affecting the cell membrane potential and ion transport.\n\n【8】What Causes Lithium Carbonate Toxicity?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【9】Lithium carbonate toxicity occurs when there is an excessive intake of this drug. The factors that increase lithium intake in the body are:\n\n【10】*   Increased intake of lithium carbonate.\n\n【11】*   Decreased or impaired excretion of lithium from the body.\n\n【12】**How Common Is Lithium Carbonate Toxicity?**\n\n【13】According to a study conducted between the years 1997 to 2013, the patients showing recurrence of lithium intoxication along with changes in the kidney were assessed. The study showed that almost 96 out of 1340 cases showed greater levels of lithium, more than 1.5 mmol/l (micro molecular liter/liter). A handful of patients experienced recurrent episodes, in which 34 percent of cases were admitted to intensive care units (ICU), and 13 % needed kidney dialysis for renal filtration. However, the death rates were very low.\n\n【14】How Does Excessive Lithium Carbonate Toxicity Occur?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Lithium toxicity can occur due to two reasons: excessive medication intake or lack of excretion of the drugs. The excessive intake occurs due to:\n\n【16】*   It occurs commonly as an attempt to commit suicide or accidental intake, which results in acute or acute to chronic overdose conditions. One of the other reasons includes increasing the lithium dosage by patients over time.\n\n【17】*   The impairment in the excretion of lithium: multiple reasons prevent the excretion of lithium from the system, and they include:\n\n【18】1.  The excretion of lithium was affected by various systemic reasons like vomiting, fever, diarrhea, less water intake, low sodium diet, congestive heart failure, etc. which causes sodium depletion in the body resulting in lithium reabsorption.\n\n【19】2.  Drugs that reduce the kidney's filtering capacity as prolonged lithium intake can induce a condition called nephrogenic diabetes that increases the signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity.\n\n【20】Lithium carbonate toxicity can be classified into three different types, and they are:\n\n【21】*   Acute overdose.\n\n【22】*   Acute overdose of patients under chronic therapy.\n\n【23】*   Chronic overdose.\n\n【24】How Was Lithium Carbonate Administered Clinically?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Lithium carbonate as a drug was administered in the 1800s as lithia, a water-based solution for treating maniac and gout disorders, which later was administered as tablets; on the administration of these medications, clinical signs of tremors and weaknesses were becoming evident by the end of 1898, which eventually led to the first case of lithium poisoning.\n\n【26】What Are the Clinical Signs of Lithium Carbonate Poisoning?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Clinically lithium poisoning results in the following side effects affecting the organs, and they are:\n\n【28】*   **Effect on the Nervous System:** The symptoms of toxification in the nervous system include shivers, rapid involuntary eye movements, hyperreactive body language, and ataxia that causes a lack of coordination in speech, balance, etc. Patients also show symptoms of confusion and delirium. Although these symptoms are nearly reversible, the symptoms existing over more than a year never tend to resolve.\n\n【29】*   **Kidney Toxicity:** These symptoms of toxicity affecting the kidneys are the most common aftermath of lithium carbonate poisoning, which affects the concentration of urine, drug-induced diabetes insipidus of the kidney, nephrotic syndrome, and sodium-losing nephritis.\n\n【30】*   **Effect on the Heart:** The symptoms on the heart are very mild and not particularly specific, but almost every patient administered lithium showed a flattening of the T wave. The other symptoms include dysfunction of the sinus node, long QT wave, and defects in conduction between two ventricles and U wave. However, these symptoms can be reversed at the cessation of the medication.\n\n【31】*   **Effect on the Digestive System:** The symptoms in the gastrointestinal tract occur within one hour from the intake of the drug and are often seen as a symptom of an acute drug overdose.\n\n【32】*   Effect on the Hormones: The administration of lithium affects the thyroid gland causing a gradual reduction in the production and eventually slowing down the release of thyroid hormones resulting in hypothyroidism. Cases of hyperthyroidism are also seen to be associated with lithium toxicity.\n\n【33】How Is Lithium Carbonate Poisoning Evaluated?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Patients with lithium toxicity are monitored closely for cardiac output through an electrocardiogram, assessing the oxygen levels and monitoring the renal output. In addition, blood tests are done to study blood glucose, serum lithium levels, and thyroid-stimulating hormones. The normal serum lithium level is around 0.6 to 1.2 meq/lit (micro equivalent per liter).\n\n【35】How Is Lithium Carbonate Poisoning Treated?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【36】Lithium carbonate poisoning can be treated in three ways, and they are:\n\n【37】*   Decontamination: It is the first step of treatment and is done by administering activated charcoal. However, activated charcoal and lithium do not effectively bond, and charcoal helps eliminate the other substances ingested with lithium. Oral administration is preferred as gastric lavage and is the most preferred treatment choice.\n\n【38】*   Elimination: The most indicated method of removal of lithium in blood is through hemodialysis, mainly in patients with renal failure. Although stomach lavage is considered, it should never replace renal dialysis.\n\n【39】*   Disposition: All patients with lithium poisoning should be admitted and monitored despite the results showing normal serum levels.\n\n【40】1.  Patients are indicated for admission in the intensive care unit at the development of moderate to severe symptoms.\n\n【41】2.  The serum level of lithium is monitored every six hours.\n\n【42】3.  The patient should not be allowed to be discharged unless the serum level shows less than 1.5mEq/l (milliequivalent/liter).\n\n【43】What Are the Conditions Similar to Lithium Toxicity?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】The conditions that appear similar to lithium toxicity are:\n\n【45】*   Sharp fall in blood sugar levels.\n\n【46】*   Alcohol toxicity.\n\n【47】*   Dementia - frequent loss of memory.\n\n【48】*   Depression.\n\n【49】*   Other toxicities like heavy metals, mercury, and neuroleptic drugs.\n\n【50】*   Stroke.\n\n【51】*   Ischemia (a clinical condition characterized by loss of blood supply to the body or a particular organ due to obstruction of blood vessels).\n\n【52】*   Delirium (a state of uncoordinated mind with confused thinking).\n\n【53】**Conclusion:**\n\n【54】Lithium chloride toxicity is a clinical condition that affects all body organs, resulting in symptoms ranging from mild to severe conditions like nausea, vomiting, tremors, fatigue, lethargy, confusion, tachycardia, delirium, agitation up to coma, hypotension, seizure, hyperthermia. However, when treated with obvious evidence of symptoms, lithium toxicity can be prevented from fatality. Lithium carbonate toxicity can be reversed by administering the patient serotonergic drugs and following all the treatment guidelines.\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>*   Lithium Toxicity  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499992/\n*   Lithium toxicity  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002667.htm\n*   Lithium side effects and toxicity: prevalence and management strategies  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5164879/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Everyone is susceptible, and most adults will experience fatigue at some point. Fatigue is a symptom, not a disease. Rather than an underlying medical condition, many people experience fatigue as a result of a combination of lifestyle, social, psychological, and general well-being issues. Although fatigue is sometimes referred to as tiredness, it is distinct from simply feeling tired or sleepy. Everyone gets tired at some point, but it usually goes away after a nap or a few nights of sound sleep. A sleepy person may feel temporarily refreshed after exercising.\n\n【2】If a person gets enough sleep, eats well, and exercises regularly but still find it difficult to perform daily activities, concentrate, or be motivated at normal levels, they may be suffering from fatigue, which requires further investigation. There are two types of fatigue: physical fatigue and mental fatigue.\n\n【3】*   A person suffering from physical fatigue may find it difficult to perform daily tasks such as climbing the stairs. Muscle weakness is one of the symptoms, and a strength test may be required for diagnosis.\n\n【4】*   A person suffering from mental fatigue may find it difficult to concentrate and maintain focus. They may feel sleepy or struggle to stay awake while working.\n\n【5】What Causes Fatigue?\n--------------------\n\n【6】Fatigue can be caused by various conditions, disorders, medications, and lifestyle factors. Fatigue can be a temporary or chronic condition (lasting six months or more). One may be able to alleviate the symptoms by making changes to their diet, medications, exercise routine, or sleeping habits. Doctors can usually treat or help manage an underlying medical condition that causes fatigue. Fatigue may be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n【7】*   **Lifestyle Habits**: Improper diet, excessive alcohol, drug use, excessive stress, and a sedentary lifestyle can all contribute to fatigue. Jet lag is frequently associated with temporary fatigue (the symptoms normally improve in a few days).\n\n【8】*   **Medical Conditions**: Fatigue is a symptom of various diseases, disorders, and deficiencies affecting various body parts.\n\n【9】*   **Sleep Disorders**: Sleep apnea, insomnia, and narcolepsy can all lead to extreme exhaustion and long-term fatigue.\n\n【10】*   **Treatments and Medications**: Fatigue can be caused by various prescription and over-the-counter medications, including antihistamines and blood pressure medications. Fatigue is often seen as a side effect of chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants, and other treatments.\n\n【11】What Medical Conditions Can Cause Fatigue?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Fatigue can be caused by various conditions and disorders.

Fatigue is frequently caused by hypothyroidism.\n\n【22】*   **Chronic Conditions**: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS or myalgic encephalomyelitis) and fibromyalgia can cause severe, long-term fatigue.\n\n【23】*   **Heart and Lung Issues**: Fatigue is a typical symptom of cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease, POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and congestive heart failure.\n\n【24】*   **Deficiencies**: Fatigue is frequently caused by anemia and other vitamin deficiencies (like vitamin D or vitamin B12). Dehydration can cause fatigue because the body requires a lot of fluids to function properly.\n\n【25】*   **Weight Issues and Eating Disorders**: Anorexia, bulimia, obesity, and being underweight can all cause fatigue and various other symptoms.\n\n【26】What Are the Symptoms of Fatigue?\n---------------------------------\n\n【27】Exhaustion from physical or mental activity is the primary symptom of fatigue. After resting or sleeping, a person does not feel refreshed. It may also be difficult for them to carry out their daily activities, such as work, housework, and caring for others.\n\n【28】Fatigue is commonly associated with the following symptoms:\n\n【29】*   Muscle ache or soreness.\n\n【30】*   Lack of motivation and apathy.\n\n【31】*   Drowsiness during the day.\n\n【32】*   Having trouble concentrating or learning new tasks.\n\n【33】*   Digestive issues such as bloating, constipation, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.\n\n【34】*   headache.\n\n【35】*   Irritability or depression.\n\n【36】*   Slowed response time.\n\n【37】*   Vision issues, such as blurriness.\n\n【38】Symptoms usually worsen after exertion.

To reduce fatigue, one must first understand the underlying causes of fatigue. If fatigue is interfering with the quality of life or causing distress, consult with a medical professional. They will assist in determining the cause of the fatigue and will offer suggestions on how to find relief by asking questions. If there is a reasonable chance that the cause of the fatigue is an undiagnosed medical issue, the doctor may recommend certain medical tests (for example, anemia or thyroid dysfunction).\n\n【49】If a medical condition does not cause fatigue, changing the lifestyle may help. One can reduce fatigue by doing the following:\n\n【50】*   **Maintain Healthy Sleeping Habits**: Aim for seven to nine hours of sleep per night. Do not consume caffeine, use electronics, or exercise before bed. Try sleeping and waking up at the same time every day. Ensure that the room is dark and quiet.\n\n【51】*   **Avoid Toxins**: Abstain from illegal drugs and alcohol consumption.\n\n【52】*   **Maintain a Healthy Diet**: A healthy diet and plenty of water will nourish and hydrate the body.\n\n【53】*   **Manage Stress**: Stress management methods such as mindfulness, yoga, meditation, and regular exercise can help relieve stress and gain energy.\n\n【54】*   **Consult a Doctor**: Schedule an appointment to rule out infections, illness, vitamin deficiency, and other health issues. One should also discuss with a healthcare provider to rule out fatigue from medications.\n\n【55】*   **Exercise Frequently**: Regular exercise is essential for living a healthy lifestyle. Though it may appear contradictory, vigorous exercise can help one feel more energetic. However, excessive exercise can cause fatigue.\n\n【56】*   **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Discuss the ideal weight with a healthcare provider or a nutritionist to maintain within the normal range.\n\n【57】**Conclusion**\n\n【58】Fatigue can be caused by various medical conditions and lifestyle factors, including diabetes, depression, and chronic pain. If fatigue and sleepiness interfere with a person's daily life, a doctor must be consulted.

Narcissistic personality disorder, otherwise called NPD, is a type of personality disorder. People with NPD have an extreme need for attention and admiration, an unreasonable sense of self-importance, problematic relationships, and an inability to share others’ feelings. But such people have very fragile self-esteem.\n\n【2】A narcissistic personality disorder affects an individual’s work, relationships, school, etc. When such people are not given special care, attention, and favors, they easily become unhappy and disappointed. Due to their constant need for appreciation and approval, others do not enjoy being in a relationship with them and they find all relationships unfulfilling. Treatment for narcissistic personality disorder centers around talk therapy (psychotherapy).\n\n【3】People with NPD have self-centered and arrogant thinking and behavior, which often makes others describe them as manipulative, demanding, selfish, and patronizing. These patients do not change their behavior even when they notice it is the root of all their problems. They always turn the blame to others and react extremely sensitive to minutest criticisms or disagreements. They view such criticisms as a personal attack.\n\n【4】As people with NPD do not consider themselves mentally ill, treatments have not been well studied. NPD is more common in men than women and affects about 1 % of people at some point in life. This condition was first described in 1925 by the psychoanalyst Robert Waelder, and in 1968, Heinz Kohut coined the term narcissistic personality disorder.\n\n【5】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Narcissistic Personality Disorder?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The traits or signs and symptoms that a narcissistic personality disorder are:\n\n【7】*   An exaggerated sense of self-importance.\n\n【8】*   Require constant and excessive admiration that they deserve.\n\n【9】*   They tend to exaggerate their achievements and talents.\n\n【10】*   Fantasize about the perfect partner, success, money, power, and beauty.\n\n【11】*   A constant need to be considered superior even without any achievements.\n\n【12】*   Consider themselves superior and associate only with equally superior people.\n\n【13】*   Crave special favors and attention from everyone.\n\n【14】*   Step on and use others to get what they want.\n\n【15】*   Look down on people who they consider to be inferior.\n\n【16】*   An inability to understand and recognize others’ feelings and needs.\n\n【17】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I believe that I have narcissistic personality disorder and pathological lying.

But like all other mental health disorders, narcissistic personality disorder is also believed to be caused due to multiple factors. The possible factors include:\n\n【33】1.  Environment - excessive adoration or criticism by parents during childhood.\n\n【34】2.  Neurobiology - problems with the brain and behavior connection.\n\n【35】3.  Genetics.\n\n【36】### Risk Factors:\n\n【37】*   Males are more susceptible than females.\n\n【38】*   Teenagers and young adults are more prone than older adults.\n\n【39】*   Excessive pampering.\n\n【40】*   Childhood abuse.\n\n【41】*   Engaging in frequent sexual activity with different partners.\n\n【42】*   Parents expecting unrealistic things from their children.\n\n【43】How Is Narcissistic Personality Disorder Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】There is no specific lab test that can diagnose this personality disorder. But your doctor might suggest X-rays and blood tests to rule out other conditions that can result in similar signs and symptoms.\n\n【45】For NPD diagnosis, the patient must show the following criteria written in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which was published by the APA (American Psychiatric Association):\n\n【46】1.  Exaggerated importance and idea of self.\n\n【47】2.  The patient’s thoughts are dominated by fantasies about money, power, beauty, and success.\n\n【48】3.  The patient believes that he or she is special, and relates only to other people that they consider special.\n\n【49】4.  A constant need to be admired.\n\n【50】5.  They feel that they are entitled to most things.\n\n【51】6.  Try to manipulate and use others for self-gain.\n\n【52】7.  Inability to feel and recognize others’ feelings or lack of empathy.\n\n【53】8.  Envious of others.\n\n【54】9.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a rapidly evolving disease that may be associated with other conditions. The characteristic features of the disease are the abnormal formation of fibrous tissue in the bile ducts, inflammation, and enlargement of the bile ducts.\n\n【2】Both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are affected by primary sclerosing cholangitis. Symptoms of primary sclerosing cholangitis include itching, fatigue, and jaundice (yellowing mucous membrane discoloration, skin, and skin whites of the eyes). Affected persons may also suffer from nausea or abdominal pain and pass dark urine and light-colored stools. The treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis is not specified, however, treatment of appearing symptoms helps to slow the progression of the disease.\n\n【3】What Are the Causes of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a multifactorial disorder that is caused by a combination of several factors such as environmental, genetic, and immunologic.\n\n【5】*   Researchers state that primary sclerosing cholangitis results from a triggering factor that is not specific and causes an abnormal immune response that leads to an autoimmune reaction. The body’s immune system attacks its bile duct cells, leading to primary sclerosing cholangitis. In most cases, the triggering factors are toxic agents or any infection.\n\n【6】*   Genetics has an important role in the onset of primary sclerosing cholangitis as the incidence of the disease is very high among first-degree relatives such as parents, children, and siblings. Researchers have stated that there are 16 genetic regions that can be expected to be associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Genetic predisposition means that a person carries genes for the disease which gets triggered due to an external environmental factor.\n\n【7】*   Several theories explain the pathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis including leaky gut syndrome in individuals with primary sclerosing cholangitis along with inflammatory bowel disease or the toxic bile theory. But these theories can not explain the cause of all the cases of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Thus, more research and studies must be carried out to know the exact cause of primary sclerosing cholangitis.\n\n【8】Which Population Is Mostly Affected by Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Though primary sclerosing cholangitis is a rare disease, it affects males twice as often as females. The age spectrum is not specific as it can affect any age group. Gradually primary sclerosing cholangitis is becoming one of the main reasons behind liver transplant cases in the United States of America.\n\n【10】What Are the Symptoms of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Primary sclerosing cholangitis leads to episodes of interrupted or obstructed bile flow from the liver, known as cholestasis. This obstruction occurs due to thickening, inflammation, and formation of abnormal fibrous tissues within the bile ducts. Initially, the patient may be asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms which progress gradually.\n\n【12】Some of the common symptoms of primary sclerosing cholangitis are:\n\n【13】*   Abdominal discomfort and pain, especially in the upper right side of the abdomen.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Portal Hypertension - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Cholangitis - Indications, Types, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Fatigue or tiredness.\n\n【15】*   **Pruritus**: Uncomfortable and irritating sensation, creating an urge to scratch the skin.\n\n【16】*   **Obstructive Jaundice:** Blockage of bile flow from the liver leads to absorption of bile into the bloodstream. This results in yellowishness of the skin, mucous membrane, and sclera of the eyes.\n\n【17】*   Passing of dark-colored urine and light-colored stools.\n\n【18】*   **Nausea:** Feeling of uneasiness and vomiting.\n\n【19】*   **Hepatomegaly**: Abnormal enlargement of the liver.\n\n【20】*   **Splenomegaly:** Abnormal enlargement of the spleen.\n\n【21】*   Sudden weight loss.\n\n【22】*   Deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins including A, D, E, and K.\n\n【23】*   **Hepatic Osteodystrophy:** A metabolic bone disease that develops due to chronic liver disease.\n\n【24】*   The affected patients may also suffer from osteoporosis, in which the bone density and calcium deposition in bones are reduced. Osteoporosis leads to repeated fractures.\n\n【25】*   Episodes of fever, chills, and night sweating due to bacterial cholangitis.\n\n【26】*   Scarring and destruction of liver tissues due to bile accumulation.\n\n【27】*   **Portal Hypertension:** Increased blood pressure in the vessels of the liver.\n\n【28】*   **Ascites:** Ascites is defined as the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen.\n\n【29】*   Increased chances of development of cholangiocarcinoma. Approximately 8-15 % of affected individuals with primary sclerosing cholangitis develop cholangiocarcinoma.\n\n【30】*   Ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease in almost 60% to 70% of cases of primary sclerosing cholangitis.\n    </u>\n\n【31】Some of the Autoimmune Diseases Associated With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Are:\n\n【32】*   **Celiac Disease**: It is also known as gluten-sensitive enteropathy. It is an immune response to eating gluten.\n\n【33】*   **Sjorgen’s Syndrome**: Immune disorder is characterized by the common symptoms of dry mouth and eyes.\n\n【34】*   **Peyronie’s Disease**: Non-cancerous condition resulting from fibrous scar tissue developed on the penis and causes painful and curved erections.\n\n【35】*   **Psoriasis**: A skin disease that commonly causes itchy, scaly, and red patches on elbows, knees, scalp, and trunk. It is a chronic disease with no cure.\n\n【36】*   **Wegener’s Granulomatosis**: It is an uncommon disorder that leads to inflammation of the blood vessels in which the throat, sinuses, lungs, kidneys, and nose.\n\n【37】*   **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: It is a rare condition characterized by large, painful ulcers that develop on the skin and legs.\n\n【38】How to Diagnose Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【39】The most important step in diagnosing primary sclerosing cholangitis is a medical history and clinical examination. After this, there are a few tests that help to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【40】These are:\n\n【41】*   **Liver Functional Test:** It is performed to evaluate the concentration and levels of liver enzymes. Elevation of liver enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase indicate chances of liver disease but specifically primary sclerosing cholangitis.\n\n【42】*   **Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography**: It is a non-invasive test used to evaluate the extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts.\n\n【43】*   **Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography**: This imaging technique also helps to diagnose primary sclerosing cholangitis. An endoscope (a thin flexible tube) is inserted into the mouth and down through the esophagus, stomach, and bile ducts. A contrast dye is taken to investigate and evaluate the function and health of bile ducts.\n\n【44】*   **Liver Biopsy:** A sample of tissue is taken surgically for a microscopic examination to evaluate the progress of primary sclerosing cholangitis and the state of the liver.\n\n【45】*   In some cases, a colonoscopy is recommended to evaluate the function and health of the bowels due to the association of primary sclerosing cholangitis with inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer.\n\n【46】What Is the Treatment for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】There is no specific treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis, however, treating the associated symptoms can slow the progress of the disease.\n\n【48】*   Narrowed or blocked bile ducts can be treated with medical procedures, such as percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.\n\n【49】*   Itchy skin is cured by skin creams and lotions containing Menthol, camphor, Pramoxine, or Capsaicin. In some cases, antihistamines such as Fexofenadine can also be used.\n\n【50】*   Supplements for fat-soluble vitamin deficiency and calcium deficiency in bones.\n\n【51】*   Antibiotics such as Penicillin are advised for bile duct infections.\n\n【52】*   In cirrhosis or liver failure cases, transplantation is the only treatment choice.\n\n【53】**Conclusion**:\n\n【54】Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a complex disorder with no specific causative factor. It affects both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The episodic obstruction of bile due to the disease leads to symptoms such as inflammation, abdominal pain, scarring, and cirrhosis of the liver. The treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis depends on the treatment of associated symptoms.\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>*   Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/liver-disease/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis\n*   Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)  \n    https://liverfoundation.org/liver-diseases/rare-disease/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-psc/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is a serious condition that is rare. The onset of aplastic anemia can be sudden or gradual, and it can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). Aplastic anemia can affect individuals of any age, gender, and race. The cause of aplastic anemia is multifactorial, including certain infections and medications. Although aplastic anemia is found equally in all age groups, a comparatively higher incidence is found in childhood and young adulthood between 20 to 25 years of age. However, it can also occur frequently in elderly patients.\n\n【2】Asians or Asian-American are also at higher risk for developing aplastic anemia. Aplastic anemia is of inherited and acquired types. Inherited aplastic anemia occurs due to gene mutation and occurs more in children and young adults, while acquired occurs due to dysfunction of the immune system and is common in elderly people.\n\n【3】What Are the Causes of Aplastic Anemia in Older People?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】1.  **Autoimmune Disorders:** The most common cause of aplastic anemia is an autoimmune disorder when the immune system starts attacking the healthy cells of the body. When the immune system attacks bone marrow, a tissue inside bones that is responsible for the production of blood cells, aplastic anemia occurs.\n\n【5】2.  **Exposure to Chemicals:** Studies revealed that exposure to toxic chemicals in insecticides and pesticides can induce aplastic anemia\n\n【6】3.  **Radiation therapy or Chemotherapy:** Radiation therapy and chemotherapy can kill the growth of tumors or cancer cells. But sometimes, it can also affect bone marrow stem cells which leads to a decrease in the production of blood cells. Aplastic anemia is a common side effect of these therapies.\n\n【7】4.  **Use of Medications:** Medications used to treat thyroid disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain antibiotics can cause aplastic anemia.\n\n【8】5.  **Infections:** Some viral infections like hepatitis, cytomegalovirus, Ebstein-Barr virus, HIV, etc. are found to be associated with aplastic anemia.\n\n【9】6.  **Family History:** Aplastic anemia can be inherited and can occur in many members of the same family. It occurs as a part of a syndrome called inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS), which is a rare genetic disorder.\n\n【10】7.  **Unknown Causes:** The exact cause of aplastic anemia is unknown in certain cases and is known as idiopathic aplastic anemia.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Post chemotherapy, there is remission of RA with pain in joints.

All these have many functions. RBCs carry oxygen, WBCs can fight infections, and platelets induce clotting or stoppage of bleeding. When the stem cells get affected, the number of all these cells in the blood gets reduced which results in the following symptoms:\n\n【14】*   Frequent nosebleeds and bleeding gums.\n\n【15】*   An irregular and fast heartbeat.\n\n【16】*   Tiredness.\n\n【17】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【18】*   Bruising or bleeding easily.\n\n【19】*   Petechiae or red-colored round spots.\n\n【20】*   Pale skin.\n\n【21】*   Chest pain.\n\n【22】*   Headaches.\n\n【23】*   Fever.\n\n【24】*   Contracting infections frequently.\n\n【25】*   Skin rashes.\n\n【26】What Are the Complications of Aplastic Anemia?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【27】If left untreated aplastic anemia can end up in severe complications such as:\n\n【28】*   Leukemia.\n\n【29】*   Irregular heartbeat.\n\n【30】*   Heart failure.\n\n【31】*   Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\n【32】*   Uncontrolled bleeding.\n\n【33】How Is Aplastic Anemia Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【34】The physician will ask for a detailed medical history of symptoms and history of diseases, medications, exposure to any toxins, etc. Family history of aplastic anemia will also be inquired.\n\n【35】*   **Blood Test:** The physician will advise a blood test to get a count of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The levels of all these cells will be low in a person with aplastic anemia.\n\n【36】*   **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** A tiny sample of bone marrow will be isolated from the person’s larger bone, like hip bone, and is analyzed under the microscope. Bone marrow biopsy is the confirmatory test for aplastic anemia.\n\n【37】How Is Aplastic Anemia Treated in Older People?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【38】*   **Immunosuppressants:** These are often indicated in patients with autoimmune disorders to suppress the immune system. The immunosuppressant cyclosporin, in combination with anti-thymocyte globulin, a horse or rabbit-derived antibody, suppresses the immune system and generates new cells in the bone marrow.\n\n【39】*   **Bone Marrow Stimulants:** Sargramostim, filgrastim, and eltrombopag are some of the bone marrow stimulants that are used in the treatment of aplastic anemia. These drugs can stimulate bone marrow for the production of new blood cells.\n\n【40】*   **Bone Marrow Transplantation:** In this procedure, the bone marrow of the person with aplastic anemia is removed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy, followed by the infusion of healthy stem cells from a donor through an intravenous route into the blood. The infused stem cells will migrate to the bone marrow cavities, where they start forming new blood cells. A healthy sibling is usually preferred as a donor. Also known as stem cell transplantation, this procedure is indicated in severe aplastic anemia and young adults. However, if the older patients are overall healthy, they can also be eligible for this procedure.\n\n【41】*   **Blood Transfusion:** Although blood transfusion is not a cure for aplastic anemia, it can manage symptoms like bleeding or bruising.\n\n【42】*   **Antibiotics and Antivirals:** Infections are common in patients with aplastic anemia. So antibiotics and antiviral drugs are prescribed as supportive therapy based on the infection.\n\n【43】What Are the Precautions to Be Taken by People With Aplastic Anemia?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Elderly patients with aplastic anemia have to take extra precautions because, in addition to this condition, they may also suffer from other diseases.\n\n【45】*   **Stay Away From Sick People:** The risk of contracting infections is very high in aplastic anemia. Hence, patients need to prevent infection by staying away from infected people.\n\n【46】*   **Wash Hands Properly:** Hands have to be washed or sanitized frequently to kill bacteria, viruses, or other germs that may have the potential to cause disease.\n\n【47】*   Get flu shots annually, as flu is a very common illness.\n\n【48】*   Stay away from crowds as crowds may contain asymptomatic infected people.\n\n【49】*   Before taking a flight or going to high altitudes, oxygen levels have to be checked by consulting a doctor.\n\n【50】**Conclusion**\n\n【51】Aplastic anemia is a serious but rare disorder that can affect individuals of any age. It is caused by the impairment of bone marrow to produce sufficient amounts of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets which leads to many symptoms like frequent infections, uncontrolled bleeding, shortness of breath, etc. Inherited aplastic anemia is common in children, while acquired is the one that is commonly seen in older people. Certain medications, exposure to toxins, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, autoimmune disorders, etc. are the causes of acquired aplastic anemia. Various treatment options have been developed to treat and manage the symptoms of aplastic anemia, and as a part of prevention, some countries have banned the medications which induce aplastic anemia.\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>*   Older Adults  \n    https://www.aamds.org/caregivers/patient-type/older-adults\n*   Aplastic Anemia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534212/\n*   Aplastic Anemia  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/aplasticanemia.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The common allergy triggers are as follows:\n\n【49】*   **Airborne Allergens:** Such as animal dander, dust mites, pollen, and mold spores.\n\n【50】*   **Certain Foods:** Include peanuts, shellfish, tea nuts, fish, wheat, eggs, and milk.\n\n【51】*   **Insect Stings:** Such as wasps or bees.\n\n【52】*   **Medications:** Such as penicillin-based medications.\n\n【53】*   **Latex:** Can cause skin allergic reactions.\n\n【54】What Is an Allergic Reaction?\n-----------------------------\n\n【55】Allergic reaction is the way the body responds to allergens. Whenever the person comes in contact with the allergens, the body responds by producing allergic (IgE) antibodies. As a result, a chemical is released known as histamine that causes symptoms of allergy.\n\n【56】Which of the Areas of the Body May Get Affected?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【57】People experience symptoms depending on the contact with allergens that involve different body parts.\n\n【58】*   **Eyes, Nose, Throat, and Sinuses:** When allergens are breathed, the release of histamine occurs, which causes the linings of the nose to form more mucous and become inflamed and swallowed. It causes the nose to itch and sneeze. The throat may become sore, and the eyes start to water.\n\n【59】*   **Lungs and Chest:** Allergic reactions can trigger asthma. When the allergen comes in contact with the lining of the passage, the lung swells, and it becomes difficult to breathe.\n\n【60】*   **Stomach and Bowel:** Food that usually causes allergies are seafood, dairy food, peanuts, and eggs. Cow milk allergy is common in infants and can cause eczema (refers to dry, itchy skin and rashes), stomach upset, and asthma.\n\n【61】*   **Skin:** Problems are usually triggered by allergies such as eczema (dry, itchy skin and rashes).\n\n【62】What Is the Prevalence of Allergy?\n----------------------------------\n\n【63】Approximately 10 to 30 percent of an individual in the world are affected by allergies. The prevalence of allergy has drastically increased over the period of two years.\n\n【64】**Who Is at Risk of Allergies?**\n--------------------------------\n\n【65】*   Allergies can develop at any age and time of life. Food allergies are the most common allergies in infants.\n\n【66】*   Sensitization, or the initial exposure period of allergy, can begin even before birth.\n\n【67】*   Allergies can outgrow in an individual over a period of time.\n\n【68】*   Genetics or family history plays a major role as there is a high risk of developing allergies from parent to child.\n\n【69】*   A child born through cesarean section is more prone to develop allergies.\n\n【70】*   Exposure to air pollution and smoking increases the risk of allergy.\n\n【71】How to Diagnose Allergy?\n------------------------\n\n【72】The allergy can be diagnosed by the symptoms and family history. The allergy tests which can be done are as follows:\n\n【73】*   **Blood Test:** Measures the levels of IgE antibodies which are specific to certain allergens in the immune system.\n\n【74】*   **Skin Prick Test:** A prick is made on the skin surface that contains allergens. If the skin reacts and becomes red, itchy, or swollen indicates the presence of allergens.\n\n【75】*   **Patch Test:** It is done to check for the presence of eczema (refers to dry, itchy skin and rashes) using the metal disc with a small amount of allergen. Skin reaction is checked after 48 hours of the patch test.\n\n【76】**What Are the Preventive Measures for Allergies?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【77】Effective preventive measures for allergy include the medications such as:\n\n【78】*   **Antihistamines:** Tends to block the chemical called histamine that is released from mast cells.\n\n【79】*   **Intranasal Corticosteroid Nasal Spray (INCS):** It is effective for the treatment of moderate to severe allergies.\n\n【80】*   **Combination Therapies (INCS and Antihistamine):** These are used for the treatment of severe allergies.\n\n【81】*   **Decongestants:** Are used to relieve blocked noses.\n\n【82】*   **Immunotherapy:** It helps the person develop long-term tolerance either as an injection or in tablet form.\n\n【83】*   **Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist:** Thismay help in treating moderate to severe allergy by blocking chemicals that cause allergy.\n\n【84】*   **Medicated Eye Drops:** Theseare helpful in cases with eye tears due to allergens.\n\n【85】*   **Adrenaline (Epinephrine):** It is used in emergency treatment for life-threatening severe allergic reactions. Adrenaline is usually administered using injections.\n\n【86】*   **Non-Medicated Treatment:** This includes a saline spray for treating sinusitis (refers to inflammation or swelling of the tissue lining the sinus).\n\n【87】**What Are Complications of Allergy?**\n--------------------------------------\n\n【88】The complications of allergy are asthma, eczema (refers to a skin condition characterized by rashes and inflammation), ear or lung infection, sinus infection, nasal polyp (refers to non-cancerous growth on the lining of the sinus or nose), and migraine (refers to the headache that causes severe pain).\n\n【89】**Conclusion**\n\n【90】The prognosis of allergy is often excellent as it does not affect the life expectancy of an individual. The precautions taken to prevent the risk of allergy are exposure to allergens should be avoided, and autoinjectors should be accommodated by the person who has an allergy to certain things.\n\n【91】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【92】无关删除-1:<u>*   What is Allergy?  \n    https://www.allergy.org.au/patients/about-allergy/what-is-allergy\n*   Allergies  \n    https://acaai.org/allergies/\n*   Allergies  \n    https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-treatments/allergies</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "9dc52f0c-f16a-45d9-be59-1a2f12832b0f", "title": "Lower Nose Site for Safe Filler Injections", "text": "【0】Lower Nose Site for Safe Filler Injections\n**Introduction**:\n\n【1】The advent of dermal fillers has revolutionized the rhinoplasty procedure. Not only are these dermal filler injections safe, but they are equally effective and productive as surgical methods. As a result, nonsurgical rhinoplasty has gained popularity over the past few decades among patients with a crooked nose or other nasal deformities. In addition, it also reduces the time and cost the patient needs to bear for surgical rhinoplasty. However, though the procedure has numerous benefits, it is technically challenging, along with numerous risks or complications. Hence, doctors must perform the procedure with a clinically sound understanding of the lower nose anatomy and safe injection techniques.\n\n【2】Which Lower Nose Sites Are Safe for Filler Injections?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Patients who are willing to undergo nonsurgical rhinoplasty must consult the doctor for a thorough nasal examination. This is because the doctor needs to comprehend the nasal anatomy to inject dermal fillers safely and appropriately. The following skin layers of the nose are commonly observed during nonsurgical rhinoplasty:\n\n【4】*   **Skin** \\- It is the thickest portion at the tip and thinnest at the lower end of nasal bones. People with thicker and oily skin often have problems undergoing nonsurgical rhinoplasty because it becomes difficult to insert the injection needle at this site. The risk of postoperative edema is high in such patients.\n\n【5】*   **Superficial Fat** - It is a space within the nose occupied by major blood vessels.\n\n【6】*   **Deep Fat** - It is an avascular area that is one of the safest sites for filler injections. Though small arteries are present in this layer, fillers can be safely injected without any complications. However, the injection must be inserted slowly, and aspiration must be done repeatedly.\n\n【7】*   **Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System** \\- It is a thin layer of fibers and muscles occupied by major blood vessels.\n\n【8】*   **Perichondrium** \\- It is a thin fibrous layer present over the cartilage.\n\n【9】*   **Periosteum** \\- It is a thin fibrous layer present over the bones.\n\n【10】One needs to remain careful while injecting at sites having abundant blood supply. The blood supply of the nose arises from ophthalmic and facial arteries via the internal and external carotid arteries. Hence, the vasculature of the lower nose can be described below:\n\n【11】*   **Ophthalmic Artery** - It gives rise to two arteries that supply the upper portion of the nose.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Fecal Transplantation - Types and Procedures</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Eye Lift Without Surgery</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Phonophoresis In Physiotherapy</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   **Facial Artery** - It gives rise to several branches that supply the lower portion of the nose.\n    </u>\n\n【13】Doctors usually emphasize injection in the avascular zone to avoid vascular occlusion, necrosis, and blindness. The doctor can obtain an elaborate nasal analysis after thoroughly reviewing the nasal anatomy. This anatomical analysis allows one to inject in the safe sites.\n\n【14】What Are Facial Fillers or Dermal Fillers?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Dermal or facial fillers are an integral part of minimally invasive nonsurgical procedures. There are numerous varieties of dermal fillers. Doctors usually inject these fillers in the areas surrounding the nose, mouth, and eyes. Dermal fillers work to reduce wrinkles, smoothen fine lines, and restore facial volume. The doctor usually injects these fillers under the skin. People opt for this treatment procedure to improve their features and obtain a youthful look. Though dermal filler is a non-invasive procedure, it has several risks or complications, including bleeding, bruising, or infections.\n\n【16】What Are the Indications of Filler Injections in the Lower Nose?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Non Surgical rhinoplasty or infusion of filler injections in the lower nose is usually done to correct minor cosmetic flaws. This procedure is specifically done for patients who want to avoid the cost, surgical trauma, downtime, and risks associated with surgical rhinoplasty. Hence, nonsurgical rhinoplasty is indicated to address the following:\n\n【18】*   Low radix (radix is a depression near the root of the nose).\n\n【19】*   Presence of convexity or hump on the nose.\n\n【20】*   Concavity on the nose.\n\n【21】*   Presence of irregularities or asymmetry in nasal contour.\n\n【22】*   Reduced tip projection.\n\n【23】*   Reduced tip rotation.\n\n【24】*   Irregularities in the structure surrounding the nostrils.\n\n【25】*   Presence of irregularities after rhinoplasty.\n\n【26】What Are the Contraindications of Using Filler Injections in the Lower Nose?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Before initiating the procedure, the doctor must determine if the patient is suitable for surgical or nonsurgical rhinoplasty. In addition, patients with excess nasal deviation rotated tips and irregularities in the contour of the tip might have limited benefits. Hence, nonsurgical rhinoplasty must be offered to patients willing to undergo hump reduction or irregularly positioned nasion. In addition, people with unrealistic expectations must not be recommended for this procedure. The absolute contraindications of dermal fillers include the following:\n\n【28】*   Patients with a history of autoimmune diseases.\n\n【29】*   Presence of bleeding disorders.\n\n【30】*   Pregnant females.\n\n【31】*   Breastfeeding mothers.\n\n【32】*   Inflammation or infection at the injection site.\n\n【33】*   Patients with a previous history of nonsurgical rhinoplasty with silicone.\n\n【34】In addition to the contraindications mentioned above, patients diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder must be referred to a psychiatrist before undergoing filler rhinoplasty. Such patients have poor satisfaction related to the procedure. Filler rhinoplasty is contraindicated in patients taking the following drugs:\n\n【35】*   Anticoagulants.\n\n【36】*   Antiplatelet drugs.\n\n【37】*   Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n【38】*   Herbal medications or supplements include ephedra, chondroitin, echinacea, or ginger.\n\n【39】How Does the Procedure Work?\n----------------------------\n\n【40】Non Surgical rhinoplasty uses fillers to change the shape and contour of the nose. The procedure is relatively simple compared to surgical rhinoplasty. During the procedure, a gel-like substance, mainly hyaluronic acid, is inserted underneath the skin to target those areas, creating fine lines specifically. In some cases, botox might also be used. The ingredients of the injections settle in the deeper skin tissues. Hence, the patient can have an improved appearance of the nose within four months to three years, depending on the skin, outcomes, and the constituents used. The entire procedure gets completed within 15 to 45 minutes.\n\n【41】What Are Some of the Risks or Side Effects of Nonsurgical Rhinoplasty?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】Some people often complain of sensitivity and redness at the injection site after liquid rhinoplasty within one or two days after the procedure. The additional side effects of nonsurgical rhinoplasty are listed below:\n\n【43】*   Swelling.\n\n【44】*   Bruising.\n\n【45】*   A wavy or overfilled look of the nose.\n\n【46】*   Nausea.\n\n【47】The nose is a delicate or sensitive organ occupied by major blood vessels close to the eyes. Hence, nonsurgical rhinoplasty is more complicated than other procedures. Some of the other serious complications are listed below:\n\n【48】*   Vascular complications.\n\n【49】*   Tissue necrosis.\n\n【50】*   Loss of vision.\n\n【51】Some of the rare complications are listed below:\n\n【52】*   Fever.\n\n【53】*   Blurred vision.\n\n【54】*   Redness.\n\n【55】*   Hives.\n\n【56】*   Allergic reactions.\n\n【57】**Conclusion**:\n\n【58】The nose is a sensitive organ and is richly supplied by a network of nerves and blood vessels. As a result, the risk of complications increases when any surgical or non-surgical procedures are performed. Hence, dermal fillers should be used cautiously to avoid any nasal complications.\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【60】无关删除-1:<u>*   Nose, Nasal Cavities, & Paranasal Sinuses  \n    https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/respiratory/passages/nose.html\n*   Lower Nose Arterial Plexus and Implications for Safe Filler Injections  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35994353/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The drug is used to treat angina and lower the risk of death after a heart attack. The beta-blocker reduces the workload on the heart and helps to reduce strain on the heart. Atenolol is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for treatment in acute myocardial infarction. It may also be used for the treatment of arrhythmias, migraine prevention, alcohol withdrawal, and prophylaxis against secondary myocardial infarction.\n\n【2】How Does Atenolol Work?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】Atenolol affects the response to the nerve impulses such as epinephrine in certain body parts, like the heart and blood vessels. This resulted in lower heartbeats and decreased blood pressure. The beta-blockers effects manifest within one hour of single oral administration, while with an intravenous dose, the effects are evident within five minutes.\n\n【4】Atenolol reaches the peak concentration within two hours of an oral dose. The kidneys predominantly eliminate the hydrophilic beta-receptor, with only 5 percent metabolized by the liver.\n\n【5】What Is the Dosage of Atenolol?\n-------------------------------\n\n【6】How to Take Atenolol?\n---------------------\n\n【7】Atenolol is available in strengths of 25 milligrams, 50 milligrams, and 100 milligrams. The dosage, drug form, and how often the drug may be taken depends on various factors such as\n\n【8】*   Age.\n\n【9】*   The condition that is being treated.\n\n【10】*   The severity of the condition.\n\n【11】*   Other medical conditions.\n\n【12】*   Response to the first dose.\n\n【13】The doctor recommends taking the first dose of Atenolol before bedtime, as it can make the person feel dizzy. There should be an eight to ten hours interval between the doses when taking the medication twice daily. Atenolol may be taken with or without food and should be taken at the same time of the day. Atenolol should be swallowed whole with plenty of water. A plastic syringe is provided to measure the liquid form of Atenolol. It is advised that one should not stop taking Atenolol suddenly, as it may worsen the condition.\n\n【14】What Are the Possible Side Effects of Atenolol?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Some commonly observed side effects of Atenolol may include\n\n【16】*   New or worsening chest pain.\n\n【17】*   Slow, uneven heartbeats.\n\n【18】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    My husband had Losar Beta H twice by mistake.

Atenolol passes into the breast milk and may cause drowsiness in the baby.\n\n【32】*   **Congestive Heart Failure -** Atenolol reduces myocardial contractility and may worsen or precipitate heart failure, especially during volume overload. Therapy with beta-blockers can be administered cautiously in some congestive heart failure patients who are receiving Digitalis, diuretics, an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor, or nitrates.\n\n【33】*   **Mind Alertness -** Atenolol impairs thinking or reactions and should not be taken while driving or handling machinery.\n\n【34】*   **Alcohol -** Avoid drinking alcohol when taking Atenolol, as it may increase drowsiness and dizziness.\n\n【35】*   **Diabetes -** Therapy with beta-blockers should be administered cautiously in patients with diabetes or predisposed to spontaneous hypoglycemia as they affect insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay the recovery of normal blood sugar levels.\n\n【36】*   **Children -** Beta-blockers should be cautiously administered in small children as they may cause shallow heart rate, lethargy, and coma.\n\n【37】*   **Asthma -** Atenolol is contraindicated in bronchospastic disease as it may worsen the existing conditions.\n\n【38】*   **Elderly -** Beta-blockers should be avoided in older adults because of physiologic changes associated with people over 60 years of age, such as low cardiac output, low glomerular filtration rate, bradycardia, and reduced renal blood flow.\n\n【39】What Are the Interactions of Atenolol with Other Medicines and Supplements?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】**Drug Interaction:**\n\n【41】Some medicines may affect the effectiveness of Atenolol. These medications may include\n\n【42】*   Other medicines for high blood pressure like Carvedilol, Metoprolol, Sotalol, and Bisoprolol.\n\n【43】*   Amiodarone.\n\n【44】*   Flecainide.\n\n【45】*   Digoxin.\n\n【46】*   Diltiazem.\n\n【47】*   Nifedipine.\n\n【48】*   Verapamil.\n\n【49】*   Reserpine.\n\n【50】*   Amlodipine.\n\n【51】*   Clonidine.\n\n【52】*   Isocarboxazid.\n\n【53】*   Indomethacin.\n\n【54】**Interaction with Food:**\n\n【55】*   **Multivitamins with Minerals -** Using Atenolol with multivitamins and minerals may decrease the effects of Atenolol. Care should be taken to separate the administration of these drugs by at least two hours.\n\n【56】*   **Orange Juice -** Taking large amounts of orange juice can decrease the effectiveness of Atenolol.\n\n【57】*   **Alcohol -** Alcohol aggravates the effects of Atenolol in lowering blood pressure and may cause headaches, increased heart rate, dizziness, and fainting.\n\n【58】**Interaction with Disease:**\n\n【59】*   **Hemodialysis -** Patients on hemodialysis should receive a dose of Atenolol following each dialysis as it is moderately removed by conventional hemodialysis.\n\n【60】*   **Renal Dysfunction -** The kidneys eliminate Atenolol. There is significant drug accumulation in patients because of low clearance levels in patients with renal dysfunction.\n\n【61】*   **Bradyarrhythmias -** Atenolol is contraindicated in patients with sinus bradyarrhythmia or heart block.\n\n【62】*   **Cardiogenic Shock -** Atenolol is contraindicated in patients with hypotension as the beta-blockers may further depress the cardiac output and blood pressure.\n\n【63】*   **Congestive Heart Failure** \\- Beta-adrenergic receptors should not be given to patients with congestive heart failure as it can worsen heart failure.\n\n【64】*   **Diabetes -** Atenolol may mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as tremors, tachycardia, and blood pressure changes in patients with diabetes.\n\n【65】*   **Ischemic Heart Disease -** Cessation of beta-blocker therapy should be done gradually with reduced dosages over some time as there may be an exacerbation of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias.\n\n【66】*   **Glaucoma -** Systemic beta-blockers may lower intraocular pressure. Patients with glaucoma may require adjustments in their dosage or discontinue the therapy.\n\n【67】*   **Hyperthyroidism -** Abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blockers can exacerbate thyrotoxicosis or precipitate a thyroid storm. Close monitoring is recommended during and after therapy withdrawal.\n\n【68】*   **Myasthenia Gravis -** Beta-blockers may potentiate muscle weakness and symptoms such as diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness.\n\n【69】**Conclusion:**\n\n【70】Atenolol lowers blood pressure, so it is essential to check the blood pressure periodically. It is advised not to stop taking Atenolol suddenly as it may increase the risk of a heart attack. Eating a healthy diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, low-fat meat, and dairy products, and avoiding packaged or processed foods provide added benefits.\n\n【71】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【72】无关删除-1:<u>*   National Library of Medicine - Atenolol  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539844/\n*   Medicine net - Atenolol  \n    https://www.medicinenet.com/atenolol/article.htm\n*   Medline plus - Atenolol  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a684031.html#:~:text=Atenolol%20is%20used%20alone%20or,of%20medications%20called%20beta%20blockers.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is characterized by obstruction of the outflow in the hepatic veins (veins that carry deoxygenated blood from the liver to the heart). It occurs in one in a million of the general population. The clinical manifestations are nonspecific, and imaging may be difficult in the early stages. Generally, obstruction of a single hepatic vein is not evident clinically, and the clinical manifestations are seen when two veins are blocked. However, if left untreated, the condition may become fatal.\n\n【2】What Is Budd-Chiari Syndrome (BCS)?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】The liver has many functions that include filtering all the blood in the body. When the outflow of blood is blocked fully or partially, it results in Budd-Chiari syndrome. The obstruction could be thrombotic (blood clots inside the blood vessel) or non-thrombotic, occurring anywhere between the hepatic vein to the inferior vena cava or the right atrium. This can result in high blood pressure of the portal vein, known as portal hypertension. This causes reduced hepatic perfusion, which eventually results in liver congestion. Then the blood flow to the liver cells is reduced, leading to an injury of the liver cells followed by the death of the liver cells. It is followed by progressive fibrosis or scarring and ultimately liver cirrhosis or liver failure.\n\n【4】What Causes Budd-Chiari Syndrome?\n---------------------------------\n\n【5】BCS occurs commonly in women and young adults. It could be primary or secondary, depending on the origin of the obstructive lesion. If the obstruction is due to the hepatic venous lesion like a thrombosis, it is considered a primary BCS. If the block is due to tumor invasion or extrinsic causes, then it is a secondary BCS. Thrombosis is the primary cause of hepatic vein obstruction. Other causes include:\n\n【6】1.  Hematologic diseases, especially myeloproliferative disorders.\n\n【7】2.  Thrombotic diseases include paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (characterized by destruction of red blood cells), antiphospholipid syndrome (disorder in which the immune system mistakenly affects the normal proteins), etc.\n\n【8】3.  Metastatic invasion.\n\n【9】4.  Membranous web-like obstruction of the hepatic vein.\n\n【10】5.  Interruption of the diaphragm, which is congenital.\n\n【11】6.  Behcet’s disease.\n\n【12】7.  The use of oral contraceptives or pregnancy.\n\n【13】8.  Abdominal trauma.\n\n【14】9.  Infections such as tuberculosis, syphilis, aspergillosis.\n\n【15】10.

Immunosuppressant drugs.\n    </u>\n\n【21】What Are the Signs and Symptoms?\n--------------------------------\n\n【22】The clinical signs and symptoms in the patient depend upon the extent and acuteness of the hepatic venous obstruction. BCS includes the following signs and symptoms:\n\n【23】*   Severe upper abdominal pain.\n\n【24】*   Jaundice.\n\n【25】*   Liver enlargement.\n\n【26】*   Spleen enlargement.\n\n【27】*   Fluid accumulation within the peritoneal cavity (ascites).\n\n【28】*   Elevated liver enzymes.\n\n【29】*   Encephalopathy (damage to the brain).\n\n【30】*   Severe lactic acidosis.\n\n【31】How to Diagnose Budd-Chiari Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【32】Doppler ultrasonography of the liver, computed tomography(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hepatic venography, metabolic function tests, cavograms, and liver biopsy are available diagnostic methods. The liver biopsy shows high-grade venous congestion, centrilobular liver cell atrophy, and thrombi within the terminal hepatic venules. Diagnosis can be based on the following:\n\n【33】*   Abrupt onset of ascites (fluid in the abdomen) and painful hepatomegaly (enlarged liver).\n\n【34】*   Massive ascites with preserved liver functions. On examination of the ascitic fluid in chronic patients, they usually have a high protein concentration (greater than two g/dL). The serum ascites-albumin gradient is generally less than 1.1.\n\n【35】*   Sinusoidal dilation in liver biopsy without heart disease.\n\n【36】*   Fulminant hepatic failure is associated with hepatomegaly and ascites.\n\n【37】*   Unexplained chronic liver disease.\n\n【38】*   Liver disease with a blood clotting disorder.\n\n【39】*   WBC (white blood cell) count is usually less than 500 per microlitre.\n\n【40】**Ultrasound -**\n\n【41】In acute cases, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and heterogeneous echotexture are present. There will be peripheral atrophy of the affected regions, regenerative nodules, gallbladder wall thickening, and ascites in chronic cases.\n\n【42】**Color Doppler -**\n\n【43】The following findings are seen in the color Doppler test:\n\n【44】1.  No flow or inappropriately directed flow in the right hepatic vein.\n\n【45】2.  The discontinuity between the central hepatic vein and the inferior vena cava. Reversed flow in hepatic veins.\n\n【46】3.  Intra and extrahepatic collaterals, low or absent flow in the inferior vena cava. The high resistive index within the hepatic artery, tumor thrombus within the inferior vena cava.\n\n【47】**Computed Tomography(CT) Findings -**\n\n【48】1.  The early enhancement of the caudate lobe (only part of the liver that is in contact with the inferior vena cava) and central liver,\n\n【49】2.  Delayed enhancement of the peripheral liver with accompanying low central density (flip-flop appearance),\n\n【50】3.  Nutmeg liver (inhomogeneous mottled liver),\n\n【51】4.  Inability to identify hepatic veins.\n\n【52】**Angiography Findings -**\n\n【53】On hepatic venography, complete occlusion of hepatic vein(s) may be noted, which may or may not be associated with narrowing of the intrahepatic inferior vena cava.\n\n【54】What Are the Treatment Options Available?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【55】The primary goal of the treatment should be to improve hepatic perfusion and preserve the functioning of the hepatic cells.\n\n【56】**Medical Treatment -**\n\n【57】It includes anticoagulant therapy- intravenous Heparin initially and then by Warfarin orally. Other measures to control ascites and gastrointestinal bleeding are taken. This includes reducing the salt intake in the diet, using diuretics such as Spironolactone and Furosemide. In the case of refractory ascites, large-volume paracentesis with albumin infusion is done. Normal serum albumin and bilirubin level indicate an improvement in liver functions. Thus liver function tests help evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. The medical treatment may alleviate the patient’s symptoms temporarily, but the disease progresses.\n\n【58】**Surgical Treatment -**\n\n【59】This includes:\n\n【60】*   Balloon angioplasty.\n\n【61】*   Localized thrombolysis.\n\n【62】*   Variceal treatment.\n\n【63】*   Portal decompression.\n\n【64】*   Percutaneous transhepatic balloon angioplasty (PTBA).\n\n【65】*   Surgical shunts may be placed to divert the blood flow around the obstruction of the liver. The TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts) can be employed. If all the hepatic veins are blocked, the portal veins can be approached by the intrahepatic part of the inferior vena cava. This procedure is called DIPS (direct intrahepatic portocaval shunt).\n\n【66】*   Liver transplantation is generally performed in the case of fulminant liver failure when the shunts fail.\n\n【67】What Are the Complications?\n---------------------------\n\n【68】*   Cirrhosis of the liver.\n\n【69】*   Ascites (fluid build-up in the abdomen).\n\n【70】*   Varicose veins in the esophagus.\n\n【71】*   Graft infection, rejection, arterial or venous thrombosis.\n\n【72】*   Gallbladder, kidney problems.\n\n【73】*   Low liver function can affect digestion.\n\n【74】*   Patients with chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome are at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and should be monitored with serum alpha-fetoprotein.\n\n【75】**Conclusion:**\n\n【76】The survival of the patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome is mainly dependent on the underlying cause. In general, nearly two-thirds of the patients survive for ten years. Some negative prognostic indicators like ascites, encephalopathy, elevated Child-Pugh scores, elevated prothrombin time, etc. indicate the patient's prognosis.\n\n【77】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【78】* * *\n\n【79】#### **1.**删除换行**Can Budd-Chiari Syndrome Be Cured?**\n\n【80】Yes, Budd-Chiari syndrome is curable.

It is frequently employed for the management of bacterial infections, especially those in the gastrointestinal tract. Neomycin works by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial proteins, which prevents the bacteria from growing and spreading. As with other antibiotics in the aminoglycoside family, Neomycin is particularly efficient in eradicating gram-negative organisms, providing excellent coverage for enteric (intestine-related) bacteria. It is often used within the gastrointestinal tract because Neomycin is not well absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\n【2】What Are the Uses of Neomycin?\n------------------------------\n\n【3】The US food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Neomycin for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy or hepatic coma, particularly in acute cases than that for long-term use, due to its side effects. The other uses of this drug include the following:\n\n【4】*   **Perioperative or Surgical Prophylaxis:** This requires combining Neomycin with Erythromycin or Metronidazole a day before surgery to decrease the possibility of surgical site infections.\n\n【5】*   **Skin Infections:** Neomycin is a possible treatment option for bacterial skin infections such as impetigo and cellulitis.\n\n【6】*   **Eye Infections:** Neomycin eye drops or ointment may be used to treat bacterial infections of the eye, such as conjunctivitis.\n\n【7】*   **Ear Infections:** Neomycin may be used to treat bacterial infections of the ear, such as otitis externa.\n\n【8】*   **Prevention of Infections:** Neomycin may be used to prevent infections in people with a high risk of developing them, such as those with weakened immune systems.\n\n【9】*   **Off-Label Usage:** Neomycin is also used to treat constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n【10】What Is Neomycin Toxicity?\n--------------------------\n\n【11】Neomycin toxicity refers to the harmful effects that occur due to Neomycin intake. Although Neomycin is effective in treating bacterial infections, it can cause toxic effects in some individuals. The normal dose includes:\n\n【12】*   The usual adult dose of Neomycin is 1 to 1.5 g (grams) per day, divided into three or four doses.\n\n【13】*   The usual children's dose of Neomycin is 25 to 30 mg/kg (milligrams per kilogram) per day, divided into four doses.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Retinol - A Magical Wand to All Skin Woes?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Sorafenib - Uses, Warnings, Side Effects, Dosage, and More</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Is it advisable to use Neomycin during first month of pregnancy?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【15】Neomycin toxicity can occur at doses as low as 500 mg per day, especially in individuals with preexisting kidney or liver disease. Symptoms of Neomycin toxicity may appear at doses greater than 1 g per day, and severe toxicity may occur at doses greater than 12 g per day.\n\n【16】What Are the Causes of Neomycin Toxicity?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【17】Several factors contribute to Neomycin toxicity which include:\n\n【18】*   **High Doses:** If the drug is taken in high doses, it can accumulate in the body, leading to toxicity. Neomycin is usually prescribed in low doses to minimize the risk of toxicity.\n\n【19】*   **Prolonged Use:** Neomycin is typically prescribed for short periods of time, usually less than two weeks. Prolonged use of the medication increases the chance of toxicity.\n\n【20】*   **Kidney or Liver Disease:** Neomycin is eliminated from the body through the kidneys and liver. Patients with kidney or liver disease may be unable to eliminate the drug efficiently, and it accumulates within the body and develops toxicity.\n\n【21】*   **Drug Interactions:** Neomycin may interact with other medications, leading to an increased risk of toxicity. Taking Neomycin with another medication that is metabolized by the liver or kidneys can increase the risk of toxicity.\n\n【22】What Are the Precautions to Be Taken When Using Neomycin?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Following are some precautions to be taken while using Neomycin:\n\n【24】*   Neomycin should only be used under medical supervision and as prescribed by a healthcare provider.\n\n【25】*   Avoid the use of Neomycin in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to Neomycin or other aminoglycoside antibiotics.\n\n【26】*   Use caution in individuals with kidney problems, hearing loss, or neuromuscular disorders.\n\n【27】*   Long-term use of Neomycin should be avoided as it can increase the risk of toxicity.\n\n【28】*   Monitor for potential side effects such as ringing in the ears, hearing loss, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n【29】*   Neomycin should be used with caution in children and elderly individuals due to the increased risk of adverse effects.\n\n【30】*   Inform the healthcare professional of all medications and supplements being taken as Neomycin can interact with other medications, including certain diuretics, muscle relaxants, and anesthetics.\n\n【31】*   It is advisable to refrain from using this medication while pregnant or nursing, as it has the potential to pass through the placenta and into breast milk.\n\n【32】What Are the Symptoms of Neomycin Toxicity?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Some common symptoms of Neomycin toxicity include:\n\n【34】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【35】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【36】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【37】*   Abdominal pain.\n\n【38】*   Dehydration.\n\n【39】*   Dizziness.\n\n【40】*   Auditory impairment or tinnitus (a ringing sensation in the ears).\n\n【41】*   Balance problems.\n\n【42】*   Headache.\n\n【43】*   Confusion.\n\n【44】*   Muscle weakness or twitching.\n\n【45】*   Kidney damage or failure.\n\n【46】How Can Neomycin Toxicity Be Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【47】The diagnosis of Neomycin toxicity is done with the help of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The following are the steps for diagnosis:\n\n【48】*   **Blood Tests:** Elevated Neomycin levels in the blood can be detected through blood tests. These tests also assess kidney function and electrolyte levels. It is recommended to obtain a baseline serum creatinine or BUN (blood urea nitrogen) to monitor any impact on renal function during chronic therapy and conduct periodic follow-up blood tests. Elderly patients may sometimes have impaired renal function, which routine screening tests such as BUN or serum creatinine may not detect. Therefore, it is more beneficial to determine creatinine clearance.\n\n【49】*   **Urine Tests:** Urine tests can be used to assess kidney function and identify any signs of kidney damage.\n\n【50】*   **Hearing Tests:** Hearing tests may be performed to assess any hearing loss or other auditory problems that may be associated with Neomycin toxicity.\n\n【51】*   **Imaging Tests:** In some cases, imaging tests such as X-rays, CT (computed tomography) scans, or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) may be ordered to assess the extent of any kidney damage or other complications.\n\n【52】What Is the Treatment for Neomycin Toxicity?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【53】Neomycin toxicity can be treated in the following ways:\n\n【54】*   **Stopping Drug Intake:** The first step in managing Neomycin toxicity is to discontinue the medication. This allows the body to eliminate the drug and prevent further damage.\n\n【55】*   **Supportive Care:** Supportive care may be necessary to manage symptoms and prevent complications. This may include rehydration, nutritional support, and electrolyte replacement.\n\n【56】*   **Monitoring for Complications:** Patients with Neomycin toxicity may be at risk of developing complications such as kidney damage or hearing loss. Regular monitoring for these complications may be necessary to prevent further damage and guide appropriate treatment.\n\n【57】*   **Medication Adjustment:** In some cases, medication adjustment may be necessary to manage Neomycin toxicity. This may involve reducing the dose or switching to an alternative medication.\n\n【58】*   **Complications Management:** If complications such as kidney damage or hearing loss develop, appropriate treatment may be necessary. This may involve medication, surgery, or other interventions.\n\n【59】*   **Prevention:** Prevention of Neomycin toxicity involves careful monitoring and appropriate use of the medication. This may include avoiding high doses, limiting the duration of treatment, and monitoring drug interactions.\n\n【60】**Conclusion**\n\n【61】Neomycin toxicity is not very common, but it is necessary to closely monitor for any signs of toxicity when taking this medication, especially in individuals with preexisting health conditions or who are taking other medications that may increase the risk of toxicity. In certain instances, it may be essential to perform periodic checks on kidney function and electrolyte levels to prevent toxicity. If any signs of toxicity occur, inform a healthcare professional as early as possible.\n\n【62】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>*   Neomycin  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560603/\n*   Neomycin toxicity revisited  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/938230/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This bacteria releases toxins in the small intestine, causing the body to secrete an enormous amount of water resulting in rapid loss of water and electrolytes. It is caused by the ingestion of contaminated food and water. It is a highly virulent disease that causes watery diarrhea. If the bacteria are in a small amount in the body, it is killed by acid in the stomach; however, bacteria remain in stool for seven to fourteen days. Therefore, proper maintenance of sanitation and hygiene helps in the prevention of this infection.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Cholera in a Child?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Vibrio cholerae bacteria cause cholera. It is found in contaminated food and water and spreads to the feces of an infected person. The bacteria release a toxin in the small intestines that causes severe diarrhea. The child may get infected by water or eat raw uncooked food contaminated with bacteria.\n\n【4】Following are the various modes of transmission.\n\n【5】*   Food and drink items are sold outside with improper hygiene.\n\n【6】*   Consumption of vegetables grown with the help of human waste.\n\n【7】*   Raw and undercooked seafood from polluted sewage.\n\n【8】*   Water supplies from municipal sources.\n\n【9】*   Unsanitary disposal of stool.\n\n【10】What Are the Clinical Features of Cholera?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The signs and symptoms of cholera begin after six days of the infection. Most commonly, symptoms range from mild to moderate, but sometimes, it gets severe. The most common clinical manifestation is acute diarrhea and vomiting, resulting in severe dehydration. The infected child with mild or without symptoms can spread the infection.\n\n【12】The bacteria is present in feces for ten days, approximately after the infection. The bacteria typically have an incubation period of one to two days. The characteristic symptom of this infection is stool presenting with a fishy odor, also known as cholera gravis. If it is not treated correctly, it can lead to hypovolemic shock. Children who have weak immune systems are at significant risk of severe complications.\n\n【13】Following are the various signs and symptoms found in this infection.\n\n【14】*   There is the presence of severe watery diarrhea known as \"rice-water stools.\"\n\n【15】*   There is the presence of recurrent vomiting.\n\n【16】*   Severe dehydration due to water and electrolyte loss.\n\n【17】*   The heart rate of the child is rapid.\n\n【18】*   The blood pressure of the child is low.\n\n【19】*   The mucous membrane appears to be dry.\n\n【20】*   There is the presence of muscle cramps.\n\n【21】*   There is a loss of skin elasticity.\n\n【22】*   The stool output can reach one liter per hour.\n\n【23】*   There is the presence of abdominal discomfort.\n\n【24】*   There is a presence of low urine output.\n\n【25】*   The child appears to be irritable.\n\n【26】What Are the Treatment Plans for Cholera?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【27】The infection needs immediate care and treatment as it can cause severe dehydration. The primary goal of the treatment is to manage dehydration and treat fluid and electrolyte loss. For mild to moderate symptoms, fluid intake is advised for hydration; however, if there is a severe infection, the child is recommended to get intravenous fluid. In addition, the adjunctive therapy of antibiotics is indicated in children suffering from severe diseases.\n\n【28】Following are the various treatment plans for the treatment of cholera.\n\n【29】*   **Assessment of Loss of Fluid -** It can be assessed by physical examination of skin, mouth, eyes, and pulse rate. According to the world health organization, the degree of volume loss is categorized as mild to severe according to the physical findings. For estimating the volume loss in stools, cholera clots are used. There can be a loss of ten milliliters per kilogram of fluid in each stool or vomiting episode.\n\n【30】*   **Oral Rehydration Solution -** Most infected children can be treated with the help of an oral rehydration solution. The oral rehydration solution is administered as a standard sachet dissolved in one liter of clean water. The recommended dose for children suffering from mild to moderate dehydration is approximately five liters of oral rehydration solution. It helps in replacing fluid and electrolyte loss caused by vomiting and diarrhea.\n\n【31】*   **Intravenous Fluid -** Intravenous fluid is indicated in children suffering from severe volume depletion and hypovolemic shock. There is immediate administration of fluid to restore circulation rapidly. Initially, the fluid volume administered is 100 milliliters per kilogram gram every three hours. The most commonly used intravenous fluid is ringer lactate solution.\n\n【32】*   **Antibiotic Solution -** Antibiotics are used as an adjunct to the hydration treatment of the child. It is indicated in moderate to severe volume depletion. Antibiotic therapy shortens the duration of diarrhea and reduces volume loss by up to fifty percent. The choice of antibiotics depends upon the availability and pattern of the resistance. The commonly used antibiotics are tetracycline, furazolidone, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and sulfaguanidine. The doxycycline is given at a dose of 300 milligrams.\n\n【33】*   **Zinc -** It is a necessary adjunctive therapy for children under the age of five years. It reduces the duration of diarrhea. In addition, it helps in the prevention of fluid loss in children.\n\n【34】How Can Parents Prevent the Spread of Cholera in Their Children?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】Parents can practice a few measures to prevent cholera in their children.\n\n【36】*   Parents should ensure a clean water supply and proper sanitization to prevent cholera.\n\n【37】*   If the child travels with their parents, boiled and chemically disinfected water should be used.\n\n【38】*   The children's hands should be adequately cleaned before eating food.\n\n【39】*   The eating utensils should be washed properly.\n\n【40】*   The fruits and vegetables should be washed properly before eating.\n\n【41】*   The surface of tins or cans containing food and beverages should be adequately cleaned.\n\n【42】**Conclusion**\n\n【43】It is a bacterial infection that causes acute diarrhea. Diarrhea caused by this infection can range from mild to moderate. This infection is severe because it causes water and electrolyte loss. It is a global threat to public health and indicates a lack of social development. If left untreated, it can cause severe consequences. Proper sanitation, disinfection, and safe water can prevent this infection. Oral cholera vaccines can help in controlling cholera outbreaks. In case of extreme conditions, rapid treatment with antibiotics and intravenous fluid is indicated. Parents should take care of the hygiene and environment of the child.\n\n【44】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【45】* * *\n\n【46】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Symptoms of Cholera in Children?**\n\n【47】The symptoms of cholera in children are mild to moderate stomach pain. In severe cases, there is vomiting and diarrhea. The diarrhea is watery. All these signs lead to dehydration in children. Other signs are rapid heart rate, dry mucous membranes, decreased blood pressure, and muscle cramps. Immediate treatment for dehydration is essential as it leads to shock and death.\n\n【48】#### **2.**删除换行**Does Cholera Infection Occur in Infants?**\n\n【49】Cholera infections rarely occur in infants. The infection is rare in children below two years of age. The signs are mild diarrhea. The treatment is rehydration therapy. That is through oral or intravenous route hydration. This is the primary management of cholera.\n\n【50】#### **3.**删除换行**How Do the Stools After a Cholera Infection Appear?**\n\n【51】In the earlier stages of the infection, the stools consist of fecal matter and bile. The distinguishing feature of cholera infection is the passage of rice-water stool. There is watery diarrhea with mucus flecks. The odor of the stools is fishy.\n\n【52】#### **4.**删除换行**Does the Cholera Infection Subside on Its Own?**\n\n【53】The cholera infection subsides on its own in a few days. The symptoms subside in three to six days after onset. But if there is severe diarrhea which causes severe dehydration,  there is a need for medical attention and for intravenous fluid administration.\n\n【54】#### **5.**删除换行**What Is the Diagnosis of Cholera Infection?**\n\n【55】The correct method to confirm the cholera infection is rapid cholera dip tests. The identification of bacteria in a stool sample. These tests help physicians conclude quickly. Quick confirmation and timely management help to decrease the mortality rates. The signs of cholera are similar to other bacterial infections.\n\n【56】#### **6.**删除换行**What Is the Treatment for Cholera Infection?**\n\n【57】Hydration is the primary treatment for cholera through the oral or intravenous route. Along with hydration, treatment with antibiotics is recommended for severely affected patients. Antibiotic treatment is also recommended for patients severely affected by dehydration who continue to pass a large stool volume during rehydration treatment.\n\n【58】#### **7.**删除换行**What Is the Incubation Period of Cholera Infection?**\n\n【59】The cholera infection lasts for about two to five days. Individuals who have mild to moderate cases usually get better within a week. Even individuals with severe cholera cases recover fully in a week or so if medical attention is provided.\n\n【60】#### **8.**删除换行**What Are the Stages of the Cholera Infection?**\n\n【61】The typical case of cholera shows three stages, which are:  \n\\- Stage of evacuation.  \n\\- Stages of collapse:   \n\\-- Stage of collapse   \n\\-- Stage of recovery.\n\n【62】#### **9.**删除换行**Is Cholera Infection Life-Threatening?**\n\n【63】The cholera infection can become life-threatening. In the most adverse cases, excess fluids and electrolytes are rapidly lost, which can lead to death within a short span.

But accidents happen, and sometimes the skin barrier is broken, either because of a cut or scrape or some other type of injury. After an injury, the body's repair mechanisms spring into action. Soldier cells (a specific type of white blood cell) are sent to the area to fight against any infection that may attempt to enter through the opened tissue. Some of these soldier cells die, as do some of the skin cells that were damaged in the injury. All of these dead cells contribute to forming something called an exudate.\n\n【2】Exudate is the fluid produced by a wound as it heals, and it is a normal part of the healing process. However, sometimes infection sets in, changing the appearance of the exudate.\n\n【3】What Is an Exudate?\n-------------------\n\n【4】Exudate is a fluid comprised mainly of protein and cellular elements that oozes out of blood vessels in nearby tissues and gets deposited there. This happens due to inflammation as the permeability of blood vessels changes which allow the bigger molecules and solid matter to pass through their walls.\n\n【5】The word ‘exudate’ is derived from a Latin word, exsudare, meaning - to sweat out. Hence, exudate denotes vessels that seem to weep or sweat.\n\n【6】An exudate possesses a high specific gravity (>1.020). It has a fluid to serum total protein ratio of less than 0.5, and a fluid to serum LDH ratio greater than 0.6. An exudate may also come out from cuts or from sites of infection or inflammation and is also known as pus. In diabetic retinopathy, exudate gets deposited in the retina of the eye.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】Viral Pharyngitis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment\n\n【10】Croup Imaging - Diagnostic Evaluation and Scoring Systems\n\n【11】Long-Term Respiratory Effects of COVID-19\n\n【12】Why Does Exudate From Wounds Occur?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【13】*   Wound exudate occurs in response to aggression; it comprises various substances that are essential for healing.\n\n【14】*   Water and electrolytes like sodium, are the main components of an exudate. In the exudate that comes out from wounds, immune system cells like leukocytes, proteolytic enzymes, and inflammatory mediators are also present.\n\n【15】*   These mediators further stimulate the migration of other cells of the immune system to the infected or affected area. The exudate also contains growth factors that cause stimulation of cell proliferation and help in the healing of the wound.\n\n【16】*   However, wounds’ exudate can portray other effects also. In chronic wounds, the exudate carries more inflammatory mediators and proteolytic enzymes.\n\n【17】What Is the Difference Between Exudates and Transudates?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】*   Exudates are made up of fluids, cells, or other cellular substances that slowly seep from blood vessels, particularly from inflamed tissues. Transudates have a more fluid component. They also flow through a membrane or ooze through tissue into the extracellular tissue spaces. They are comparatively thin and watery, carry few cells or proteins, and occur due to the alteration in hydrostatic or colloid osmotic pressure, and not by inflammation.\n\n【19】*   In comparison, a transudate is a fluid that permeates a membrane that filters out most of the protein and cellular elements and leaves a watery solution behind. The transudation process occurs due to increased pressure in the veins and capillaries. This pressure forces fluid through the vessel walls and leads to low levels of serum proteins. So the transudate is actually a filtrate of blood.\n\n【20】What Are the Types of Exudates?\n-------------------------------\n\n【21】Wound drainage is of four types namely serous, sanguineous, serosanguinous, and purulent. The serous drainage production is a usual response of the body during the normal healing stage of inflammation.\n\n【22】Types of exudates are:\n\n【23】1.  **Fibrinous Exudate -** Cloudy and thin with strands of fibrin.\n\n【24】2.  **Serous Exudate -** A clear, amber, thin, and watery plasma. It is normal during the inflammatory stage of wound healing, and smaller amounts are considered normal.\n\n【25】3.  **Sanguineous Exudate -** Occurs as fresh bleeding in deep partial or full-thickness wounds. It is also produced normally in small amounts during the inflammatory stage.\n\n【26】4.  **Serosanguineous Exudate -** It is thin and watery in consistency and pale red to pink in color.\n\n【27】5.  **Seropurulent Exudate -** It is thin and watery in consistency, has a cloudy appearance, and is yellow to tan in color.\n\n【28】6.  **Purulent Exudate -** It is a thick and opaque exudate that is tan, yellow, green, or brown in color. It is not normally seen in a wound bed and is usually associated with infection or high amounts of bacteria.\n\n【29】7.  **Haemopurulent Exudate -** It is reddish, viscous, and milky.\n\n【30】**Which Factors Determine the Amount of Exudate?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】*   The exudate quantity is also influenced by the evaluation. When the wound is in the healing process, the amount of exudate usually gets reduced. However, if it does not heal properly, the amount of exudate may remain the same.\n\n【32】*   So, an excessive amount of exudate causes the inflammatory process to be maintained. Moreover, humid conditions also hamper the healing.\n\n【33】*   However, there are some more factors that influence the exudate quantity, like the wound extent. The larger the affected or infected area, the more drainage occurs. Exudate amounts also depend on the type of wound. Burns, venous ulcers, and inflammatory ulcers cause abundant oozing of exudates.\n\n【34】*   Similarly, in cases of peripheral edema or infection, commonly a profuse exudate is seen. In leg wound cases, if the leg is kept at a low level, the fluid is drained out by gravity.\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】What we must remember is that exudating wounds are normal. Exudate refers to the draining of liquid from open wounds in the human body; it occurs in response to injury or infection to encourage the healing and healing process. However, if it is a chronic wound, the exudate can interfere negatively. In addition, we must bear in mind that the characteristics of the exudate, such as color or viscosity, are decisive. They can help in diagnosis.\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>*   Exudate  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/exudate\n*   Wound exudate--the good, the bad, and the ugly  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22647956/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

There is, however, a distinction between normal memory changes and memory loss associated with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. In addition, some memory problems are caused by treatable conditions.\n\n【2】The brain can generate new brain cells at any age; therefore, severe memory loss is not an inevitable result of aging. Lifestyle, habits, and daily activities all have a significant impact on the brain's health. Whatever the age, numerous ways exist to improve cognitive abilities, prevent memory loss, and safeguard grey matter. Furthermore, normal aging has little effect on many mental abilities, such as:\n\n【3】*   The ability to do what one has always done and continue to do frequently.\n\n【4】*   The wisdom and knowledge one has gained through life experience.\n\n【5】*   The natural common sense and ability to construct reasonable arguments and judgments.\n\n【6】**When Can Memory Issues Be Considered Normal With Aging?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】For most people, short-term memory lapses are a normal part of aging, not a sign of serious mental deterioration or the incidence of Alzheimer's or other dementia. However, memory problems of the following types are common in older adults and are not considered warning signs of dementia:\n\n【8】*   Occasionally forget where they left items they regularly use, such as glasses or keys.\n\n【9】*   Forgetting names of acquaintances or confusing one memory with another, such as calling a grandson by his father's name.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Dietary Supplements to Combat Chronic Fatigue</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Geriatric Rehabilitation - An Overview</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Maintenance of Strong Memory Power in Old Age</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Occasionally forget an appointment or enter a room and forget why they are there.\n\n【11】*   Being easily distracted or needing help remembering what they just read or the specifics of a conversation.\n\n【12】*   Not being able to recall information that is \"on the tip of the tongue.\"\n    </u>\n\n【13】Simple forgetfulness (the \"missing keys\") and a delay or slowing in recalling dates, names, and events are normal parts of the aging process. Memory processes include recalling information, learning new information, and recognizing familiar information. Each of these processes can be disrupted, resulting in forgetfulness. There are also various types of memory, each of which is affected differently by normal aging, as illustrated below.\n\n【14】*   **Preserved Memory Functions:**\n\n【15】    *   Remote memory (ability to recollect events from years ago).\n\n【16】    *   Procedural memory (performing tasks).\n\n【17】    *   Semantic recall (general knowledge).\n\n【18】*   **Declining Memory Functions:**\n\n【19】    *   Learning new information.\n\n【20】    *   Remembering new information (it takes longer to learn and remember something new).\n\n【21】There are three possible causes of age-related memory loss:\n\n【22】*   The hippocampus, involved in memory formation and retrieval, frequently deteriorates with age.\n\n【23】*   Proteins and hormones that protect and repair brain cells, and those that stimulate neural growth, decline with age.\n\n【24】*   Reduced blood flow to the brain is common in the elderly, which can impair memory and lead to changes in cognitive skills.\n\n【25】**What Are the Memory Issues Not Considered Normal Aging?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Normal aging does not include memory problems that begin to interfere with normal daily life and activities. For example, forgetting where one puts their glasses is a common symptom of forgetfulness, disorganization, or aging; however, forgetting what the glasses are for or that they are worn on the face is not a normal memory problem.\n\n【27】Memory loss and thinking difficulties seen in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia are not symptoms of normal aging. Recent studies say mild cognitive impairment is a step toward dementia for some people and a stage between normal aging and early-stage dementia. Not everyone who has mild cognitive impairment may develop dementia. The following list highlights some abnormal memory changes in MCI and dementia.\n\n【28】**Memory Issues in People With Mild Cognitive Impairment:** Some older adults have a mild cognitive impairment, which means they have more memory or other thinking problems than others their age. Signs of MCI include:\n\n【29】*   Forgets recent events, repeats the same stories and questions, occasionally forgets the names of close friends and family members, forgets conversations, often forgets appointments or planned events, and misplaces items.\n*   Has difficulty coming up with the appropriate words. Has difficulty comprehending written or spoken information.\n*   Focus is often lost, the individual is prone to be distracted. It is necessary to write reminders to do things to avoid forgetting.\n*   Although they may struggle, they can complete complex tasks such as taking medications, paying bills, shopping, cooking, cleaning the house, and driving.\n*   Has many significant memory impairments but is still able to function independently.\n\n【30】**Memory Issues in Dementia Patients:**\n\n【31】*   Dementia does not constitute a normal part of the aging process. Instead, it refers to the loss of cognitive functioning like thinking, remembering, learning, and reasoning, in addition to behavioral abilities that interfere with a person's quality of life and activities. It has many of the same symptoms as MCI, along with the following as dementia progresses:\n*   Is incapable of carrying out complex daily tasks (for example, taking medications, paying bills, shopping, driving).\n*   Insight or awareness of memory loss is lost.\n*   Shows poor judgment.\n*   Reduced rational thinking and problem-solving ability.\n*   Memory, language, and cognition deteriorate to the point where self-care tasks cannot be completed without the assistance of another person.\n\n【32】Can Memory Be Preserved as People Age?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【33】The best way to maintain brain health is to exercise (especially aerobics) twice a week, according to the American Academy of Neurology's practice guideline for patients with mild cognitive impairment.\n\n【34】Although there is no clear-cut proven report that doing any of the following will help slow the decline of memory and thinking skills, these are general recommendations for maintaining good health.\n\n【35】*   Maintain normal blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels.\n\n【36】*   Stop smoking and limit alcohol consumption.\n\n【37】*   A healthy diet rich in antioxidants and olive oil reduces the risk of dementia. Dash or Mediterranean diets can be considered.\n\n【38】*   Maintain a healthy weight.\n\n【39】*   Stay positive, happy, and grateful.\n\n【40】*   Reduce stress.\n\n【41】*   Make sure to get enough sleep.\n\n【42】*   Exercise (include aerobic exercises, stretching exercises, strength training, and balance training).\n\n【43】*   Train the brain (do quizzes, puzzles, card games, learn a new language or play a new instrument, read, take a class, learn a new skill or hobby).\n\n【44】*   Maintain a social life (share hobbies with like-minded people, join clubs, volunteer).\n\n【45】Is Memory Loss Treatable?\n-------------------------\n\n【46】Treatment for memory loss is determined by the nature of the condition and its underlying cause. For example, if memory loss is caused by a mental health condition, such as depression, better management may aid recovery. Simple lifestyle changes for patients in the early stages of dementia may help prevent the disease's progression. New research suggests that one-third of dementia cases could be avoided by changing one's lifestyle. There are also medications available to help treat and slow its progression.\n\n【47】**Conclusion**\n\n【48】Subtle changes in memory occur as a natural part of the aging process. However, when memory loss hinders us from performing daily tasks and our usual roles in life, it becomes a health concern that requires further evaluation by healthcare professionals. A doctor must be consulted if a family member, or a friend has difficulty in remembering recent events or thinking clearly.\n\n【49】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【50】无关删除-1:<u>*   Age-Related Memory Loss  \n    https://www.helpguide.org/articles/alzheimers-dementia-aging/age-related-memory-loss.htm\n*   Memory, Forgetfulness, and Aging: What's Normal and What's Not?  \n    https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/memory-forgetfulness-and-aging-whats-normal-and-whats-not\n*   Do Memory Problems Always Mean Alzheimer's Disease?  \n    https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/do-memory-problems-always-mean-alzheimers-disease</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Traction is derived from \"tractico,\" a Latin word that means to pull or draw. The lumbar vertebral column is applied with a stretching force on the individual segments of the spine to achieve pain relief in conditions like disc protrusion, back pain, and leg pain. Weights are used for applying traction force, and they can weigh about 26 percent of the total body weight of the individual.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Lumbar Traction?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【3】1.  **Continuous Traction:** It is also known as bed traction. It is done using low weights for several hours at one time. This type of traction is slightly ineffective in separating the spinal structures that are to be treated. Patients cannot withstand huge weights, which can cause separation of the vertebrae for an extended time.\n\n【4】2.  **Manual Traction:** Manual traction is done by the therapist. The hands of the therapist pull the belt, that in turn pulls the legs of the patient. Traction force is applied only for a few seconds. It can also be done in sudden, quick thrusting motions.\n\n【5】3.  **Intermittent Mechanical Traction:** This technique is somewhat resembling sustained traction in the duration and intensity of application. This technique has a mechanical unit that can apply force and release the traction force alternatively that are at preset intervals.\n\n【6】4.  **Sustained Traction:** It is also called static traction. This type is done in shorter periods that range from a few minutes up to one hour. Since it is used for little time, heavier weights can be used that are applied steadily on the spinal columns.\n\n【7】5.  **Autotraction:** It consists of a table that is specifically designed and divided into two sections. These two sections can be rotated and tilted individually. The traction force is given by the patient by asking them to pull with the arms and push with the feet.\n\n【8】6.  **Positional Traction:** This type of traction is applied longitudinally to pull the spinal structures. The patient is placed in various positions using blocks, pillows, and sandbags to apply the traction. Lateral bending is incorporated in this and affects the spinal segment on one side only.\n\n【9】7.  **Gravity Lumbar Traction:** This type uses a chest harness to provide a traction force. The chest harness is used to hold the patient securely, and the treatment table is tilted to a vertical position. This will enable the patient to use the lower body weight to induce traction.\n\n【10】What Are the Effects of Lumbar Traction?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【11】Traction, when performed correctly, can cause the following effects:\n\n【12】1.  Separation or destruction of the vertebral bodies.\n\n【13】2.  Spinal curves straightening.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Spinal Anesthesia for Emergency Abdominal Surgery</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Is surgery the only option to release nerve trapped between discs?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I have pain in the left lower back that spreads down the back of the left leg and knee.

Lumbar auto traction is the preferred method to obtain immediate pain relief.\n\n【20】*   **Joint Hypomobility:** Traction is considered a form of mobilization because it involves the passive movement of joints by manual or mechanical means. Joint stiffness and hypomobility can be effectively treated through traction.\n\n【21】*   **Degenerative Joint Disease:** It is related to joint hypomobility. Patients affected with degenerative disc disease have a reduced range of motion. Traction can help restore the movement of the affected segments and also help interrupt the degenerative process.\n\n【22】*   **Lumbar Disc Herniation:** Lumbar disc herniation refers to the bulging, protruding, or rupturing of the disc in the lumbar spine. They can cause sciatica, low back pain, and leg pain. Lumbar disc herniation can be treated conservatively through lumbar traction in six weeks. Autotraction and manual traction can be used for pain relief and improvement in function. Mechanical lumbar traction is incorporated along with extension exercises for functional improvement. The size of the hernia can be decreased by combining physical therapy and lumbar traction.\n\n【23】*   **Low Back Pain:** Traction, along with other modalities, can provide a little amount of pain relief.\n\n【24】*   **Muscle Guarding and Spasm:** Intermittent traction is done to treat muscle guarding and muscle spasms.\n\n【25】*   **Joint Pain:** Mobilization and traction done within the normal range of movements can be effective in treating joint pain.\n\n【26】*   **Discogenic Pain:** Traction can help relieve spinal pain that is discogenic in nature. If traction produces slight modification or restoration in the anatomy, it can produce favorable effects.\n\n【27】*   **Compression Fractures:** After the healing of the fracture, some amount of pain is persistent in the affected individuals. Traction is not considered a routine treatment choice. However, it can be used for effective pain relief in certain cases.\n\n【28】Who Can Benefit From Lumbar Traction?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【29】Patients can benefit from lumbar traction if they have the following conditions:\n\n【30】*   Degenerative disc disease (a degenerative condition causing neck and back pain due to wear and tear of spinal discs).\n\n【31】*   Disc herniation (bulging of the spinal disc that can cause neck, leg, and back pain).\n\n【32】*   Slipped discs.\n\n【33】*   Facet disease (a condition in which facet joints that are present in between the vertebrae are affected).\n\n【34】*   Bone spurs (bony prominences present on the ends of bones).\n\n【35】*   Pinched nerves may occur due to excess pressure on a nerve by the adjacent tissues.\n\n【36】*   Foraminal stenosis (caused due to narrowing of the cervical disc space occurring due to joint enlargement).\n\n【37】*   Sciatica.\n\n【38】What Are the Clinical Benefits of Lumbar Traction?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】*   It has been effective in treating radicular low back pain.\n\n【40】*   Adhesions are also corrected through traction.\n\n【41】*   The nerve root or disc pressure has been significantly reduced after lumbar traction.\n\n【42】*   It can help correct joint hypomobility.\n\n【43】*   Traction has helped to relieve contractures in connective tissues.\n\n【44】*   Muscle spasms can be corrected through traction.\n\n【45】What Are the Contraindications?\n-------------------------------\n\n【46】Patients suffering from the following conditions should be refrained from undergoing lumbar traction:\n\n【47】*   Spinal malignancy.\n\n【48】*   Spinal infection.\n\n【49】*   Osteoporosis.\n\n【50】*   Cord compression.\n\n【51】*   Uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n【52】*   Hiatal hernia.\n\n【53】*   Acute lumbago.\n\n【54】*   Pregnancy.\n\n【55】*   Cardiovascular disease.\n\n【56】*   Abdominal hernia.\n\n【57】*   Severe respiratory disease.\n\n【58】*   Rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【59】*   Severe hemorrhoids.\n\n【60】**Conclusion:**\n\n【61】Lumbar traction can be effectively used for treating several musculoskeletal disorders. Traction has been clinically effective in treating various pain disorders. Static traction has been essential to fatigue the muscles and allow the traction force to act on the joints and help relieve pain. Static traction has helped treat disc protrusions, and intermittent traction to treat degenerative joint disease and joint hypomobility.\n\n【62】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>*   Herniated Disk in the Lower Back  \n    https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/herniated-disk-in-the-lower-back/\n*   Lumbar Traction: A Review of the Literature  \n    https://www.jospt.org/doi/pdf/10.2519/jospt.1994.20.5.262\n*   The Effects of Stretching with Lumbar Traction on VAS and Oswestry Scales of Patients with Lumbar 4–5 Herniated Intervertebral Disc  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4135195/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is characterized by congenitally small and malformed kidneys with reduced renal mass and nephron number with the presence of dysplastic features. It belongs to a group of renal diseases that are perinatally lethal. Renal hypodysplasia was initially thought to be secondary to scarring that is associated with reflux or reflux nephropathy, but now it is considered as primary dysplasia that is associated with reflux.\n\n【2】What Is the Difference Between Agenesis, Aplasia, Hypodysplasia, Hypoplasia, and Dysplasia?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】*   **Agenesis**: It refers to developmental failure in which the organ fails to develop during embryonic growth and development because of the absence of primordial tissue. It indicates the complete absence of an organ.\n\n【4】*   **Aplasia**: It indicates that the organ, tissue, or body part did not develop normally, and it is malformed.\n\n【5】*   **Hypodysplasia**: It is also called aplasia. It is used to describe kidneys that are abnormally small and malformed.\n\n【6】*   **Hypoplasia**: It refers to the developmental arrest in which an organ or a part of it remains below the normal size or it is immature.\n\n【7】*   **Dysplasia**: It refers to the presence of abnormal cells within a tissue. It indicates abnormal growth or development of a tissue or organ. It usually precedes the development of cancer.\n\n【8】What Is Renal Hypodysplasia?\n----------------------------\n\n【9】Renal hypodysplasia or aplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by the presence of abnormally small and malformed kidneys. It belongs to a group of perinatally lethal renal disorders such as bilateral renal aplasia, unilateral renal agenesis with contralateral dysplasia, and severe obstructive uropathy. A renal aplasia is a severe form of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, which usually causes death in utero or during the perinatal period. Bilateral renal agenesis is a fatal condition, and death occurs in utero or in the perinatal period. However, unilateral agenesis is compatible with life with mild manifestations like vesicoureteral reflux.\n\n【10】What Causes Renal Hypodysplasia?\n--------------------------------\n\n【11】Renal hypodysplasia or aplasia is caused by mutations in the FGF20 gene on chromosome 8p22. It has been documented that bilateral renal agenesis or aplasia coexists with unilateral renal aplasia, renal dysplasia, and renal aplasia with renal dysplasia exists in families.\n\n【12】Exposure to the following environmental factors in the fetal and neonatal period contributes to renal hypodysplasia:\n\n【13】*   Maternal vitamin A deficiency.\n\n【14】*   Intrauterine growth restriction.\n\n【15】*   Maternal low folic acid intake.\n\n【16】*   Maternal hyperglycemia and diabetes.\n\n【17】*   Maternal use of cocaine and excessive alcohol consumption.\n\n【18】*   Maternal intake of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.\n\n【19】How Does Renal Hypodysplasia Occur?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【20】The direct precursor of the mature kidney is the human metanephros. The human metanephros begins to form in the fifth week of gestation. During the fifth week of gestation, the ureteric bud branches from the mesonephric duct, and the renal mesenchyme condenses around the developing bud to form nephrons, while the bud forms the ureter and collecting ducts. Abnormalities in these events result in a spectrum of disorders which is known as congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT).\n\n【21】Approximately 40 percent of children with chronic renal insufficiency or end-stage or end-stage renal failure have congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract. Some of these renal malformations are associated with obstruction in the lower tract, which is caused by posterior urethral valve disease that is common in males. Renal dysplasia and hypoplasia are two common variants of CAKUT.\n\n【22】What Are the Clinical Features of Renal Hypodysplasia?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The clinical features and symptoms related to renal hypodysplasia include the following:\n\n【24】*   Unilateral or bilateral renal agenesis (complete absence of one or both the kidneys).\n\n【25】*   Renal dysplasia (a kidney that is not developed fully in the womb).\n\n【26】*   Duplicated ureter (two ureters areformed on the same kidney).\n\n【27】*   Ureteral agenesis (congenital absence of the urethra).\n\n【28】*   Hydronephrosis (swelling of the kidney due to the build up of urine).\n\n【29】*   Vesicoureteral reflux (urine flows backward to the kidneys).\n\n【30】*   Ectopic kidneys (kidney’s are located in an abnormal position in the urinary tract).\n\n【31】*   Horseshoe kidney (two kidneys are fused together).\n\n【32】*   Pulmonary hypoplasia (incomplete development of the lung tissue).\n\n【33】The presence of bilateral renal agenesis in the developing fetus results in oligohydraminos, and the affected babies have a characteristic facial phenotype at birth. This is called potter facies. Potter facies is seen in newborns with bilateral renal agenesis or other renal abnormalities like renal aplasia, hypoplasia, dysplasia, or multicystic kidney disease. This typical facial phenotype is characterized by the presence of wide-set eyes, a receding chin, a flattened nose, and large, low-set ears that are deficient in cartilage. This characteristic facies occurs due to the decrease in the volume of amniotic fluid and consequent restriction in fetal movement.\n\n【34】Neonates with renal hypodysplasia may present with pneumothorax, feeding difficulties, urinary sodium loss, metabolic acidosis, and impaired renal function. During the first year of life, the infants experience persistent anorexia with vomiting and poor growth. After the first year, patients experience poor growth, proteinuria, polyuria, polydipsia, and renal failure.\n\n【35】What Are the Pathological Features of Renal Hypodysplasia?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】The patients with renal hypodysplasia show features of both renal hypoplasia and dysplasia. It includes the following features on histopathological examination:\n\n【37】*   The presence of dysplastic elements in the renal parenchyma, such as primitive tubules surrounded by undifferentiated stroma, smooth muscle, and metaplastic cartilage with cystic tubule dilations. Dysplasia can affect a segment of the kidney or the entire kidney.\n\n【38】*   The presence of smaller kidneys that weighs less than 50 percent of the normal weight.\n\n【39】*   A decrease in the number of nephrons. The total number of nephrons is reduced by 20 to 25 percent.\n\n【40】*   The glomeruli in the kidneys are hypertrophic, and they are twice the normal size of the glomeruli.\n\n【41】*   The affected tubules are hypertrophic. They are larger and longer than normal tubules.\n\n【42】*   Electron microscopy reveals the presence of irregular thickening and fusion of epithelial cell foot processes. Thickening of Bowman’s capsule and abnormalities of the glomerular basement membrane is also seen.\n\n【43】How Is Renal Hypodysplasia Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【44】The diagnosis of renal hypodysplasia is based on ultrasound examination during pregnancy and genetic testing for patients with a familial history of renal hypodysplasia.\n\n【45】*   **Ultrasound Imaging**: It is performed during or after the third month of gestation helps in the diagnosis of renal hypodysplasia. It is diagnosed by using fetal renal measurements. Postnatally, patients with a unilateral abnormality and normal contralateral kidney have normal kidney function. Patients with bilateral renal impairment do not survive or may present with end-stage renal disease.\n\n【46】How Is Renal Hypodysplasia Treated?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【47】*   Individuals with unilateral hypodysplasia are monitored with follow-up ultrasounds to determine the growth of the normal contralateral kidney that exhibits compensatory hypertrophy.\n\n【48】*   Individuals with bilateral renal hypodysplasia require supportive therapy to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and growth promotion.\n\n【49】*   The drugs like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are given to slow the progression to end-stage kidney disease.\n\n【50】*   For individuals, who have progressed to end-stage renal disease, renal transplantation is recommended. There is no specific treatment protocol for renal hypodysplasia. It is mainly aimed at supportive management with growth promotion.\n\n【51】**Conclusion**\n\n【52】Renal hypodysplasia is a rare autosomal dominant disorder. It can be detected by antenatal ultrasound screening after the third month of gestation. Patients with a unilateral abnormality and normal contralateral kidney have normal kidney function. Patients with bilateral renal impairment do not survive or may present with end-stage renal disease. The main aim of treatment is to offer supportive therapy and to aid in growth promotion. Renal transplantation is recommended for patients who have progressed to end-stage renal disease.\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH - Renal hypodysplasia/aplasia 3  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/1626497\n*   JASN - Renal Hypodysplasia and the Problem with Faulty Parts  \n    https://journals.lww.com/jasn/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2008&issue=05000&article=00002&type=Fulltext\n*   Renal Agenesis/Hypoplasia  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/surveillancemanual/quick-reference-handbook/renal-agenesis-hypoplasia.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This ground-breaking operation aims to increase the G-spot's sensitivity and size, potentially improving sexual experiences. G-Spot amplification presents a non-surgical, minimally invasive procedure aimed at empowering individuals by offering individuals the chance to explore heightened levels of intimacy and pleasure. Practitioners attempt to increase the prominence of the G-spot by injecting specialized chemicals into the anterior vaginal wall, resulting in heightened sensations and improved orgasms. This article explores the field of G-Spot amplification, illuminating its history, approach, prospective advantages, and critical factors. It thoroughly reviews this contentious yet fascinating technique that considers the available scientific data.\n\n【2】What Is G-Spot?\n---------------\n\n【3】An erogenous zone in the vagina known as the 'G-spot' is thought to be highly sensitive and capable of generating intense sexual pleasure when stimulated. Often characterized as a small, bean-shaped area located approximately two to three inches (5 to 7.5 centimeters) deep within the front wall of the vagina, the G-spot is commonly described. Some people think that activating this region might produce potent orgasms and more sexual gratification.\n\n【4】It is crucial to remember that some experts in science and medicine continue to disagree about the presence and precise characteristics of the G-spot. According to some studies, the G-spot may not be a discrete physical structure but a sensitive region within the larger pelvic floor muscle and nerve network.\n\n【5】What Is G-Spot Amplification?\n-----------------------------\n\n【6】A cosmetic treatment called G-spot amplification, often referred to as G-spot augmentation or G-spot enhancement, tries to increase the sensitivity and size of the G-spot in some people. A substance, such as hyaluronic acid, collagen, or fat, is injected into the G-spot region during G-spot amplification in order to expand its size and possibly improve sexual pleasure. G-Spot amplification surgery, commonly performed by healthcare professionals like gynecologists or plastic surgeons, can be conducted using local or general anesthesia.\n\n【7】G-spot amplification aims to improve the G-spot's visibility and ease of stimulation during sexual activity, which may result in more intense orgasms or more sexual satisfaction. The existence and sensitivity of the G-spot can differ from person to person, and its precise nature and function are still up for debate among specialists in the field. Before deciding on any cosmetic operation, including G-spot amplification, it is essential to have a full consultation with a licensed healthcare professional. They can provide additional information on the procedure's potential risks, benefits, and limitations, assisting in assessing its suitability based on an individual's specific needs and objectives.\n\n【8】What Are the Techniques Used in G-Spot Amplification?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】G-Spot amplification is a controversial procedure, and medical authorities have not thoroughly investigated or endorsed its efficacy or safety. However, certain practitioners in this field have put forth and used some strategies.\n\n【10】*   **Hyaluronic Acid Injections:** By injecting hyaluronic acid, a naturally occurring chemical in the body, into the G-Spot region, the aim is to increase the size and sensitivity of the G-Spot.\n\n【11】*   **Fat Transfer:** During this procedure, adipose cells are harvested from areas like the thighs or abdomen and injected into the G-Spot region. The purpose of fat transfer is to enhance the size and sensitivity of the G-Spot.\n\n【12】*   **Dermal Fillers:** Similar to hyaluronic acid injections, dermal fillers can be employed to enhance the G-Spot.\n\n【13】What Are the Advantages of G-Spot Amplification?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Although there are conflicting views on the efficacy and advantages of this technique, supporters tout the following advantages:\n\n【15】*   Increased sexual pleasure is one of the critical advantages of G-spot amplification that is asserted. Advocates contend that by increasing and activating the G-spot, women may feel more intense orgasms and enjoy heightened sensations during sexual engagement.\n\n【16】*   G-spot amplification tries to improve sexual function by possibly enhancing vaginal lubrication, tightening up the vagina, and promoting climax. Some women claim that by enlarging the G-spot region, they can attain orgasms more easily and with better sexual satisfaction.\n\n【17】*   For some people, G-spot amplification can have a profoundly positive effect on their minds. It may improve self-esteem, body confidence, and general sexual well-being.\n\n【18】*   G-spot amplification is typically seen as a minimally invasive technique that can be completed in a short duration of time. It frequently requires local anesthesia, can be completed in an outpatient setting, and requires little recovery time.\n\n【19】What Are the Potential Risks of G-Spot Amplification?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The following are some possible hazards connected to G-spot amplification:\n\n【21】*   **Infection:** There is a danger of infection with any invasive surgery. There is a chance of introducing bacteria into the body during the procedure if suitable sterile techniques are not used, which could result in infection.\n\n【22】*   **Pain and Discomfort:** G-spot amplification involves injecting chemicals into the G-spot region, which causes pain and discomfort. This may result in discomfort, edema, and pain.\n\n【23】*   **Allergic Reactions:** Certain individuals may exhibit allergies or sensitivities to the substances utilized in G-Spot amplification, including hyaluronic acid fillers or autologous fat transfer.\n\n【24】*   **Damage to Nearby Structures:** The structures, like the urethra, bladder, or rectum, could hurt unintentionally during the procedure.\n\n【25】*   **Sensation Changes:** G-Spot amplification aims to enhance sensitivity, although it may alter one's natural sensations. The operation might not have the desired impact or cause a decreased sensation.\n\n【26】*   **Psychological Effect:** Some people could have irrational expectations of how G-spot amplification will occur. If the procedure falls within these expectations, it may cause disappointment.\n\n【27】What Are the Safety and Efficacy Regarding G-Spot Amplification Techniques?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】There needs to be more scientific evidence regarding the security and effectiveness of G-spot amplification methods. There are several methods for G-spot amplification. However, there currently needs to be more large-scale, carefully planned clinical trials to give firm proof of the safety and efficacy of these methods.\n\n【29】**Conclusion:**\n\n【30】In conclusion, G-Spot amplification is a viable option for those seeking increased sexual gratification. This cosmetic operation aims to find and increase the sensitivity of the G-spot using various methods and procedures, which could result in more powerful orgasms and a more intense sexual experience. Although G-Spot amplification has received favorable and negative reviews, it is vital to acknowledge the uniqueness of sexual enjoyment and the range of requirements and preferences among people. When conducted by trained medical specialists and with informed consent, this technique provides an option for individuals seeking to explore and enhance their sexual experiences.\n\n【31】It's crucial to remember that G-Spot Amplification is not a fix-all or a promise that everyone will experience more pleasure. Each person's anatomy and preferences significantly influence the success of the process. More research and studies are required to completely comprehend the long-term consequences and potential hazards connected with this cosmetic technique.\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>*   Female genital surgery, G-spot amplification techniques--state of the science  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24938616/\n*   G-spot: Fact or Fiction?: A Systematic Review  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8498956/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "d197e57c-7ca5-4584-8ac1-97abd0904cbc", "title": "Cherubism: A Congenital Disorder of the Oral Cavity", "text": "【0】Cherubism: A Congenital Disorder of the Oral Cavity\nWhat Is Cherubism?\n------------------\n\n【1】Cherubism is an autoinflammatory condition affecting the bones, especially the jaw and the orofacial cavity, with childhood onset. This disease is primarily characterized by bilateral and symmetric fibro-osseous proliferative lesions and is only limited to the mandible and maxilla of the face. Cherubism was initially described as a \"familial multilocular cystic disease of the jaw bone\" by Jones in 1933.\n\n【2】What Is the Phenotype of Cherubism?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】The phenotype of this disease may range from no clinical manifestations to severe mandibular or maxillary overgrowth that interferes with respiration, speech, and even vision. The affected patient also suffers from dysphagia or difficulty in swallowing. In most affected individuals, either the teeth are displaced or may even remain unerupted, malformed, or absent, which is a very common finding. According to case reports, some individuals’ teeth also appear to float in cystlike spaces or may suffer from severe malocclusion or an incorrect bite. Additional dental clinical features of this pathology are premature exfoliation of the primary or deciduous teeth alongside root resorption.\n\n【4】Although the course and duration of the active disease may vary in the affected individuals, the degree of bone destruction depends on the extent of the lesions. The disease onset is, as per research, in early childhood, wherein typically new lesions manifest till puberty. Regression of these lesions is possible when these lesions become filled with bone and they remodel the jaw portion, especially during the second or third decade of life. By the age of 30, though facial abnormalities associated with cherubism are not usually detectable, the childhood condition leaves behind a clinically observable residual deformity of the jaw.\n\n【5】What Are the Inheritance Pattern and Genetic Aspects of Cherubism?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Dental and medical literature implicate that cherubism is, in fact, an isolated condition with benign nature. Also, the affected person does not suffer from any lack of intellectual skills and can be found to have absolutely no other physical deformities in other body parts. Cherubism is hypothesized to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of cherubism cases caused by pathogenic variants is elusive owing to the variability of the disease pattern and genetic pertinence. Each child of an individual who suffers from cherubism may have a 50 % chance of inheriting this pathogenic variant, pertaining to the nature of inheritance. Prenatal diagnosis is essential during pregnancy when there is a family history or known parent with cherubism, and prenatal genetic testing would be advised to detect possible pathogenic variants. When the pathogenic variant can be identified in a family member, then molecular testing can be further ordered to study the genetic or transmission patterns through mildly affected relatives or parents. Prenatal diagnosis of cherubism may hence benefit early intervention and diagnosis. The same can be achieved through clinical and radiographic evaluations to identify the individuals affected by cherubism or those associated with risk factors.\n\n【7】How Does Cherubism Progress?\n----------------------------\n\n【8】The onset of the condition occurs mainly, in most cases, between the ages of two and seven years when a bilateral symmetric enlargement is observed in the mandible (lower jaw) or the maxilla (upper jaw) involving the coronoid region as well but without the involvement of the mandibular condyles. The other craniofacial structures and cranial bones usually remain unaffected. During the initial onset of cherubism, the swelling of both submandibular and cervical lymph nodes would be observed. These lesions show a slow progression that speeds up and enlarges by adolescence. Spontaneous regression typically takes place only after puberty and extends well into the late second decade or the early years of the third decade. Patients may also report, in severe cases of cherubism, upturned or tilted eyeballs, missing second and third molars (congenital cases), premature exfoliation of the milk teeth, displacement of permanent teeth because of secondary or enlarged jaw lesions, severe malocclusion causing oral discomfort, etc.\n\n【9】What Are the Diagnostic Studies Done for Cherubism?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】**1\\. Radiographic Imaging Studies**\n\n【11】Radiographic examinations typically show a bilateral multilocular radiolucency of the affected area within the maxillary or mandibular regions. The coronoid processes may be commonly involved, whereas the condyles are rarely affected. There may be bony expansile remodeling and thinning of the bone cortex with a characteristic coarse trabecular pattern, all confirmative of cherubism lesions.\n\n【12】**2\\. Histopathological Diagnosis**\n\n【13】Histologic evaluation of lesions, present either in the mandible and/or maxilla, show non-neoplastic characteristics of fibrotic nature with multiple giant cell formations and cysts along with an increase in the osteoid matrix.\n\n【14】How to Manage Cherubism?\n------------------------\n\n【15】Cherubism is considered a self-limiting condition that eventually improves over time despite severe deforming manifestations. Treatment, however, should be tailored to suit the individual’s clinical presentation and their esthetics. These individuals may need physical and social encouragement, and surgery may be needed to improvise the person's functional and esthetic features and concerns. Surgical intervention may be done by a maxillofacial surgeon who may curettage the lesion and place a bone graft if needed. The physician or dermatologist may advise liposuction to recontour the disfigured cheeks after surgically treating the affected mandible or maxilla.\n\n【16】**Conclusion**\n\n【17】To conclude, cherubism is a locally aggressive yet self-limiting condition that may require multidisciplinary intervention comprising a craniofacial specialist, dentist, orthodontist, ophthalmologist (eye specialist), and maxillofacial surgeon. A psychologist can also be of great help to these affected individuals to overcome the potential stress, stigma, and psychological trauma experienced by them. Affected parents can seek help from a genetic counselor before planning their pregnancy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Being that it only makes up a small portion of all cases of osteosarcoma, it is a particularly intriguing and difficult condition to identify and treat. Young adults are often affected with parosteal osteosarcoma, which presents as a slow-growing tumor that frequently develops in the long bones of the limbs.\n\n【2】What Is Parosteal Osteosarcoma?\n-------------------------------\n\n【3】A rare kind of bone cancer called periosteal osteosarcoma develops from the periosteum, the outer layer of the bone. It is a kind of osteosarcoma, a cancerous tumor that produces osteoid, a material that resembles bone. Parosteal osteosarcoma develops on the surface of the bone, in contrast to other types of osteosarcoma, which normally take place within the medullary cavity of the bone.\n\n【4】This type of osteosarcoma is most commonly found near the knee joint, specifically on the posterior aspect of the distal femur. Parosteal osteosarcoma usually affects young adults, with a peak incidence in the second and third decades of life. It is more prevalent in females than males.\n\n【5】Histologically, parosteal osteosarcoma exhibits a well-differentiated appearance. The tumor is composed of fibrous tissue and bony trabeculae, resembling normal bone architecture. It grows slowly and typically remains confined to the bone for an extended period before invading surrounding tissues. This slow growth pattern distinguishes parosteal osteosarcoma from other aggressive subtypes of osteosarcoma.\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms and Clinical Manifestations of Parosteal Osteosarcoma?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Here are the commonly observed symptoms and clinical features associated with this condition:\n\n【8】**1\\. Mass or Swelling:** The most common presenting symptom of parosteal osteosarcoma is the presence of a painless mass or swelling in the affected bone. This mass may gradually increase in size over time.\n\n【9】**2\\. Pain:** Despite being largely painless in the early stages, parosteal osteosarcoma can occasionally produce localized pain as it progresses. The discomfort is frequently described as dull and enduring, and it may get worse when you move around or at night. The discomfort may be worse if the tumor compresses nearby nerves or results in pathological fractures.\n\n【10】**3\\. Limited Range of Motion:** A parosteal osteosarcoma that is close to a joint may have a limited range of motion. Patients may feel stiff, have trouble moving the injured limb, or have less range of motion in the nearby joint.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>Does continuous tingling sensation on face, legs, and arms indicate multiple sclerosis?</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-3:<u>What can be done for osteogenic sarcoma?</u>\n\n【15】Anthracycline Cardiotoxicity - Risk and Prevention\n\n【16】**4\\. Pathological Fractures:** Parosteal osteosarcoma can sometimes weaken the damaged bone, which might result in a pathological fracture. This kind of fracture can result in rapid, excruciating pain and can happen spontaneously or with little impact.\n\n【17】**5\\. Neurological Symptoms:** If the tumor presses on nearby tissues or nerves, neurological symptoms may result. The affected limb may experience numbness, tingling, or weakening as a result.\n\n【18】What Are the Radiological Features of Parosteal Osteosarcoma?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The following are the radiological characteristics of parosteal osteosarcoma:\n\n【20】**1\\. X-rays:** Parosteal osteosarcoma frequently exhibits recognizable findings on X-ray imaging. The tumor is seen as a lobulated mass that is adhered to the bone's surface. It typically has a \"cloud-like\" or \"sunburst\" look, with thick, erratic, and radiating mineralized regions. The tumor may also lead to erosion of the underlying bone and cortical thickening.\n\n【21】**2\\. Computed Tomography (CT):** CT scans provide a more detailed view of the tumor and surrounding structures. They can help evaluate the extent of the tumor, its relationship with adjacent bones, and any cortical breakthrough. CT scans also assist in surgical planning by delineating the tumor's size, shape, and involvement of critical anatomical structures.\n\n【22】**3\\. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** The assessment of the soft tissue component of parosteal osteosarcoma and the detection of any involvement of surrounding muscles, tendons, or ligaments can both be done using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It gives a clear view of the size of the tumor and aids in identifying benign from malignant tumors. The effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the tumor can also be assessed with the help of MRI.\n\n【23】**4\\. Bone Scintigraphy:** Nuclear medicine imaging methods such as bone scintigraphy, often known as a bone scan, are used to assess the entire skeletal system for metastatic involvement. The bone scan for parosteal osteosarcoma often reveals higher uptake in the tumor's vicinity, confirming the tumor's presence and activity.\n\n【24】**5\\. Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT):** These scans can be useful for determining probable metastatic disease and gauging the metabolic activity of parosteal osteosarcoma. Increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the tumor or distant sites may indicate tumor activity and guide treatment decisions.\n\n【25】How to Diagnose Parosteal Osteosarcoma?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【26】The diagnosis of parosteal osteosarcoma involves a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and histopathological analysis. Here are the steps involved in diagnosing parosteal osteosarcoma:\n\n【27】**1\\. Clinical Examination:**\n\n【28】*   **Medical History and Physical Exam:** The first step is to compile a full medical history and do a physical exam. The doctor will ask about symptoms, the length of the mass or swelling, and any pain or functional restrictions that may be present.\n\n【29】**2\\. Imaging Studies:**\n\n【30】*   The diagnosis of parosteal osteosarcoma relies heavily on radiological imaging.\n\n【31】*   X-rays are frequently the first imaging technique employed, and they might show distinctive characteristics like the \"sunburst\" or \"cloud-like\" look connected to parosteal osteosarcoma.\n\n【32】*   Computed tomography (CT) scans offer more precise details on the tumor's dimensions, distribution, and extent.\n\n【33】*   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is particularly helpful in evaluating the soft tissue component and assessing the involvement of adjacent structures.\n\n【34】**3\\. Histopathological Analysis:**\n\n【35】**Biopsy:**\n\n【36】*   A biopsy can provide a conclusive diagnosis of parosteal osteosarcoma. In order to perform a histological analysis, a sample of the tumor tissue must be obtained.\n\n【37】*   Imaging studies may be used to direct a needle biopsy or an incisional biopsy to guarantee a precise sample.\n\n【38】*   The existence of cancerous cells is confirmed by histopathological investigation, which also evaluates the tumor's subtype, grade, and margins.\n\n【39】**4\\. Staging and Additional Tests:**\n\n【40】*   Once the diagnosis of parosteal osteosarcoma is confirmed, further tests may be conducted to determine the extent of the disease and to stage the tumor.\n\n【41】*   These tests may include bone scans, positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scans, and sometimes, chest X-rays or CT scans to check for possible metastasis.\n\n【42】What Are the Treatment Strategies for Parosteal Osteosarcoma?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】The treatment plan for parosteal osteosarcoma typically involves a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating surgery, chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy. The specific treatment plan may vary depending on factors such as tumor size, location, extent, and the presence of metastasis. Here is a brief overview of the treatment options:\n\n【44】**1\\. Surgical Resection****:** The main form of treatment for parosteal osteosarcoma. The objective is to completely remove the tumor while maintaining maximum limb function. Usually, a large local excision is carried out, removing the tumor along with a margin of healthy tissue. In some circumstances, limb salvage techniques like endoprostheses reconstruction (implanting an artificial bone) or bone allograft transplantation (using donated bone) may be taken into consideration. Amputation, however, might be required in patients with significant illness or insufficient margins.\n\n【45】**2\\. Adjuvant Chemotherapy:** Chemotherapy is often used in conjunction with surgery as adjuvant therapy. Different chemotherapy medications and regimens are used, but they all work to find and kill any cancer cells that may still be present while lowering the likelihood of recurrence and preventing metastasis. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which is administered before surgery, may be used in some circumstances to reduce the tumor, make surgical resection easier, and enhance limb preservation.\n\n【46】**3\\. Radiation Therapy:** It may be used in certain circumstances, especially when complete surgical resection is difficult or when there is a high risk of local recurrence. High-energy radiation is used to specifically target and kill cancer cells. Usually, radiation therapy is only used when surgery alone is insufficient or when there is still illness present after surgery.\n\n【47】**4\\. Clinical Trials:** For qualified patients with parosteal osteosarcoma, clinical trials offer access to innovative medications and experimental treatments designed to improve outcomes. Patients should speak with their medical team to see if taking part in a clinical trial is an option that would be beneficial to them.\n\n【48】**Conclusion:**\n\n【49】A rare kind of bone cancer that develops from the periosteum is called parosteal osteosarcoma. Usually, it appears as a painless swelling or lump close to the knee joint. Clinical assessment, imaging investigations, and histological examination are all used in the diagnosis process. The recommended course of treatment frequently entails radiation therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and surgical resection.

There are several genodermatoses, but common types of genodermatoses are ichthyosis, epidermolysis bullosa, ectodermal dysplasia, albinism, cutis laxa, progeroid, and precancerous conditions xeroderma pigmentosum, Rothmund Thomson syndrome, and dyskeratosis congenita. The type of disease is determined by how the genes are affected. They affect a person's quality of life and may cause death.\n\n【2】How Are Genodermatoses Classified?\n----------------------------------\n\n【3】Genodermatoses are inherited through modes:\n\n【4】*   **A Single Gene (Monogenic):** A single gene abnormality is seen in such diseases.\n\n【5】*   **Polygenetic (Multiple Genes):** Polygenic disorders include multiple gene abnormalities.\n\n【6】*   **Chromosomal:** Refers to the diseases caused by a chromosomal abnormality.\n\n【7】What Are the Common Types of Genodermatoses?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Genodermatoses have many types. Most of them are rare.\n\n【9】The common types are:\n\n【10】**Ectodermal Dysplasia**\n\n【11】*   Ectodermal dysplasia is a genetic disease due to the mutation or deletion of specific genes.\n\n【12】*   It is characterized by a defect in the development or function of the teeth, hair, nails, and sweat glands.\n\n【13】*   People with ectodermal dysplasia have abnormal nails, no or less sweating, abnormal or missing teeth, cleft lip, large forehead, low nasal bridge, thin hair, and poor hearing.\n\n【14】*   It is a genetic disorder that can be inherited or passed down the family line.\n\n【15】*   Their patterns of inheritance include x-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Nystagmus - Types, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Ways to Prevent Skin Pigmentation Disorders</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Alexandria’s Genesis - Conditions That Affect Eye Color</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Out of 150 types of ectodermal dysplasia, the most common one is hypohidrotic dysplasia (caused by mutations in the EDA, EDAR, or EDARADD genes).\n\n【17】*   **Treatment:** People with abnormal or no sweat gland function should live in ventilated areas at home, school, and work. Surgical procedures to repair the cleft palate may lessen facial deformities and improve speech. In addition, artificial tears may prevent corneal damage in people with dry eyes.\n    </u>\n\n【18】**White Sponge Nevus**\n\n【19】*   There is a mutation in the keratin‑4 or keratin‑13 (genes that provide instructions for making proteins).\n\n【20】*   It is characterized by thick, velvety sponge-like white patches of tissue (nevi) commonly found on the lining of the mouth (oral mucosa) and the inside of the cheeks (buccal mucosa).\n\n【21】*   The condition inherits an autosomal dominant pattern (a copy of the altered gene in each cell causes the disorder).\n\n【22】*   **Treatment:** Topical or systemic antibiotics may help in complete or partial remission.\n\n【23】**Ichthyosis**\n\n【24】*   A disorder characterized by dry, thickened, scaly skin (fish-scale skin).\n\n【25】*   It occurs due to genetic defects that alter the appearance and behavior of keratinocytes (skin cells) in the stratum corneum layer of the skin (outer layer).\n\n【26】*   Most types of ichthyosis are rare. The two most common forms are:\n\n【27】    *   **Ichthyosis Vulgaris:** It manifests as gray, brown, or white scales on the skin in early childhood. Most types of ichthyosis are rare.\n\n【28】    *   **X-linked Recessive Ichthyosis:** It affects only males; women can be carriers. It can raise the risk of testicular cancer in males.\n\n【29】*   **Treatment:** Treatment involves the management of dry and scaly skin by keeping it moist. Rub cream, lotion, or ointment on the skin daily. Take a bath with salt water. Use products containing salicylic acid, lactic acid, or glycolic acid.\n\n【30】**Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome**\n\n【31】*   It is a condition that results from mutations in the STK11 gene (also known as the LKB1 gene) - the gene responsible for controlling cell growth.\n\n【32】*   Symptoms include dark-colored spots (also called mucocutaneous pigmentation) on various body parts like the mouth, lips, eyes, nose, hands, feet, and anus. Also, there is a development of hamartomatous polyps (noncancerous overgrowths of tissue).\n\n【33】*   **Treatment:** Close surveillance of organs to monitor for cancers may avoid emergencies.\n\n【34】**Epidermolysis Bullosa**\n\n【35】*   Group of rare diseases caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene (gene provides instructions for making subunits that form a more significant protein called type VII collagen).\n\n【36】*   The disease causes blistering and fragile skin. The blisters arise due to rubbing, scratching, or minor trauma. Other symptoms include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and itchy and painful skin.\n\n【37】*   The gene can either pass on from one parent with the disease (autosomal dominant inheritance) or from both parents (autosomal recessive inheritance). It may also arise due to a new mutation in the affected person.\n\n【38】*   Three main types of the condition are:\n\n【39】    *   **Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex:** A most common form of all types in which blistering occurs anywhere on the skin, mainly affecting the palms and the feet. The blisters usually heal without scarring.\n\n【40】    *   **Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa:** A more severe condition in which blisters appear in infancy. A baby with this condition develops a hoarse-sounding cry and difficulty breathing due to the development of granulation tissues in the airway.\n\n【41】    *   **Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa:** It occurs due to a defect in the gene responsible for producing a kind of collagen that provides strength to the dermis (underlying layer of the skin). In the absence of this collagen, the layers of the skin fail to join correctly.\n\n【42】*   **Treatment:** Medications can help control pain and itching. Oral antibiotics can be considered if the wounds show widespread infection (fever, weakness). Skin grafting can be regarded as if scarring has affected the function of the hand. Repeated blistering and scarring can cause bends in the joints. Surgery can correct these conditions.\n\n【43】**Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome**\n\n【44】*   A group of inherited conditions is associated with abnormal collagen production (a protein that is the main component of connective tissue).\n\n【45】*   The affected areas are skin, joints, and blood vessels that lead to hyperflexible joints and stretchy, fragile skin.\n\n【46】*   There are thirteen types of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, out of which the common types are:\n\n【47】    *   **Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome:** Occurs due to rupture of blood vessels and organs, leading to bleeding problems. Some complications may lead to bruising, internal bleeding, or stroke. Most cases of this vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome result from alterations in the COL3A1 gene.\n    *   **Classical Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome:** People with this type have characteristic \"cigarette paper scars\" due to the wounds that split open with bleeding and leave scars that widen over time alterations in the genes COL5A1 or COL5A1, or COL5A2 cause the classical type cases.\n    *   **Cardiac-Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome:** Those with cardiac-vascular type experience severe problems with the valves that control blood movement through the heart. It involves mutations in the TNXB gene.\n    *   **Kyphoscoliotic Type:** Occurs due to mutations in the PLOD1M or FKBP14 genes. People with this type experience curvature in their spines.\n*   **Treatment:** Over-the-counter pain relievers such as Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen sodium are the mainstay of treatment. Low blood pressure helps reduce the stress on fragile blood vessels in some forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n\n【48】**Multiple Hamartoma Syndrome**\n\n【49】*   Changes in the genes - PTEN, KLLN, and WWP1 cause this disease. It is also known as Cowden syndrome, characterized by numerous non-cancerous, tumor-like growths (hamartomas).\n\n【50】*   These tumor-like growths are most commonly found on the skin, mucous membranes, intestine, and other body parts.\n\n【51】*   People with this disease are at increased risk of developing melanoma and colorectal and kidney cancers.\n\n【52】*   **Treatment:** People with this condition should undergo annual medical and physical examinations, laboratory tests, and radiographic tests to check for internal malignancies. Genetic counseling is mainly for women to reduce the risk of complications. Oral retinoids may help treat skin lesions temporarily. Surgeries like chemical peeling, laser resurfacing, or shave excisions may be considered.\n\n【53】**Xeroderma Pigmentosum**\n\n【54】*   Inherited skin condition caused due to extreme sensitivity to sunlight.\n\n【55】*   The affected areas are sun-exposed body parts such as the face, arms, and lips.\n\n【56】*   In people with xeroderma pigmentosum, DNA damage is not repaired on its own due to the mutations in genes involved in repairing damaged DNA. As a result, many abnormalities form in DNA, cells malfunction, and later become cancerous or die.\n\n【57】*   People with this condition experience sunburn with blistering, dark or light-colored patches, and dry skin and eyes. They have more risk of developing cancers.\n\n【58】*   This condition inherits in an autosomal recessive pattern. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder carry one copy of the mutated gene. Still, they do not show signs and symptoms of the disease.\n\n【59】*   **Treatment:** Avoid ultraviolet radiation exposure like cigarette smoke, sunlight, and others. People with xeroderma pigmentosum may require regular screening for cancer.\n\n【60】**Conclusion**\n\n【61】Genodermatoses are rare diseases for which effective treatment still does not exist. Currently, the treatment modalities are based on managing the symptoms comprising topical preparations, surgery, symptomatic pain relief, itching treatment, and complications like skin cancers. One of the biggest challenges in treating genodermatoses is multiple organ involvement. Recent technological advances offer new inventive tools that help target the real cause of genodermatoses and thus restore or replace the affected gene. Therapies emerging as powerful tools to treat genodermatoses are gene replacement, genome editing, protein replacement, and cell-based and RNA-based therapies. However, despite all the advancements, therapeutic approaches still have much scope for improvement.\n\n【62】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【63】* * *\n\n【64】#### **1.**删除换行**How Long Does Xeroderma Pigmentosum Be Present in an Individual and Can It Be Cured?**\n\n【65】Xerostomia pigmentosum occurs as damage to the DNA (deoxy-ribo nucleic acid) and hence it exists for a lifetime with visible signs seen from six months of age, and because of this reason it is not completely curable but can be maintained with UV protection.\n\n【66】#### **2.**删除换行**Does Xeroderma Pigmentosum Affect the Brain?**\n\n【67】Xeroderma pigmentosum does not directly affect the functioning of the brain but shows  alterations in brain functions in around thirty percent of the cases with evident neurological symptoms like  \n\\- Memory loss.  \n\\- Eyesight dysfunction.  \n\\- Difficulty in intellection.  \n\\- Deafness.  \n\\- Seizures.\n\n【68】#### **3.**删除换行**Is Xeroderma Pigmentosum Seen From Birth?**\n\n【69】Xeroderma pigmentosum is a genetic condition present from birth due to an autosomal recessive disorder with clinical conditions seen at the early stage of life or infancy with evident clinical signs visible after six months of age.\n\n【70】#### **4.**删除换行**What Are the Tests Used To Evaluate Xeroderma Pigmentosum?**\n\n【71】The evaluation methods used to diagnose xeroderma pigmentosum are done by getting complete medical and family history along with  \n\\- Gene testing.   \n\\- Gene-targeted testing (Multiple gene testing panel).  \n\\- Comprehensive genomic testing.\n\n【72】#### **5.**删除换行**What Is the Life Span in Progeria?**\n\n【73】Progeria is a critical condition seen in children, and it is known to cause early death.

It is a biological response of the body to remove foreign substances. The immune system activates inflammatory cells whenever the body encounters a foreign body, such as a virus, bacteria, or toxins, or suffers an injury. The cytokines are the first responders, stimulating the inflammatory response. Cytokines are the small proteins that control the growth and activity of other immune system cells and blood cells.\n\n【2】The immune system cells are the major players in mediating inflammatory responses against any stimuli. These cells act as signaling receptors that help detect foreign substances, and inflammasome complexes get formed when persistent inflammation occurs. This help activates certain enzymes and produces pro-inflammatory cytokines and pyroptosis induction (inflammatory cell death caused by microbial infection).\n\n【3】What Are Inflammasomes?\n-----------------------\n\n【4】Inflammasomes are defined as high-molecular-weight cytoplasmic multiprotein complexes which are responsible for the activation of the inflammatory response to any external stimuli. The inflammasomes help regulate the activation of caspase-1 (a family of protease enzymes playing essential roles in programmed cell death) and induce inflammation in response to infectious microbes and molecules derived from host proteins. Moreover, it has been implicated in a host of inflammatory disorders. The activation and assembling of inflammasomes promote the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, leading to pyroptosis (inflammatory cell death caused by microbial infection).\n\n【5】What Is the History of Inflammasomes?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【6】Tschopp and coworkers first discovered the inflammasomes in 2002 in diseases such as type 2 diabetes and gout. Their study found that various signals can stimulate the response from an inflammasome, such as viral DNA, asbestos, muramyl dipeptide (MDP), and silica. They also found a connection between metabolic syndrome and NLRP3, a subtype of the inflammasome. Tschopp and his coworker's work helps evaluate and treat various major diseases.\n\n【7】Later in 2002, Martinon and his coworkers found that a subset of NLRs (NOD-like receptors) (NOD-nucleotide-binding oligomerization) named NLRP1 assembled into a common structure, collectively activating the caspase-1 cascade, thereby producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. This NLRP1 complex was considered the first inflammasome found, which led to more interest from the scientists, and later on, several other inflammasomes were discovered, such as NLR subtypes - NLRP3 and NLRC4.\n\n【8】The nucleotide-binding oligomerization- (NOD-) like receptors (NLRs) are a type of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and are located within the cytoplasm of a cell and help in recognizing the pathogen/damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs). The NLRs include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectins (CTLs), and galectins, which help mediate the innate immune response to identify harmful microbes or other pathogens.\n\n【9】What Is the Structure of Inflammasomes?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【10】The inflammasome complexes are formed by three important molecular structures: a sensor molecule, an adaptor protein, and an effector, for example, caspase-1. The sensor molecules identified to participate in the assembly process include the following:\n\n【11】*   Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD).\n\n【12】*   Leucine-rich repeat (LLR).\n\n【13】*   NOD-like receptors (NLRs) family.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Colchicine - Indications, Dosage, and Side Effects</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Pseudogout - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    How to Improve Lung Health If You Get COVID-19?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Absent in melanoma 2- (AIM2-) like receptors (ALRs) family.\n\n【15】*   Interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI-16).\n\n【16】*   Retinoic acid\\-inducible gene I (RIG-I).\n    </u>\n\n【17】Once these sensor molecules are activated, they help promote apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation (ASC) and recruitment domain (CARD), which helps activate specific caspases.\n\n【18】The protein components of NLR inflammasomes are present in their structure death domains (DD - protein-protein interaction structures found in proteins that regulate various signal transduction pathways), which are represented by pyrin domains (PYD), NLRP, or CARD domains. The NLR family - NLRP1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and NLRC12 are capable of inflammasome complex formation after receptor activation. There are four known NLRP inflammasomes, including NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP4, and AIM2 inflammasomes. Among these, NLRP3 inflammasomes play a vital role in shaping immune responses and regulating intestinal homeostasis in various inflammatory diseases.\n\n【19】What Are the Components of Inflammasome Complexes?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The inflammasome complexes consist of three major molecules, including:\n\n【21】**1\\. Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs)** **-** The PRR receptors comprise Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin (CTL), which are membrane-bound receptors and cytoplasmic receptors such as NLRs, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and ALRs.\n\n【22】**2\\. Adaptor protein (ASC - apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD)** **-** It is based on two protein-protein interaction domains - an N-terminal PYD domain and a C-terminal CARD domain. The primary function of the ASC protein is to connect with the complex assembly involved in inflammatory processes and automated cell death.\n\n【23】**3\\. Caspase Family** **-** The caspase family can be divided into multiple domains depending upon their involvement in inflammation or apoptosis, which include\n\n【24】*   Inflammatory caspases (caspase-1, caspase-4, and caspase-5).\n\n【25】*   Caspases involved in apoptosis initiation (caspase-2, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-10).\n\n【26】*   Caspases required for apoptosis advancement (caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7).\n\n【27】What Is the Mechanism of Activation of Inflammasomes?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】The mechanism of activation of inflammasomes is listed below:\n\n【29】*   Inflammasomes are the protein complexes that assemble in the cytoplasm of body cells after sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Specific sensors such as PRRs pattern recognition receptors or TLRs Toll-like receptors can recognize this distinct stimulus depicted by PAMPs or DAMPs.\n\n【30】*   After sensing, the PAMPS and DAMPs receptor molecules get assembled and will further activate the caspase-1.\n\n【31】*   The activated receptor molecules engage with the adaptor protein ASC, which engages the procaspase-1 and determines its activation through oligomerization which is a process that allows proteins to form large structures and provides stability to the complex.\n\n【32】*   After that, the active caspase-1 helps the cleavage (breakdown) and maturation of IL-1β and IL-18, which promotes the secretion of other inflammatory factors and causes pyroptosis (inflammatory cell death caused by microbial infection).\n\n【33】There are two other noncanonical pathways of inflammasome activation, including other caspases instead of caspase-1.\n\n【34】1.  The first one evaluates the capacity of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to activate caspase-4 and caspase-5 through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). This will further simulate the processing of gasdermin D (GSDMD - a protein encoded by the GSDMD gene on chromosome 8) to activate the inflammasome complex. After the activation of the inflammasome, IL-1β and IL-18 maturation will occur in a caspase-1-dependent manner and will facilitate the process of pyroptosis.\n\n【35】1.  The second method is represented by IL-1β and IL-18 maturation through the activation of caspase-8, which is activated through microbes' detection by CTL (C-type lectin) receptors.\n\n【36】What Is the Link Between Inflammasomes and Auto-Inflammatory Diseases?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Inflammasomes have been linked with various autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease and metabolic disorders like atherosclerosis, type-2 diabetes, and obesity.\n\n【38】Below are some of the associated auto-inflammatory diseases and their pathologic activation of inflammasomes or NLRs.\n\n【39】**Hereditary Periodic Fevers:**\n\n【40】*   **Cryopyrinopathies (MWS, FCAS, NOMID) -** Mutation in CIAS1 or NLRP3. Overactive variants of NLRP3 and overexpression of NLRP3 lead to facilitated inflammasome activation.\n\n【41】*   **Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) -** Mutations in MEFV or pyrin. Possible promotion of ASC assembly.\n\n【42】*   **NLRP12 Familial Fever -** Truncation mutations in NLRP12. Hereditary periodic fevers associated with arthralgia (joint stiffness) and urticaria (raised, itchy skin rash).\n\n【43】**Genetic Diseases:**\n\n【44】*   **Vitiligo -** Mutations in NLRP1.\n\n【45】**Crystal-induced Diseases:**\n\n【46】*   **Gout -** A complex form of arthritis. MSU crystals. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\n【47】*   **Pseudogout -** A form of arthritis characterized by sudden, painful swelling in one or more of the joints. Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrates. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\n【48】*   **Asbestosis** **-** A lung disease caused by breathing in particles of asbestos. Asbestos. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\n【49】*   **Silicosis** **-** A long-term lung disease caused by inhaling large amounts of crystalline silica dust. Silica. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\n【50】**Other -**\n\n【51】*   **Alzheimer's Disease -** β-Amyloid. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\n【52】*   **Contact Hypersensitivity -** Trinitrochlorobenzene, sodium dodecyl sulfate. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\n【53】**Conclusion:**\n\n【54】The inflammasomes are vital cellular complexes that help detect pathogens and endogenous danger signals. In addition, they help in immunity as they promote the production of interleukins IL-1β and IL-18. Therefore, the effectiveness of any drug that can alter the inflammasome function can potentially improve the symptoms of various autoinflammatory diseases like crystal-induced inflammation. Therefore inflammasome activity is considered critical to check the host response to microbial pathogens and the response of the body's immunity to medicine.\n\n【55】Hence, inflammasome activation cannot be considered harmful as it has multiple beneficial factors. As the research is still going on these factors, there is a high chance that new therapies will be developed in the coming future to tackle various inflammatory diseases.\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>*   Inflammasomes: Mechanism of Action, Role in Disease, and Therapeutics  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4519035/#!po=7.81250\n*   Inflammasomes  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4292152/\n*   Inflammasomes: too big to miss  \n    https://www.jci.org/articles/view/40599/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Usually, signals are sent to the bladder muscles to tighten or loosen them. However, in the neurogenic bladder, these signals do not work as they should, causing bladder control problems.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Neurogenic Bladder?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】There are two significant types of bladder control problems linked to neurogenic bladder. Depending on the nerves involved and the damage, your bladder may become overactive (spastic or hyper-reflexive) or less active (flaccid or hypotonic).\n\n【4】*   **Hyper-Reflexive Bladder:** In the case of the overactive bladder, the muscles of the bladder contract and are squeezed too much even when the bladder is not full, which makes the urine leak.\n\n【5】*   **Hypotonic Bladder:** In the hypotonic bladder, the muscles become underactive and do not contract, and the release of the urine becomes difficult.\n\n【6】How Frequent or Common Is the Neurogenic Bladder?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Neurogenic bladder dysfunction is more common in people with spinal cord injuries, affecting more than 90 %. Around 95 % of people with spina bifida have some neurogenic dysfunction. This condition also affects 50 % to 80 % of people with multiple sclerosis (a condition in which the immune system destroys the protective covering of the nerves). In addition, the neurogenic bladder affects people with stroke and Parkinson's disease, and many other neurological disorders. Neurological conditions such as advanced diabetes can also cause neurogenic bladder.\n\n【8】What Causes Neurogenic Bladder?\n-------------------------------\n\n【9】The neurogenic bladder can be caused due to congenital disabilities (defects that the person is born with) or other neurogenic causes and illnesses.\n\n【10】**Congenital Disabilities:** Below congenital disabilities can cause neurogenic bladder:\n\n【11】*   **Spina Bifida:** This disorder occurs when the spine does not fully develop during the first month of pregnancy. Babies born with spina bifida often have a disability or weakness that affects how the bladder works.\n\n【12】*   **Sacral Agenesis:** An abnormality in which parts of the lower spine are absent.\n\n【13】*   **Cerebral Palsy:** Cerebral Palsy is a group of chronic (long-term) problems that reduce a person's ability to control body movements and posture. They are caused due to damage to the areas of the brain.\n\n【14】**Non-Congenital Causes:** The non-congenital causes for neurogenic bladder include:\n\n【15】*   Neuropathy (damage to the nerve).\n\n【16】*   Nervous damage due to prolonged alcohol use.\n\n【17】*   Neurological impairment due to chronic diabetes.\n\n【18】*   Vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n【19】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Transurethral Needle Ablation of the Prostate - Procedure, Indications, Contraindications, Benefits, and Complications</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Child Bedwetting: Are You and Your Child Frustrated?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I get out of breath easily causing pressure to urinate or pass stools.

Likewise, the symptoms rely upon nerve damage causing the issue. They include:\n\n【35】*   **Urinary Tract Infection:** UTI is usually the first sign of a neurogenic bladder. People with less active bladder may develop recurrent urinary tract infections causing recurrent illnesses by harmful bacteria, germs, or yeast that grow in the urinary tract.\n\n【36】*   **Urinary Incontinence:** Urine leakage occurs when bladder muscles become overworked. Sometimes this causes the urine to leak before it is ready to urinate, causing urinary incontinence in which you drip just a few drops of urine, or it can also be like a flow. Also, sometimes urine leakage occurs while you are sleeping.\n\n【37】*   **Frequent Urination:** The symptom of frequent urination is, urinating more than eight times in 24 hours.\n\n【38】*   **Dribbling:** With symptoms of underlying bladder disease, you may urinate only a small amount of urine means just a few drops, which is known to be dribbling and may not be able to empty your bladder, or sometimes due to blockage, you may not be able to open your bladder at all to urinate. This can happen to people with diabetes, multiple sclerosis, polio, syphilis, or significant pelvic surgery, as bladder muscles may not tighten when needed. In addition, the sphincter muscles around the urethra may not function properly. As a result, they may stay firm and cause difficulty in urinating.\n\n【39】How Is Neurogenic Bladder Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------\n\n【40】*   **Physical Examination of the Bladder and Ureter:** Includes checking the anatomy of the pelvic organs and looking out for any abnormality. The neurologic aspect of physical examination involves checking the mental state of the patient, sensations, reflexes, and strength.\n\n【41】*   **Imaging Techniques:** Like X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) are used to visualize the bladder or for any blockage that is present in the system.\n\n【42】*   **Ultrasound (Sonography):** This imaging test uses high-frequency sound waves to create images on a computer screen.\n\n【43】*   **Cystoscopy:** A small, flexible tube is inserted into the urinary tract tube to check the urinary tract to examine structural changes or blocks, such as kidney stones or tumors.\n\n【44】*   **Urodynamics:** These tests examine how your lower urinary tract stores and excretes urine. The patient is asked to urinate in a particular container to see how much urine they produce and how long it takes.\n\n【45】How Is Neurogenic Bladder Treated?\n----------------------------------\n\n【46】Treatment for another neurogenic bladder will be determined by your healthcare provider based on the following;\n\n【47】*   Age, overall health, and medical history.\n\n【48】*   Cause of nerve damage.\n\n【49】*   Type and severity of the symptoms.\n\n【50】*   Tolerance of certain drugs, procedures, or treatments.\n\n【51】1.  **Treatment of Urinary Incontinence:** Depending on the symptoms, it can be of various types. The following are the treatment modalities available:\n\n【52】    *   Stress incontinence is treated with surgical and some non-surgical approaches.\n\n【53】    *   Behavioral modification, pharmacotherapy, or third-line procedures may help.\n\n【54】    *   Mixed incontinence may require medications as well as surgery.\n\n【55】    *   Overflow incontinence is generally treated by emptying the bladder with a catheter.\n\n【56】    *   Other forms of incontinence may be resolved by treating the underlying cause (e.g. urinary tract infection, constipation).\n\n【57】    *   Lifestyle changes.\n\n【58】    *   Surgery for urinary incontinence - The surgeon opens a stoma (hole) in the abdomen in this procedure. The catheter can be passed through a stoma to remove it from the bladder or an outer collection bag placed over the stoma to hold urine.\n\n【59】2.  **Drugs:** Drugs that treat neurogenic bladder include Oxybutynin, Tolterodine, Mirabegron, Solifenacin Succinate, and others.\n\n【60】3.  **Botulinum Injections:** Injected into the bladder muscle to help assist the bladder from contracting too often. It might also want to be repeated in six months or a year.\n\n【61】4.  **Catheters:** This is a treatment used for underactive bladder. A tiny tube is inserted into your urethra to help your bladder empty fully. There are two types:\n\n【62】    *   **Clean Intermittent Catheterization (CIC)** - The type of technique in which a removable type of catheter is placed depending on your symptoms, the patient is asked to perform self-catheterization at regular intervals, usually three to four times a day; sometimes, clean intermittent catheterization can help improve how your bladder works after several weeks or months. However, intermittent catheters may be hard to use for some people with hand coordination problems.\n\n【63】    *   **Continuous Catheterization** - Insertion of the catheter, whichstays in place to drain urine. The catheter can be placed through the urethra or surgically placed through a small incision in the lower belly directly into the bladder (called a suprapubic tube). The catheter needs to be changed every four to six weeks.\n\n【64】5.  **Lifestyle changes:** Avoid certain foods or drinks that may irritate your bladder. These include alcohol and certain caffeinated beverages such as coffee and soda. Proper blood sugar control in people with diabetes and constipation can also help.\n\n【65】6.  **Surgery:** Some of the surgeries that are performed to help patients to cope with neurogenic bladder include:\n\n【66】    *   **Artificial Sphincter** \\- This device is inserted to treat severe urinary incontinence when the urethral sphincter muscle is not functioning correctly. Surgery is needed to place the sphincter cuff around the urethra while the pump is inserted under the skin into the scrotum.\n\n【67】    *   **Augmentation Cystoplasty** - In this procedure, the surgeon removes parts of the intestines (sigmoid colon) and attaches them to the bladder's walls. This reduces the internal pressure in the bladder and increases its ability to retain urine.\n\n【68】What Are the Complications of Neurogenic Bladder?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【69】Patients with neurogenic bladder are at risk for several urologic complications, including:\n\n【70】*   Hydronephrosis: swelling of the kidneys due to urine build-up.\n\n【71】*   Vesicoureteral reflux: an atypical flow of urine from bladders to ureters.\n\n【72】*   Kidney failure.\n\n【73】*   Urinary tract infections: an infection of the kidneys, bladder, urethra, or any other component of the urinary system.\n\n【74】*   Calculus (kidney stones).\n\n【75】*   Bladder cancer.\n\n【76】*   Sexual dysfunction.\n\n【77】*   Infertility.\n\n【78】*   Other malignancies.\n\n【79】**Conclusion**:\n\n【80】The neurogenic bladder has no permanent cure; however, it can be managed through lifestyle changes and nutritional choices. Talk to your physician if you experience new or worse concerns, including things that may indicate an infection, such as pain or fever.\n\n【81】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【82】* * *\n\n【83】#### **1.**删除换行**Does Neurogenic Bladder a Permanent Condition?**\n\n【84】Neurogenic bladder is a condition that occurs when the association between the nervous system and bladder function is altered by injury or disorder.

From a medical perspective, women in developing nations are most interested in the pill's efficacy. The pill benefits not only maternal health but also the survival and health of infants by reducing unintended pregnancies and allowing women to space out their births. Oral contraceptives contain a wide range of advantages and disadvantages in addition to preventing conception. The incidence of menstrual issues (including dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia), iron-deficiency anemia, pelvic inflammatory disease, functional ovarian cysts, benign breast disease, epithelial ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer is decreased as a result of combination oral contraceptives.\n\n【2】The considerable preventive effects of the pill against ovarian and endometrial malignancies are particularly significant because they seem to last in former users for at least 15 years after discontinuing oral contraception. The tendency of combination oral contraceptives to cause cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, thrombotic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and venous thrombosis and embolism is one of their most significant side effects. Luckily, these side effects are few and are mostly limited to existing oral contraceptive users.\n\n【3】What Are Oral Contraceptives?\n-----------------------------\n\n【4】Oral contraceptives, sometimes known as birth control pills, are hormonally-rich drugs that are taken internally to prevent conception. Inhibiting ovulation and stopping sperm from entering the cervix are two ways they prevent pregnancy. The synthetic forms of the feminine hormones progesterone and estrogen are included in the oral contraceptive, which is the most often prescribed in the United States. A combination oral contraceptive is another name for this kind of birth control pill. A different kind of oral contraceptive frequently called the micro pill, solely contains progestin, a synthetic counterpart of progesterone. Progesterone and estrogen are hormones that are synthesized and found in the majority of birth control pills. A small pill is a form of birth control pill that only contains synthetic progesterone, also known as progestin. A tablet containing both hormones is referred to as a combined oral contraceptive.\n\n【5】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【7】Breast Cancer Screening: How and When to Begin\n\n【8】Are birth control pills given to manage PCOS and endometriosis?\n\n【9】Yasmin Birth Control Pills\n\n【10】The hormones in the pill prevent the body from ovulating or releasing an egg. Moreover, they alter the cervical mucous and uterine lining. This works together to stop sperm from fertilizing an egg during sexual contact. When used correctly, birth control pills can prevent conception 99 percent of the time. They are taken at the same time each day. Birth control tablets stop pregnancy and reduce period discomfort, stop ovarian cysts, control menstrual cycles, and many other health advantages. Birth control pills do, however, have several side effects and hazards, just like any prescription.\n\n【11】What Is Known About the Relationship Between Oral Contraceptive Use and Cancer?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Women who use oral contraceptives run a higher risk of breast and cervical cancer but a lower risk of endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer. Longer duration of oral contraceptive use lowers chances for ovarian and endometrial malignancies; however, current oral contraceptive use is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. There is mounting evidence that many malignancies in women may have a hormonal origin. Birth control pills, often known as oral contraceptives, are hormone-containing drugs used to prevent pregnancy. Estrogen and progestin are two hormones that are used in the formulation of birth control pills.\n\n【13】Hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control tablets and intrauterine devices (IUDs), marginally increase the risk of breast cancer. However, the significance of the increase in risk varies with each woman and is determined by a variety of factors, including:\n\n【14】*   Age.\n\n【15】*   Overall health.\n\n【16】*   Other breast cancer risk factors include smoking, consuming alcohol, and keeping a healthy weight.\n\n【17】According to studies, older kinds of hormonal birth control with higher hormone levels were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Newer kinds of contraception with lower hormone levels were deemed safer, although all included caution in the instructions that they could increase cancer risk. It is critical to understand that if one has been diagnosed with breast cancer, one should not use hormone-based contraception. There is some evidence that hormonal contraception may raise the chance of cancer recurrence (recurrence). Many women worldwide share the need for safe, efficient birth control. Around 140 million women use hormonal contraception globally. In addition to successfully preventing unintended pregnancies, birth control tablets also aid in managing other conditions like acne, PMS, heavy periods, and mood swings. Birth control tablets have also been demonstrated in studies to marginally reduce the incidence of ovarian and uterine cancer. Additionally, some evidence suggests that birth control tablets may lower the incidence of colorectal cancer.\n\n【18】How Oral Contraceptives Lowers the Risks of Some Cancers?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】It has been proposed that oral contraceptives may reduce the risk of some cancers in a variety of ways, including:\n\n【20】*   Inhibiting endometrial cell proliferation and preventing endometrial cancer.\n\n【21】*   Reducing the number of ovulations a woman has in her lifetime, thereby reducing exposure to naturally occurring female hormones and preventing the risk of ovarian cancer.\n\n【22】*   Decreasing bile acid levels in women taking oral conjugated estrogens prevents colorectal cancer.\n\n【23】**Conclusion:**\n\n【24】In the United States, skin and breast cancer are the two most prevalent cancers in which women are diagnosed. It has been established that oral contraceptives that contain hormones can affect the chance of developing cancer because they alter how cells divide and differentiate. For instance, it has been demonstrated that both estrogen and progestin promote cell division in breast tissue. All forms of birth control enhance a woman's risk of breast cancer to the point that delaying her first pregnancy is necessary. Discussing the optimal method of birth control with the medical staff is vital because all drugs, including oral contraceptives, might have side effects.\n\n【25】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【26】无关删除-1:<u>*   Oral Contraceptives and Cancer Risk  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/hormones/oral-contraceptives-fact-sheet\n*   ERisks and Benefits of Oral Contraceptives: Will Breast Cancer Tip the Balance?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234345/\n*   Does the contraceptive pill increase risk of cancer?  \n    https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/hormones-and-cancer/does-the-contraceptive-pill-increase-cancer-risk</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

If the injury remains unrecognized, it can lead to preventable traumatic death. Spleen is the body's most vascular (rich in blood vessels) organ. Thus the injuries affecting the organ generally affect the arteries and lead to hemoperitoneum. The splenic injuries are recognizable because the bleeding is mostly intraperitoneal (inside the peritoneum). The treatment of choice in cases of injuries is salvaging the spleen instead of removing it because of its immunological functions. The injuries of the spleen are traced easily with a computed tomography scan.\n\n【2】What Are the Functions of the Spleen?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【3】The spleen is a small organ inside the left rib cage above the stomach. The size of the spleen is similar to an avocado in an adult. The spleen is a major part of the lymphatic system, which is an important part of the body's immune system. The functions of the spleen include storage of blood, formation of white blood cells and antibodies, which helps to strengthen the immune system, maintenance of fluid levels in the body, filtration of blood by removing the cellular waste (dead cells) and production of antibodies for the protection of the body from infections.\n\n【4】What Causes Splenic Injury?\n---------------------------\n\n【5】The spleen is generally injured when the trauma involves the upper left abdomen or the lower left chest region. It is most commonly affected by trauma because of its juxtaposition in the upper left abdomen to the 9th, 10th, and 11th rib.\n\n【6】Some of the conditions which can lead to splenic injury are:\n\n【7】*   Blunt trauma is like a blow to the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.\n\n【8】*   Indirect trauma generally occurs while treating any organ besides the spleen or performing an endoscopy or colonoscopy. This type of injury can damage the outer splenic capsule.\n\n【9】*   Penetrating trauma in which there is direct injury to the spleen. One example is gunshot wounds, which comprise almost 7 to 9% of penetrating traumas of the abdomen.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Aneurysm - Causes, Symptoms, Treatments and Prevention Methods</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Pancreatic Pseudoaneurysm - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Acanthocytosis- Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   **Road Accidents**: These are the most common changes of splenic injury, which may involve a blunt blow to the spleen.\n    </u>\n\n【11】How Common Are Splenic Injuries?\n--------------------------------\n\n【12】Splenic injuries are the most common abdominal traumas, with almost 25 % of cases every year. It has no specific gender prevalence; it can affect anyone. However, out of all the causes, blunt trauma is the most common cause of splenic injury.\n\n【13】What Are the Symptoms of Splenic Injury?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【14】*   The most common reason to inquire is trauma to the left rib cage or upper left abdomen region. Although in every case, there doesn't need to be a history of trauma.\n\n【15】*   The symptoms include abdominal pain (especially in the upper left region), abdominal distension, reduced blood pressure or hypotension, and tenderness of the abdominal region.\n\n【16】*   In some rare cases, there can be pain in the left shoulder region due to diaphragmatic irritation. This phenomenon is known as Kehr's sign.\n\n【17】*   In trauma cases, there are external signs such as lacerations, abrasions, or contusions.\n\n【18】*   Some of the cases also witness pleuritic left-sided pain in the chest.\n\n【19】What Are the Points Important for Physical Examination in Splenic Injury Cases?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】*   The most common reason behind splenic injuries is trauma. However, it is not the only reason in all cases. Suppose there is trauma in the left upper chest region. In that case, it is advised to look for external injuries such as lacerations, abrasions, or contusions, which can help evaluate the trauma's intensity.\n\n【21】*   It is important to ask for a history of splenectomy or any surgery around the spleen. The doctors also investigate other liver or portal vein diseases with the help of anticoagulants.\n\n【22】*   It is important to inquire if there are fractures in the lower rib region on the left side, as splenic injury can occur. In adults with lower rib fractures, approximately 20% of cases have associated splenic injury.\n\n【23】*   In children, even with a history of blown-out trauma, there might be no fractures as the chest wall has plasticity characteristics, but there might be a chance of internal injuries, which could be splenic.\n\n【24】How to Evaluate Splenic Injuries?\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Some of the adjuncts which can be used to locate the splenic injury are:\n\n【26】*   **Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST)**: This examination can quickly identify the presence of free intraperitoneal fluid in cases of blunt abdominal trauma. This test is useful in cases of hemodynamically unstable patients. There are four acoustic windows in the examination, perihepatic, pericardiac, pelvic, and perisplenic. The test is positive when there is a black rim or anechoic band around the spleen. This test is advised in cases of intraperitoneal bleeding, which is not always necessary for splenic injury. In approximately 25% of cases of spleen injuries, there is no intraperitoneal hemorrhage.\n\n【27】*   **Computed Tomography**: The CT scan (computed tomography) helps to diagnose disruption in solid organs, such as it helps to trace abnormal splenic parenchyma, free intra-abdominal blood, and hematoma. A contrast-enhanced CT scan is used to evaluate the density difference between the splenic parenchyma and hematoma.\n\n【28】What Is the Spleen Organ Injury Scale?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【29】Based on the computed tomography findings, the splenic injuries are classified into different grades:\n\n【30】*   **Grade 1**: Laceration involving less than 1 cm of parenchymal depth with hematoma is less than 10% surface area.\n\n【31】*   **Grade 2**: Presence of hematoma and subcapsular in about 10% to 50% of surface area, with lacerations in 1 to 3 cm of parenchymal depth that does not involve trabecular vessels.\n\n【32】*   **Grade 3**: Hematoma in more than 50% of surface area with subcapsular, intraparenchymal hematoma with more than 5 cm diameter and lacerations greater than 3 cm in depth.\n\n【33】*   **Grade 4:** Lacerations that involve segmental or hilar vessels that produce major devascularization up to 25%.\n\n【34】*   **Grade 5**: Laceration, which completely shattered the spleen, and major devascularization.\n\n【35】What Is the Treatment for Splenic Injuries?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【36】*   The initial step in managing splenic injury includes following the trauma's ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation). The assessment of circulation is done by checking the possibility of bleeding in patients with blunt trauma.\n\n【37】*   Injuries in which the bleeding has stopped can be managed without splenectomy (spleen removal). However, there are chances of delayed hemorrhages in such cases.\n\n【38】*   **Nonoperative Treatment of Splenic Injury**: The aim of the treatment of splenic injuries is maximizing salvage therapy. In children, it is the treatment of choice in most cases. Approximately 80 % of cases can be treated by nonoperative technique, but the patient's condition should be hemodynamically stable without any sign of peritonitis.\n\n【39】*   **Operative Management:** The cases of ongoing bleeding or the ones which require more than two units of blood are considered for the operative approach. The conditions which are indications for an operative approach are hemodynamic instability, peritonitis, intra-abdominal injuries associated with the spleen, and pseudoaneurysm formation.\n\n【40】*   **Embolization**: It requires a vascular interventionist and splenic embolization. It is advised in cases of grade 3 or splenic injuries. However, some embolization complications include devascularization of about 25 % of the spleen and recurrence of hemorrhage or abscess.\n\n【41】**Conclusion:**\n\n【42】Splenic injuries are considered one of the most common abdominal injuries, as trauma can easily affect them. Spleen is the most vascularized organ of the body, and the basic symptom of splenic injury is bleeding. The injuries are divided into five grades depending on the intensity of damage caused to the spleen. The causes vary from different types of trauma to surgical accidents. The treatment is necessary because the spleen is an important part of the lymphatic system (which is a part of the immune system).\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>*   Splenic Injury  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441993/\n*   Splenic trauma  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/splenic-trauma\n*   Splenic Injury, Blunt, Selective Nonoperative Management  \n    https://www.east.org/education-career-development/practice-management-guidelines/details/splenic-injury-blunt-selective-nonoperative-management-of\n*   Blunt Splenic Trauma  \n    https://www.aast.org/resources-detail/8764001f-b3b2-425e-89c5-5284d417de1e</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Essential vitamins and minerals that are required in older age groups or need to be included in the diet are vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K. Each of these vitamins has its own importance and role in our body. A few important minerals required by our body are zinc, magnesium, potassium, and calcium. Iron and fluoride are also crucial nutrients that are needed by our bodies in small quantities. So if the diet plan or daily dietary habits are balanced and planned according to the needs, all the essential vitamins and minerals can be derived from the food. Read the article further to know the importance, need, and recommended daily intake of each essential vitamin and mineral in older people.\n\n【2】What Are Dietary Supplements for Older People?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Older age groups in the age range of above 50 years old require more vitamins and minerals as compared to younger people. Different vitamins and minerals that are essential for the body are:\n\n【4】*   **Calcium:** Calcium is one of the essential minerals required by the body for maintaining strong bones. Calcium can be taken from the diet from sources such as milk, curd, and other milk products. Deficiency of calcium in the older age group increases the risk of bone fractures as the bone becomes very brittle due to calcium deficiency. It is seen in both males and females. So calcium, along with vitamin D, is necessary for maintaining bone strength.\n\n【5】*   **Vitamin D:** Vitamin D can be taken from sources such as milk products, green leafy vegetables, and cereals. A deficiency of this vitamin makes the bone brittle because of a lack of nourishment. Older age groups who are deficient in vitamin D are prescribed vitamin D supplements by the doctor.\n\n【6】*   **Vitamin B12 or Cobalamin:** Vitamin B12 is essential for the diet to maintain healthy RBCs (red blood cells) and nerves. Vitamin B12 is mostly available in animal-based foods, so vegetarians usually suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency. In case of vitamin B12 deficiency or in older people who are not able to digest vitamin B12 from a natural food source, the doctor prescribes vitamin B 12 supplements.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Post - Covid Tips for Patients</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) - Types, Stages, Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Testosterone Gel - Uses, Mechanism of Action, Precautions and Side Effects</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【8】*   **Dietary Fibers:** The importance of food rich in dietary fibers in older people is that it reduces the risk of cardiac diseases and diabetes (Type 2 diabetes).\n\n【9】What Are the Recommended Dietary Guidelines for Vitamins and Minerals for Older People?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The recommended dietary guidelines for each vitamin and mineral in both men and women above the age of 50 years are:\n\n【11】1.  **Vitamin B 12:** The recommended daily dose of vitamin B 12 in older patients is around 2.4 micrograms.\n\n【12】2.  **Calcium:** Above the age of 50 years, women are recommended to take 1200 milligrams of calcium daily. A dose of 1000 milligrams of calcium is recommended in men in the age group of 50 to 70 years and 1200 milligrams in people above 70 years of age. Dosing more than 2000 milligrams per day is not advised in old age people.\n\n【13】3.  **Vitamin D:** The average recommended daily dose of vitamin D is around 600 international units in older people in the age group of 50 to 70 years of age. People above 70 years of age are advised to increase the dose of vitamin D to 800 international units. It is not advisable to take more than 4000 international units per day.\n\n【14】4.  **Vitamin B6 or Pyridoxine:** The recommended daily dose of vitamin B6 is 1.7 milligrams per day in older males and 1.5 milligrams per day for older females.\n\n【15】5.  **Vitamin C:** Citrus fruits are important sources of vitamin C. The average daily intake of vitamin C is 75 milligrams per day in older men and 90 milligrams each day in women above the age of 50 years.\n\n【16】6.  **Vitamin E:** The average daily recommended amount of vitamin E is 15 milligrams per day in both older men and women above the age of 50 years.\n\n【17】7.  **Vitamin K:** 120 micrograms and 90 micrograms of vitamin K are recommended daily intake of vitamin K in older males and females respectively.\n\n【18】8.  **Magnesium:** 420 and 320 milligrams per day of magnesium intake is recommended in females and males above 50 years of age, respectively.\n\n【19】9.  **Potassium:** 3400 milligrams per day for men and 2600 milligrams per day for women are recommended potassium levels.\n\n【20】10.  **Folate**: 400 micrograms per day of folate intake is recommended in both older males and females.\n\n【21】11.  **Sodium**: Older age people should consume less sodium and reduce their sodium intake to 2300 milligrams per day with increasing age. Excess sodium in the diet increases the risk of hypertension, cardiac stroke, and heart attacks. Older people who are already hypertensive can reduce their sodium consumption further to 1500 milligrams per day.\n\n【22】Hypertensive people should avoid processed foods as they have a high amount of salt and try to add fresh fruits and vegetables to their diet.\n\n【23】Are Taking Dietary Supplements Safe in Older People?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Many people are not able to fulfill their body's needs for adequate vitamins and minerals from their regular diet. In those people, after recognizing the nutritional deficiencies, the doctor recommends starting with dietary supplements to fulfill the body's needs for that specific missing nutrients. It is advisable not to start taking any nutritional supplements without the doctor's consent.\n\n【25】After the complete health check-up with the doctors and the diagnosis of the cause of nutritional deficiency only, it is recommended to start with a dietary supplement in the doses and schedule as prescribed by the doctor.\n\n【26】**Conclusion:**\n\n【27】Essential vitamins and minerals are crucial for the survival of individuals of all age groups. However, the daily dietary intake of essential vitamins and minerals increases with age for maintaining a healthy body and improving the overall body's immune functions. A balanced diet with all essential nutrition in older people prevents the risk of developing systemic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases.

A complement system is a group of proteins that work together to help the body fight infections and remove damaged cells. When a component of the complement system is missing or not functioning properly, the system becomes less effective, leading to increased susceptibility to infections and a higher risk of autoimmune diseases.\n\n【2】**What Are the Types of Primary Deficiencies of Complement Components?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】There are several types of primary deficiencies of complement components, each resulting from a deficiency in a specific system component. Some of the most commonly recognized primary deficiencies are:\n\n【4】*   **C1q Deficiency:** This is a rare form of primary complement deficiency and results from a deficiency in the component C1q. People with C1q deficiency have an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases and frequent infections.\n\n【5】*   **C2 Deficiency:** This deficiency type is characterized by a reduced complement component C2. People with C2 deficiency have an increased risk of infections and autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus erythematosus.\n\n【6】*   **C3 Deficiency:** This is a common form of primary complement deficiency and results from a reduction in the level of the complement component C3. People with C3 deficiency have a higher risk of recurrent infections, particularly of the respiratory and urinary tracts.\n\n【7】*   **C4 Deficiency:** This type of deficiency results from a reduction in the level of the complement component C4. People with C4 deficiency have an increased risk of recurrent infections and are at higher risk for developing autoimmune diseases, mainly systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【8】*   **Factor H Deficiency:** This type of deficiency results from a reduction in the level of the complement component Factor H. People with Factor H deficiency have an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases and recurrent infections, particularly those affecting the kidneys.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Epigenetic Therapy - An Overview</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Cherry-Red Spot - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Acanthocytosis- Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【10】**What Are the Causes of Primary Deficiencies of Complement Components?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Primary deficiencies of complement components occur when a genetic mutation affects the production or function of one or more components of the complement system. This can lead to a reduction or absence of the affected component, which can result in a decreased ability of the complement system to fight infections and remove damaged cells. These mutations can occur spontaneously or be passed down from a person's parents through heredity.\n\n【12】**What Are the Symptoms of Primary Deficiencies of Complement Components?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Primary deficiencies of complement components can lead to a wide range of symptoms, depending on the severity and specific deficiency type. Some of the most common symptoms include:\n\n【14】*   **Recurrent Infections:** People with primary complement deficiencies are at increased risk for recurrent infections, particularly of the respiratory and urinary tracts. These infections can range from mild to severe and occur more frequently than in people without complement deficiencies.\n\n【15】*   **Autoimmune Diseases:** Primary complement deficiencies can increase the risk of developing autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune glomerulonephritis. These diseases occur when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.\n\n【16】*   **Inflammation:** Complement deficiencies can lead to chronic inflammation, which can cause joint pain and swelling, skin rashes, and other symptoms.\n\n【17】*   **Hemolytic Anemia:** Some complement deficiencies can lead to the destruction of red blood cells, causing a condition called hemolytic anemia.\n\n【18】*   **Kidney Problems:** Complement deficiencies can increase the risk of kidney problems, including glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and kidney failure.\n\n【19】*   **Neuropsychiatric Symptoms:** In some cases, complement deficiencies can also lead to neuropsychiatric symptoms, including memory problems, difficulty concentrating, and depression.\n\n【20】*   **Other Symptoms:** Some people with complement deficiencies may experience additional symptoms, such as low energy, fever, and weight loss.\n\n【21】**What Are the Diagnosis Methods of Primary Deficiencies of Complement Components?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Diagnosis of primary deficiencies of complement components typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory testing. Some of the tests commonly used to diagnose complement deficiencies include:\n\n【23】*   **Complement Component Levels:** Blood tests can measure the levels of various complement components, including C1q, C2, C3, C4, and Factor H. Low levels of a specific component can indicate a deficiency.\n\n【24】*   **Functional Testing:** Certain complement components, such as C3 and Factor H, can be tested for their ability to function properly. This type of testing can help determine the cause of a complement deficiency.\n\n【25】*   **Genetic Testing:** Genetic testing can be used to identify mutations in the genes that code for the production of complement components. This type of testing can confirm a diagnosis of primary complement deficiency and help predict the risk of passing the condition on to future generations.\n\n【26】*   **Clinical Evaluation:** A thorough medical history and physical examination can provide important information about a person's symptoms and overall health. This information can help the healthcare provider diagnose a complement deficiency and determine the best course of treatment.\n\n【27】**What Is the Treatment of Primary Deficiencies of Complement Components?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Treatment for primary deficiencies of complement components depends on the specific type of deficiency and the severity of the symptoms. Some of the most common treatments include:\n\n【29】*   **Antibiotics****:** People with recurrent infections may benefit from antibiotics to help prevent or treat these infections. Antibiotics can help to reduce the risk of further infections and prevent the spread of infections to other parts of the body.\n\n【30】*   **Immune Globulin Therapy**: Immune globulin therapy involves receiving injections of immune globulin, which can help boost the body's immune system. This therapy often treats people with complement deficiencies with recurrent infections or autoimmune diseases.\n\n【31】*   **Plasma Exchange:** Plasma exchange, also known as plasmapheresis, is a procedure in which the plasma in a person's blood is removed and replaced with plasma from a healthy donor. This procedure can help remove harmful substances from the blood and restore normal levels of complement components.\n\n【32】*   **Stem Cell Transplant:** In severe cases, a stem cell transplant may be necessary to correct a primary complement deficiency. This procedure involves transplanting healthy stem cells from a donor into a person with the deficiency. The stem cells then grow into new cells, including immune cells, that can help restore normal levels of complement components.\n\n【33】*   **Medications:** Certain medications, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, may be prescribed to help control inflammation and reduce the risk of autoimmune diseases.\n\n【34】**What Are the Complications of Primary Deficiencies of Complement Components?**\n\n【35】Primary deficiencies of complement components can lead to several serious health complications, including\n\n【36】*   **Meningococcal Disease****:** Meningococcal is a serious bacterial infection that can lead to meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord) and sepsis (a potentially life-threatening infection that spreads throughout the body). People with complement deficiencies are at increased risk of meningococcal disease.\n\n【37】*   **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC):** DIC is a condition where blood clots form throughout the body, leading to blockages in the blood vessels. This can cause serious health problems, including organ damage and death. People with complement deficiencies are at an increased risk of DIC.\n\n【38】*   **Chronic Kidney Disease:** Chronic kidney disease can occur due to recurrent infections and autoimmune diseases associated with complement deficiencies. This can lead to a decline in kidney function and end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\n【39】**Conclusion:**\n\n【40】Primary deficiencies of complement components are inherited disorders that can result in a reduction in the effectiveness of the complement system. This can increase susceptibility to infections and a higher risk of autoimmune diseases. A complement deficiency's specific symptoms and severity can vary widely from person to person. Different tests can help identify the specific type of complement deficiency and determine the best course of treatment. It is important to work with a healthcare provider experienced in diagnosing and treating complement deficiencies to ensure an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential for managing these conditions and reducing the risk of associated complications.\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>*   Complement Deficiency  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557581/\n*   \\[Pathophysiology of systemic lupus erythematosus\\]  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17449371/\n*   Complement Deficiencies  \n    https://primaryimmune.org/about-primary-immunodeficiencies/specific-disease-types/complement-deficiencies/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It often starts in infancy, and as the individual grows, symptoms may worsen. It is a multisystem disorder, and it can also affect the nervous system, cause vision problems, tooth decay, bone abnormalities, hearing loss, and difficulty in learning. The affected individuals find it very difficult to lead a normal life. It mainly occurs due to mutations in the genes.\n\n【2】Depending on the severity and age of onset, Cockayne syndrome is classified into three types, out of which type II is the most severe. In severe cases of Cockayne syndrome, extreme sensitivity to light is observed; even mild exposure to sunlight can cause severe blisters in affected individuals.\n\n【3】According to studies, there are one to two cases in the million population. There is no proper treatment available for this condition yet. The primary treatment protocol involves supportive measures. The prognosis of this condition depends on the severity of the disease. The life expectancy is not above 50 years in this condition.\n\n【4】How Is Cockayne Syndrome Classified?\n------------------------------------\n\n【5】Cockayne Syndrome is classified mainly on the age of onset and disease severity. This classification also determines the life span of the affected individuals. The three types of Cockayne syndrome are:\n\n【6】Type I – This is the moderate or classic form of Cockayne syndrome. It is usually present in early childhood, around one to two years. The symptoms appear after the intrauterine growth and development. After the onset of the disease, the growth is very slow.\n\n【7】Type 2 – This is the most severe form of Cockayne syndrome. It is also known as cerebro-oculo-facial-skeletal syndrome. This form is present at birth, and it can affect intrauterine growth and development. Brain development does not happen in this form.\n\n【8】Type 3 – It is the milder form of Cockayne syndrome. Considerable growth and mental development can occur in this case. The symptoms start appearing only after two years of age. As the individual grows, symptoms may worsen.\n\n【9】What Are the Clinical Features of Cockayne Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The severity of symptoms varies in each type of Cockayne syndrome. The main clinical features include:\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>Mole or Melanoma: When to Worry?</u>\n\n【14】Link Between Skin Disorders and Psychology\n\n【15】The Pupil of Our Eye and Problems Related to Its Size\n\n【16】*   Photosensitivity – In some cases, sunburn can occur even with mild sunlight exposure.\n\n【17】*   Microcephaly – The size of the head is very small.\n\n【18】*   Delay in growth.\n\n【19】*   Short stature.\n\n【20】*   Kyphosis (hunch back).\n\n【21】*   Thin nose and large ears.\n\n【22】*   Minimal weight gain due to loss of subcutaneous tissue.\n\n【23】*   Vision impairment.\n\n【24】*   Hearing loss.\n\n【25】*   Dental problems.\n\n【26】*   Wrinkling of the skin due to premature greying.\n\n【27】*   Muscle wasting.\n\n【28】*   Abnormal gait.\n\n【29】*   Lack of coordination.\n\n【30】*   Abnormal speech.\n\n【31】*   Mental retardation.\n\n【32】*   Hormonal issues.\n\n【33】*   Kidney problems.\n\n【34】*   Decreased sweating.\n\n【35】*   Cataracts.\n\n【36】*   Facial rashes.\n\n【37】*   Hair anomalies.\n\n【38】*   Brittle nails.\n\n【39】The severity of the above-mentioned clinical features is extreme in type II Cockayne syndrome. Severe neurological issues may lead to seizures, lack of urination control, etc. in this type. There will be growth failure at birth in type II Cockayne syndrome.\n\n【40】What Is the Etiology of Cockayne Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【41】It is an autosomal recessive disorder (the disorder that occurs due to an unhealthy gene's expression). It is mainly due to the mutations in the gene. Due to mutations in DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the cells become sensitive to light. There can also be decreased DNA and RNA (ribonucleic acid) synthesis. All these factors gradually contribute to the symptoms presented by the Cockayne syndrome.\n\n【42】What Is the Prognosis of Cockayne Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【43】Prognosis varies depending on the type of Cockayne syndrome. In type I, the life expectancy is approximately 10 years to 20 years approximately. In type II, the lifespan is up to seven years. Type III is the least severe form, and the affected individuals can have a lifespan of 40 years to 50 years. There is a slow progression of diseases in type III.\n\n【44】What Are the Complications of Cockayne Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】The complications of Cockayne syndrome include an increase in blood pressure (hypertension), skin cancer, dental problems, kidney problems, cardiac problems like atherosclerosis in younger age, gastroesophageal reflux in babies causing difficulty in feeding, lack of control over urination, difficulty in walking, difficulty in processing thoughts, and lack of learning skills. The affected individuals have a life-threatening reaction to Metronidazole. It can cause liver failure in affected individuals. So the use of Metronidazole is contradictory in these patients.\n\n【46】How Is Cockayne Syndrome Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【47】By clinical examination, most of the features of Cockayne syndrome can be identified. It can be confirmed with genetic testing. Prenatal diagnosis can also be made if suspected. Laboratory studies like skeletal radiography, endocrinologic tests, etc. can help exclude other diseases similar to this. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be done for the disease's neurological problems.\n\n【48】What Are the Differential Diagnoses of Cockayne Syndrome?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】Most of the mitochondrial diseases that exhibit clinical features of Cockayne syndrome can be the differential diagnoses of Cockayne syndrome. These include UV (ultraviolet) sensitive syndrome, Werner syndrome, Bloom syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum, etc.\n\n【50】What Is the Treatment for Cockayne Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【51】There is no treatment for Cockayne syndrome. The main aim in providing treatment for the patients includes reducing the severity of the disease and managing the complications.\n\n【52】Some general measures have to be taken by the patients. These include eating nutritious food, sun protection, using sunscreen while going out, and physiotherapy. Metronidazole should be avoided in these patients.\n\n【53】For the visual problems, affected individuals must take the help of experts. Cochlear implantation can be done to minimize auditory impairment. For all the complications, treatment is given under the guidance of experts like neurologists, dentists, ophthalmologists, etc. however, only symptomatic treatment can be given, and there is no cure for this condition.\n\n【54】**Conclusion:**\n\n【55】Cockayne syndrome is a life-threatening condition. It is challenging to survive this disease. By taking proper measures, at least the severity of the disease can be controlled. Parents of the affected children should be well aware of the precautions that need to be followed.\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>*   Cockayne syndrome  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/cockayne-syndrome\n*   Cockayne Syndrome  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/cockayne-syndrome/\n*   Cockayne syndrome  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/cockayne-syndrome/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These are often diagnosed in childhood but may also be found in adults. Esophageal cysts can be asymptomatic or present with symptoms such as dysphagia, respiratory distress, and chest pain. Esophageal cysts were first described by Blasius in 1711. The cause of these cysts is not clearly known. Esophageal cysts are rare malformations as their incidence is estimated to be one in 8200 live births. About 80 % of esophageal cysts are diagnosed in childhood. If the esophageal cyst is excised entirely, the recurrence is rare but has been reported, and morbidity is low.\n\n【2】What Are Esophageal Cysts?\n--------------------------\n\n【3】Esophageal cysts are rare congenital abnormal growth originating in the esophagus. These cysts are often diagnosed in childhood but are also seen in adults. The etiology of esophageal cysts is clearly not known. The development of esophageal cysts is believed to be a result of the failure of vacuolization and budding of the primitive esophagus between weeks four to eight of gestation. Esophageal cysts are more common on the right lateral aspect of the esophagus. In 1881, Roth divided esophageal cysts into two categories:\n\n【4】*   Simple-epithelial lined cysts.\n\n【5】*   Esophageal duplication cysts.\n\n【6】Esophageal duplication cysts have a double layer of smooth muscle surrounding them and are either attached or located within the esophageal wall.\n\n【7】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Esophageal Cysts?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Esophageal cysts are asymptomatic in many children. The signs and symptoms usually seen in adults are:\n\n【9】*   Chest pain (fullness or tightness).\n\n【10】*   Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).\n\n【11】*   Respiratory distress.\n\n【12】*   Failure to thrive.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Fetal MRI - Indications, Procedure, and Contraindications</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Mediastinal Tumors - Causes, Types, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Early Assessment of Acute Abdomen</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Vomiting.\n\n【14】*   Hematemesis (vomiting blood) when there is a presence of ectopic gastric epithelium.\n    </u>\n\n【15】What Are the Criteria for the Classification of Esophageal Cysts?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】*   The esophageal cyst is within the esophageal wall or attached to the wall.\n\n【17】*   The lining of the cyst is the squamous, cuboidal, columnar, pseudostratified, or ciliated epithelium.\n\n【18】*   The two muscle layers cover the cyst.\n\n【19】How to Diagnose Esophageal Cysts?\n---------------------------------\n\n【20】The diagnosis of esophageal cysts is made through history, physical examination, specific histopathologic characteristics, and imaging or diagnostic procedures.\n\n【21】*   **Chest X-Rays** - This test uses a small dose of radiation to create black-and-white images of the chest. They reveal a cyst within the mediastinum.\n\n【22】*   **Barium Swallow Studies** - It is an imaging test in which the patient swallows a chalky substance called barium, and it looks distinct on an X-ray. It reveals compression of the esophagus without ulceration.\n\n【23】*   **CT (Computed Tomography) Scan** - This scan reveals a fluid-filled cystic structure arising from the esophagus.\n\n【24】*   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Scan** - This scan also helps in the diagnosis of esophageal cysts by showing further anatomic details.\n\n【25】*   **Endoscopic Ultrasound** \\- It is a test that uses sound waves to generate images of the gastrointestinal tract and nearby tissues. It is the choice of the diagnostic test to evaluate the esophageal cysts. It reveals a cystic-filled structure originating from the esophagus.\n\n【26】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Esophageal Cysts?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】*   **Bronchogenic Cysts** - These are the congenital abnormal growths of tissue that form in the area of the chest cavity that separates the lungs (mediastinum).\n\n【28】*   **Lipoma** - A lipoma is a slow-growing, round, or oval-shaped fatty lump of tissue that grows between the skin and the underlying muscle layer.\n\n【29】*   **Neurenteric Cysts** - These are the rare benign endodermal growth of the central nervous system, most frequently occurring in the spinal cord.\n\n【30】*   **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst** \\- A thyroglossal duct cysts are a rare type of cyst or lump filled with fluid that develops in the neck or near the thyroid glands.\n\n【31】*   **Cervical Duplication Cyst** - These are rare congenital anomalies and are causes of upper airway obstruction.\n\n【32】*   **Lymphangioma** - These are benign fluid-filled cysts of the lymphatic system often formed in children in the head and neck region.\n\n【33】*   **Anterior Meningocele** - These are congenital defects characterized as small moist cyst that protrudes through the gap in the anterior aspect of the spine.\n\n【34】*   **Pericardial Cyst** - It is a benign congenital anomaly characterized by abnormal growths in the pericardium, which is the fluid-filled sac surrounding the heart.\n\n【35】*   **Hemangioma** - It is a common bright red birthmark made up of extra blood vessels in the skin.\n\n【36】What Are the Treatment Options for Esophageal Cysts?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】*   All esophageal cysts should be assessed and eventually resected surgically, except in those situations where the patient's medical conditions do not allow for surgery. Surgical removal of the esophageal cyst is the choice of treatment in most symptomatic cases. Medical therapy has no role in the treatment of esophageal cysts.\n\n【38】*   The preferred mode of treatment for simple cysts is enucleation, and for duplications, it is excision. The minimally invasive operative techniques for the removal of esophageal cysts have less morbidity and mortality rates. Endoscopic treatment has proven to be a reasonable and feasible alternative.\n\n【39】*   Traditionally, posterolateral thoracoscopic surgery was performed for the removal of the cyst. Currently, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is used to enucleate cysts and resect duplications. Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery is also used for the surgical removal of the esophageal cyst.\n\n【40】*   Another option for the excision of the cyst is endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection (ESTD), which is less invasive. Laparoscopic resection is a common method for the removal of esophageal cysts that are continuous with the mediastinum and abdominal cavity.\n\n【41】*   In cases of esophageal cysts being asymptomatic, there are no clear guidelines on whether the treatment is needed or not. Surgery can be an option to avoid cases of perforation, ulceration, and rare instances of malignancy.\n\n【42】What Are the Complications of Esophageal Cysts?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【43】The overall complication rate of esophageal cysts is very less. The complications that may develop include:\n\n【44】*   Heartburn.\n\n【45】*   Reflux esophagitis (inflammation of esophageal mucosa that occurs secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease).\n\n【46】*   Rupture of the esophagus.\n\n【47】*   Obstruction in the esophagus.\n\n【48】*   Hemorrhage.\n\n【49】*   Wound infection.\n\n【50】*   Pneumonia (an infection causing the inflammation of the air sacs of one or both lungs).\n\n【51】*   Malignancy (cancerous abnormal growth of the cells).\n\n【52】*   Deep venous thrombosis (blood clot formation in the deep veins of the body, often in the legs).\n\n【53】*   Vagus nerve paralysis (paralysis of the tenth cranial nerve known as vagus).\n\n【54】*   Esophageal leak (the contents of the esophagus pass into the surrounding area) or pseudodiverticulum (outpouching of the mucosa of the esophagus).\n\n【55】*   Persistent air leak.\n\n【56】**Conclusion:**\n\n【57】Esophageal cysts, after treatment with full surgical enucleation or excision, have a good prognosis. Overall, most patients do well in both the short-term and long-term. Patients and family members should be educated about recognizing the symptoms associated with esophageal cysts. Patients should also be educated about the possible complications if undergoing surgical intervention, as patient education is paramount.\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n无关删除-1:<u>*   Esophageal Cyst - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549813/\n*   Esophageal Cysts: Practice Essentials, Anatomy, Pathophysiology  \n    https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/426589-overview\n*   Esophageal duplication cyst | Radiology Reference Article | Radiopaedia.org  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oesophageal-duplication-cyst</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Acute AC joint injury is sometimes called a sprain or \"separated\" shoulder and can be diagnosed with swelling, focal tenderness, and deformity. Diagnosing AC joint disorders due to overuse, inflammation, or chronic degeneration may be more difficult, especially if the patient has concomitant shoulder problems.\n\n【2】A separated shoulder occurs due to the tearing of the ligaments between the collarbone, known as the clavicle, and a section of the shoulder blade called an acromion. This tear causes the mutual connection between the collarbone and shoulder blade to loosen. Thus, they either get separated or dislocated from each other. This type of injury does not usually cause damage to the main ball-and-socket joint of the shoulder. Any individual can get affected by this condition. There is no difference based on age, physical health, ethnic background, or fitness level.\n\n【3】How Is It Caused?\n-----------------\n\n【4】The prevalence of AC joint pain has been reported to be between 0.5 to 2.9 per 1000 people per year. The most common cause of pain or swelling is an injury from catching oneself on an outstretched arm. Most cases reported with shoulder separation are because of a direct fall onto the shoulder with enough force, which can tear the ligaments. These injuries are more commonly observed in young people as they are frequently associated with collision sports like football, hockey, etc.\n\n【5】Various other causes of injury to the joint are as follows:\n\n【6】*   Car accidents.\n\n【7】*   Falling from a bicycle.\n\n【8】*   Repeatedly lifting objects above the head level with poor mechanics or ergonomics.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I have pain and crunching sound in the shoulder due to injury.

This can lead to the lifting of the top end of the collarbone.\n\n【15】How Can It Be Diagnosed?\n------------------------\n\n【16】When you visit your physician, you will be asked about your personal history, family history, medical history, and the signs and symptoms you are experiencing. Following this, a physical examination will focus on the affected shoulder. Your doctor may ask you to undergo various tests to confirm the diagnosis and decide on the treatment plan, which includes X-rays, ultrasounds, and MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging). Also, the patient may be instructed to hold a weight in hand while performing these tests to visualize the injury more clearly in the images.\n\n【17】After all these examinations and tests, the doctor can diagnose the severity of the shoulder separation using a scale called the Rockwood classification of AC joint injuries. This scale ranges from type I to VI injuries from \"injury limited to an AC ligament sprain; joint still in place to severe ligament detachment and joint dislocation injuries,\" respectively. This staging helps in accurate diagnosis and treatment plan, including guiding the patient about the time taken for treatment and prognosis.\n\n【18】How Can It Be Treated?\n----------------------\n\n【19】Most people will recover from this condition within two to 12 weeks without surgery.\n\n【20】**Non-surgical Treatments**: The various non-surgical treatments which can be done on these patients are as the following:\n\n【21】*   A sling can keep the shoulder in place during the healing period.\n\n【22】*   Ice packs and medicated drugs like Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Naproxen, or Acetaminophen can be used to reduce pain.\n\n【23】*   Strengthening the muscles and ligaments of the shoulder can be done with the help of physical therapy or an exercise session after the healing period. Getting the physician's consent before initiating a rehabilitation program is important.\n\n【24】*   The patient should avoid lifting heavy objects for eight to 12 weeks after healing the injury.\n\n【25】**Surgical Treatments**: Surgery may be indicated in more serious cases like type IV, V, or VI injuries on the Rockwood scale or after the non-surgical treatments have not shown improvement. The symptoms of more serious injuries include when the fingers become cold or numb, weakened arm muscles, or severe shoulder deformity.\n\n【26】The surgical treatments that can be considered are as the following:\n\n【27】*   Shaving the end of the collarbone. This will help in preventing it from rubbing against the shoulder blade.\n\n【28】*   Reattachment of torn ligaments to the underside of the collarbone.\n\n【29】What Are The Complications Associated With This Condition?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】Although most people recover and regain the complete function of the injured shoulder, some people may experience a bump or other deformity. They can also have continuous pain, even in cases with mild shoulder separation. This can be due to the rubbing of bones against each other, arthritis, or damage to the cartilage, which acts as a cushion between the bones of the shoulder joint. You should consult your physician or specialist if you have recurring signs and symptoms or face any of the mentioned complications.\n\n【31】How Can It Be Prevented?\n------------------------\n\n【32】There is no sure way to prevent shoulder separation. However, being aware of the factors that can cause shoulder separation can help prevent it.\n\n【33】These factors have been mentioned below:\n\n【34】*   Old age.\n\n【35】*   Repetitive motions of the shoulder.\n\n【36】*   Manual labor causes more force on the shoulders.\n\n【37】*   Accidents\n\n【38】*   Falls.\n\n【39】*   Overuse or straining of the shoulders, especially in older adults.\n\n【40】*   Participation in collision sports.\n\n【41】**Conclusion:**\n\n【42】Acromioclavicular (AC) joint disorder, which is more common in sports players, is the separation of shoulders. It can be managed conservatively and surgically, depending on the severity of the condition. Most cases heal with conservative management. The prognosis is good in most cases. Early management can assist in preventing any complications. The state is mainly associated with sports injuries, accidents, or falls, and proper rest and physiotherapy can help improve healing.\n\n【43】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【44】* * *\n\n【45】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is an Illness of the Acromioclavicular Joint?**\n\n【46】Acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis (inflammation or swelling of one or more joints), also known as AC joint arthrosis, is most common in middle-aged persons. It appears when the AC joint's cartilage begins to wear down. Usually, this illness causes discomfort that restricts arm movements. Primary degenerative, inflammatory, posttraumatic, and septic arthritis are some of the pathologic mechanisms that can cause this illness, which is the most prevalent of the acromioclavicular joint. The clinical picture is further complicated by the patients' frequent nonspecific complaints of neck, shoulder, and arm discomfort.\n\n【47】#### **2.**删除换行**Is Degeneration of the Acromioclavicular (AC) Joint Similar to Arthritis?**\n\n【48】Yes, degeneration of the acromioclavicular joint is the most similar kind of arthritis. Anterior or superior shoulder discomfort is frequently brought on by the degeneration of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint, especially during overhead and cross-body exercises. The fibrocartilaginous disc that cushions the joints most frequently degenerates in middle-aged people, which is when this most frequently happens. Traumatic injuries or arthritis are the two main causes of AC joint discomfort. Several disorders, collectively known as arthritis, lead to joint deterioration and inflammation.\n\n【49】#### **3.**删除换行**Can an Acromioclavicular (AC) Joint Heal Without Surgery?**\n\n【50】About 50 percent of patients will heal completely without surgery, and they can resume their sporting activities more quickly than if they underwent surgical repair. About 25 percent of individuals may experience acceptable but prolonged, low-grade symptoms that could impair job or athletic performance. Treatment options for Grade-III serious injuries include both non-operative and surgical methods. A course of physiotherapy is administered after two to three weeks of immobilization in a splint as part of non-operative treatment.\n\n【51】#### **4.**删除换行**How Is an Acromioclavicular (AC) Joint in the Shoulder Fixed?**\n\n【52】Typically, reconstructive shoulder surgery will last two hours. The collarbone could need to be moved in the AC joint, and torn ligaments need to be stitched together. Normally, general anesthesia is administered; however, certain patients may also have an interscalene block (to do surgery on the upper arm, shoulder, or neck, the brachial plexus is anesthetized at the level of the nerve roots), a regional anesthetic administered above the collarbone. Over the bony protrusion on the top of the shoulder, there is a two-inch incision created. Sutures are used to repair torn ligaments that surround the acromioclavicular joint. The ligaments can be stitched back into place to help retain the collarbone in place and tighten the shoulder. The collarbone may need to be held in place while the ligaments repair using a screw or strong sutures. After the wound is stitched up, patients are sent to the recovery area.\n\n【53】#### **5.**删除换行**Can Acromioclavicular (AC) Joint Ever Recover?**\n\n【54】After a type I acromioclavicular joint injury, most persons may resume their regular activities in three to two weeks. Overhand athletes could need two to three weeks to go back to the full exercise. It can take four to six weeks to recover fully. Type I wounds often recover fully without a higher risk of re-injury. Compared to type I, Type II injuries typically result in more pain and swelling. The first course of therapy may consist of rest, ice, painkillers, and three to seven days of splint immobilization of the shoulder. Stretching and range-of-motion exercises can be started as soon as they are bearable.\n\n【55】#### **6.**删除换行**Why Is the Joint Acromioclavicular (AC) Not Healing?**\n\n【56】The shoulder joint has probably been injured in addition to the AC joint, which is the most likely cause of a poor recovery. This is a relatively frequent issue, and an orthopedic appointment is necessary if shoulder pain lasts more than a few weeks to assess the likelihood of other injuries. Most patients with AC joint injuries may feel better a few days or a week after the incident, but the AC ligaments may not entirely recover for at least six weeks.\n\n【57】#### **7.**删除换行**What Medicines Are Effective for Acromioclavicular Joint Pain?**\n\n【58】The following drugs can treat acromioclavicular osteoarthritis symptoms and reduce their development:   \n\\- Oral painkillers like Acetaminophen, the main component in Tylenol, and other painkillers have few adverse effects and are effective at reducing pain.  \n\\- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications are taken orally (NSAIDs).   \n\\- Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Naproxen, or COX-2 inhibitors are anti-inflammatory drugs that may lessen discomfort, swelling, and inflammation brought on by osteoarthritis of the AC joint.   \n\\- Creams and lotions. Topical treatments are administered directly to the skin over the affected joint and come in creams, sprays, gels, and patches. Topical drugs come in wide different varieties.\n\n【59】#### **8.**删除换行**Is Acromioclavicular (AC) Joints Similar to Rotator Cuffs?**\n\n【60】No, the AC joint is not similar to rotator cuffs. Because the upper arm bone's head is covered by the rotator cuff, which also connects it to the shoulder blade, the acromion and clavicle, which comprise a component of the scapula, meet at the AC joint. Tough connective tissues function as tethers to hold the bones in place.\n\n【61】#### **9.**删除换行**Does Physical Therapy Help With Arthritis of The Acromioclavicular (AC) Joint?**\n\n【62】Physical therapists can treat mild cases. Physical treatment may be followed by surgery in more severe situations. Because the joint is repeatedly under too much stress, AC joint damage from strain develops over time. The extent of the AC joint damage determines how long one will need physical treatment. Type I and Type II wounds could take two to three weeks to heal completely. Physical therapy might take eight to twelve weeks if surgery is required to fix the AC joint separation.\n\n【63】#### **10.**删除换行**What Can Heal An Acromioclavicular (AC) Joint Quickly?**\n\n【64】\\- Rest will benefit the healing of the shoulder.   \n\\- Using a splint is possible to protect the shoulder and keep the joint in an ideal healing posture.   \n\\- Cold packs can be applied to ease pain and reduce swelling.   \n\\- One can use either over-the-counter or prescription painkillers. One can work both arms and shoulders exercises.\n\n【65】#### **11.**删除换行**How Can Acromioclavicular (AC) Joints Loosen?**\n\n【66】Dislocation of the clavicle from the acromion causes an AC joint separation, often known as a shoulder separation. This injury is frequently brought on by a hit to the shoulder or a fall in which the person lands squarely on their arm or shoulder. Contact sports like football and hockey are the most frequent causes of AC joint separations. An acromioclavicular joint injury's severity determines which supporting tissues are damaged and how badly. When the coracoclavicular ligaments are torn, the entire shoulder joint is affected, making a dislocation more difficult. Tearing of the acromioclavicular ligament alone is rarely a major injury.\n\n【67】#### **12.**删除换行**How Should An Acromioclavicular (AC) Joint Be Massaged?**\n\n【68】Although it comes after the osteopath's role, massage is essential to the procedure. Massage can relieve discomfort, reduce swelling, and condition the muscles around the incision once the shoulder has been reset or determined to have no dislocation. The muscles would extend with deep tissue massage, increasing the instability of the joint. A superficial massage might be utilized to lessen the swelling's inflammatory effects. Ask the doctor to recommend a physiotherapist.\n\n【69】#### **13.**删除换行**How Severe Is an Acromioclavicular (AC) Joint Sprain?**\n\n【70】An AC joint sprain can range in severity from a minor injury grade one to a serious injury grade six. The AC ligament is exclusively sprained in type I damage, whereas it is ripped in type II injury. The AC and Coracoclavicular ligament (CC) are ruptured in type III, although the distal clavicle is only partially displaced. In type IV, the distal clavicle is displaced posteriorly, and both ligaments are ruptured. Extreme instability of the AC joint is caused by Type V damage, which involves tearing the AC and CC ligaments and the origin and insertion of the deltoid and trapezius muscles. The distal clavicle's inferior displacement into the subcoracoid position leads to type VI injuries.\n\n【71】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【72】无关删除-1:<u>*   UPMC Acromioclavicular (AC) Joint Injury  \n    https://www.upmc.com/services/sports-medicine/conditions/acromioclavicular-joint-injury\n*   NCBI Acromioclavicular Joint Disorders  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9565953/\n*   John Hopkins AC Joint Disorders  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/ac-joint-problems</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The syndrome was first described by Kluver and Bucy, who described it as a neurobehavioral syndrome in rhesus monkeys.\n\n【2】The syndrome affects males and females equally. The disease is usually associated with herpes simplex encephalitis, head trauma, degenerative brain disorders like Pick’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease or cerebral-vascular diseases, and brain tumors. It is characterized by increased appetite, hypersexuality, hypermetamorphosis, memory disorders, visual agnosia, stagnancy, aphasia, bulimia, polyuria, and polydipsia. It is also known as bilateral temporal lobe disorder or post-encephalitic Kluver-Bucy syndrome.\n\n【3】What Causes Kluver-Bucy Syndrome?\n---------------------------------\n\n【4】Kluver-Bucy syndrome, in its complete adaptation, seldom occurs in humans. However, partial infliction or presentation of this syndrome is caused by massive bilateral temporal damage attributable to the following:\n\n【5】*   Herpes simplex encephalitis.\n\n【6】*   Head trauma.\n\n【7】*   Subarachnoid hemorrhage, epilepsy.\n\n【8】*   Bilateral thalamic infarct.\n\n【9】*   Bilaterally temporal lobe resection.\n\n【10】*   Glioblastoma.\n\n【11】*   Shigellosis.\n\n【12】*   Pick disease.\n\n【13】*   Adrenoleukodystrophy.\n\n【14】*   Hypoglycemia.\n\n【15】*   Reye syndrome.\n\n【16】*   Alzheimer's disease.\n\n【17】*   Porphyrinuria.\n\n【18】*   Anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.\n\n【19】*   Neurocysticercosis.\n\n【20】*   Tuberculosis meningitis.\n\n【21】*   Arachnoid cyst.\n\n【22】*   Huntington chorea.\n\n【23】*   Parkinson's disease.\n\n【24】*   Systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【25】*   Carbon monoxide intoxication.\n\n【26】*   Leukoencephalopathy is associated with methotrexate, radiation, and stroke.\n\n【27】The symptoms are mainly due to\n\n【28】*   Destruction of the temporal neocortex or the amygdala bilaterally.\n\n【29】*   Disturbances in the temporal portions of limbic networks that connect with multiple cortical and subcortical circuits to modulate emotional behavior and affect.\n\n【30】*   Injuries include the amygdala, uncus, hippocampus, orbitofrontal and cingulate gyri, and insular cortex.\n\n【31】What Are the Risk Factors of Kluver Bucy Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】The risk factors of Kluver Bucy syndrome include\n\n【33】*   Epilepsy.\n\n【34】*   Cerebrovascular Disease.\n\n【35】*   Alzheimer's Disease.\n\n【36】*   Pick's a disease or frontotemporal dementia.\n\n【37】*   Stroke.\n\n【38】*   Head injury or trauma.\n\n【39】*   Herpes simplex encephalitis.\n\n【40】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Kluver Bucy Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Individuals with Kluver-Bucy syndrome display the following behavioral manifestations:\n\n【42】*   **Visual Agnosia** \\- Inability to identify familial persons or objects.\n\n【43】*   **Hypermetamorphosis** - It is excessive attention to visual stimuli with a tendency to touch every perceived stimulus.\n\n【44】*   **Oral Tendency or Hyperorality** \\- It is a strong urge to bring objects to the mouth.\n\n【45】*   **Placidity** - It is a diminution or loss of anger and fear responses, blunted affect, and obedience.\n\n【46】*   Acts of licking and touching are unacceptable for public display.\n\n【47】*   Demonstrating an excessive desire to engage in human sexual practices or hypersexuality.\n\n【48】*   Engagement in binge-eating excessive, uncontrollable overeating with feelings of guilt and depression afterward or bulimia.\n\n【49】*   Memory disorders include short-term memory loss and other serious presentations of memory-related ailments or amnesia.\n\n【50】*   Inability to recognize people.\n\n【51】*   Lack of fear reaction.\n\n【52】*   Difficulty in distinguishing and identifying some objects.\n\n【53】What Are the Diagnostic Tests to Be Carried Out?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【54】The diagnosis is mainly based on clinical presentations.\n\n【55】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain** \\- It is beneficial in analyzing the extent of temporal lobe damage.\n\n【56】*   **Electroencephalogram** - It is also used to identify seizures originating from the temporal lobe.\n\n【57】What Are the Management of Kluver Bucy Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【58】There is no specific treatment protocol present at the moment for the condition. Most treatment focuses on providing symptomatic relief and supportive care to the patient. The main drugs used in the management are\n\n【59】*   Mood stabilizers.\n\n【60】*   Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).\n\n【61】*   Antipsychotic drugs.\n\n【62】*   Anticonvulsant drugs.\n\n【63】*   Carbamazepine.\n\n【64】*   Leuprolide.\n\n【65】Drugs such as Carbamazepine and Leuprolide are typically administered to reduce sexual behavioral disorders. Drugs such as haloperidol and anticholinergics are useful in treating behavioral abnormalities. Antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic drugs are usually given to treat behavioral disorders.\n\n【66】The prognosis of the disease depends upon the underlying cause and the severity of the disease. The disorder is not life-threatening, but managing the patients may be difficult in certain situations. With treatment, symptoms may slowly decline.\n\n【67】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Kluver Bucy Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【68】Symptoms of the following disorders can be similar to those of Kluver-Bucy syndrome:\n\n【69】1.  **Pick Disease, or Frontotemporal Dementia** \\- It is a very rare progressive neurological disease initially predominantly affecting the temporal and frontal lobes of the brain. It is characterized by deterioration of intellect with alterated behavior and personality. However, memory is usually intact in the early stages of the disease, and there is less disorientation than in Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n【70】2.  **Alzheimer’s Disease** - It is a progressive disorder of the brain affecting thoughts, memory and language. Bundles of nerve endings degenerate in the cortex of the brains and disrupt the passage of electrochemical signals between the cells. Affected individuals become gradually forgetful. As there is an increased memory losses, altered personality, mood and behavior also seen.\n\n【71】3.  **Korsakoff’s Syndrome** - A deficiency of vitamin B1 leads to disturbances in the central and peripheral nervous system. Most common symptoms of Korsakoff’s syndrome include fatigue, irritation, difficulty sleeping, poor memory chest pain, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, and constipation. Later the symptoms are mainly neurological and cardiovascular.\n\n【72】4.  **Prader-Willi Syndrome** - It is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder. It usually affects all races and both sexes. It is characterized by poor muscle tone, short stature with small hands and feet, poor growth, and delayed development.\n\n【73】5.  **Kleine Levin Syndrome** - It is a rare sleep disorder characterized by intermittent insomnolence, behavioral and cognitive dysfunction, hyperphagia, and hypersexuality.\n\n【74】**Conclusion:**\n\n【75】Kluver-Bucy syndrome is a rare neuropsychiatric disorder associated with damage to both anterior temporal lobes of the brain, especially the hippocampus and amygdala, resulting in social and sexual dysfunctioning, memory loss and unknown behaviors. The disease is usually associated with herpes simplex encephalitis, head trauma, degenerative brain disorders like Pick’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease or cerebral-vascular diseases, and brain tumors. Patients with epilepsy should be closely followed for Kluver Bucy syndrome, especially those with hypersexuality, hallucinations, hypermetamorphosis, increased appetite, memory disturbance, speech disturbance, hyperactivity, agitation, and aggressiveness.

But instead of feeling better, they find themself worse than when they started. People experience joint pain, muscle aches, and sometimes even fever. This could be caused by exercise-induced vasculitis.\n\n【2】Exercise-induced vasculitis (EIV) is a disorder that causes inflammation of the blood vessels due to excessive exercise or physical activity. It can impact people from all walks of life, from athletes to casual fitness enthusiasts. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications. This is why it is important to understand its causes and symptoms and how to prevent them.\n\n【3】What Is Exercise-Induced Vasculitis?\n------------------------------------\n\n【4】Exercise-induced vasculitis, or EIV, is a harmless form of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis that usually appears after prolonged and strenuous workouts, usually in athletes. It is an inflammation of the blood vessels that occurs when the endothelium (the thin, inner layer of cells lining the arteries) suffers damage due to physical activity. This can range from running to weightlifting and can even occur in less strenuous activities, such as cycling and yoga.\n\n【5】The symptoms of exercise-induced vasculitis may vary but commonly include redness or purplish skin discoloration around the neck, upper arms, or chest. People may also experience pain or itching in these areas. All cases are self-limiting and typically resolve within a few days.\n\n【6】What Are the Causes of Exercise-Induced Vasculitis?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Exercise-induced vasculitis is an autoimmune disorder when the body's antibodies mistakenly attack the blood vessels. Several things can trigger the disorder.\n\n【8】1.  First, high-intensity workouts are known to increase pulse and respiration rates while reducing oxygen supply to the body, leading to inflammation of the blood vessels.\n\n【9】2.  Second, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), in particular, is more likely to lead to vasculitis symptoms due to its short bursts of intense activities.\n\n【10】3.  Other potential causes include medications and supplements taken before or during an intense workout and environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures or high humidity.\n\n【11】4.  Additionally, individuals with a history of autoimmune disorders such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis may be more prone to developing exercise-induced vasculitis due to weakened immune systems.\n\n【12】What Are the Symptoms of Exercise-Induced Vasculitis?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】If someone thinks they might have exercise-induced vasculitis, the first thing to look out for is symptoms. Exercise-induced vasculitis comes in many forms, and the signs can be different for everyone, but there are some common signs that people should watch out for:\n\n【14】1.  Skin redness, heat, or swelling in the affected area.\n\n【15】2.  Pain in the affected area.\n\n【16】3.  Tenderness or soreness when touched.\n\n【17】4.  Burning sensations or itching of the skin.\n\n【18】5.  Fatigue and overall feeling of being unwell.\n\n【19】6.  Joint pain or stiffness.\n\n【20】7.  Numbness or tingling sensation in the affected area.\n\n【21】8.  Swelling of lymph nodes near the affected area.\n\n【22】9.  Low-grade fever.\n\n【23】10.  Weight loss or loss of appetite.\n\n【24】11.  Headache, dizziness, and muscle ache after exercise.\n\n【25】On experiencing any of these symptoms while exercising, it is important to stop and consult with a doctor right away to rule out exercise-induced vasculitis and get treatment so that it does not become a more serious condition like inflammation or a clotting disorder like deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\n\n【26】How to Prevent Exercise-Induced Vasculitis?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Exercise-induced vasculitis can be debilitating, so it is important to help people prevent and treat this inflammatory joint condition before it progresses. Here are some tips to help prevent and treat exercise-induced vasculitis.\n\n【28】*   **Warm-Up Properly:** Ensure the body is warm and ready for the workout by doing a proper warm-up before starting. A warm-up should include dynamic stretches like lunges, leg swings, and arm circles. This helps increase the range of motion, lubricate the joints, and activate the muscles. Also, do light cardio, such as walking or jogging, to increase circulation throughout the body.\n\n【29】*   **Listen to the Body:** When exercising, it is important to always listen to the body when it needs a break. For example, if people feel pain or discomfort in any affected areas, they should stop immediately and rest for a few minutes until the pain subsides. Also, drink plenty of water before, during, and after each workout so that the body stays hydrated.\n\n【30】*   **Wear Appropriate Clothing:** Wearing clothing that supports the joints is imperative when preventing exercise-induced vasculitis. Choose clothing with extra padding in areas like the knees when jogging or running long distances; this will provide supportive cushioning for the joints so they do not have too much impact when exercising or running on hard surfaces.\n\n【31】What Are the Complications of Exercise-Induced Vasculitis?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Even though exercise-induced vasculitis is generally benign, it can still cause some unpleasant side effects, so taking the proper steps to prevent the condition is important. In some cases, exercise-induced vasculitis can cause joint pain, fatigue, and muscle and joint discomfort. In addition, it can even lead to more serious issues like high blood pressure, anemia, and an increased risk of infection.\n\n【33】Fortunately, there are several steps that people can take to help prevent exercise-induced vasculitis:\n\n【34】*   **Speak with the Doctor:** If one plans to embark on a new fitness journey or increase the intensity of the current routine, it is important to talk to the doctor first. They can offer advice tailored to the situation and help in setting realistic expectations.\n\n【35】*   **Warm Up and Cool Down:** Starting any exercise routine with a thorough warm-up will help prepare the body for the strain people endure. Simultaneously, cooling down will help the body gradually return to its resting state after a workout. This will minimize sudden spikes in blood pressure that could trigger an exercise-induced vasculitis flare-up.\n\n【36】*   **Manage Stress Level:** Maintaining healthy stress levels is always important regardless of whether or not people experience exercise-induced vasculitis. In addition, engaging in stress-relieving activities like yoga or meditation can help reduce body tension and the likelihood of a flare-up.\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】Knowing the risk of exercise-induced vasculitis is important if people engage in strenuous physical activity. Therefore, on experiencing any of the symptoms mentioned, people should immediately seek medical attention. Furthermore, the best way to prevent EIV is to limit exercise activity to reasonable levels and to hydrate and refuel the body after exercising properly.\n\n【39】Taking precautions can reduce the risk of exercise-induced vasculitis and help people live a healthy and active lifestyle. While exercise-induced vasculitis can have serious complications, early diagnosis, and treatment can help reduce the risk of long-term damage and help people return to a normal, active lifestyle.\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>*   Exercise-induced vasculitis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5828891/\n*   Exercise-Induced Vasculitis: A Review with Illustrated Cases  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27591889/\n*   Exercise-induced vasculitis associated with autoimmune disease  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19681343/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is usually used to treat various female reproductive system disorders. It is a major operation that alters a woman's reproductive system. Sex after a hysterectomy affects a woman physically, emotionally, and even socially. This varies depending on the procedure and any complications that may have arisen during or after surgery. The following article outlines the effect hysterectomy has on the body and how it affects sex for both partners.\n\n【2】What Is a Hysterectomy?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】The surgical removal of the uterus is called a hysterectomy. The uterus is the pear-shaped organ in a woman’s pelvis that holds a baby during pregnancy. Ovaries and fallopian tubes are also removed during a hysterectomy. This type of surgery is usually done to treat cancer of the uterus, ovaries, or cervix. Hysterectomy treats other conditions, such as endometriosis and fibroids.\n\n【4】When Should One Start Having Sex After a Hysterectomy?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】A hysterectomy can be performed as a total or partial removal. In a total hysterectomy, the surgeon will remove the uterus, including the cervix. In a partial or supracervical hysterectomy, the surgeon removes the upper part of the uterus, leaving the cervix in place. This means that you no longer have a menstrual cycle and cannot become pregnant. You may have some vaginal discharge for a few weeks or months after surgery. You may also have some vaginal bleeding or spotting for the first few weeks. Most people can resume sexual intercourse four to six weeks after a hysterectomy. For most women, this time frame is sufficient for full recovery from the surgery. Many factors can influence the rate of healing and recovery for each person - ranging from their age and medical history to what type of hysterectomy was performed. It is important to listen to your body during this time and pay attention to any unusual pain or discomfort you may feel as you get back into your routine life. Please consult your physician if you experience any discomfort or pain immediately so they can help you adjust medications or manage postoperative symptoms effectively.\n\n【6】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【7】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>Had hysterectomy long back and spotting now.

The loss of the uterus can also cause psychological effects that can impact sexual satisfaction. Some women may feel less feminine after a hysterectomy, which can affect their desire for sex. It can cause problems with arousal, lubrication, and orgasm. It can also lead to a loss of sexual desire. These problems can be tough to deal with. They can cause a lot of stress and anxiety. Hysterectomy can affect sexual function in several ways. First, it can cause changes in hormone levels. This can lead to vaginal dryness, hot flashes, and other menopausal symptoms. Second, the surgery can damage the pelvic nerves and blood vessels, which can lead to pain during sex. Third, the loss of the uterus can sometimes cause the vaginal walls to collapse, making intercourse difficult or impossible. If you are undergoing any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor. Some treatments can help, such as hormone therapy, lubricants, and pelvic floor exercises.\n\n【13】How Does Hysterectomy Cause Dyspareunia?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【14】The most frequent postoperative complications of hysterectomy are dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse). This can be caused by a variety of factors, including surgical damage to the pelvic floor muscles, scar tissue formation, and changes in hormone levels. While some women may able to manage their dyspareunia with lubricants and other treatments, others may find that the condition severely impacts their sexual quality of life. It is important to speak about the potential risks and benefits with your physician if you are thinking about having a hysterectomy.\n\n【15】How Does Hysterectomy Affect Orgasm?\n------------------------------------\n\n【16】There is no clear data on how hysterectomy affects orgasm. Some women report that their orgasm is more intense after having a hysterectomy, while others report no change or less. The effect of hysterectomy on orgasm may depend on individual factors such as the effect of women’s age, the type of hysterectomy done, and their overall health. The surgery can also cause scarring and adhesions in the pelvic area, which can make it difficult for a woman to feel aroused.\n\n【17】What Are the Tips for Having Sex After a Hysterectomy?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】There are a few things that can be done to improve sex after a hysterectomy.\n\n【19】*   Consult with your physician to check if any physical restrictions should be followed.\n\n【20】*   Many women report feeling a loss of sensation after the surgery, so experimenting with different types of stimulation may be necessary to find what feels good.\n\n【21】*   Lubrication is often key to comfortable and enjoyable sex after a hysterectomy.\n\n【22】*   You can also try different positions during sex.\n\n【23】*   Communicating with your partner about your needs and desires is essential to having a satisfying sexual experience.\n\n【24】If you are experiencing pain during sex after a hysterectomy and cannot or do not want to use medication, talk to your doctor about non-drug options. Identifying the underlying cause of pain is necessary to avoid it in the future and find ways of relaxing.\n\n【25】**Conclusion:**\n\n【26】The sexual function does not usually decrease after a hysterectomy. Most women continue to enjoy sex, and if you experience any problems with your libido or vaginal dryness, treatments can help improve sexual satisfaction after a hysterectomy. These include hormone therapy, vaginal moisturizers, and sex therapy. It is important to follow advice about when to resume sexual activity.

This condition can occur in males and females, and the extent of duplication can vary. Both tubes may be functional in some cases, while in others, one may be non-functional. Treatment for urethral duplication varies depending on the case and may include surgery, medications, or a combination of both.\n\n【2】What Is the Incidence of Urethral Duplications?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Urethral duplication is a rare congenital abnormality, and the exact incidence rate is not well established. The condition is estimated to occur in about 1 in every 50,000 to 500,000 live births. However, the true incidence rate may be higher as some mild cases go undiagnosed. The incidence of urethral duplication is thought to be higher in males than in females, with a male-to-female ratio of about 4:1. The condition can occur as an isolated finding or as part of a more complex congenital abnormality, such as bladder exstrophy or cloacal exstrophy.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Urethral Duplication?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The exact cause of urethral duplication is not well understood. It is a congenital (present at birth) abnormality that takes place during embryonic development. Some factors that have been suggested to contribute to the development of urethral duplication include:\n\n【6】*   Genetic mutations.\n\n【7】*   Exposure to certain chemicals.\n\n【8】*   Drugs during pregnancy.\n\n【9】*   Abnormalities in the formation of the urinary and reproductive systems.\n\n【10】However, in many cases, the cause of urethral duplication is not known. It is important to note that urethral duplication is rare, and most people with this abnormality do not have any other underlying medical conditions or genetic mutations.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>Can miscarriage happen after seeing heartbeat of fetus in earlier scans?</u>\n\n【14】Chromosomal 1q Duplication - A Rare Chromosomal Disorder\n\n【15】Fetal ultrasound failed to detect heartbeat.

Individuals may have no symptoms in some cases, and the condition is discovered incidentally. In other cases, the following symptoms may be present:\n\n【18】*   **Urinary Incontinence**: This may occur if one of the urethral tubes is not functional or is obstructed.\n\n【19】*   **Urinary Tract Infections**: These may occur if bacteria enter the non-functional urethral tube and cause an infection.\n\n【20】*   **Painful Urination:** This may occur if there is a narrowing or stricture of one of the urethral tubes.\n\n【21】*   **Urinary Retention:** This may occur if there is blockage or stricture of one of the urethral tubes, making it difficult to empty the bladder completely.\n\n【22】*   **Abnormalities in the External Genitalia:** This may occur in males and may include hypospadias (a condition in which the opening of the urethra is located on the underside of the penis) or epispadias (a condition in which the opening of the urethra is located on the top of the penis).\n\n【23】How to Make a Diagnosis of Urethral Duplication?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】A healthcare provider may use the following methods to diagnose urethral duplication:\n\n【25】*   **Physical Examination:** This may include a visual examination of the external genitalia and a digital rectal exam in males.\n\n【26】*   **Medical History:** The healthcare provider would take note of the symptoms and past urinary tract problems.\n\n【27】*   **Imaging Tests:** This may include X-rays, ultrasound, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), or CT (computed tomography) scan to visualize the urinary tract and determine the extent of the duplication.\n\n【28】*   **Urodynamic Testing**: This type of test measures the pressure in the bladder and the flow of urine. It can help determine each urethral tube's function and assess the urinary system's overall health.\n\n【29】*   **Cystoscopy:** This is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera are inserted into the bladder to visualize the urethra and determine the extent of the duplication.\n\n【30】What Is the Treatment of Urethral Duplication?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【31】The treatment for urethral duplication varies depending on the extent of the duplication and the symptoms present. Some standard treatment options include:\n\n【32】*   **Surgery**: Surgical intervention may sometimes be necessary to correct the duplication and improve urinary function. This may include urethral reconstruction, bladder neck suspension, or urinary diversions.\n\n【33】*   **Medications:** Antibiotics are given to treat or prevent urinary tract infections. Pain relievers may also be given to help with the pain.\n\n【34】*   **Bladder Training:** This involves retraining the bladder to hold more urine and reduce urinary incontinence.\n\n【35】*   **Catheterization**: In some cases, a catheter may be inserted into the bladder to help empty it.\n\n【36】*   **Self-Catheterization:** Individuals may be trained to perform self-catheterization to empty the bladder.\n\n【37】What Are the Complications of Urethral Duplication?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】*   **Stricture:** Narrowing of one or both of the urethral tubes can occur over time, leading to difficulties with urination.\n\n【39】*   **Vesicoureteral Reflux:** This condition in which urine flows back from the bladder into the ureters can lead to kidney damage over time.\n\n【40】*   **Nephropathy:** Long-term complications with the urinary system can lead to kidney damage or failure.\n\n【41】*   **Hydronephrosis:** This is a condition in which the kidney becomes enlarged and filled with fluid due to urine buildup.\n\n【42】*   **Pyelonephritis:** This is a severe urinary tract infection that involves the kidney.\n\n【43】*   **Kidney Stones:** These may form if the urine becomes concentrated due to difficulty with bladder emptying.\n\n【44】*   **Bladder Dysfunction:** This may occur if the bladder cannot function properly due to nerve or muscle damage.\n\n【45】*   **Erectile Dysfunction:** This may occur in males due to nerve damage or other urinary tract complications.\n\n【46】*   **Chronic Pain:** This may occur if there is ongoing discomfort or pain due to urethral stricture or other complications.\n\n【47】What Is the Prognosis of Urethral Duplications?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【48】The prognosis of urethral duplication varies depending on the condition and severity. Some individuals with mild symptoms may not experience symptoms, while others may experience urinary tract infections, incontinence, and other complications.\n\n【49】In more severe cases, urethral duplication can lead to obstructive voiding symptoms, recurrent urinary tract infections, and difficulty with hygiene. Surgery may be necessary to correct the related abnormality and prevent further complications.\n\n【50】**Conclusion:**\n\n【51】Urethral duplication is a complex condition requiring several medical specialists' care. A combination of physical examination, medical history, and diagnostic tests are used to diagnose the condition. The treatment options may include surgery, medications, bladder training, catheterization, and self-catheterization. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent or mitigate potential complications and improve outcomes for individuals with urethral duplication. It is important to seek the care of a qualified healthcare provider if you have symptoms of urethral duplication to receive prompt and appropriate care. Regular follow-up appointments with a healthcare provider can help monitor potential complications and allow timely treatment if necessary.\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>*   Diagnosing urethral duplication including a novel radiological diagnostic algorithm  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6159257/\n*   Urethral duplication as cause of incontinence in a 5-years-old female: Surgical approach  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36075828/\n*   Duplication of urethra  \n    https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/1975/duplication-of-urethra</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It can spread by semen, blood, or other body fluids from an infected person to an uninfected person. This can happen through sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment, sexual contact, or from mother to baby at birth. Hepatitis B can be a short-term illness or chronic long-term infection. It may also lead to severe, life-threatening conditions like liver cirrhosis or cancer. It is estimated that 257 million people are currently living with chronic hepatitis B, and two billion people have been infected worldwide.\n\n【2】What Is Hepatitis?\n------------------\n\n【3】Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. The liver serves many functions in the body, including detoxification, digestion, protection against infection, protein and hormone production, and many more. Heavy alcohol use, certain medications, toxins, and infections can cause hepatitis. Persistent hepatitis can lead to scarring of the liver called cirrhosis. Cirrhosis occurs when the liver has been severely damaged. A cirrhotic liver does not function and can result in complications such as bleeding from the esophagus and stomach, yellowing skin (jaundice), and fluid accumulation in the abdomen.\n\n【4】What Is Hepatitis B?\n--------------------\n\n【5】Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus. Many patients will have little or no symptoms when they get infected. They are fever, feeling tired, lack of appetite, upset stomach, vomiting, dark urine, grey-colored stool, joint pain, and yellow skin and eyes. Often, patients can have hepatitis B for many years without knowing they have it. Acute hepatitis B infection is a short-term infection lasting up to six months. When infection persists for over six months, it is called chronic hepatitis B. The younger people get infected, the more likely they will progress to chronic hepatitis. Up to 90 % of infants will develop chronic hepatitis B, while only 5 % of adults will develop chronic infection. Hepatitis B slowly damages the liver over decades, leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer. The virus exists worldwide.\n\n【6】How Is Hepatitis B Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------\n\n【7】**Blood Test** - Blood tests can detect the presence of antibodies, viral particles, or genetic material (deoxyribonucleic acid).\n\n【8】**Ultrasound** - A liver ultrasound is usually done to assess cirrhosis or signs of liver cancer.\n\n【9】**Fibroscan** - Often, a fibroscan is also performed. This is a specialized machine that measures the degree of fibrosis (scarring) in the liver.\n\n【10】How Is Hepatitis B Transmitted?\n-------------------------------\n\n【11】Many people do not know how they acquired hepatitis B. Worldwide, the most common method of getting the infection is when an infected mother passes the virus to her baby during childbirth. The virus is spread by contact with blood and sexual fluid. Before widespread screening of blood donors in the 1970s, hepatitis B was also spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants. Other methods of transmission are:\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【14】Hepatitis C - Common Questions Answered\n\n【15】I think I have a liver damage.

The vaccine consists of three doses given over six months and offers 95 % protection against infection. Anyone who is not immune should receive the vaccine.\n\n【40】**Preventing Further Liver Damage** \\- If a person has hepatitis B, it is essential to avoid other insults to the liver. Avoid heavy alcohol consumption and get vaccinated for hepatitis A. Check with your healthcare provider before starting any new medications to ensure they are safe for the liver. Sometimes your doctor will need to evaluate you for other liver diseases as well.\n\n【41】Is There a Cure for Hepatitis B?\n--------------------------------\n\n【42】No, unfortunately, there is currently no cure for hepatitis B. Once a person has been infected, the virus lives inside their liver forever.\n\n【43】What Are the Treatment Options for Hepatitis B?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Most people simply need regular monitoring with blood work and liver ultrasound every six months to ensure their liver remains healthy and that the virus stays under control. If the virus starts to cause symptoms or inflammation to the liver, medications can be used to stop the virus from reproducing in the body. Many people who start treatment remain on it for years or even lifelong. There is no treatment that actually removes the virus from the body. Treatment of hepatitis B should be overseen by a gastroenterologist, hepatologist, infectious disease specialist, or a physician experienced in the management of this condition.\n\n【45】What Should Be Done in if a Pregnant Women Is Infected With Hepatitis B?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】A pregnant woman can still have a perfectly healthy baby even if she has been infected with hepatitis B. It is important to have regular monitoring of the hepatitis B virus during pregnancy to determine the risk of infection to the baby and whether there is inflammation of the liver. If the virus is at low levels, no special treatment is required. If the virus is at high levels or she is experiencing symptoms, treatment may be necessary. If a baby is born to an infected mother, they should receive hepatitis B immune globulin and the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine shortly after birth to prevent infection.\n\n【47】Can Hepatitis B Positive Mothers Breastfeed?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【48】Yes, they can as long as their nipples are not cracked or bleeding and the baby has received hepatitis B immunoglobulin and the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth.\n\n【49】**Conclusion:**\n\n【50】Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Chronic hepatitis B may develop liver failure, liver cirrhosis, or cancer. A vaccine can prevent this infection, but there is no cure. Taking certain precautions can help prevent spreading the virus from an infected person to others.\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>*   Hepatitis B  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/index.htm#:~:text=Hepatitis%20B%20is%20a%20vaccine,someone%20who%20is%20not%20infected\n*   Hepatitis B  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-b/symptoms-causes/syc-20366802</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Unfortunately, sexual assault is a common social issue that victimizes all ages and genders, especially children and women. Forensic sexology is essential to understanding how the criminal mindset of sexual offenders is likely to play out. It is necessary to predict patterns in order to stop future criminal sexual offenses, attain a diagnosis, devise a treatment plan, and eventually pass legal judgment on a sexual offender.\n\n【4】What Are the Common Issues Forensic Sexology Deals With?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Forensic sexology will typically cover the following areas:\n\n【6】*   Sexual disorders.\n\n【7】*   Sexual crime.\n\n【8】*   Legal aspects of sexology, including sexual assaults and courtroom issues.\n\n【9】*   Sexual criminal typology.\n\n【10】*   Supervision and control of sexual offenders.\n\n【11】*   Therapy for sexual offenders.\n\n【12】What Is the Difference Between Forensic and Clinical Sexology?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Clinical sexologists are often relied on to provide perspective on forensic aspects, but there are essential differences between forensic and clinical sexology practices that are important to understand. These differences include:\n\n【14】*   **The Subject-** Clinical sexology is about the patient and their needs. Patients approaching clinical sexologists are usually distressed about sexual dysfunction and need to be helped with the dysfunction and the accompanying distress. Forensic sexology attempts to save other people from the distress caused by sex offenders. The offenders themselves may not feel any qualms at their behavior.\n\n【15】*   **Treatment Motivation-** In clinical sexology, the patient is motivated and seeks out the doctor for treatment. Forensic sexology is less about motivation and more about preventing further sex crimes by law. Sex offenders are required by law to undergo sex therapy and to be evaluated and treated.\n\n【16】*   **Confidentiality-** Confidentiality is assured to patients in clinical sexology, whereas forensic sexology allows for no concessions. Everything patients say may be used in a forensic report.\n\n【17】*   **Truth and Lies-** As a direct subset of the lack of confidentiality, as also due to the nature of sex offenders, it is usually assumed that whatever is being said to the sexologist by a sex offender is probably false. On the other hand, clinical sexology is for patients who need to tell the full truth of their condition in order to obtain adequate treatment, so their statements are regarded as probably true.\n\n【18】*   **Time-** For clinical sexologists, the greatest weapon in their arsenal is time, and the understanding that sex therapy is a dynamic process that shifts and changes. The initial diagnosis may change with time, the nature of therapy may also change, and the clinician’s assessment continues to grow and evolve with the patient’s progress. In forensic sexology, everything from assessment and evaluation to psychometric tests and therapy recommendations is begun and concluded in a single session. Very rarely do forensic sexologists spend more time with their patients. Forensic sexology is thus often referred to as a static process, which is in stark contrast to the dynamism of clinical sexology.\n\n【19】*   **The Environment-** Clinical sexology encourages patients to explore sexuality, emphasizing sex positivity. The aim is to allow patients to confront their sexual issues and the underlying reasons through an atmosphere of positivity and exploration of their sexual desires. On the other hand, forensic sexology operates in a sex-negative climate, with no encouragement for the actions of sex crime perpetrators. Rather, the aim is to control the sexual desires that patients feel most comfortable with because these are invariably the sort of desires and proclivities that are classified as criminal and cause harm to society.\n\n【20】What Are the Keys to Practicing Forensic Sexology?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Forensic sexology deals less with facts and more with predicting the future based on previous facts. Forensic sexologists are required to do two things-\n\n【22】*   **Find the Truth-** Often, finding the truth is difficult for a forensic sexologist, given the sexual offender’s propensity to lie. However, this is where their experience, understanding of the sexual offender’s mind and reasoning, and ability to elicit the truth or some semblance of the truth come into play.\n\n【23】*   **Predict the Future**\\- Second, there is a need to predict how dangerous the sex offender may be, based on their statements, their crimes, and the sexologist’s understanding of what drives their internal thoughts and beliefs. This exercise needs to be approached with caution since the eventual determination of future legal or therapeutic action may be based on their assessment.\n\n【24】How Do Sexual Offenders Operate?\n--------------------------------\n\n【25】The very aspect of sexual offending that makes it a tough job for forensic sexologists is the frequent lack of an identifiable or established offense pattern. While some may display such a pattern, sexual deviancy is more often than not well-hidden and difficult to identify.\n\n【26】The characteristic patterns of criminals may apply to some persistent sexual offenders, such as:\n\n【27】*   They are young.\n\n【28】*   They may not be gainfully employed.\n\n【29】*   They may lack social boundaries while also being completely antisocial.\n\n【30】*   They may indulge in substance abuse.\n\n【31】*   They may often associate with other criminals.\n\n【32】However, sexual offenders may present slightly different attitudes from traditional criminal mindsets. Sexual offenders are often classified as high or low risk based on their deviancy. In some cases, they may not actually have deviant natures. Their issue might be with mistaking consent or not being able to accept reality. In other cases, their proclivities might truly be deviant and abnormal enough to constitute a menace to society.\n\n【33】Characteristic traits more likely to be common to sexual offenders include:\n\n【34】*   Low self-esteem.\n\n【35】*   Inability to exercise self-control.\n\n【36】*   Poor coping strategies.\n\n【37】*   Substance abuse.\n\n【38】Finally, the toughest part of dealing with a sexual offender lies in estimating recidivism potential (potential for repetition of the sexual offense). This is challenging because sex offenders are often adept at convincing even the most seasoned practitioners of their remorse. That is why forensic sexologists are often advised to use extreme caution and a skeptical mindset.\n\n【39】**Conclusion:**\n\n【40】Forensic sexology can be a hit-or-miss practice. Failure to identify truly dangerous sexual offenders and recommend the necessary treatment can result in serious crimes and loss of human life. However, the field continues to grow and evolve. There is ultimately hope that sexual assault patterns and offenders may at least be identified and effectively dealt with.\n\n【41】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【42】* * *\n\n【43】#### **1.**删除换行**Is a Sexologist Considered a Doctor?**\n\n【44】\\- A doctor who specializes in the sexology field or the field of sexual science is called a sexologist.  \n\\- Sexologists can also be therapists who deal specifically with issues of a sexual nature.\n\n【45】#### **2.**删除换行**Do Sexologists Touch Their Patients?**\n\n【46】\\- Sexologists do not typically touch their patients, have sex with them, or have any sort of physical contact with them unless necessary as a part of their session.  \n  - These individuals have received professional training with regard to managing issues of intimacy and sex, and do not get physically or sexually involved.  \n\\- However, they may occasionally engage a surrogate sexual partner for the patient or ask the patient’s partner to join.   \n \n\n【47】#### **3.**删除换行**What Do Sexual and Gender-Based Crimes Mean?**\n\n【48】\\- Gender-based crimes or gender-based violence refers to harmful acts perpetuated against individuals on the basis of their gender.

It also enhances immune function and prevents clogging in the arteries. The liver metabolizes and excretes the other forms of vitamin E, but it resecretes only alpha-tocopherol via the hepatic alpha-tocopherol transfer protein. Free radicals harm cells and may play a role in cancer and cardiovascular disease development.\n\n【2】How Bad Is Ataxia With Vitamin E Deficiency?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】*   A deficiency of vitamin E can lead to neurological problems such as difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and speech (dysarthria), loss of reflexes in the legs (lower limb areflexia), and a loss of sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy).\n\n【4】*   Some may also develop an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa that causes vision loss.\n\n【5】*   Most people with ataxia, due to a vitamin E deficiency, start experiencing problems with movement between the ages of 5 and 15 years, which worsens with age.\n\n【6】**What Are the Other Names for Ataxia With Vitamin E Deficiency?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】*   Ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency (AVED).\n\n【8】*   Familial isolated vitamin E deficiency (FIVE).\n\n【9】*   Friedreich ataxia phenotype with selective vitamin E deficiency.\n\n【10】*   Friedreich-like ataxia.\n\n【11】**How Common is the Disease?**\n\n【12】*   Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency is rare; however, its prevalence is unknown.\n\n【13】**What is the Genetic Background of the Disease?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】*   Due to a mutation in both copies of the gene in each cell, this condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive pattern.\n\n【15】*   An autosomal recessive condition is one in which one copy of the mutated gene is carried by each parent, who is asymptomatic in most cases.\n\n【16】What Are the Causes of Ataxia Due to Vitamin E Deficiency?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】*   Mutations in the TTPA gene cause ataxia with a vitamin E deficiency.

Still, symptoms and disease severity can differ even between siblings in families with different pathogenic variants.\n\n【27】The first symptoms include,\n\n【28】*   Progressive ataxia (lack of coordination).\n\n【29】*   The clumsiness of the hands (poor coordination, movement, or action).\n\n【30】*   Loss of proprioception (reduction in the sense that includes the awareness of posture, weight, movement, and limb position about the environment).\n\n【31】*   Areflexia (a condition in which your muscles do not respond to stimuli).\n\n【32】Other features include,\n\n【33】*   Dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid, quick, synchronous, alternating muscle movements, including rotational forearm movement, fast finger tapping, opening and closing of the fists, foot tapping, etc.).\n\n【34】*   Dysarthria (weakness in the muscles of speech, which causes slowed or slurred speech).\n\n【35】*   Positive Romberg sign (inability to maintain an erect posture over 60 seconds with eyes closed).\n\n【36】*   Head titubation (involuntary tremor of the head, neck, and trunk area).\n\n【37】*   Positive Babinski sign (extension/ dorsiflexion /upward movement) of the big toe causing the fanning of the other toes).\n\n【38】*   Macular atrophy (loss in the center of the field of vision).\n\n【39】*   Retinitis pigmentosa (decreased vision at night or in low light and loss of side vision).\n\n【40】How to Diagnose Ataxia With Vitamin E Deficiency?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】**Suggestive Findings:**\n\n【42】*   Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) should be suspected in individuals who typically present the symptoms mentioned above at the beginning of puberty.\n\n【43】**Definitive Findings:**\n\n【44】*   There are currently no universal diagnostic standards for AVED.\n\n【45】The primary diagnostic indicator is the presence of\n\n【46】*   A neurologic phenotype resembles Friedreich ataxia.\n\n【47】*   A marked decreased plasma vitamin E (α-tocopherol) concentration.\n\n【48】*   Standard lipoprotein profile in the absence of known causes of malabsorption of vitamin E.\n\n【49】**Antenatal Diagnosis:**\n\n【50】*   Antenatal diagnosis is confirmed by identifying bi-allelic TTPA pathogenic variants via molecular genetic testing when the mutation has been identified in the family.\n\n【51】How to Manage Ataxia With Vitamin E Deficiency?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【52】**Treatment of Manifestations:**\n\n【53】*   Lifelong high-dose oral vitamin E supplementation to bring plasma vitamin E concentrations into the high-normal range.\n\n【54】*   If the treatment starts at the early stage of the disease, it may, to some extent, reverse ataxia and mental deterioration.\n\n【55】**Prevention of Primary Manifestations:**\n\n【56】*   Children with biallelic TTPA pathogenic variants who are presymptomatic can take vitamin E therapy to delay the onset of symptoms.\n\n【57】**Genetic Counseling:**\n\n【58】*   Since AVED is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, the parents of an affected child are obligate heterozygotes, carry one pathogenic variant, and are asymptomatic.\n\n【59】*   Carrier detection for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing can be done if the pathogenic variants in the family have been identified.\n\n【60】**Surveillance:**\n\n【61】*   Check the level of plasma vitamin E every six months, especially in children.\n\n【62】**Agents or Circumstances to Avoid:**\n\n【63】*   Smoking, occupations requiring quick responses, or good balance can be avoided.\n\n【64】**Evaluation of Relatives at Risk:**\n\n【65】*   Evaluation for vitamin E deficiency, especially in the younger siblings of the person affected with the disease.\n\n【66】**Others:**\n\n【67】*   People with AVED may find it challenging to ride a bicycle or operate a vehicle due to abnormal position sense in the extremities.\n\n【68】*   A doctor should evaluate affected people before driving to check if they can safely operate a vehicle.\n\n【69】What is the Prognosis of Ataxia With Vitamin E Deficiency?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【70】*   If people are treated with vitamin E before the symptoms start, people with AVED can lead normal lives.\n\n【71】*   Without treatment, individuals with AVED will become dependent on a wheelchair between the ages of 11 and 50 and may experience severe physical and mental problems.\n\n【72】**Conclusion:**\n\n【73】Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) is a rare cause of hereditary ataxia in developing countries with an unknown prevalence. AVED is reversible if treated in time with vitamin E supplementation. In addition, vitamin E supplementation decreases the symptoms and prevents disease progression.\n\n【74】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【75】无关删除-1:<u>*   Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1241/\n*   Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/ataxia-with-vitamin-e-deficiency/?filter=ovr-ds-resources\n*   Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency: Widening the Phenotypic Spectrum  \n    https://n.neurology.org/content/94/15\\_Supplement/2197</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This period lasts for about six to seven years. It is a stage when puberty hits and a child transforms into a youngster. They notice many visible changes in their body during this phase. The changes can be physical, mental, emotional, social, and sexual. A child unprepared for this phase can go through a lot of apprehension and anxiety. Though the transition may be new and challenging to parents and children, understanding the ups and downs of adolescence can help them handle it better. Parents play an essential role in guiding and supporting the child positively.\n\n【2】What Are the Stages of Adolescence?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】Adolescence is divided into three stages, which include:\n\n【4】1.  Early adolescence.\n\n【5】2.  Middle adolescence.\n\n【6】3.  Late adolescence.\n\n【7】What Is Early Adolescence?\n--------------------------\n\n【8】*   Early adolescence lasts from ten to 13 years.\n\n【9】*   There is rapid growth in the child during this phase.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Vaginal Bleeding - When to Consult a Doctor?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Acquired RBC Anemias - Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Iron-Deficiency Anemia - Its Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   There are many changes taking place in the body, like hair growth under the arms and in the genital area and start of breast development in girls, and the enlargement of testicles in boys.\n\n【11】*   These changes may start one or two years earlier in girls than boys.\n\n【12】*   It is also not uncommon for early adolescence to start as early as eight years in girls and nine years in boys.\n\n【13】*   Most girls get their first period by 12 to 13 years, which generally occurs two to three after the onset of breast development.\n    </u>\n\n【14】These physical changes can create anxiety and curiosity in most children. Some might be unprepared and cannot differentiate whether the changes are normal or abnormal. Children in this age group have concrete “black and white” thinking, which means something is either excellent or terrible. They do not have room to accommodate a more detailed point of view. This kind of thinking makes them more self-centered. Also, they are constantly feeling of being judged and experience peer pressure.\n\n【15】Pre-teens also develop a sense of privacy. They try to maintain privacy by looking for ways to stay away from family. If elders place strict boundaries in the family, they retaliate.\n\n【16】What Is Middle Adolescence?\n---------------------------\n\n【17】*   Middle adolescence lasts from 14 to 17 years.\n\n【18】*   Most of the physical changes are achieved by this stage.\n\n【19】*   Girls attain a major part of physical development and tend to get regular periods.\n\n【20】*   Voice changes are a noticeable change in boys. Their voices begin to crack and deepen.\n\n【21】*   Acne development is a common finding in both boys and girls.\n\n【22】Teens at this age develop an interest in sexual and romantic development. They explore sex and sexuality through self-stimulation called masturbation. Also, the feelings of having independence strengthen at this age, and they may constantly get into arguments with their parents. They develop a liking for spending more time with friends than at home or with family. Peer pressure is at its maximum, and they are very concerned about their appearance and what others think of them.\n\n【23】The brain continues to mature through middle adolescence. The frontal lobes of the brain develop entirely only in the 20s. Therefore, complex decision-making and an ability to consider various scenarios and consequences can differ in adolescents compared to adults. They validate situations more abstractly rather than understanding the pros and cons.\n\n【24】What Is Late Adolescence?\n-------------------------\n\n【25】*   Late adolescence is from 18 to 21 years and beyond.\n\n【26】*   By this stage, most adolescents would have attained an adult height and have completed physical development.\n\n【27】Adolescents at this age have clearer thinking and can assess the good and bad in most situations. They can gauge the risks and rewards in a better way. They develop a sense of individuality and can focus well on essential decisions on their road to the future. They tend to detach themselves physically and emotionally from their family but can consider having an “adult” relationship with their parents. This thought process helps them keep the thread open and discuss mature topics and decisions with them, rather than only considering them as “authoritative figures.”\n\n【28】How Can Parents Help Children Navigate Through Adolescence?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Family dynamics and relationships can go through a lot of changes during a child’s adolescent period. During such times, constant support and understanding from parents are very important in helping the child get through. There are a few things that parents can do to help:\n\n【30】*   Sitting down and talking to the child. The child can be made to understand that “puberty” is a normal phase of development that everyone goes through. They may have fears and anticipations, which can be cleared by talking openly. They must also be given room to ask questions and express emotions. If required, a pediatrician can also be consulted.\n\n【31】*   Starting early conversations about topics like sex, sexuality, pregnancy, substance abuse, and consent helps build a good framework for future discussions.\n\n【32】*   Keeping conversations positive and celebrating successes.\n\n【33】*   Setting clear but reasonable boundaries. For example, communication must be clear regarding behavior or social media use so that they know the limits on a positive note. At the same time, they must be given the independence and encouragement to explore opportunities. A balance between the opinions of adolescents and parents has been shown to reduce the risk of depression and drug use.\n\n【34】*   Discuss the pros and cons of a consequence and explain to them the possible risks involved.\n\n【35】*   Setting a positive example for them so that they look up to the parents.\n\n【36】*   Guiding them in their decision-making journey.\n\n【37】*   Honoring a child’s individuality and independence as adolescence is only a phase of the transition from childhood to adulthood.\n\n【38】*   Assuring the children that their parents are always there for them in times of need.\n\n【39】**Conclusion**\n\n【40】Adolescence is a journey of a child into adulthood. A child undergoes physical and emotional development during this phase, which can create anxiety and anticipation. Parents play a vital role during this period to help and guide them in what they are going through in their minds and body. A positive relationship with children can help them become successful, happy, healthy adults.\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>*   Stages of Adolescence  \n    https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/teen/Pages/Stages-of-Adolescence.aspx\n*   What are the 3 stages of adolescence?  \n    https://mindfulness-supervision.org.uk/what-are-the-3-stages-of-adolescence/\n*   Stages of Adolescence  \n    https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290204766\\_Stages\\_of\\_Adolescence</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "05ad83d1-3056-4223-968d-502ceb11c99f", "title": "Thick Toenails - Causes, Symptoms, Treatment and Prevention", "text": "【0】Thick Toenails - Causes, Symptoms, Treatment and Prevention\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】To safeguard the tops of the toes, toenails are made thick by nature. They can, however, occasionally grow unnaturally thick and, particularly if they start to discolor, represent a cosmetic concern for certain people. Age-related toenail thickening is a natural process, but other factors, such as autoimmune diseases, fungal infections, or mechanical pressures from ill-fitting shoes, can also contribute to thick toenails. People with thick toenails often have questions about why toenails get thick, why toenails turn yellow, and how to treat thick toenails. This article will provide answers to these questions.\n\n【2】What Are the Signs And Symptoms of Thick Toenails?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Toenails are typically one to two millimeters thick for adults. In general, men's toenails are slightly thicker than those of women. The toes and toenails' appearance, texture, and sensation may vary as they become thicker. When extra layers form below the nail's surface, toenails swell up.\n\n【4】The nail may separate from the nail bed if the thickening is excessive. Onycholysis is the medical word for this dissociation. The nail typically turns white or somewhat yellow, changing its original color. The toenails may turn yellow or brown if a fungus is a reason for their thickening. The nails will frequently become brittle and fall off or flake easily due to toenail fungus.\n\n【5】Smooth and strong toenails are often signs of good health. However, nails might break as they become thicker. Brittle toenails can split, crack, or break easily. When wearing closed-toe shoes, thickened toenails may cause discomfort or suffering. In addition to creating rubbing, friction, or increased pain when walking, thicker toenails may also cause paresthesia (numbness or tingling) of the toenail.\n\n【6】What Causes Thick Toenails?\n---------------------------\n\n【7】Thick toenails occur as a result of several factors. All the causative factors are discussed below.\n\n【8】**1\\. Age-Related Thickening of Toenails:** Thicker toes are easily noticeable in older individuals. The nails on a person's toes frequently begin to thicken as they get older. Though the disorder is most frequent on toes, fingernails can also thicken. According to medical experts, changes in blood circulation or prolonged UV (ultraviolet) exposure cause the nails to grow as people age. It is not possible to treat thick nails or ridges on the nail that develop with age. However, one can softly polish them to make them look smoother.\n\n【9】**2\\. Fungal Infections of Toenails:** One of the most typical causes of thick nails is a fungus infection called onychomycosis. Since fungi like warm, damp environments, they frequently develop in toenails and spread quickly. The following are some of the main causes of fungal infections in toenails:\n\n【10】*   Exposure to moist areas continuously.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Diabetic Foot Ulcer- Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Yellow Nail Syndrome - Causes, Signs, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Ayurvedic Management of Psoriasis</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Smoking.\n\n【12】*   Wearing tight shoes.\n\n【13】*   Damage to the nail or the area nearby.\n    </u>\n\n【14】Some people are more susceptible to fungus infections than others. This is because of some underlying medical conditions which make them more prone to fungal infections. All those conditions are discussed below.\n\n【15】*   Diabetes mellitus.\n\n【16】*   Skin diseases like psoriasis.\n\n【17】*   Athlete’s foot (a fungal infection that occurs between the toes).\n\n【18】*   Immunocompromised individuals.\n\n【19】*   Individuals undergoing chemotherapy.\n\n【20】*   Circulatory problems.\n\n【21】**3\\. Psoriasis**: Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that causes itchy, inflammatory skin patches. Some people also get psoriasis on their nails, which makes them brittle and thick. The nails may become fragile from psoriasis and perhaps fall off entirely. Fortunately, there are numerous therapies available for psoriasis that affect the nails.\n\n【22】**4\\. Injuries to the Toenail:** Repeated toenail injuries can also lead to a thick toenail. Because of the repeated microtrauma caused by the nail rubbing against the shoe, runners and athletes are more likely to suffer from toenail injuries. Injury-related thick nails are sometimes misinterpreted as fungus infections. Injured nails may heal more naturally if they get treated. If treatment is effective, the improvement will probably come gradually. It takes several months for new nail development to match the nail's length.\n\n【23】**5\\. Yellow Nail Syndrome:** Both toenails and fingernails can develop thick nails due to this less frequent cause. Yellow nail syndrome causes the nails to turn yellow, thicken, and bend. Hence, individuals who notice that their toenail has turned yellow and thick should get their check-up done to rule out the presence of this syndrome.\n\n【24】How to Get Rid of Thick Toenails?\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Because toenails grow slowly, repairs frequently take a long period. Many of the treatments that are currently available necessitate long-term commitment. Some toenail issues can take up to a year to resolve.\n\n【26】1.  **Self-Care Measures:** To avoid toenail damage, an individual should put all their effort into maintaining good foot and nail care. Seeking medical advice the very first time a thick toenail is spotted can prevent it from growing worse. Make sure the shoes are comfortable to wear and do not rub against the toes. If people suffer a toe injury and their nail becomes temporarily thick, they may improve with time.\n\n【27】2.  **Medicines:** The doctor may prescribe some creams, ointments, and pills to treat thick toenails. Fungal infection of the toenail will require antifungal medications.\n\n【28】3.  **Laser Treatment:** Both nail psoriasis and nail fungal infections can be treated with laser therapy.\n\n【29】4.  **Debridement:** Debridement is a method of treating thick toenails. The healthcare professional will use instruments to remove excess layers of your toenail and help reduce its thickness during this process. The toenail may also be trimmed (shortened) by the provider.\n\n【30】5.  **Injections:** Injections are available for treating psoriasis, which are chosen if psoriasis causes thick toenails.\n\n【31】How to Prevent Thick Toenails?\n------------------------------\n\n【32】There are some preventive measures for thick toenails. These are discussed below.\n\n【33】1\\. Maintaining proper foot hygiene is the primary preventive measure. Maintaining proper foot hygiene can lower the chance of developing a fungal infection and stop it from recurring after treatment. Some of the hygienic habits are:\n\n【34】*   Maintaining dry and clean toes.\n\n【35】*   Keeping the nails short.\n\n【36】*   Not exchanging nail care supplies (like nail clippers).\n\n【37】*   Wearing shoes in communal areas like locker rooms or swimming pools\n\n【38】*   Stay away from shoes that are either too tight or too loose.\n\n【39】2\\. Short nails can lower the chance of developing nail fungus because it frequently enters under the nail. Consider cleaning the nail clippers with rubbing alcohol after each usage.\n\n【40】3\\. Keeping the shoes and socks dry to prevent fungal growth.\n\n【41】4\\. Between uses, pedicure tools must be adequately sanitized to prevent the development of illnesses like nail fungus.\n\n【42】What Are the Complications of Thick Toenails?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【43】Toenail infections that are left untreated can result in complications. The infection may worsen, and the symptoms may worsen with time. Toenails may become so thick that wearing shoes becomes painful, or they may even make walking more challenging.\n\n【44】**Conclusion:**\n\n【45】There are many causes (old age, nail fungus, psoriasis) and remedies for thick toenails. The doctor can suggest a treatment plan and assist patients in understanding any changes to the toenails. Thick toenails can be prevented and treated by concentrating on wearing shoes that fit properly and maintaining appropriate foot care.\n\n【46】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【47】* * *\n\n【48】#### **1.**删除换行**How Does One Groom Thick Toenails?**\n\n【49】For grooming the thick toenails, the toenails should be soaked in warm water for a minimum of two minutes. By doing so, these nails become soft. Therefore, this step is used to soften the thick toenail. After that, a soft and clean towel should be used for drying. To prevent the nail from splintering, make little cuts with a nail clipper while cutting across. Avoid rounding off the corners of the nail to reduce the likelihood of an ingrown nail. Sharp edges and corners should be rounded off with an emery board.\n\n【50】#### **2.**删除换行**What Causes Toenails to Become Thick?**\n\n【51】Several factors can cause toenails to become thick. These include age-related thickening, fungal infections like onychomycosis, skin diseases like psoriasis, injury to the toenail, and a rare condition called yellow nail syndrome.\n\n【52】#### **3.**删除换行**How to Get Rid of Thick Toenail Fungus?**\n\n【53】Thick toenail fungus is treated with the help of antifungal medications. Apart from these medications, some home care measures can also help. These include using baking soda and water for soaking the toenails. The application of tea tree oil, coconut oil, and olive leaf extract can provide benefits as all of them have antifungal properties. Laser treatment can also be used if required to treat fungal infections of the thick toenails.\n\n【54】#### **4.**删除换行**How to Get Rid of Thick Toenails From Injury?**\n\n【55】Injuries or injuries that occur suddenly or repeatedly can cause toenails to thicken. Soccer players, runners, and dancers are most likely to experience this. People who wear ill-fitting shoes are also at risk.   \nSeeking medical attention for a thick toenail caused by a nail injury may aid in the proper growth of the nail. If treatment is effective, the improvement will probably come gradually. New nail growth takes months to replace the length of the nail fully.   \nThe severity of the problem determines treatment and whether the nail causes pain or trouble wearing shoes. If the illness is caused by repeated microtrauma, minimizing pressure may help, although onychogryphosis is seldom treated. The problematic nail can be clipped to make it easier to manage.\n\n【56】#### **5.**删除换行**How to Deal With Thick Toenails in the Elderly?**\n\n【57】With advancing age, it is very normal for the toenails to grow thick. This condition can be managed by improving foot hygiene, treating toenail fungal infections, or sometimes undergoing surgery for toenail removal.\n\n【58】#### **6.**删除换行**How Can Diabetics Trim Their Large Toenails?**\n\n【59】For diabetic patients, it is recommended never to cut the toenail across completely; instead, make tiny cuts. Edges can be smoothed with a nail file after making a straight cut. Never put lotion between the toes; it should be applied only on the top and bottom of the foot. Diabetic patients may take the help of a foot care professional to trim their toenails.\n\n【60】#### **7.**删除换行**How Are Thick Toenail Clippers Used?**\n\n【61】Before trimming thick toenails using nail clippers, toenails should be soaked in water to make them soft to ease the trimming procedure. If the nail is too long, use the nail clipper to cut it down. Trimming thick toenails is made considerably simpler by the nail clipper's bigger opening than typical clippers. The nail clipper can also be used to cut the nail from the top if it is extremely thick.\n\n【62】#### **8.**删除换行**How Are Thick Toenails Treated?**\n\n【63】The treatment options for the thick toenail are discussed below.  \n - Antifungal medicines if fungal infections are causing thick toenails.  \n - Laser treatment.  \n - Injections for treating psoriasis if thick toenails are due to psoriasis.  \n - Debridement to reduce the thickness of the thick toenail.\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【65】无关删除-1:<u>*   Foot Health Facts- Thick Toenails  \n    https://www.foothealthfacts.org/conditions/thick-toenails\n*   AAD- WHAT IS NAIL PSORIASIS, AND HOW CAN I TREAT IT?  \n    https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/psoriasis/treatment/genitals/nails</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Paraphimosis:**\n\n【4】It is a common andrological emergency that occurs in uncircumcised men when the foreskin of the penis becomes trapped behind the corona of the glans penis, resulting in the impossibility of positioning it back by moving it distally to its anatomic position to cover the glans.\n\n【5】**Complications and Clinical Features:**\n\n【6】This condition results in inflammation and edema formation in the foreskin, which gradually impairs venous and arterial blood flow and lymphatic drainage that occurs within a few hours or days. If it is not treated on time, ischemia and glans necrosis are the serious consequences.\n\n【7】**Management:**\n\n【8】*   Simple manual compression of the oedematous foreskin.\n*   Cut a thumb of a surgical glove, fill it with the local anesthetic cream, and place it over the penis for nearly 30 minutes to soften the oedematous skin and provide analgesia for pain relief.\n\n【9】*   Apply granulated sugar or mannitol solution around the edematous skin that alleviates edema through osmosis.\n\n【10】*   Injection of hyaluronidase directly into the edematous foreskin.\n\n【11】*   If a manual reduction is not successful, a surgical procedure is advisable.\n\n【12】**2\\. Penile Strangulation Injury:**\n\n【13】It is a rare clinical entity in which the penis is circumferentially constricted and trapped in an object, resulting in venous and arterial blood flow impairment and subsequent vasculogenic damage to the corpus cavernous (tissue of the penis responsible for erection).\n\n【14】**Complications and Clinical Features:**Prolonged and unresolved entrapment may lead to edema, ischemia, urethral-cutaneous fistula, and tissue necrosis, which may lead to penile amputation.\n\n【15】**Management:**\n\n【16】*   Local anesthesia with a standard penile block may be necessary.\n\n【17】*   Prompt attempt to remove the constricting object with an appropriate method to preserve the integrity of the involved penile structures.\n\n【18】*   To reduce excessive swelling of the glans, an incision or positioning of a needle into the glans to continuously draw blood and reduce engorgement while removing constricting objects is helpful.\n\n【19】*   A surgical procedure such as penile reconstructive surgery is the last resort if all the attempts to remove a constrictive object are unsuccessful.\n\n【20】**3\\. Penile Blunt Trauma:**\n\n【21】It refers to penile trauma from an external force. Although rare, it can happen during sexual activity, work, traffic, and sports injury.\n\n【22】**Complications and Clinical Features:**\n\n【23】It may lead to penile fracture if trauma occurs on the erect penis. Local hematoma, swelling, tip deviation, and pain are common symptoms. Long-term complications include scars at the repair site, erectile dysfunction, penile deformity, and urethral stricture.\n\n【24】**Management:**\n\n【25】*   Conservative management with compression bandages, ice pack application, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic therapy is only viable for contusions without penile fracture.\n\n【26】*   In the case of penile fracture, surgery within a few hours after blunt trauma, especially in the presence of associated urethral injury.\n\n【27】**4\\. Penile Open Trauma:**\n\n【28】This is an occurrence of penetrating wounds to the male genitalia. It is very uncommon, and most open trauma to the penis is from wars, stabbing and bullet wounds, crime, traffic accidents, animal biting injuries, burn victims, and industrial machinery.\n\n【29】**Complications and Clinical Features:**\n\n【30】Severe to mild damage to the anatomic structure of the penis. Sequelae such as infection, erectile dysfunction, loss of penile sensation, skin necrosis, urethral stricture, and penile implant failure can occur.\n\n【31】**Management:** Treatment of open penile trauma is multifaceted and complex.\n\n【32】*   Open wounds require immediate surgical exploration depending on and vary on a case.\n\n【33】*   Reconstruction includes skin flaps, immediate or staged urethroplasty, and phalloplasty to treat affected anatomical structures of the genitals.\n\n【34】*   In the case of penile amputation, the surgeon performs penile reimplantation surgery.\n\n【35】**5\\. Testicular Trauma:**\n\n【36】Trauma to the scrotum includes blunt and penetrating injuries associated with burns, bites, sports-associated trauma, traffic accidents (especially motorbikes), falls, and violent injury that can cause skin avulsions. Scrotal pain and swelling are the most common symptoms.\n\n【37】**Complications and Clinical Features:**\n\n【38】Trauma to the scrotum may result in testicular contusion, hematoma, testicular dislocation, hematocele, and testicular rupture. Long-term sequelae such as impaired fertility, hypogonadism, and chronic pain can occur in untreated or delayed treated cases.\n\n【39】**Management:**\n\n【40】*   Conservative management in mild injury includes ice pack application, anti-inflammatory drugs, painkillers, and scrotal elevation support.\n\n【41】*   Surgical management in major trauma, such as testicular rupture, large hematoma, hematocele, and penetrating injuries, mandates prompt surgical intervention.\n\n【42】*   Penetrating trauma needs the removal of non-viable tissue and reconstruction. Surgical drainage is required in case of larger hematocele and hematoma.\n\n【43】**6\\. Testicular Torsion:**\n\n【44】This is a serious and true andrology emergency that occurs due to twisting of the spermatic cord leading to venous congestion, impaired arterial blood flow, and consequent ischemia of the testis. The onset may be spontaneous, due to physical activity, or associated with scrotal trauma. It is a very commonly occurring emergency.\n\n【45】**Complications and Clinical Features:**\n\n【46】It can cause scrotal enlargement, redness, retraction of the scrotum's skin, testicular pain on palpation, proximal dislocation of the testes with or without aberrant positioning, nausea, and vomiting. Untreated or delayed treatment leads to infertility.\n\n【47】**Management:**\n\n【48】*   The surgeon attempts Manual detorsion, not intended to avoid surgical exploration but to limit the effects of prolonged ischemia while preparations for surgical intervention are underway.\n*   Surgical intervention under anesthesia is a gold standard for confirming or ruling out a diagnosis of testicular torsion and comprises the treatment of choice.\n\n【49】**7\\. Priapism:**\n\n【50】Priapism is a penile erection lasting longer than four hours without sexual stimulation. Most commonly, it is due to minimal or no arterial inflow along with complete closure of venous outflow of the corpora cavernosa.\n\n【51】**Complications and Clinical Features:**\n\n【52】This phenomenon leads to edema, inflammation, and progressive necrotic degeneration of the muscle of the penis. It can happen in someone with sickle cell disease or other hematologic diseases. The most frequent cause includes the recreational use of erectile agents, antipsychotic drugs, and trazodone. Rarely it can be caused by amyloidosis, pelvic tumors, spinal cord, or peripheral nerve injuries. It is characterized by a rigid erection often associated with penile pain.\n\n【53】**Management:**\n\n【54】*   It includes the patient’s medical history, physical examination, and penile blood gas analysis. History focuses on the onset and duration of the erection, the presence of concomitant diseases, the use of recreational drug medications, history of traumas, and previous experience of priapism. The physical examination must also include the evaluation of the abdomen.\n\n【55】*   Penile blood aspiration is done after local anesthesia to achieve a flaccid state.\n\n【56】*   Supportive therapy for underlying hematological conditions, including hydration, oxygen administration, and blood transfusions, as well as long-term therapy to prevent future episodes, is helpful.\n\n【57】*   In case of failure of the above steps, surgical management is considered. Surgical procedures are divided into shunting procedures and penile prosthesis implantation.\n\n【58】**8\\. Fournier’s Gangrene:**\n\n【59】This is a form of necrotizing fasciitis of the genital and perineal parts with concurrent thrombosis of local arteries. It leads to skin and subcutaneous tissue gangrene, sepsis, and multiple organ failure. It is often associated with morbid obesity, poor hygiene, impaired self-care ability, and low socioeconomic status.\n\n【60】**Complications and Clinical Features:**\n\n【61】Local signs and symptoms can be discoloration and ulceration of genital and perianal skin, full-on tissue necrosis with swelling, palpable crepitus, and purulent discharge, usually appearing and worsening within three to four days. There can be concurrent voiding symptoms and micturition impairment. General signs and symptoms of sepsis, such as fever, can be present.\n\n【62】**Management:**\n\n【63】*   Broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce systemic toxicity and limit the circulation of the causative microorganism.\n\n【64】*   Surgical debridement with the removal of necrotic and infected tissue is vital to halt the progression of the disease.\n\n【65】*   In the case of larger defects, plastic reconstruction techniques are mandatory to regain some of the functions of the genitals.\n\n【66】**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\n【67】True andrological emergencies include a wide range of acute genital injuries requiring immediate specialist care. Delaying or missing treatment often leads to permanent loss of function or, in some cases, losing the affected organ. Thus, these emergencies demand prompt management to recover and regain the normal sexual function of the affected individuals, as sexual functions are the key factor influencing interpersonal relationships and a person's overall health.\n\n【68】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【69】无关删除-1:<u>*   Urologic Emergencies  \n    https://cbc.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/0616SCu.pdf\n*   Penile emergencies  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10953801/\n*   Andrology  \n    https://www.longdom.org/andrology-open-access.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Olfactory (sense of smell) dysfunction is commonly due to sinonasal diseases such as nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis, traumatic injury, or viral injury. Nasal polyps are soft tissue growth on the lining of the nose and sinuses. Long-standing nasal polyps cause degenerative changes in the mucosa, which may cause impairment in the sense of smell, loss of sense of taste, runny nose, difficulty in breathing, postnasal drip, facial pain, and snoring. Sinus surgery is indicated in such cases, which has significant improvement in recovering the sense of smell, but the factors like age and gender do not affect the recovery of the sense of smell, hyposmic (partial loss of sense of smell) patients have no significant recovery, anosmic (complete loss of sense of smell) patients have remarkable improvement, and patients have good recovery in case of their first surgical treatment.\n\n【2】What Are Nasal Polyps?\n----------------------\n\n【3】Nasal polyps are soft tissue growths in teardrop shape on the lining of nasal passages and sinuses. They are painless and non-cancerous growths; large polyps may block the airway and cause breathing problems. Such nasal polyps require surgical treatment and are often associated with immune disorders, drug or other allergies, asthma, and recurrent infection. Nasal polyps are most common in middle age or young people. Left untreated, it can cause asthma flare-ups, sinus infections, and obstructive sleep apnea (a disorder where breathing is stopped for a few seconds during sleep).\n\n【4】What Are the Symptoms of Nasal Polyps?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【5】Nasal polyps are associated with swelling of the nasal passage and sinusitis (inflammation of the sinus). Symptoms of nasal polyps are:\n\n【6】*   Decreased or loss of sense of smell.\n\n【7】*   Loss of sense of taste.\n\n【8】*   Difficulty in breathing.\n\n【9】*   Runny nose.\n\n【10】*   Postnasal drip (accumulation of mucous at the back of the throat).\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Had pilonidal sinus surgery before two months.

The different types of sinus surgery are:\n\n【20】*   **Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery:** This surgery involves the removal of infected tissue and trapped mucous by widening the nasal passage between the nose and sinus, with the help of an endoscope (thin tube with a camera and light), which uses an image-guided system.\n\n【21】*   **Balloon Sinuplasty:** This surgery involves using a balloon to widen the nasal passage with the help of an endoscope and a catheter.\n\n【22】*   **Caldwell Luc Surgery:** It is indicated when there is growth in the sinus cavity. In this surgery, an opening is made in the maxillary sinus through the second molar tooth region to drain mucous from the sinuses.\n\n【23】What Are the Indications of Sinus Surgery?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【24】The indications of sinus surgery are:\n\n【25】*   Sinusitis (inflammation of the mucosal lining of the sinus, which is hollow-filled spaces in the forehead, cheeks, nasal bones, and eyes).\n\n【26】*   Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the mucosal lining of nasal passages and sinus with sudden onset of four or more episodes per year, each lasting for at least ten days).\n\n【27】*   Chronic rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the mucosal lining of nasal passages and sinus that lasts for at least twelve weeks) with or without nasal polyps.\n\n【28】*   Sinonasal polyposis with airway obstruction.\n\n【29】*   Fungal rhinosinusitis.\n\n【30】*   Paranasal sinus opacification.\n\n【31】*   Mucocele.\n\n【32】*   Benign or malignant sinonasal tumors.\n\n【33】*   Distorted anatomy of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus.\n\n【34】*   Skull base defects in case of cerebrospinal fluid leak.\n\n【35】What Is the Pathway of the Sense of Smell?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【36】The smell stimulates the neuronal receptors of the olfactory epithelium, which is connected to the olfactory bulb by thin, non-myelinated nerve fibers. These neuronal receptors are located in the upper posterior part of the nasal septum, upper parts of the central and anterior cornea, and olfactory clefts, which triggers the neural cascade through the olfactory bulb, in turn, stimulate the olfactory cortex. Any alteration in this pathway will lead to loss of sense of smell. Major causes to alter this pathway are sinonasal diseases like nasal polyps and chronic rhinosinusitis, viral infections, and traumatic injuries. In the case of nasal polyps, because of airway obstruction, the air containing the smell receptors is blocked; another cause is microbial toxins that cause injury to the olfactory system. Removing the polyps and controlling the infection improves the sense of smell.\n\n【37】Can Nasal Polyps and Sinus Surgery Affect the Sense of Smell?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Loss of sense of smell is common in patients with nasal polyps and is usually because of obstruction in the airway, and chronic infections cause injury to the olfactory organ. Patients with long-standing polyposis have an impaired sense of smell. There may be irreversible impairment in the sense of smell due to degenerative inflammatory changes of nasal and sinus mucosa, recurrent infections, and many polyp operations that cause scarring. Postoperative steroid treatment improves the sense of smell by decongesting the nasal mucosa.\n\n【39】The recovery of the sense of smell after sinus surgery treatment depends on olfactory dysfunction disease duration, details on previous medications, involved sinuses, smoking, and other associated disorders like asthma. Therefore:\n\n【40】*   Age and gender do not affect the recovery of the sense of smell.\n\n【41】*   After endoscopic rhinosinus surgery, hyposmic (partial loss of sense of smell) patients have no significant recovery, but anosmic (complete loss of sense of smell) patients have remarkable improvement. Therefore patients with a higher score of olfactory dysfunction have a higher recovery rate.\n\n【42】*   Patients who have undergone endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis also have good recovery in subjective and objective olfaction.\n\n【43】*   Patients have a good recovery after their first surgical treatment.\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】Patients with chronic nasal polyps have degenerated epithelial mucosa, which results in an impaired sense of smell. Therefore, patients with rhinosinusitis who are treated with endoscopic surgery of the nose and sinuses have an improvement in the sense of smell to a greater extent, factors like age and gender do not affect the recovery of the sense of smell, hyposmic (partial loss of sense of smell) patients have no significant recovery, anosmic (complete loss of sense of smell) patients have remarkable improvement, and patients have good recovery in case of their first surgical treatment.\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>*   Comparison of Olfactory Function before and After Endoscopic Sinus Surgery  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5787653/\n*   Sense of smell in long-standing nasal polyposis  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11453501/\n*   Nasal polyps  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nasal-polyps/symptoms-causes/syc-20351888</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "fe2f4e6c-c5eb-4ca3-b7a0-a2a8413a14e2", "title": "Prostate Cancer - Types, Diagnosis and, Staging", "text": "【0】Prostate Cancer - Types, Diagnosis and, Staging\nWhere Is the Prostate Gland Located?\n------------------------------------\n\n【1】The prostate gland is situated in front of the rectum and behind the base of the penis. The size of this gland is comparable to a walnut. The tube-like urethra, which carries urine and sperm through the penis, is encircled by the prostate gland. The primary job of the prostate is to produce the liquid in semen (seminal fluid) that nourishes, shields, and aids in the movement of sperm. As age increases, the prostate continues to grow larger. When the urethra gets clogged, a condition known as benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) might result from this. BPH is a typical disease brought on by aging. However, there is no evidence that it increases prostate cancer risk.\n\n【2】What Is Prostate Cancer?\n------------------------\n\n【3】*   Sometimes, a change in the prostate's normal cells results in their uncontrolled proliferation (high-speed growth) and development into a tumor or cancer that may be benign or malignant.\n\n【4】*   Malignancy refers to the ability of a cancerous tumor to develop and spread to other parts and regions. If a tumor is benign, it will grow in size but will not spread to other areas of the body.\n\n【5】*   Prostate cancers develop very slowly and do not readily spread to other body areas. Some forms of prostate cancer may remain for years or even decades without showing any signs or issues. It is frequently treatable, even when it has spread to other body areas.\n\n【6】*   Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer occurring among males after skin cancer. Men aged 65 years and older are diagnosed with prostate cancer. Monitoring growth over time to determine whether it is expanding slowly or rapidly is crucial for controlling it.\n\n【7】*   Therefore, even those with advanced disease may have a long lifespan of good health and quality of life.\n\n【8】*   However, cancer can result in symptoms like pain and exhaustion and occasionally cause mortality if it is not appropriately treated with current therapies. The doctor can choose the most effective treatments and when to provide them based on the growth pattern.\n\n【9】Under a microscope, histology shows how cancer cells appear. For example, the various types of cancers of the prostate gland are as follows:\n\n【10】1.  **Adenocarcinoma** - The most typical prostate cancer histology.\n\n【11】2.  **Small Cell Prostate Cancer** - Less prevalent histologically.\n\n【12】3.  **Neuroendocrine Type** - Less frequently found tumor.\n\n【13】These variations typically expand outside the prostate early, are more aggressive, and generate significantly less prostate-specific antigen (PSA).\n\n【14】What Is the Role of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The cells in the prostate gland produce a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and are released into the bloodstream. Blood tests are used to determine PSA levels. Men with prostate cancer tend to have higher-than-average PSA levels.\n\n【16】A high PSA level can also result from benign prostate enlargement or prostatitis. The inflamed or infected prostate is known as prostatitis. In addition, actions such as ejaculating might momentarily raise PSA levels. Thus, ejaculations should be avoided before a PSA test to prevent false results. Because of revised screening recommendations and reduced PSA testing, prostate cancer incidence rates fell in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Before utilizing PSA testing to screen for prostate cancer patients, one should consider the advantages and disadvantages of the procedure with the doctor.\n\n【17】How Is Prostate Cancer Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【18】**1\\. Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) -**\n\n【19】DRE is the first screening test used in conjunction with PSA testing. A digital rectal exam (DRE) is a test that checks a person's lower rectum, pelvis, and lower abdomen to discover abnormal areas of the prostate by probing the room with a finger. It offers the advantage of identifying cancers that do not secrete PSA. The positive predictive value of DRE has been approximately 50 % in research conducted since the initial assessment of its accuracy in 1956.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【21】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【22】Nasopharyngeal Cancer\n\n【23】Is prostate cancer hereditary?\n\n【24】Peritoneal Cancer - Types, Symptoms, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognosis\n\n【25】However, even in the hands of skilled examiners, it misses a significant portion of cancer cases and, when compared to PSA, it finds malignancies earlier in the pathological process. In fact, in the pre-PSA era, 75 % of men with prostate cancer who had a DRE diagnosis subsequently passed away from their condition.\n\n【26】**2\\. Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Test -**\n\n【27】The initial description of PSA, a serine protease, was made in 1979. It is an organ-specific biomarker that is not cancer-specific and has shown promise as a diagnostic aid for benign epithelial tumors. The researchers determined the initial reference range between 4 and 10 ng/mL. In addition, age-specific cutoff thresholds are created to strengthen the test's specificity because benign epithelium production rises with advancing years.\n\n【28】While age-specific levels make PSA easy for spotting cancer in younger people, they lessen the test's sensitivity in older men, especially for early-stage and treatable cancers.\n\n【29】The value of PSA density (PSAD = PSA \\[ng mL-1\\] divided by prostate volume \\[mL\\]) has been studied to increase test specificity. Compared to total blood PSA, a PSAD of > 0.15 enhances the specificity of prostate cancer diagnosis, while the ideal cutoff remains debatable.\n\n【30】**3\\. Biomarker Testing -**\n\n【31】A biomarker is a chemical that may be found in a cancer patient's blood, urine, or tissues in the body. The body produces it in reaction to cancer or as a result of the tumor. A tumor marker is another name for a biomarker. The prostate health index (PHI), a biomarker test for prostate cancer, and the 4K score, which determines a person's likelihood of having high-risk prostate cancer, are examples of such tests.\n\n【32】A genetic test, such as Oncotype Dx prostate, polaris, decipher, or promark, might occasionally give extra information for men who have received a prostate cancer diagnosis through biopsy to help with management decisions. It can also help low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer patients considering active surveillance.\n\n【33】Additionally, it can entail performing the decipher test to determine whether additional therapy should be taken into account in some individuals after prostate surgery or prostatectomy. Finally, the professional should continuously assess the outcomes with all other relevant data. For additional information about biomarker testing, what they signify, and how the results may or may not influence the treatment plan, it is suggested to consult the doctor.\n\n【34】What Are the Grades and Stages of Prostate Cancer?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】The staging of cancer is a method of defining the location of cancer, its spread, and its impact on other body parts. Cancer staging may not be established until all diagnostic tests are described. However, knowledge of these stages aids the doctor in recommending the best course of action and assists in determining the prognosis, or likelihood of recovery, for a patient.\n\n【36】For prostate cancer, there are two staging methods:\n\n【37】**1\\. Clinical Staging -** Based on the digital rectal exam (DRE) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA)tests. These tests will help to determine if additional tests like X-rays, bone scans, CT (computed tomography) scans, or MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) are required to provide further information on the clinical stage.\n\n【38】**2\\. Pathologic Staging -** This is based on information obtained by pathology reports of the prostate tissue removed during surgery. For pathologic staging, examination of the excised lymph nodes for the pathologic stage may also yield further information.\n\n【39】**TNM Staging System:**\n\n【40】The American Joint Committee (AJC) on cancer devised this approach to specify the stage of the tumor.\n\n【41】*   **A Tumor (T):** What is the size of the primary tumor? In which location is it present?\n\n【42】*   **Node (N):** Have the lymph nodes been affected by the tumor? In such a case, how many and where?\n\n【43】*   **Metastasis (M):** Has cancer metastasized (M) to other body organs? If so, how much and where?\n\n【44】The combined findings are used to establish the cancer stage. Stage 0 (zero) and stages I through IV comprise the five steps. For clinicians to collaborate and develop the most effective treatment plans, the stage offers a traditional manner of classifying cancer.\n\n【45】**Stage I:**\n\n【46】*   Cancer tends to develop slowly at this stage.\n\n【47】*   The prostate is affected on one side, or even less, and the tumor cannot be felt.\n\n【48】*   The PSA level is low. The cancer cells mimic normal appearance.\n\n【49】**Stage II:**\n\n【50】*   Only the prostate is affected by the tumor.\n\n【51】*   PSA levels are either low or medium.\n\n【52】*   Although stage II prostate cancer is modest, it may be more likely to progress and spread.\n\n【53】**Stage IIA:**\n\n【54】*   The prostate is only partially affected by the tumor, which cannot be noticed.\n\n【55】*   The cancer cells are highly differentiated, and PSA levels are moderate.\n\n【56】*   As long as the cancer cells are highly differentiated, this giant tumor is identified solely in the prostate.\n\n【57】**Stage IIB:**\n\n【58】*   The tumor is exclusively located inside the prostate and could be large enough to be evaluated during DRE.\n\n【59】*   The PSA is at a modest level.\n\n【60】*   The differentiation of the cancer cells might be moderate.\n\n【61】**Stage IIC:**\n\n【62】*   The tumor is exclusively located inside the prostate and could be large enough to be evaluated during DRE.\n\n【63】*   The PSA is at a modest level.\n\n【64】*   The differentiation of the cancer cells might be low or moderate.\n\n【65】**Stage III:**\n\n【66】*   The tumor is expanding; the PSA values are high.\n\n【67】*   They all point to a locally advanced malignancy that will continue to develop and spread.\n\n【68】**Stage III A:**\n\n【69】*   Cancer tissue has invaded the prostate's outer layer.\n\n【70】*   The seminal vesicles may have also been affected.\n\n【71】*   As a result, the PSA level is elevated.\n\n【72】**Stage III B:**\n\n【73】*   The tumor has invaded the prostate gland, which may also have spread to the bladder or rectum.\n\n【74】**Stage III C:**\n\n【75】*   The cancer cells have little to no differentiation, meaning they do not resemble healthy cells.\n\n【76】**Stage IV:**\n\n【77】*   Cancer has spread outside of the prostate gland.\n\n【78】**Stage IVA:**\n\n【79】*   Cancer has reached the local lymph nodes.\n\n【80】**Stage IV B:**\n\n【81】*   Cancer has progressed to the bones, distant lymph nodes, or other organs.\n\n【82】What Is the Rate of Recurrence of Prostate Cancer?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【83】Cancer that has returned after therapy is referred to as recurrent prostate cancer. It could recur in the prostate region or elsewhere in the body. If cancer does come back, more tests will be performed by the doctor to determine the amount of the recurrence. These examinations and scans frequently resemble those carried out during the first diagnosis.\n\n【84】**Conclusion**\n\n【85】The current focus of diagnostic efforts must be on detecting early-stage malignancies that offer a significant danger to life expectancy and quality of life. Improved clinical staging methodologies are required for more precise prediction of disease stages and, more importantly, for distinguishing responses to various treatment modalities. In addition, medical advancements must concentrate on areas that will most effectively lower the high mortality and morbidity currently connected with this illness since prostate cancer continues to be a severe health burden.\n\n【86】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【87】无关删除-1:<u>*   Prostate cancer: diagnosis and staging  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3735216/\n*   Prostate Cancer Stages  \n    https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/staging.html\n*   Prostate Cancer Stages  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/prostate-cancer/prostate-cancer-stages</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "039ef3a1-fff5-4c3e-99a5-035eed3c969a", "title": "Clozapine Toxicity: How to Identify and Treat It", "text": "【0】Clozapine Toxicity: How to Identify and Treat It\nWhat Is Clozapine?\n------------------\n\n【1】Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug used to treat mental conditions like schizophrenia (a severe mental disorder affecting a person's behavior, thoughts, and feelings), schizoaffective disorder, recurrent suicidal behavior, etc. Clozapine is frequently used in the case of schizophrenia patients who do not respond to therapy with other antipsychotic drugs. Clozapine works by aiding in restoring the neurotransmitter balance in the brain. An antipsychotic medication called Clozapine helps to regulate the amount of dopamine and other chemicals in the brain. When dopamine activity is excessive, Clozapine decreases it and alleviates symptoms like hallucinations and suicidal behavior. Although Clozapine can be helpful for certain patients, there are also health hazards associated with drug usage. In particular, Clozapine can reduce the number of neutrophils, a kind of white blood cell that helps the body fight infections. Other side effects of the drug include myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscles), seizures (electrical disturbance in the brain), metabolic syndrome (a set of medical conditions that increases the risk of various diseases), etc.\n\n【2】Why Is Clozapine Used?\n----------------------\n\n【3】Although Clozapine is FDA (The United States Food and Drug Administration) approved, it is not frequently used because of the various side effects associated with the disease and the risk of Clozapine toxicity. However, the drug can be used in the following conditions when other antipsychotic drugs fail to show any effective results:\n\n【4】*   **Schizophrenia**: A mental condition characterized by an inability to interpret reality and altered thinking, behavior, and expressions.\n\n【5】*   **Suicidal Behavior**: People who have attempted suicide are prone to attempt suicide or cause injury to themselves again.\n\n【6】How Should Clozapine Be Taken?\n------------------------------\n\n【7】*   Clozapine is available in oral suspension, tablets, and disintegrated tablets. And it should be taken orally as prescribed by the physician.\n\n【8】*   The drug must be taken after a doctor’s recommendation, and the dosage should be followed as directed.\n\n【9】*   Clozapine should be taken at the same time every day, and the drug should not be taken more or less than prescribed.\n\n【10】*   The FDA recommends a daily dose of 900 mg (milligram) of Clozapine as the maximum recommended dosage. The typical dose is 400 mg daily for men and 300 mg per day for women.\n\n【11】*   Clozapine intake should not be suddenly stopped without a doctor’s consultation. Doctors usually reduce the dosage gradually before completely stopping the medication.\n\n【12】What Are the Precautions That Should Be Taken Before Taking Clozapine?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The following precautions must be considered before taking Clozapine:\n\n【14】*   The healthcare provider must be informed about allergies to Clozapine or any ingredient present in the medicine. Any other pre-existing drug allergies should also be notified to the healthcare provider.\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Trimipramine - Uses, Dosage, Precautions, and Adverse Reactions</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Doxepin - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Warnings, and Precautions</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Busulfan - Dosages, Indication, Side Effects, and Warnings</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Any prescription and non-prescription drugs, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products taken must be reported to the doctor and pharmacist. For example, suppose the patient takes any of the following medicines; it should be reported to the doctor so that appropriate measures can be taken to adjust the dosage of the drugs to prevent any toxicity or side effects:\n    </u>\n\n【16】Diphenhydramine (antihistamine), Ciprofloxacin (antibiotic), Erythromycin, Benztropine, Cimetidine, Bupropion, Cyclobenzaprine, antihypertensive drugs, anti-anxiety drugs, drugs for other mental conditions, oral contraceptives, drugs for seizures, etc.\n\n【17】*   If any of the close relatives or family members had suffered from prolonged QT interval (a rare cardiac condition that could result in irregular heartbeat, dizziness, or untimely death) or is suffering from diabetes, it must be immediately informed to the doctor. In addition, other health problems like urinary system problems, prostate problems, nausea, constipation, abdominal distension, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, liver diseases, kidney diseases, lung diseases, glaucoma (a set of eye disorders that affects vision), etc. should also be notified to the doctor.\n\n【18】*   If a patient is pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant, they should inform their doctor immediately, especially if they are in the last few months of their pregnancy. If Clozapine is taken in the last months of pregnancy, it may have adverse effects on babies after birth.\n\n【19】*   Drinking alcohol and smoking should be avoided while taking Clozapine because alcohol can add to the drowsiness caused by the drug, and smoking or tobacco consumption can reduce drug efficiency.\n\n【20】*   Hyperglycemia may be experienced while taking Clozapine, even in nondiabetic patients. Therefore, if symptoms like increased thirst, frequent urination, increased appetite, weakness, lethargy, blurred vision, etc. are experienced, then the doctor must be immediately informed.\n\n【21】*   It is crucial to inform the doctor as soon as certain symptoms are experienced because increased blood sugar levels can result in a severe condition known as ketoacidosis. If ketoacidosis is not treated right away, it could become life-threatening. Dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, fruity-smelling breath, and diminished consciousness are all signs of ketoacidosis.\n\n【22】What Are the Side Effects Caused by Clozapine?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Clozapine can cause the following side effects:\n\n【24】*   Drowsiness or sleepiness.\n\n【25】*   Impaired balance and feeling dizzy.\n\n【26】*   Headaches.\n\n【27】*   Restlessness.\n\n【28】*   Increased salivation.\n\n【29】*   Dryness of mouth.\n\n【30】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【31】*   Constipation.\n\n【32】*   Stomach distension and swelling.\n\n【33】*   Loss of bladder control.\n\n【34】*   Fainting.\n\n【35】*   Confusion.\n\n【36】*   Muscle stiffness.\n\n【37】*   Profuse sweating.\n\n【38】*   Altered behavior.\n\n【39】*   Unusual bleeding and bruising.\n\n【40】*   Decreased appetite.\n\n【41】*   Lack of energy.\n\n【42】Other adverse effects include:\n\n【43】*   **Agranulocytosis**: Agranulocytosis can be defined as the reduced number of agranulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils) in the blood that increases the susceptibility to infections. Patients who take Clozapine have a one percent risk of developing agranulocytosis. Most cases require close monitoring of blood absolute neutrophil counts since they typically arise early in the course of treatment, between six weeks and six months.\n\n【44】*   **Myocarditis**: Myocarditis can be defined as the inflammation or swelling of the heart muscles that can cause a reduction in the pumping of blood, shortness of breath, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, etc. Less than three percent of patients will experience Clozapine-induced myocarditis. However, the first four weeks of treatment are when patients experience this fatal, dose-independent side effect more frequently. Myocarditis symptoms in these patients can range from a flu-like illness to respiratory and cardiovascular problems.\n\n【45】*   **Metabolic Syndrome**: A metabolic syndrome is a group of ailments that coexist and raise the risk of developing heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Due to increased insulin resistance, Clozapine is linked to considerable weight gain, type 2 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, and elevated lipid levels. However, it is crucial to note that metabolic syndrome development may also be influenced by other variables, such as a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n【46】*   **Seizures**: The seizure threshold may be lowered by Clozapine in both epilepsy patients and normal subjects. The danger may be more common in younger individuals and is often dose-dependent, ranging from one to six percent.\n\n【47】*   **Pulmonary Embolism**: Pulmonary embolism is the blockage of one of the pulmonary arteries due to a blood clot. Clozapine increases platelet adhesion and aggregation in a recent study that included several other antipsychotics. Pregnant women and older patients who are taking high doses appear to be at greater risk.\n\n【48】What Is Clozapine Toxicity?\n---------------------------\n\n【49】*   The degree of harm that the drug can do to an organism is referred to as Clozapine toxicity. Clozapine toxicity is dose-dependent, and it might affect the whole system.\n\n【50】*   Clozapine is only accessible through a unique restricted distribution method due to the risks associated with using this medicine. Therefore, the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) Program was established by the Clozapine producers to ensure that users do not take the medication without the required monitoring.\n\n【51】*   Clozapine can cause serious blood problems. Before starting treatment, throughout treatment, and for at least four weeks after treatment, the doctor will order specific lab tests. Once per week at the start, the doctor will order the lab tests; as the treatment progresses, the frequency of tests may decrease.\n\n【52】*   The doctor should be immediately informed if the following symptoms are experienced- extreme fatigue, drowsiness, weakness, fever, chills, or other flu- or infection-related symptoms; abnormal vaginal discharge or vaginal itching; mouth and throat sores; delayed healing of wounds; burning or painful sensation while urinating; sores or discomfort in or around the rectum; stomach pain.\n\n【53】*   Several dose-dependent side effects, like myocarditis, pulmonary embolism, metabolic syndrome, agranulocytosis, seizures, constipation, etc. may occur due to Clozapine toxicity or Clozapine overdose.\n\n【54】What Should Be Done in Case of Clozapine Toxicity?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】Symptoms of Clozapine toxicity include; extreme drowsiness, fainting, slowed breathing, unconsciousness, altered breathing, etc. If these symptoms are experienced by an individual, then the emergency helpline should be immediately contacted. The patient must be immediately taken to the ER (emergency room), and medical aid should be given. If not treated on time, Clozapine toxicity can be fatal.\n\n【56】**Conclusion**:\n\n【57】Due to its numerous fatal side effects, many practitioners are reluctant to prescribe Clozapine for patient safety reasons. Agranulocytosis, a side effect of clozapine that necessitates stopping treatment and seeing a hematologist, is one of the biggest worries. However, there are several other effects of toxicity that require immediate treatment and management. In addition, Clozapine toxicity can be fatal if the symptoms are ignored and medical aid is not given promptly.\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>*   Information on Clozapine  \n    https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/information-clozapine\n*   Clozapine  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a691001.html\n*   Clozapine  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535399/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The drug is available as an inhalation therapy which should be used once daily or as a fixed-dose combination with the long-acting beta 2-agonist Vilanterol. Umeclidinium inhibits the binding of acetylcholine and thus opens up the airway by preventing bronchoconstriction in cases of COPD (chronic pulmonary disease). Umeclidinium is clinically significant and also sustains improvements in lung function. It is also used in the treatment of bronchitis and emphysema.\n\n【2】**Warnings for the Use of Umeclidinium:**\n\n【3】*   The drug should be avoided if the patient is allergic to it or severely allergic to milk protein.\n\n【4】*   Umeclidinium is not a fast-acting inhalation drug for bronchospasm and does not work immediately after administration. Thus in cases of acute bronchospasm, it is important to take a fast acting drug.\n\n【5】*   Umeclidinium should not be taken if the breathing problem does not improve after taking a few initial doses.\n\n【6】What Is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The symptoms of COPD are difficulty breathing, sputum (mucus) production, cough, and wheezing. Patients suffering from chronic obstructuve pulmonary disease (COPD) develop an increased risk of diseases to the heart, lungs, and some other organs.\n\n【8】**Causes of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease**\n\n【9】*   The most common cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is long-term exposure to irritating gasses or particulate matter.\n\n【10】*   Diseases that can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Emphysema is a lung disorder in which the air sacs of the lungs are damaged, leading to shortness of breath. Chronic bronchitis is prolonged inflammation in the bronchi of the lungs. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis occur together and lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary obstruction.\n\n【11】**Symptoms Seen in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease**\n\n【12】*   **Wheezing:** Coarse rattle or shrill whistle is heard when the airway is partially blocked.\n\n【13】*   Shortness of breath, particularly during physical activities.\n\n【14】*   Chest tightness or stiffness.\n\n【15】*   Lack of energy and fatigue.\n\n【16】*   Respiratory infections are frequent.\n\n【17】*   Chronic cough produces clear, white, greenish, or yellow mucus.\n\n【18】*   In later stages, the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may lead to unintentional weight loss.\n\n【19】*   Swellings in the ankles, feet, or legs.\n\n【20】**More About the Drug:**\n\n【21】For Patients:\n-------------\n\n【22】Before Starting the Drug Umeclidinium:\n--------------------------------------\n\n【23】Some of the conditions which should be mentioned to the doctor or the pharmacist before starting the drug are:\n\n【24】*   Allergies due to any drug or Umeclidinium.\n\n【25】*   Allergies to milk proteins such as whey or casein.\n\n【26】*   **Glaucoma:** It is an eye disease that leads to vision loss in one or both eyes. It is caused due to fluid build-up behind the eye, which puts pressure on the optic nerve and damages it. There are two types of glaucoma which are open angle and closed angle. Open-angle glaucoma is when the blockage due to fluid is not seen in the tests, whereas closed-angle glaucoma is when the blockage is seen in the tests.\n\n【27】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What is the treatment and life expectancy for chronic bronchitis?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Why do I have chronic cough even after quitting smoking?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Is the antibiotic prescribed to my dad appropriate?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Heart diseases such as heart attack or congestive heart failure.\n\n【28】*   Urination problems may make it difficult to excrete the drug outside the body.\n\n【29】*   Enlarged prostate due to an increase in the number of prostate cells.

The prescription label should also be read properly before starting the drug.\n\n【34】*   The drug should be taken every day at the same time and not more than once in 24 hours.\n\n【35】*   The dose should be taken strictly, as the healthcare professional advice; overdosing should be avoided.\n\n【36】*   Umeclidinium should not be considered a rescue medicine for bronchospasm attacks. It is not a fast-acting inhalation medicine so it should not be used in cases of acute breathing attacks.\n\n【37】*   The inhaler device should not be cleaned or opened apart as it may damage the drug.\n\n【38】**Storage and Disposal:** The drug should be stored at room temperature away from moisture and away from the reach of children. The inhaler device should be in a sealed foil tray before it is used. The inhaler should be thrown away after six weeks of opening or when the dose indicator shows a zero on the inhaler.\n\n【39】What if a Dose of Umeclidinium Is Missed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【40】If the dose of the drug is missed, it is advised to take it as soon as possible, but if the time is almost for the next dose, it is advised to avoid the dose and take the next dose. Two doses of the drug should not be taken at a time.\n\n【41】What Should Be Avoided While Using Umeclidinium?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】Any other bronchodilator which may contain Aclidinium, Arformoterol, Indacaterol, Olodaterol, Tiotropium, or Salmeterol should not be used while using Umeclidinium.\n\n【43】Side Effects of Umeclidinium:\n-----------------------------\n\n【44】Some of the common side effects shown by Umeclidinium are:\n\n【45】*   Cold symptoms include a stuffy nose, sore throat, sneezing, and cough.\n\n【46】*   Bruised or darkened skin color.\n\n【47】*   Irregular and fast heartbeats.\n\n【48】*   Pain in muscles or joints.\n\n【49】*   Stomach pain.\n\n【50】*   Changed senses of taste.\n\n【51】Some of the serious side effects caused by Umeclidinium are:\n\n【52】*   Choking or wheezing or any other breathing issue after using Umeclidinium.\n\n【53】*   Blurred vision, eye pain, vomiting, and nausea.\n\n【54】*   Seeing halos or bright colors around lights.\n\n【55】*   Frequent urination which can be painful and difficult.\n\n【56】*   Allergic reactions leading to hives, rashes, difficulty in breathing, swelling of the face, tongue, or lip, and itching.\n\n【57】It is advised to call the doctor immediately if there are any of these serious side effects seen after taking Umeclidinium.\n\n【58】Some of the less common side effects of Umeclidinium are:\n\n【59】*   Chest pain.\n\n【60】*   Chills.\n\n【61】*   Body pain.\n\n【62】*   Cough.\n\n【63】*   Bladder pain.\n\n【64】*   Dryness or soreness of the throat.\n\n【65】*   Ear congestion.\n\n【66】*   Fever.\n\n【67】*   Burning sensation while urinating.\n\n【68】*   Loss of voice.\n\n【69】*   Trouble swallowing.\n\n【70】*   Tender and swollen glands in the neck.\n\n【71】*   Voice changes\n\n【72】*   Tightness or stiffness in the chest.\n\n【73】**Dosage of Umeclidinium:** The adult dose for Umeclidinium for the maintenance of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is one inhalation of 62.5 mcg orally once a day. The maximum dose which can be taken is one inhalation every 24 hours.\n\n【74】What Drugs Can Affect Umeclidinium?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【75】*   Medications that treat depression, anxiety, mental illness, and mood disorders.\n\n【76】*   Medicines for colds and allergies, such as Benadryl.\n\n【77】*   Medications that treat Parkinson’s disease.\n\n【78】*   Drugs that treat stomach problems, motion sickness, or irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n【79】*   Drugs that treat overactive bladder.\n\n【80】*   Any other bronchodilators such as Aclidinium or Tiotropium.\n\n【81】For doctors:\n------------\n\n【82】**Indication:** Umeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist used to treat and maintain chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Umeclidinium is either used as once-daily inhalation monotherapy or as a fixed-dose combination product with long-acting beta2-agonist Vilanterol.\n\n【83】**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n【84】Umeclidinium is a long-acting antimuscarinic agent which can also be referred to as anticholinergic. The drug has a similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptor M1 to M5. In case of airways, it shows pharmacological effects by inhibiting the M3 receptor in the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation.\n\n【85】**Absorption:**\n\n【86】Cmax for Umeclidinium occurred at 5 minutes to 15 minutes with concentrations in 14 days with 1.8 fold accumulations.\n\n【87】**Protein Binding:**\n\n【88】The plasma protein binding capacity of Umeclidinium is almost 89 %.\n\n【89】**Metabolism:**\n\n【90】Umeclidinium is primarily metabolized by the enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). It is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein transporter. The primary route of the metabolites of Umeclidinium is oxidative (including hydroxylation or O-dealkylation) followed by conjugation (glucuronidation). This results in a range of metabolites with either reduced pharmacological activity or for which the pharmacological activity is not established. The systemic exposure to the metabolites of Umeclidinium is low.\n\n【91】**Route of Elimination:**\n\n【92】The elimination of the drug was traced by radiolabeling which showed that 58 % of the drugs were eliminated in the feces and 22 % in the urine.\n\n【93】**Half-Life of Umeclidinium:**\n\n【94】The effective half-life of Umeclidinium after one dose every day is 11 hours.\n\n【95】**Toxicity:**\n\n【96】The most common adverse effects seen by Umeclidinium are nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, and cough. The drug should be used safely in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma or those suffering from prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction. Sometimes the inhaled medication can lead to bronchospasm, which can be fatal.\n\n【97】**Drug Interactions:**\n\n【98】*   **Acebutolol:** It is a selective beta-1 receptor antagonist used to manage ventricular premature beats and hypertension in adults. The metabolism of Umeclidinium reduces when it is combined with Acebutolol.\n\n【99】*   **Acetazolamide:** It is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can be used in edema due to heart failure or some types of medications. The drug has the tendency to increase the central nervous system depressant activities of Umeclidinium.\n\n【100】*   **Amitriptyline:** It is a tricyclic antidepressant which is used for the treatment of endogenous or psychotic depressive illness. The chances of adverse effects of Umeclidinium increase when it is used with Amitriptyline.\n\n【101】*   **Castor Oil:** The therapeutic efficiency of castor oil reduces when it is used along with Umeclidinium.\n\n【102】*   **Cocaine:** It is an ester local anesthesia that is used in diagnostic procedures or surgeries in or through the nasal cavities.The risk of developing adverse effects due to Umeclidinium increases when it is combined with cocaine.\n\n【103】*   **Dobutamine:** It is a beta-1 agonist which is used to treat cardiac decompression in patients with cardiac surgery or organic heart disease. The risk of tachycardia increases when Dobutamine is combined with Umeclidinium.\n\n【104】*   **Fostemsavir:** It is an antiretroviral HIV-1 attachment inhibitor. The serum concentration of Fostemsavir increases when it is combined with Umeclidinium.\n\n【105】*   **Levocetirizine:** It is an H1-receptor antagonist which is used to treat symptoms that are associated with chronic allergic rhinitis and urticaria. Levocetirizine increases the central nervous system activities of Umeclidinium.\n\n【106】*   **Lovastatin:** It is a drug used to lower down low-density lipids (LDL) and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The metabolism of Umeclidinium may reduce when it is combined with Lovastatin.\n\n【107】**Clinical Trials of Umeclidinium:**\n\n【108】*   Study done to evaluate the effect of Umeclidinium as a combination therapy in subjects suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n【109】**Description:** It is a multicenter, randomized, parallel, and double-blind group study done to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of Umeclidinium when it is given once daily by dry powder inhaler (DPI) to long acting beta-2-agonist twice daily compared to placebo by dry powder inhaler added to long acting beta2-agonist/ inhaled corticosteroids therapy over a treatment period of 12 weeks in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n【110】**Process of Study:** The subjects who match the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned one of the following blinded study regimens for treatment in equal proportion (1:1) Umeclidinium 62.5 mcg once daily and placebo once daily. About 230 subjects will be randomized to complete around 206 evaluable subjects. The total duration of the studies will be about 14 weeks for each patient.\n\n【111】**Actual Enrollment:** 236\n\n【112】**Allocation:** Randomized.\n\n【113】*   Study done to see the efficacy of Umeclidinium or Vilanterol with Tiotropium or Olodaterol in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n【114】**Brief Summary:** The main objective of the study is to assess the effect of Umeclidinium or Vilanterol versus Tiotropium or Olodateral in patients suffering from moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This study is a multicenter, randomized, two period crossover complete block design, and open-label.\n\n【115】**Process of Study:** Eligible patients who completed a two week run-in period will be randomly given sequence containing Umeclidinium or Vilanterol inhalation powder (62.5/25 mcg once daily) which is administered as one inhalation by the ELLIPTA inhaler and Tiotropium or Olodaterol is given in 5/5 mcg dose via inhaler as two inhalations by the RESPIMAT inhaler for eight weeks each. This is followed by a three-week washout and then one week follow-up period. The total duration of the study is 22 weeks.\n\n【116】ELLIPTA is a registered trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies, and RESPIMAT is a registered trademark of Boehringer Ingelheim.\n\n【117】**Actual Enrollment:** 236 participants.\n\n【118】**Allocation:** Randomized.\n\n【119】**Umeclidinium and Pregnancy:** Animal studies showed no signs of teratogenicity in them at approximately 200 times the inhalation of human daily inhaled dose of Umeclidinium during organogenesis. Thus no studies are present to prove any adverse effects of Umeclidinium during pregnancy.\n\n【120】**Umeclidinium and Breastfeeding:** There is no published data about the use of Umeclidinium during breastfeeding; however, it produces low systemic maternal serum levels, and any drugs in the breast milk are not likely to be absorbed by the baby. Thus the risk to the breastfed baby of maternal Umeclidinium inhalation is very small.\n\n【121】**Umeclidinium and Geriatric Patients:** The doses of Umeclidinium are the same for geriatric patients as for younger individuals. There is no adverse effect of Umeclidinium used in older patients.\n\n【122】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【123】* * *\n\n【124】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is Umeclidinium?**\n\n【125】Umeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist drug that can be used for long-term maintenance and treatment of airflow obstruction in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n【126】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is the Use of Umeclidinium?**\n\n【127】Umeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist used to treat and maintain chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Some women cannot get pregnant at the most fertile stage of their lives for various reasons, such as cancer, a medical condition affecting their fertility, or they wish to get pregnant later in life. Egg freezing, also known as oocyte cryopreservation, is a blessing for such women. Egg freezing is a great development in the field of assisted reproductive technology(ART). The first birth from a frozen oocyte successfully happened in 1986. This technology has offered acceptable pregnancy outcomes since then. However, it does have some challenges and risks. This article discusses egg freezing and related issues in detail.\n\n【2】What Is Egg Freezing?\n---------------------\n\n【3】Egg freezing or oocyte is a method of preserving women’s ability to get pregnant in the future. A woman is born with a certain number of eggs, and no more eggs are produced after birth. The chances of getting pregnant naturally decrease as she gets older because the number and quality of eggs drop. Egg freezing can be done to preserve fertility when the woman is young, and the quality of eggs is the highest. It involves extracting a woman’s eggs and freezing and storing them to preserve her reproductive potential. It is a boon for women who wish to delay pregnancy due to personal, medical, professional, financial, or psychological reasons but preserve their fertility in case of anticipated decline. It is generally an option for women under 38 years who wish to have genetically related children at a future date. Most women who opt for egg freezing attempt it in their early 30s.\n\n【4】Egg freezing is different from embryo freezing or embryo cryopreservation. Embryo freezing involves freezing the fertilized egg called embryo (an egg is fertilized by a sperm and forms an embryo). Whereas egg freezing does not require sperm to fertilize eggs, and unfertilized, mature eggs are frozen and stored.\n\n【5】Who Needs Egg Freezing?\n-----------------------\n\n【6】Egg freezing is an option for those women who are not ready to get pregnant now but want to conceive in the future and become genetic parents. Women can consider egg freezing for various reasons, such as:\n\n【7】*   Surgery that can cause damage to the ovaries.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Will my internal bleeding and laparoscopic surgery after egg retrieval for freezing make me infertile?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Side Effects of Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy on Sexuality and Fertility</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    In case of ovarian cyst, will they remove the entire ovary?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Cancer treatment, such as pelvic radiation therapy or chemotherapy, can affect fertility.\n\n【9】*   Ovarian disease with risk of ovary damage.\n\n【10】*   Chromosomal abnormalities or a family history of early menopause cause a risk of premature ovarian failure.\n\n【11】*   Genetic mutations may require the removal of ovaries.\n\n【12】*   Fertility preservation for personal or social reasons to delay pregnancy.\n    </u>\n\n【13】How to Prepare for Egg Freezing?\n--------------------------------\n\n【14】Those women who are considering egg freezing should look for a fertility clinic with a high success rate and expertise in the field. Professionals specializing in this field are called reproductive endocrinologists. Before starting the egg-freezing process, a woman is likely to undergo tests such as ovarian reserve testing, blood test, ultrasound, and infectious disease screening. Ovarian reserve testing to check for the quality and quantity of eggs by testing the concentration of estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone in the blood on the third of the menstrual cycle. A pelvic ultrasound and blood tests will be done to get complete detail of ovarian function. These tests decide whether the women can go for egg freezing or not. Infectious disease screening is done to screen for diseases such as hepatitis B, C, and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and prevent the affected egg sample from contaminating the other samples by storing them separately.\n\n【15】How Are Human Eggs Retrieved and Frozen?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【16】The complete process of egg freezing involves three different stages - ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, and freezing.\n\n【17】**1\\. Ovarian Stimulation**\\- The woman is given certain medications, which are synthetic hormones to stimulate the ovaries to boost egg production and help the eggs mature. Typically one egg is released by an ovary monthly. Medications are given in injectable form for ovarian stimulation and to prevent premature ovulation. The doctor will monitor the body’s response to these medications during this phase through blood tests. Follow-up visits include vaginal ultrasounds to determine the development of ovarian follicles (the sacs where the eggs mature). After 10 to 14 days, when the follicles are ready for egg retrieval, another medication is injected to help the eggs mature.\n\n【18】**2\\. Egg Retrieval**\\- This procedure is done under sedation or general anesthesia. The common approach adopted for this procedure is transvaginal ultrasound aspiration, which involves inserting an ultrasound probe through the vagina to identify the follicles. Then a needle is guided through the vagina into the follicle. Using a suction device connected to the needle, the eggs are removed from the follicle. Up to 15 eggs per cycle can be retrieved, although it is not always possible for women with low ovarian reserve or low egg count. Studies suggest that the more eggs retrieved, the better the chances of birth. After the egg retrieval, the woman may feel cramps, feeling of pressure, or fullness, which might continue for weeks as the ovaries remain enlarged.\n\n【19】**3\\. Freezing**\\- Immediately after the unfertilized eggs are retrieved, they are cooled at subzero temperatures for preservation and future use. Vitrification is a term commonly used for egg freezing. High concentrations of substances called cryoprotectants that prevent the formation of ice crystals during the freezing process are used for rapid cooling. Unfertilized eggs are a bit more difficult to freeze and lead to a successful pregnancy than a fertilized egg (embryo).\n\n【20】**4\\. After the Procedure**\\- Women can resume their normal activities after a week of egg retrieval. They should avoid unprotected sex to prevent unintentional pregnancy. The doctor should be contacted immediately if one experiences high body temperature (fever), severe abdominal pain, difficulty urinating, heavy vaginal bleeding, or weight gain of more than two pounds in 24 hours.\n\n【21】How Are Frozen Human Eggs Used in the Future?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【22】When the woman is ready to get pregnant and use the frozen eggs, these cryopreserved eggs are assessed after placing them in the warming solution. The eggs that survive the freezing process are fertilized with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), which involves injecting a single sperm directly into the egg. The fertilized eggs will then grow in the culture until the embryo is ready to transfer into the uterus. This is called in vitro fertilization (IVF) method to achieve pregnancy.\n\n【23】How Successful Is Egg Freezing?\n-------------------------------\n\n【24】The process of egg freezing has evolved over decades and has shown some promising results. Egg freezing is a relatively new technique and does have much data on success rate, but clinical pregnancy rates are approximately estimated between four to 12 percent per egg. However, its success rate depends on various factors that include the age of women at the time of egg freezing, the method of cryopreservation or freezing, and the total number of eggs frozen. Age while egg freezing is the most critical factor. There is no clear-cut recommendation, but freezing done at a younger age maximizes the quality and quantity of eggs that can give better results and high success rates. Egg freezing at the advanced stage requires multiple egg retrieval cycles and hence increasing the mental, physical and financial burden on the women undergoing the process. Studies have shown that egg freezing is less beneficial at ages 25 to 30 years as women of this age group are less likely to utilize the frozen eggs in the future, and it provides maximum benefits to women of ages 32 to 37 years.\n\n【25】What Are the Risks of Pregnancy at an Advanced Age?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】There are medical risks for the women and their future children associated with pregnancy at an advanced age, which is expected delivery after 35 years of age. IVF is generally a safe procedure, although some women might experience side effects. The major risk of the procedure is that it might not work and give the expected results. All the risks should be communicated to women who opt for egg freezing. The medical risk to women and their offspring include:\n\n【27】*   **Risk to Women**\\- The risks related to egg retrieval procedure include infection, bleeding, and a small risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (due to excessive response to hormones, the ovaries swell and leak fluid in the body). Women at an advanced age are at high risk of developing gestational diabetes, cesarean delivery, preeclampsia (a serious pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure), and preterm delivery of a baby with low birth weight. These risks differ widely depending on the health status of women and maternal age at the time of delivery.\n\n【28】*   **Risk to Offspring**\\- Along with premature birth and low birth weight, there are incidences of risk of congenital structural abnormalities with IVF. There is also evidence of an increased risk of structural cardiac anomalies and cancer for these children. More research is required to determine the risks to children born from frozen eggs and IVF births.\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】Egg freezing has evolved over the past three decades into a well-established technology with impressive outcomes. It is inaccessible to women who are not financially secure and is a privilege for financially sound women. Egg freezing reinforces the value of having genetically related offspring, which may not be of equal importance for all women. The competing perspectives and all information available should be provided by the healthcare professional to women choosing egg freezing.\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH - Social egg freezing  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4467930/\n*   NIH - Oocyte cryopreservation  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8812387/\n*   Uclahealth - Egg freezing  \n    https://www.uclahealth.org/medical-services/obgyn/fertility/egg-freezing</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Uncontrolled hypertension constricts and narrows the blood vessels and damages them throughout the body, including organs like kidneys. Uncontrolled hypertension is the second main cause of renal failure. Hypertensive arteriolar nephrosclerosis is also referred to as hypertensive nephrosclerosis, hypertensive nephropathy, nephroangiosclerosis, and hypertensive kidney disease.\n\n【2】What Is Hypertensive Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Hypertensive arteriolar nephrosclerosis is a term that refers to the hardening or stiffening of the renal components that are caused by uncontrolled hypertension. Hypertensive arteriolar nephrosclerosis is a clinical syndrome that is characterized by chronic hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of the walls of the heart chambers), minimal proteinuria (presence of proteins in the urine), hypertensive retinopathy (retinal vascular damage due to hypertension), and progressive kidney failure. The pathological changes in the kidneys are due to the effects of uncontrolled hypertension. Chronic hypertension damages the tissues, blood vessels, glomeruli, interstitial tissues, and renal tubules in the kidneys, resulting in chronic kidney disease. Hypertensive arteriolar nephrosclerosis is one of the causes of end-stage kidney diseases. It progresses to end-stage kidney disease in a small percentage of individuals.\n\n【4】How Does Hypertensive Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis Occur?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Benign arterial hypertension causes the accumulation of amorphous homogenous material called hyaline in the walls of small arteries and arterioles. This accumulation results in the thickening and narrowing of the arterial openings by a process called arteriolosclerosis. This process reduces the blood flow to the kidneys and causes interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, glomerular alterations, and scarring around the glomeruli. These pathological changes progress to cause renal failure. It is also associated with complications like protein and blood in the urine due to glomerular damage.\n\n【6】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【7】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>Can you help me analyze my father's serum and urine immunofixation tests?</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-3:<u>Are my symptoms the side effects of asthma medicines?</u>\n\n【10】Autopsy Findings in COVID-19 Patients\n\n【11】Chronic hypertension is the main factor that is responsible for the development of end-stage renal disease. Two pathological mechanisms contributing to the development of hypertensive arteriolar nephrosclerosis describe how the glomerulus and the network of dense capillaries that carry out the filtration process are affected.\n\n【12】*   **Glomerular Ischemia:** Glomerular ischemia is the main pathological mechanism that contributes to hypertensive nephrosclerosis. High blood pressure that is persistent for long-term damages the lining of the blood vessel called the endothelium. This causes plaque accumulation and deposition in the renal arteries, causing stenosis and ischemic kidney disease. As a result, the narrowed renal artery supplies inadequate blood to the kidneys. This causes a decrease in the size of the kidneys. Arterial stiffening involves the breakdown of elastic fibers and the thickening of the innermost layer of the blood vessel.\n\n【13】*   **Glomerular Hypertension and Glomerular Hyperfiltration :** Another mechanism that causes hypertensive nephropathy is prolonged glomerular hypertension, which results in glomerular hyperfiltration. The mechanism behind this is hypertension causes sclerosis of the glomeruli and reduces kidney function. The unaffected nephrons compensate by vasodilating to increase the blood flow. As a compensatory mechanism, this increases renal perfusion and glomerular filtration across unaffected glomeruli.\n\n【14】What Causes Hypertensive Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Chronic blood pressure damages the kidney tissues, including the glomeruli, small blood vessels, kidney tubules, and interstitial tissues. Hardening of the tissues and narrowing of the blood vessels is observed. The narrowed arteries supply less oxygen to the tissues resulting in ischemia (tissue death). The risk factors include poorly controlled blood pressure, other kidney disorders, and older age.\n\n【16】What Are the Signs and Symptoms Associated With Hypertensive Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Hypertensive arteriolar nephrosclerosis is the second most common cause of end-stage kidney disease, the first being diabetes. The signs and symptoms of hypertensive nephrosclerosis include itching, sleepiness or confusion, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and an unpleasant taste in the mouth. Malignant nephrosclerosis occurs if malignant hypertension is present. Malignant hypertension occurs if the diastolic blood pressure is greater than 130 mmHg. The blood vessels present with fibrinoid necrosis, intimal thickening, thrombosis, red blood cell fragmentation, and extravasation.\n\n【18】How Is Hypertensive Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The diagnosis of arteriolar nephrosclerosis is based on the clinical history and biochemical investigations. This includes the following tests:\n\n【20】*   **Histopathological Examination:** A definitive diagnosis can be made with a biopsy and histological examination. Histological examination shows the presence of large renal arteries with medial hypertrophy, intimal thickening, and duplication of the elastic layer. Hyaline deposition in small arterioles, glomerular collapse, and solidification is seen. Scarring of the tissues can also be observed.\n\n【21】*   **Urine Test:** Chronic kidney diseases damage the glomeruli and allow the filtration of proteins that are too large to enter the nephron. This causes an elevation in the albumin concentration in urine, called albuminuria. Protein in the urine is called proteinuria. Proteinuria is a common finding in individuals with nephrosclerosis. Proteinuria is observed in the range of 0.001 to 0.01 pound per 24-hour urine. Hematuria can occur if glomerular damage is present.\n\n【22】*   **Other Tests:** Other laboratory tests like hematocrit, creatinine, serum potassium, serum calcium, and blood glucose tests are also performed.\n\n【23】The definitive diagnosis is based on morphological examination. This procedure is usually preceded by a provisional diagnosis based on laboratory investigations. Increasing the access and use of genome profiling may help to identify ApoL1 gene variants on chromosome 22 and provide an opportunity for diagnosis.\n\n【24】How Is Hypertensive Arteriolar Nephrosclerosis Treated?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Hypertensive arteriolar nephrosclerosis management is based on strategies to slow down the progression of the disease by controlling blood pressure and reducing albumin levels. According to current guidelines, the ideal blood pressure should be less than 16/11 kPa for individuals with hypertensive nephropathy. Blood pressure higher than this can increase cardiovascular risk.\n\n【26】Drugs like ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, direct renin inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists are prescribed to lower blood pressure and reduce neuropathy and proteinuria. Lifestyle changes, weight reduction, exercise, and reduced salt intake can help manage hypertensive nephropathy. Hemodialysis is done for patients with end-stage kidney disease.\n\n【27】**Conclusion:**\n\n【28】Hypertensive arteriolar nephrosclerosis is a progressive disease caused by chronic hypertension. It causes stiffening and hardening of the renal components and reduces the blood flow. It progresses to end-stage kidney disease. Uncontrolled hypertension is the main reason for hypertensive arteriolar nephrosclerosis. The treatment aims to reduce blood pressure, nephropathy, proteinuria, and albumin. Lifestyle modifications are also essential to treat hypertensive nephropathy. Early detection and treatment can prevent the progression of the disease.\n\n【29】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【30】无关删除-1:<u>*   Hypertensive nephrosclerosis  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18408477/\n*   Hypertensive Nephrosclerosis as a Relevant Cause of Chronic Renal Failure  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.HYP.38.2.171</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

A medical emergency can be expected at any time during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Childbirth takes several hours sometimes. This can give time for patient preparation, operation theater preparation, and arrangements for the gynecologist or midwife. Childbirth occurs in three stages: the first stage which starts from uterine contractions and water breaking, followed by a second stage where the baby is pushed out of the uterus, and the last and final stage where the woman pushes out the placenta.\n\n【2】What Is an Emergency Delivery?\n------------------------------\n\n【3】Emergency delivery or childbirth is the sudden precipitation of labor in an unexpected setting. When the delivery is planned, the pregnant woman has the liberty to choose the hospital and the medical team. There are various place choices for giving birth like a multispecialty hospital, a medical facility, at home, or a natural birthing center. In some instances, women give birth on their way to the hospital without a gynecologist or any other medical staff. The percentage of emergency childbirths is low. Emergency delivery needs special care and measures. The procedure is similar to a planned delivery but there are higher chances of complications since the ideal location and medical help are lacking most of the time. The emergency delivery may be natural or cesarean. A cesarean or C-section is a surgery to give birth to a baby.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Emergency Delivery?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【5】A pregnant woman is advised for an emergency delivery for the following reason.\n\n【6】*   Considering the safety of the mother and the baby.\n\n【7】*   To save the mother and baby from a life-threatening condition.\n\n【8】*   The labor progression is abnormal.\n\n【9】*   In some medical conditions like severe bleeding and pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy).\n\n【10】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Emergency Delivery?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Most of the pregnancy symptoms are normal and nothing to panic about.

The active phase can be long and if less than 12 hours, it is considered normal. Other measures to be followed during this labor stage are to evaluate the mother for transition in the stage of labor and to motivate the mother to walk for short distances or sit comfortably.\n\n【38】**Second Phase of Labor: Birth of the Baby**\n\n【39】*   The duration of labor can vary between 20 minutes to 3 hours.\n\n【40】*   The mother is in a lithotomy position, that is lying on the back with feet at the same levels of hips and the perineal region at the edge of the bed.\n\n【41】*   The perineal area is sterilized with an antiseptic solution or water and soap. Anyone helping the woman should also clean their hands and use sterile gloves.\n\n【42】*   The pregnant woman is encouraged to push the baby down.\n\n【43】*   Once the head of the baby is delivered, to prevent rapid expulsion, place one hand on the perineum and the other hand to handle the baby’s head.\n\n【44】*   The position of the umbilical cord is checked if it is wrapped around the neck of the baby. The cord is carefully clamped at two sites. If the cord is around the neck of the baby, it is loosened and clamped.\n\n【45】*   Then the shoulders of the baby come out. A midwife or the partner during emergency birth will guide the baby out and the rest of the baby’s body follows it.\n\n【46】*   Hold the baby carefully as they come out easily once their shoulders are out and as their body is slippery to hold.\n\n【47】*   Now, the umbilical cord is cut carefully without injuring the mother and the baby with clean and sterilized scissors or a knife.\n\n【48】*   The baby is wrapped and dried with clean towels and kept warm. The baby is now kept on the mother’s breasts.\n\n【49】**Third Phase of Labor: Delivery of the Placenta**\n\n【50】*   The baby is connected to the placenta through an umbilical cord. The placenta remains inside the womb after the cord is cut. The placenta gets delivered within two to ten minutes or can take even longer. The expulsion of the placenta is spontaneous but sometimes needs the mother to push it.\n\n【51】*   The mother is later taken to a proper hospital setting to check for vaginal injuries that are repaired surgically, stabilize the mother and the baby and provide post-delivery care to the mother and newborn.\n\n【52】What Are the Risks and Complications Associated With Emergency Delivery?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】*   Infections due to lack of a sterile environment.\n\n【54】*   Excessive postpartum bleeding.\n\n【55】*   Accidental injury to the newborn.\n\n【56】*   Accidental injury to the mother.\n\n【57】*   Perineal skin laceration.\n\n【58】*   Retained placental tissue.\n\n【59】*   Vaginal and uterine lacerations.\n\n【60】*   Emotional stress.\n\n【61】*   Higher chance of infection in the newborn.\n\n【62】**Conclusion**\n\n【63】There is a common fear of pregnancy and childbirth among women. And an emergency delivery is an even more fearful thought for every pregnant woman. But they occur very rarely. If someone is experiencing a fear of this, they should be given counseling sessions with the gynecologist, physician, or midwife to reassure them and keep them motivated and relaxed throughout their pregnancy. Pregnant women can be mentally prepared and get familiar with the process which will help them cherish and enjoy the whole pregnancy journey.\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【65】无关删除-1:<u>*   Emergency caesarean  \n    https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/emergency-caesarean\n*   Pregnancy - obstetric emergencies  \n    https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/pregnancy-obstetric-emergencies#what-to-look-for-%E2%80%93-signs-of-an-obstetric-emergency\n*   Emergency childbirth  \n    https://www.globalfirstaidcentre.org/emergency-childbirth/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This condition is seen in 3 to 15 percent of all pregnancies. In fetal macrosomia, the baby weighs more than 4000 grams (8 pounds and 13 ounces) irrespective of the gestational age. It is a potentially life-threatening complication to both the mother and the baby during labor. The risk furthermore increases when it is greater than 4500 grams (9 pounds and 15 ounces). Fetal macrosomia complicates the vaginal delivery and has a high chance of injury to the baby and the mother during labor. These babies encounter an increased risk of health problems after birth. This article gives a brief knowledge about fetal macrosomia, its symptoms, causes, and the treatment plan, so let us get into reading it.\n\n【2】What Causes Fetal Macrosomia?\n-----------------------------\n\n【3】The etiology (cause) for fetal macrosomia can be categorized under two divisions:\n\n【4】*   Maternal causes.\n\n【5】*   Fetal causes.\n\n【6】**Maternal Causes:**\n\n【7】1.  **Maternal Diabetes:** Diabetes acquired during pregnancy is called gestational diabetes. In 1920 Jordan Pederson concluded from his studies that maternal hyperglycemia is associated with fetal hyperinsulinemia and fetal hyperglycemia. So the fetus overutilizes the glucose resulting in an abnormal increase in size.\n\n【8】2.  **Obesity:** Abnormal weight gain during pregnancy has a significant risk for diabetes mellitus leading to a 4 to 12 folds increase in the chance of fetal macrosomia. Increased insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are one of the strong factors that contribute to macrosomia.\n\n【9】3.  **Multiparity:** It is a condition of having more than one baby during a single gestation. Mothers with parity greater than three are prone to have macrosomic babies.\n\n【10】4.  **Previous LGA (Large for Gestational Age):** There are five to ten percent more chances if the mother had any previous history of a macrosomic baby.\n\n【11】5.  **Post-date or Overdue Pregnancy:** In prolonged gestation of more than 42 weeks, there is a continuous supply of nutrients and oxygen-rich blood from the mother to the developing fetus. This increases the chance of macrosomia.\n\n【12】6.  **Order of Pregnancy:** The risk of macrosomia increases with each pregnancy.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Caput Succedaneum - An Overview</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Role of Ultrasound in Assessing Fetal Anomalies</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    The Arrest of Descent - Types and Risk Factors</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n7.  **Maternal Age:** Women older than 35 or lesser than 17 years of age are more likely to have a macrosomic baby.\n    </u>\n\n【14】**Fetal Causes:**\n\n【15】*   Generally, male infants weigh heavier than female infants. Most cases of macrosomia are in male infants.\n\n【16】*   Presence of underlying genetic and congenital disorders.\n\n【17】*   Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (a genetic disorder characterized by overgrowth).\n\n【18】*   Sotos syndrome (characterized by excessive physical growth).\n\n【19】*   Fragile x syndrome (characterized by developmental and learning disabilities).\n\n【20】What Are the Complications of Fetal Macrosomia?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Fetal macrosomia poses health risks to the mom and the baby both during and after pregnancy. The maternal risks are,\n\n【22】*   **Labor Problems:** Macrosomia may cause problems during vaginal labor. The baby gets wedged in the birth canal, leading to a serious complication called “shoulder dystocia.”\n\n【23】Apart from that, they sustain birth injuries and may require the use of forceps or vacuum devices during delivery. In these cases, C-section may be preferred.\n\n【24】*   **Genital Tract Lacerations:** These babies cause injuries to the birth canal, such as tearing of vaginal tissues and muscles between the vagina and the anus.\n\n【25】*   **Postpartum Hemorrhage:** Fetal macrosomia increases the risk of uterine atony. It is a condition when the uterus fails to contract, leading to bleeding after delivery.\n\n【26】*   **Uterine Rupture:** This is a rare but serious condition that occurs when the mother had any prior uterine surgery or cesarean where the uterus opens along the scar line.\n\n【27】Fetal complications are,\n\n【28】*   During delivery, the baby may encounter an injury, fractures, or nerve damage.\n\n【29】*   Lower blood sugar level than the average value.\n\n【30】*   Childhood obesity.\n\n【31】*   Metabolic syndrome.\n\n【32】What Is Metabolic Syndrome?\n---------------------------\n\n【33】Metabolic condition is a cluster of conditions that includes:\n\n【34】*   High blood pressure.\n\n【35】*   High sugar levels.\n\n【36】*   Excess body weight around the waist.\n\n【37】*   Abnormal cholesterol levels.\n\n【38】How Fetal Macrosomia Be Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【39】Fetal macrosomia is often difficult to diagnose during pregnancy. However, regular prenatal visits help the clinician with suspected fetal macrosomia.\n\n【40】*   **Large Fundal Height:** The fundal height is measured regularly during routine visits, and large values above the average are suggestive of fetal macrosomia.\n\n【41】*   **Polyhydramnios:** Polyhydramnios is the excess amount of amniotic fluid. This fluid surrounds and protects the baby during pregnancy. The amount of amniotic fluid is indicative of the baby's urine output, and if the baby is large, a large amount of urine is produced, and the fluid level goes up. This may be suggestive of macrosomia in your baby.\n\n【42】What Is the Differential Diagnosis?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【43】*   Polyhydramnios.\n\n【44】*   Presence of uterine masses such as uterine myoma and adenomyosis.\n\n【45】*   Multiple gestations.\n\n【46】*   Pelvic masses such as ovarian mass.\n\n【47】Is There Any Prevention?\n------------------------\n\n【48】Fetal macrosomia may not be prevented, but early detection may promote a healthy pregnancy. Regular exercising and eating a low glycemic diet reduce macrosomia. Some measures for a healthier pregnancy journey include;\n\n【49】*   Have a preconception appointment with your doctor.\n\n【50】*   Managing your weight.\n\n【51】*   Managing diabetes.\n\n【52】*   Staying physically active.\n\n【53】How Can Macrosomia Be Treated?\n------------------------------\n\n【54】Fetal macrosomia can be managed by medical management and following proper diet and exercises.\n\n【55】**Medical Management:**\n\n【56】*   **Early Induction of Labor:** The fetus continues to gain weight of about 230 grams per week after the 37th week onwards. So stimulating the uterine contractions before the labor begins on its own is the early induction of labor. However, this is generally not recommended and may lead to cesarean.\n\n【57】*   **Elective Cesarean Surgery:** In order to avoid any birth complications for the mother and the baby, a vaginal delivery is not frequently recommended. In such a case, an elective cesarean in a suspected case of macrosomia is advised to prevent birth trauma which can prevent shoulder dystocia, brachial plexus injury, etc. in the baby.\n\n【58】**Diet And Exercise:**\n\n【59】*   The most important factor for macrosomia is uncontrolled maternal diabetes and excessive weight gain. So dietary control and insulin therapy reduce the chances of macrosomia in the baby, along with tolerable exercise programs for preventing weight gain.\n\n【60】**Conclusion:**\n\n【61】Though macrosomia remains a challenging obstetric condition, healthy lifestyle management can be helpful throughout your pregnancy. The effective management and coordination of the interprofessional persons along with the obstetricians is the key to success in the case of pregnant mothers with macrosomic babies.\n\n【62】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【63】* * *\n\n【64】#### **1.**删除换行**Is Macrosomia a Congenital Disorder?**\n\n【65】Certain genetic factors cause macrosomia if the mother is diabetic or obese during pregnancy. In diabetic mothers, the sugar passes through the placenta and gets deposited as fat, leading to a large baby. Sometimes the reason for the baby being larger than normal is unknown.\n\n【66】#### **2.**删除换行**Are Pregnancies With Macrosomia Regarded as High-Risk?**\n\n【67】The risks associated with macrosomia pregnancies are considered high-risk if the birth weight is more than nine pounds. This is because it makes vaginal delivery complicated and can lead to injuries during birth. In addition, it can also cause health issues in the baby after birth.\n\n【68】#### **3.**删除换行**What Factors Contribute to the Risk of Macrosomia?**\n\n【69】Maternal obesity, diabetes, excessive weight gain during pregnancy, male sex, and post-term pregnancy contribute to the risk of macrosomia. These factors pose more significant risks to the mother and the fetus during delivery.\n\n【70】#### **4.**删除换行**Is Macrosomia a Fatal Condition?**\n\n【71】Several studies suggest macrosomia as a fatal condition. But the infant’s death is determined by birth weight and is most commonly encountered in neonates weighing more than 4500 grams. Studies suggest the end of a fetus also depends on the diabetic and obese status of the mother.\n\n【72】#### **5.**删除换行**Can Macrosomia Be Identified With Ultrasound?**\n\n【73】Fetal macrosomia can be diagnosed only after birth. However, if the mother has the risk factors, the baby’s health and development can be monitored using ultrasound. Furthermore, there is a possibility of identifying a macrosomic baby by measuring the fundal height, which involves assessing the distance from the uppermost point of the uterus to the pubic bone.\n\n【74】#### **6.**删除换行**Is Macrosomia a Common Condition?**\n\n【75】Fetal macrosomia is not a very common condition. However, about 9 % of babies are born worldwide with fetal macrosomia. It also increases the risk of cesarean delivery and causes traumatic injury to the birth canal and the fetus.\n\n【76】#### **7.**删除换行**Does Macrosomia Indicate a C-Section?**\n\n【77】A C-section can be performed if the weight of the fetus is more than ten pounds in a diabetic woman or eleven pounds or more in other women. It can also be considered a prerequisite if the mother is obese and diabetic. Initially, labor induction is considered. Then, if it fails, a cesarean is considered.\n\n【78】#### **8.**删除换行**How Much Weight Is Considered Fetal Macrosomia?**\n\n【79】A weight of 4000 to 5000 grams or nine to ten pounds is considered fetal macrosomia, which is much larger than average. The severity of complications during labor depends upon the weight of the infants. And so, induction or elective cesarean is considered.\n\n【80】#### **9.**删除换行**How Much Weight May a Baby Have in a Regular Delivery?**\n\n【81】A baby born in a regular delivery weighs about 2.5 to 4.5 kilograms. If they exceed 4.5 kilograms, then the condition is called fetal macrosomia. If the baby weighs less than 2.5 kilograms, it is considered a low birth weight commonly noticed in premature babies.\n\n【82】#### **10.**删除换行**Do Big Newborns Continue to Be Big?**\n\n【83】No one can predict how big an infant with macrosomia will grow. However, studies have estimated a correlation between birth weight and adult size. The length of the baby is also associated with its height and weight.\n\n【84】#### **11.**删除换行**Do I Need to Be Induced for a Large Baby?**\n\n【85】A healthy woman with a large baby is recommended to be induced into labor at 41 or 42 weeks. However, studies also suggest that earlier labor induction is a safe option. If induction is not found to be successful, an elective cesarean is performed.\n\n【86】#### **12.**删除换行**Does a Large Pregnancy Bump Indicate a Large Baby?**\n\n【87】The large baby bump need not always indicate a large and healthy baby. It can also be due to excessive amniotic fluid that cushions the growing fetus. And this can lead to severe complications during birth if the mother is obese or short.\n\n【88】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【89】无关删除-1:<u>*   Macrosomia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557577/\n*   Fetal macrosomia  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fetal-macrosomia/symptoms-causes/syc-20372579\n*   Fetal Macrosomia  \n    https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17795-fetal-macrosomia</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Situated at the distal end of the urethra, it is responsible for the passage of urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. The urethral opening plays a vital role in urinary continence, sexual function, and reproductive health. In females, there are small, pea-sized glands located on either side of the urethral opening and are responsible for secreting fluid that helps with lubrication during sexual arousal. These glands are called paraurethral glands, Skene’s glands, Skene’s duct, or periurethral glands.\n\n【2】What Is a Paraurethral Cyst?\n----------------------------\n\n【3】When the paraurethral ducts of the paraurethral glands become blocked or obstructed, the secretions accumulate and form a cystic structure called the paraurethral cysts or commonly known as the Skene’s gland cyst. Paraurethral cysts can vary in size. Paraurethral cysts are typically filled with fluid. The fluid inside the cyst can vary in consistency, ranging from clear fluid to thicker fluid or even pus in cases of infection.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Paraurethral Cysts?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Paraurethral cysts can be further categorized into acquired and congenital types based on their underlying causes:\n\n【6】*   **Acquired Paraurethral Cyst -** These cysts develop later in life and are typically caused by factors such as inflammation, infection, trauma, or blockage of the ducts of the paraurethral glands. Inflammatory conditions, such as urethritis or urinary tract infections, can lead to the formation of acquired paraurethral cysts. Trauma to the area, such as childbirth or pelvic surgery, may also contribute to their development.\n\n【7】*   **Congenital Paraurethral Cysts -** These cysts are present at birth and result from developmental abnormalities or malformations of the paraurethral glands or paraurethral ducts. Congenital paraurethral cysts are relatively rare and may be associated with other congenital conditions affecting the genitourinary system.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Urethral Diverticula - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    An Insight Into Transvaginal Ultrasound Practice</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I am taking Trospium for frequent urination but having urethal discomfort. Is it due to Trospium?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【9】What Are the Symptoms of Paraurethral Cysts?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Paraurethral cysts are discovered incidentally during routine pelvic examinations or imaging studies, as they are usually asymptomatic. However, some individuals may present symptoms that can vary depending on the size, location, and individual characteristics of the cyst. Both acquired, and congenital paraurethral cysts cause similar symptoms in the affected females. Some common symptoms associated with paraurethral cysts include:\n\n【11】*   **Pain or Discomfort -** The presence of a cyst near the urethral opening can cause pain or a sensation of discomfort in the surrounding area. This pain may worsen during activities such as urination, sexual intercourse, or physical exertion.\n\n【12】*   **Swelling -** Paraurethral cysts can lead to localized swelling or a palpable lump near the urethral opening. The size of the cyst can vary, ranging from small and barely noticeable to larger, more prominent swellings.\n\n【13】*   **Urinary Symptoms -** In some cases, paraurethral cysts can cause urinary symptoms such as increased frequency, urgency, or difficulty with urination. This can occur if the cyst puts pressure on the urethra or interferes with the normal flow of urine.\n\n【14】*   **Infection or Abscess Formation -** If a paraurethral cyst becomes infected, one may experience symptoms such as increased pain, redness, warmth, and the presence of pus or discharge.\n\n【15】*   **Sexual Discomfort -** Paraurethral cysts may cause discomfort or pain during sexual intercourse due to the pressure or irritation the paraurethral cyst exerts on surrounding tissues.\n\n【16】How Is Paraurethral Cyst Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【17】The diagnosis of paraurethral cysts typically involves some common methods. Diagnostic measures for paraurethral cysts include:\n\n【18】*   **Medical History -** The healthcare provider will discuss your symptoms, including any pain, discomfort, or urinary issues you may be experiencing. They will also inquire about any relevant medical conditions or previous surgeries.\n\n【19】*   **Physical Examination -** The healthcare provider will perform a pelvic examination to assess the area around the urethral opening. They may feel for any palpable masses, swelling, or tenderness. This examination helps to localize the cyst and evaluate its size and characteristics.\n\n【20】*   **Imaging Tests -** Imaging tests may be used to visualize and confirm the presence of the paraurethral cyst. Ultrasound is commonly employed as it can provide detailed images of the cyst and its surrounding structures. In some cases, other imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, or computed tomography (CT) scans may be utilized for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\n【21】*   **Cyst Aspiration -** In certain cases, if the diagnosis is not definitive or if there is a need to relieve symptoms or obtain fluid for analysis, the doctor may perform cyst aspiration. This involves withdrawal (using a syringe with a needle) of fluid from the cyst for further examination.\n\n【22】How to Treat Paraurethral Cyst?\n-------------------------------\n\n【23】The treatment of paraurethral cysts, or Skene's gland cysts, depends on various factors, such as the size of the cyst, the severity of symptoms, and the presence of complications. Here are some common treatment options:\n\n【24】*   **Observation -** Small, asymptomatic cysts, especially congenital paraurethral cysts, may not require immediate medical treatment and can be monitored over time to assess any changes or progression. No specific treatment is required if the cyst is not causing significant discomfort or affecting urinary function or sexual activity.\n\n【25】*   **Antibiotics -** If the cyst becomes infected or an abscess forms, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection and reduce inflammation. Once the infection subsides, the cyst may be drained and excised.\n\n【26】*   **Cyst Drainage -** In cases where the cyst is large, causing significant discomfort, or not resolving with conservative measures, the doctor may recommend cyst drainage. This procedure involves aspirating (using a needle and syringe) the fluid from the cyst. Cyst drainage can provide temporary relief of symptoms but may not prevent cyst recurrence.\n\n【27】*   **Marsupialization -** Marsupialization involves creating a small opening in the cyst wall and suturing it into the surrounding healthy tissue. This forms a \"pouch\" or \"marsupial\" that allows for ongoing drainage of the cyst's contents. The cyst is not entirely removed but rather converted into an open cavity that gradually heals from the inside out.\n\n【28】*   **Surgical Excision -** Surgical removal of the paraurethral cyst is often the definitive treatment option. It is typically recommended for large cysts, recurrent cysts, symptomatic cysts, or cysts associated with complications. The surgery involves the complete removal of the cyst and is performed under local anesthesia. Minimally invasive techniques, such as endoscopic or laparoscopic approaches, may be utilized for smaller cysts.\n\n【29】**Conclusion:**\n\n【30】Paraurethral cysts are rare and usually do not cause any severe symptoms or progress into complications. Paraurethral cysts cannot be completely prevented, as their occurrence is often related to anatomical factors or underlying conditions. However, maintaining good hygiene, practicing safe sexual practices, and avoiding irritants may help prevent the development of acquired paraurethral cysts. Paraurethral cysts are harmless, and appropriate treatment measures can always heal the cyst and prevent reoccurrence.\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>*   Experiences with the management of paraurethral cysts in adult women  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3992454/\n*   Paraurethral duct cyst  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/paraurethral-duct-cyst\n*   Benign (Not Cancerous) Uretheral Lesions Girls  \n    https://www.urologyhealth.org/urology-a-z/b/benign-(not-cancerous)-uretheral-lesions-girls</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Scientists say that initially, the virus starts to fasten up the infection in the human cell receptors, but it can pass through the cell only with the help of the TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane serine protease 2) protein. Testosterone controls TMPRSS2 protein, and when the testosterone levels decrease, then TMPRSS2 levels will also decrease so that the coronavirus disease is blocked at the gates.\n\n【2】The mechanism of coronavirus infection is multifactorial, and in some patients, testosterone levels may play a major role, and in some patients, it may not.

Patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk early prostate cancers can successfully wait for the pandemic to subside before resuming the treatment like:\n\n【41】*   Patients with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) can delay the start of radiotherapy for months.\n\n【42】*   Patients planned for radiation therapy (RT) and hormone therapy (HT) can receive hormone therapy for six months before starting radiation therapy.\n\n【43】*   Patients planned for surgical treatment can delay radical prostatectomy for up to six months.\n\n【44】What Happens When a Person Miss a Follow-up Visit After Radiation Therapy or Surgery (Radical Prostatectomy)?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】Patients who have received definitive treatment for prostate cancer, either radiation therapy or surgery, can postpone their follow-up, which is initial post-treatment monitoring,\n\n【46】*   PSA (protein-specific antigen)-based testing.\n\n【47】*   Digital rectal exam (DRE) until deemed safe.\n\n【48】Also, telemedicine helps us during this pandemic to discuss any problem and PSA monitoring.\n\n【49】How to Change the Treatment Protocol When on Hormonal Therapy and Radiation Therapy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】Due to this COVID-19 pandemic, the treatment protocol for hormone therapy can be changed by three to four-month formulations when compared to monthly injections to decrease the risk of hospital visits. However, for conventional regimens, the shortest safe external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), which only consists of five to seven fractions, can be used.\n\n【51】What to Do When a Patient Is Has Urine Issue During COVID-19 Pandemic?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】When there are unusual symptoms during the COVID pandemic, follow the below:\n\n【53】1) Treatment measures should be followed when there are symptoms like,\n\n【54】*   Urinary obstruction.\n\n【55】*   Bleeding with conservative urine.\n\n【56】2) The treatment measures to be prioritized are:\n\n【57】*   Medical therapy.\n\n【58】*   Hormone therapy.\n\n【59】*   Catheterization.\n\n【60】3) Surgical intervention or radiation therapy may be considered when necessary.\n\n【61】4) Avoid unwanted emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations.\n\n【62】Can Chemotherapy for Prostate Cancer Be Continued During COVID-19?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【63】Chemotherapy regimens and protocols need some changes when in the advanced disease stage. The drugs and regimens that are less myelosuppressive (bone marrow suppression) are to be discussed with the oncologist as they may decrease immunity making us more prone to infections. So on the same day of chemotherapy, ask for growth factor support administration to improve:\n\n【64】*   Immunity.\n\n【65】*   Bone marrow function.\n\n【66】Are Patients Under Prostate Cancer Treatment at Severe Risk of Coronavirus Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【67】The severity of risk for coronavirus disease depends on the type of treatment the patients are receiving.\n\n【68】**Chemotherapy -** Patients receiving chemotherapy or immunotherapy have severe effects of COVID-19 disease. Advanced prostate cancer spreads to the lungs making the patients more prone to coronavirus disease. So these patients should stay home to avoid complications.\n\n【69】**Radical Prostatectomy -** These patients have the same risk as the general population. After complete recovery from this surgery done in the past for prostate cancer, the patient has the same risk as that of the general population of coronavirus disease.\n\n【70】**External Beam Radiotherapy -** A patient who has received or is currently receiving radiotherapy to treat prostate cancer is not at risk of catching coronavirus disease.\n\n【71】**Hormone Therapy -** Standard hormone therapy will not increase the risk of coronavirus disease.\n\n【72】**Abiraterone -** When the patients take this tablet, they will also be taking steroids like Prednisolone or Prednisone. People on steroids are at a slightly higher risk of getting infections, but it depends on the dose taken. But on taking Abiraterone, the patient will have a low dose of steroid, and hence there is decreased risk of getting infections.\n\n【73】**Enzalutamide -** This medication affects the number of white blood cells in the blood, so there is an increased risk of infections like coronavirus disease.\n\n【74】**Conclusion:**\n\n【75】Considering the COVID-19 disease, switch to the treatment recommendations in COVID-19 for prostate cancer and follow the COVID safety precautions in order to avoid community spread and prevent complications. Get the vaccination and the booster dose. Also, seek the nearest hospital if an individual comes across any unusual symptoms, and do not frequently visit clinics unless the treatment cannot be done through telemedicine.\n\n【76】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【77】* * *\n\n【78】#### **1.**删除换行**How Does COVID Influence Cancer Patients?**\n\n【79】Due to the compromised immune systems caused by cancer therapy, Covid-19 can significantly influence cancer patients, increasing their risk of severe disease. Cancer therapies may sometimes need to be postponed or adjusted, which might impact the patient's prognosis. Cancer clinics and hospitals may also be understaffed or closed, making it difficult for patients to obtain the necessary care. Furthermore, the emotional and mental stress induced by the epidemic might impact cancer patients.\n\n【80】#### **2.**删除换行**What Drugs Can Raise PSA Levels?**\n\n【81】PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) levels can be raised by drugs such as androgens, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, anti-androgens, and progestins. It is essential to consult with a healthcare provider to establish the cause of a high PSA level and ensure appropriate therapy.\n\n【82】#### **3.**删除换行**Can a Virus Have an Impact on PSA Test Results?**\n\n【83】Certain viral infections, such as prostate cancer-related viruses and urinary tract infections, might temporarily elevate PSA levels, resulting in false-positive findings. It is essential to discuss any recent viral infections or other relevant variables that may alter PSA test results with the healthcare professional. It is also recommended to wait until an active viral illness has resolved before performing the test.\n\n【84】#### **4.**删除换行**What Is the Prostate Cancer Survival Rate?**\n\n【85】The survival rate for prostate cancer varies depending on the cancer stage when it is found. According to the American Cancer Society, the five-year survival rate for males with localized prostate cancer that has not spread outside the prostate is approximately 100%. The five-year survival percentage for males with regional prostate cancer (cancer that has spread to surrounding tissues or lymph nodes is around 96%. The five-year survival rate for males with distant prostate cancer that has spread to distant organs or bones is approximately 30%.\n\n【86】#### **5.**删除换行**Are Cancer Survivors More Likely to Get COVID?**\n\n【87】It is unclear if cancer survivors are more prone to get COVID-19. Cancer survivors could be at higher risk of serious illness if they contract the virus due to their weakened immune systems due to cancer treatment. To avoid infection, cancer survivors must take measures.\n\n【88】#### **6.**删除换行**Is the Immune System Weakened as a Result of Cancer?**\n\n【89】Cancer can, indeed, damage the immune system. Immunosuppression can develop as a result of cancer, cancer therapies such as chemotherapy (a medication that employs strong chemicals to destroy rapidly growing cells in the body), and radiation therapy (a cancer therapy in which substantial doses of radiation are used to kill cancer cells and reduce tumors), or a combination of the two.\n\n【90】#### **7.**删除换行**What Should Not Be Done Before a PSA Test?**\n\n【91】One should not ejaculate or have prostate stimulation, such as a digital rectal exam, for at least 48 hours before a PSA test since it can temporarily raise PSA levels. Furthermore, some drugs may affect PSA results and should be discussed with a healthcare physician before the test.\n\n【92】#### **8.**删除换行**Which Supplements Can Help With PSA?**\n\n【93】No scientific evidence supports using any specific supplements to help with PSA levels. Although several accessories, such as Saw palmetto, Beta-sitosterol, and Pygeum africanum, are used for prostate health, scientific evidence does not support their usage for PSA levels. Before using any supplements, please speak with a healthcare practitioner.\n\n【94】#### **9.**删除换行**What Is a High PSA Level?**\n\n【95】A high PSA level is usually defined as a number more than the upper limit of normal for the assay employed. The laboratory's normal range for PSA levels varies; however, a 4 ng/mL reading or less is considered normal. Some laboratories may use a slightly higher cut-off, such as 4.5 ng/mL or five ng/mL. Various variables, including age, race, and prostate size, can impact PSA levels, and they can change over time. As a result, a single high PSA level only sometimes signals a problem. When interpreting the findings, assessing the patient's whole clinical picture, including symptoms and risk factors, is essential.\n\n【96】#### **10.**删除换行**What Might Infections Result in an Increase in PSA Levels?**\n\n【97】PSA levels can rise due to prostatitis (prostate inflammation) and urinary tract infections. These infections can raise PSA levels because they promote inflammation in the prostate, which increases PSA levels. Other illnesses that might increase PSA values include benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. It should be noted that a raised PSA level does not always indicate prostate cancer and more testing is typically required to make a diagnosis.\n\n【98】#### **11.**删除换行**What Exactly Is a Dangerously High PSA?**\n\n【99】A dangerously high PSA level is defined as one that is considerably over the usual range. The laboratory's normal range for PSA levels varies; however, a 4 ng/mL reading or less is considered normal. Some laboratories may employ a slightly higher cut-off, such as 4.5 ng/mL or five ng/mL. Some clinicians may consider a PSA level exceeding ten ng/mL possibly diagnostic of prostate cancer; however, when interpreting the results, taking the patient's entire clinical picture and other risk factors is essential.\n\n【100】#### **12.**删除换行**Can Stress Induce an Increase in PSA?**\n\n【101】It is not known if stress causes a rise in PSA levels. PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) is a protein the prostate gland generates that can be increased in situations such as prostate cancer, BPH, and prostatitis (prostate inflammation). These disorders can result in a rise in PSA values owing to inflammation or an increase in prostate size. Stress, however, is not a direct cause of these illnesses, and there is no evidence that stress may induce a rise in PSA levels. Some studies have shown that psychological stress might influence the immune system, which may affect the prostate indirectly, but further study is needed to understand this link completely.\n\n【102】#### **13.**删除换行**When Should a PSA Test Be Performed?**\n\n【103】Keep track of how the condition is progressing. The American Cancer Society suggests that men begin discussing the benefits and drawbacks of prostate cancer screening with their doctor around 50. Men at a greater risk of prostate cancer, such as African Americans or those with a family history of the illness, should begin these conversations at 45.\n\n【104】#### **14.**删除换行**What Happens Next if PSA Levels Are Elevated?**\n\n【105】If a PSA test reveals elevated levels, seeing a doctor for additional testing, such as a repeat PSA test, a digital rectal exam (DRE), and a prostate biopsy to establish if cancer is present, is critical. If the PSA test and other tests reveal the existence of prostate cancer, treatment options will be addressed. If the results show that the problems are not malignant, therapeutic alternatives will be addressed.\n\n【106】#### **15.**删除换行**How to Stop PSA From Increasing?**\n\n【107】\\- Eat a balanced diet, exercise frequently, and avoid smoking to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  \n\\- Maintain a healthy weight.  \n\\- Limit alcohol consumption.  \n\\- Discuss any drugs taken with the doctor and their potential influence on PSA levels.  \n\\- Consider 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs), which can limit the development of prostate cancer cells and reduce PSA levels.  \n\\- Discuss with the doctor the benefits of frequent PSA screenings and prostate examinations.\n\n【108】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【109】无关删除-1:<u>*   Coronavirus (COVID-19) and prostate cancer  \n    https://prostatecanceruk.org/prostate-information/coronavirus-covid-19-and-prostate-cancer/\n*   Prostate cancer: a risk factor for COVID-19 in males?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7581123/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Their specialized cell morphology facilitates their movement in the cardiovascular system and enables them to execute vital functions. Any alteration in the size, shape, and concentration of erythrocytes in blood, is a potential indicator of disease pathogenesis. Therefore, erythrocytes hold a prime position in hematological tests.\n\n【2】**What Is the Need for Erythrocyte-Related Hematological Tests?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Evaluation of erythrocytes is the foremost hematological investigation done to assess a person’s healthy state, detect disease pathologies (blood-related and non-blood-related), determine disease progression, and evaluate the prognosis of specific treatments. Multiple characteristics of red blood cells are investigated and analyzed with average standardized values. The commonly evaluated parameters of erythrocytes are red blood cell morphology, total cell count, hemoglobin concentration, and the quality of red blood cells to carry oxygen. These tests are relatively inexpensive and do not require high levels of technical expertise, and also easy accessibility of blood samples makes it an ideal source and first line of diagnosis in any hematological investigation.\n\n【4】**What Are the Routinely Done Erythrocyte-Related Hematological Tests?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】*   Peripheral blood smear.\n\n【6】*   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).\n\n【7】*   Hemoglobin concentration (HB).\n\n【8】*   Red blood cell count (RBC count).\n\n【9】*   Hematocrit (PCV).\n\n【10】*   Red blood cell indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC).\n\n【11】*   ABO-blood group typing.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    My urine and blood tests are negative after taking Nucynta.

Correlating PBF with RBC count and red cell indices helps in the diagnosis of various hematological disorders.\n\n【15】**Normal Cell Morphology of Erythrocytes**\n\n【16】*   Erythrocytes in normal health are biconcave, disk-shaped, and anucleated (without a nucleus) with an average diameter of about 7.5 μm.\n\n【17】*   Red cells are pink in color (Rowmanowsky staining method) and show a central pallor (a circular area without staining) because the hemoglobin content of the red cell is located peripherally.\n\n【18】*   Erythrocytes of normal size and color (hemoglobin content) are termed normocytic and normochromic.\n\n【19】**What Is Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate?**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The rate at which the erythrocytes fall to the bottom of the Westergren tube is termed as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The process of falling and forming sedimentation is called rouleaux formation. Females have higher ESR values than males. Also, the ESR value increases with an increase in age.\n\n【21】*   **Normal Range** \\- Male = ≤15 mm/hr, Female = ≤ 20 mm/hr\n\n【22】*   **Reduced ESR** - Inflammatory conditions such as infections, cancer, or autoimmune conditions.\n\n【23】*   **Increased ESR** \\- Pregnancy, aging, anemia, RBC abnormalities, kidney disease, low serum albumin, lupus lymphoma, multiple myeloma, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic vasculitis, thyroid disease.\n\n【24】**Why Is Hemoglobin Concentration Done?**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【25】The main function of erythrocytes is oxygen transport through hemoglobin. A sufficient hemoglobin level is necessary to ensure adequate oxygen supply to the tissues. Any abnormal change of hemoglobin concentration in the blood is a potential indicator for defective oxygen transport, which is easily detected in HB concentration analysis.\n\n【26】*   Hemoglobin concentration in blood is denoted as g/dl (grams per decilitre).\n\n【27】*   The normal Hb level in males is 14 to 18 g/dl and in females is 12 to 16 g/dl.\n\n【28】*   Hemoglobin level is low in anemia (iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency), bleeding, leukemia, renal failure, liver cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, and thalassemia.\n\n【29】*   Hemoglobin level is high in polycythemia vera, lung disease, dehydration, smoking, burns, and excessive vomiting.\n\n【30】**What Is RBC Count?**\n----------------------\n\n【31】The estimation of the number of red blood cells present in the whole blood volume is called RBC count. Normal RBC count is 4.0 - 5.2 million cells per microliter (cells/mcL). The normal range is slightly higher in males and females. The production of erythrocytes from bone marrow is termed erythropoiesis. Increased RBCs are seen in conditions that enhance erythropoiesis and erythrocytes are decreased during erythropoiesis dysfunction.\n\n【32】*   **High RBC Count -** Smoking, congenital heart disease, cor pulmonale, dehydration conditions, hypoxia, pulmonary fibrosis, Bone marrow disorders, drug-induced (Gentamicin, Methyldopa).\n\n【33】*   **Decreased RBC Count -** Anemia, Bleeding, Radiation therapy, Chronic renal failure, hemolysis, Leukemia, Malnutrition, multiple myeloma, Pregnancy, and drug-induced (chemotherapy, Chloramphenicol, Hydantoins, Quinidine).\n\n【34】**What Is Hematocrit?**\n-----------------------\n\n【35】*   Hematocrit is the packed total volume of red blood cells in percentage with the whole blood volume, also called packed cell volume (PCV).\n\n【36】*   An increased hematocrit is seen in conditions where total blood volume is decreased such as hemorrhagic shock, dehydration, and polycythemia.\n\n【37】*   Decreased values are recorded in conditions leading to increased total body fluid content like anemia, overhydration, kidney failure, and chronic inflammatory conditions.\n\n【38】*   Pregnancy shows decreased hematocrit due to an increase in blood volume.\n\n【39】**What Are Red Cell Indices?**\n------------------------------\n\n【40】Red cell indices are blood tests done to estimate the size, quality, and hemoglobin content of red blood cells. These tests are useful in identifying the types and etiology of different types of anemias. Red cell indices include\n\n【41】*   Mean corpuscular volume (MCV).\n\n【42】*   Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).\n\n【43】*   Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).\n\n【44】*   Red cell distribution width (RDW).\n\n【45】MCV is done to determine the size of RBC while the hemoglobin content of red blood cells is estimated by MCH and MCHC. Red cell distribution width (RDW) also termed as red cell morphology index is done to analyze and quantify variation in erythrocyte size (anisocytosis). Red cell indices are calculated with the known values of hemoglobin, hematocrit (packed cell volume), and red blood cell count.\n\n【46】*   **MCV** **-** average cell volume of erythrocytes which defines erythrocyte size is measured in femtoliters. The normal values for MCV = 87 ± 7 fl.\n\n【47】*   **MCH** **-** mean hemoglobin concentration present in a single red blood cell. Normal MCH value ranges from 27-31 pg (picograms). Decreased MCH is seen in hypochromic anemias.\n\n【48】*   **MCHC** **-** indicates the amount of hemoglobin per unit volume of the cell. MCHC helps to correlate the hemoglobin concentration with the cell volume. The normal values for MCHC = 34 ± 2 g/dl.\n\n【49】*   **RDW** **-** the coefficient of variation of the red blood cell volume distribution. The normal value for RDW is 13 ± 1.5%.\n\n【50】According to the size of the red cell, anemias are classified as normocytic (normal MCV), macrocytic (increased MCV), or microcytic (decreased MCV). In spherocytosis, due to the loss of membrane and the consequent spherical shape assumed by the cell, the MCHC has increased.\n\n【51】**What Is ABO-Blood Group Typing?**\n-----------------------------------\n\n【52】Blood grouping is done based on four erythrocyte phenotypes (A, B, AB, and O). There are two types of cell surface antigens, antigen A and antigen B present in the erythrocytes. Expression (presence/absence) of these surface antigens determines the blood group type. Blood types of individuals receiving blood transfusions are crossmatched with compatible blood group donors to prevent hemolytic reactions. Agglutination of red blood cells occurs in incompatible blood groups triggering adverse immune reactions.\n\n【53】**Conclusion**\n\n【54】Erythrocyte size, distribution, and variation in size help to identify and assess clinical disease and pathologic processes. In addition, red blood cells and their evaluation also give information about a patient’s general health and physiological processes in the body. Hence, erythrocyte-related hematological tests play a vital role in clinical diagnosis.\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>*   Blood: tests used to assess the physiological and immunological properties of blood  \n    https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/advan.00079.2015\n*   PERIPHERAL BLOOD FILM - A REVIEW  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4415389/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The endocrine system is a complex network of glands and tissues producing hormones that are released into the bloodstream. Multiple endocrine neoplasia was first reported in 1963 by Wermer, who noticed this condition in children and adults. In multiple endocrine neoplasia, there is an abnormal growth of the cells called the hyperplasia of the gland that can either be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) in nature. In children, the tumors commonly arise from the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands. It can also arise from the germ cell layers and the neural crest cells called neuroendocrine tumors.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Multiple endocrine neoplasias are classified into two main types:\n\n【4】*   **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 1 (MEN 1):** It is the most common variant, followed by familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. In addition, type 1 has an increased risk for medullary thyroid cancers, pheochromocytoma, or parathyroid cancers.\n\n【5】*   **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 2 (MEN 2):** The Type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasias are further subdivided into 2A, 2B, and FMTC. Type 2B is formerly called type 3, and it is relatively uncommon. The other variant is FMTC, or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma, which develops into adulthood.\n\n【6】What Are the Other Names for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】*   Adenomatosis.\n\n【8】*   Familial endocrine neoplasia.\n\n【9】*   Multiple endocrine adenomatosis.\n\n【10】What Is the Inheritance Pattern of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】All the subtypes of multiple endocrine neoplasia are autosomal dominant conditions. In an autosomal dominant condition, a single copy of the mutated or defective gene is sufficient to cause the defect in the individual. As it is an inherited condition, the parents affected by this condition can pass on the defect to their children. So, there is a 50 % chance for the child to acquire the disease.\n\n【12】**What Is the Incidence of MEN Syndrome?**\n------------------------------------------\n\n【13】*   Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 has an incidence of 1 in 30,000 people.\n\n【14】*   The type 2 variant is rarely seen in 1 in 35,000 individuals.\n\n【15】*   Males are more commonly affected than females.\n\n【16】*   Although it is rare in children, it may also be seen in children less than ten years of age.\n\n【17】**What Are the Glands Affected?**\n\n【18】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【19】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【20】VIPoma - Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment\n\n【21】Gastrinoma - Classification, Symptoms, Causes and, Treatment\n\n【22】Prolactinoma - Types, Causes, Symptoms, Complications, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【23】The affected body parts may vary in each type of MEN syndrome.\n\n【24】*   In type 1, any one of the endocrine glands may be affected, such as the pancreas, parathyroid, and pituitary.\n\n【25】*   In type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia, more than two glandular involvements are seen.\n\n【26】*   The thyroid gland is the most commonly affected and seen in almost all cases, followed by the adrenal glands in 50 % of the cases and the parathyroid in 20 % of the conditions.\n\n【27】What Causes Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【28】Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 is caused due to any gene mutations in chromosome 11q13. This gene is responsible for producing a protein called menin, a tumor suppressor gene. The tumor suppressor gene checks the growth and regulates the abnormal growth and multiplication of the cells. MEN type 1 is generally associated with tumors of the parathyroid, pituitary, and islets of the pancreas.\n\n【29】Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is caused due to the mutations of the RET (Rearranged during transfection) gene. The RET gene provides information for protein production and is also involved in cell signaling. Any mutations of the RET gene result in the hyperactivity of the signaling process causing abnormal cell growth and division even in the absence of cell signals for cell division. It leads to the formation of tumor cells.\n\n【30】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】The clinical presentation may vary slightly according to the type and severity of the syndrome.\n\n【32】**MEN Type1:**\n\n【33】MEN type 1 is also called Werner syndrome. Generally, for any child diagnosed with MEN -1, there are chances for cancer development, and they have to be assessed regularly, starting from the age of five until the end of their lives. In addition, they have a chance of developing hyperparathyroidism and are hence highly susceptible to kidney stone formations. The other common signs are:\n\n【34】*   Weakness, lethargy, a sensation of always being tired.\n\n【35】*   Decreased appetite.\n\n【36】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【37】*   Increased thirst and frequency of urination.\n\n【38】*   Constipation and decreased bowel movements.\n\n【39】*   Hypercalcemia.\n\n【40】**MEN Type 2:**\n\n【41】Type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia is also called Sipple syndrome. The symptoms are specific to the condition.\n\n【42】Medullary Thyroid Cancer:\n\n【43】*   Trouble swallowing.\n\n【44】*   Difficulty in breathing.\n\n【45】*   Change in the voice and hoarseness is noticed.\n\n【46】*   Presence of lumps in the throat and front of the neck.\n\n【47】**Pheochromocytoma:**\n\n【48】*   Pain in the chest.\n\n【49】*   Rapid and irregular heartbeats\n\n【50】*   Headaches and dizziness.\n\n【51】*   Increased sweating.\n\n【52】*   Tremors.\n\n【53】**Hyperparathyroidism:**\n\n【54】*   Increased blood calcium levels.\n\n【55】*   Persistent pain in the abdomen.\n\n【56】*   Weak, brittle, and painful bones.\n\n【57】*   Trouble swallowing and change in the voice.\n\n【58】*   Swelling or lump noticed in the neck.\n\n【59】*   Recurrent kidney stone formation.\n\n【60】*   Increased blood pressure.\n\n【61】**What Are the Other Similar Conditions?**\n\n【62】*   Von- Hippel Lindau syndrome.\n\n【63】*   Neurofibromatosis type 1.\n\n【64】*   Tuberous sclerosis complex.\n\n【65】How to Diagnose Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【66】Multiple endocrine neoplasia is diagnosed based on the medical history and any known family history. Hence an accurate diagnosis should be made. They are most often diagnosed if the child is suspected of having any cancers, etc. If known family history is present, the child should be monitored right from the age of five, as they have a high chance of cancer development.\n\n【67】Other diagnostic procedures followed are:\n\n【68】*   **Biopsies:** A fine needle aspiration or surgical biopsy is performed. A very thin needle is inserted into the abnormal growths, and the cells are examined under the microscope. This method rules out if there is any cancerous activity present in the cells.\n\n【69】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging Test:** The imaging test helps in assessing the abnormalities present in the body.\n\n【70】*   **PET (Positron Emission Tomography) Scan:** A special diagnostic imaging test performed to identify malignant cells. Radioactive glucose is given through an intravenous route. The malignant cells tend to take up more amount of glucose than the normal, healthy cells. It helps in identifying the presence of tumor cells in the body.\n\n【71】*   **Radioactive Iodine Scan:** This scan rules out the presence of thyroid cancer cells and their growth. The thyroid cells take up the radioactive iodine, thus traveling through the bloodstream and getting deposited wherever the thyroid cells are seen in the body. Generally, the amount of iodine taken up by the abnormal thyroid cells is more compared to the normal cells. The areas that lack iodine content are referred to as cold spots.\n\n【72】*   **Venous Sampling of Parathyroid:** Blood samples are collected from the vein near the parathyroid gland and checked for hormone levels. Elevated hormone levels in the blood are suggestive of hyperactive parathyroids.\n\n【73】*   **Urine Test:** The urine test is performed to assess the levels of catecholamines. Higher levels of catecholamines are indicative of any organ damage or dysfunction. Very high levels suggest pheochromocytoma (a small adrenal gland tumor causing irregular secretion of hormones).\n\n【74】How Is Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Treated?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【75】*   **MEN Type 1:** Surgery may be indicated to remove the hyperactive parathyroid glands since hyperparathyroidism is the main sign of MEN type 1. At least three parathyroid glands are removed along with the thymus.\n\n【76】*   **MEN Type 2:** In children with type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia, surgery of the thyroid gland may be necessary before the age of five to prevent the formation of cancers or to prevent the spread of cancers to other parts of the body.\n\n【77】*   **Targeted Therapy:** This therapy identifies the cancer cells and destroys only them, and the healthy cells are unaffected. Generally, targeted therapy is preferred over chemotherapy or radiation therapy. It uses certain drugs or substances to kill cancer cells and prevent their growth.\n\n【78】*   **Pharmacological Therapy:** Medications such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used to treat multiple endocrine neoplasia. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors block the signals required for the growth of the tumor cells.\n\n【79】**Conclusion:**\n\n【80】Educating the parents about the disease condition is very important. Generally, it is an inherited condition. Hence, proper genetic testing should be made mandatory for a positive medical history. It helps to assess the health of the child, thus preventing further complications. If there is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia, periodic check-ups may be required to reduce the risk of cancer in children suspected of having MEN syndrome.\n\n【81】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【82】无关删除-1:<u>*   Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK536980/\n*   Childhood Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) Syndromes Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/types/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia/patient-child-men-syndromes-treatment-pdq\n*   Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia  \n    https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is frequently misidentified as a bicuspid aortic valve. Patients with a unicuspid aortic valve are always relatively young when they are diagnosed or have surgery, ranging in age from 14 to 75 years, indicating an earlier beginning and a faster rate of development of aortic stenosis (aortic valve is constricted and does not fully open). The most common disease in patients with a unicuspid aortic valve is severe aortic stenosis or combined stenosis and regurgitation (backflow of the blood). The unicuspid aortic valve, like the bicuspid aortic valve, is prone to dilatation or dissection of the aorta, including the aortic root, ascending aorta, or aortic arch, and often necessitates surgical intervention. Aortic coarctation (birth defect with narrow aorta), a single coronary artery, an abnormal right subclavian artery, and ventricular septal defects are also related to diseases.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Unicuspid Aortic Valves?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The adult population's annual incidence of unicuspid aortic valves is predicted to be 0.02 %. However, it occurs at a rate of four percent to five percent in patients undergoing surgery for isolated aortic stenosis. There are two forms of unicuspid aortic valves:\n\n【4】1.  **Acommissural Pin-Hole-Shaped -** This form has no lateral attachment with a central orifice to the aorta.\n\n【5】2.  **Unicommissural Slit-Shaped -** This type has one attachment with an eccentric aperture.\n\n【6】How Do Unicuspid Aortic Valves Develop?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【7】A proper aortic valve with valve cusps, sinuses, and commissures develops during embryogenesis. A typical tri-leaflet aortic valve is made up of three cusps and three related commissures that grow from embryonic aortic trunk tubercules. The unicuspid aortic valve occurs when the three aortic cusps fail to separate before birth.\n\n【8】1.  **Unicuspid Acommissural Valve -** At the level of the orifice, the unicuspid unicommissural valve has no commissures or lateral attachments to the aorta and appears as a pinhole on imaging. As a result, significant aortic stenosis occurs at a young age, and patients may present for surgical repair as early as birth or infancy.\n\n【9】2.  **Unicommissural Unicuspid Aortic Valve -** It has one lateral commissural attachment to the aorta at the level of the orifice and appears as a slit-shaped feature in its morphology. Because the orifice in unicommissural unicuspid aortic valves is larger than that in acommissural unicuspid aortic valves, these patients generally stay asymptomatic until their third to fifth decade of life. Males are more likely than females in the ratio of 4:1 to have a unicuspid aortic valve.\n\n【10】What Are the Symptoms of a Unicuspid Aortic Valve?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The most common adult symptoms of the unicuspid aortic valve are:\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【14】Acquired Heart Disease - Causes, Symptoms, Risk Factors and Treatment\n\n【15】Heart Problems\n\n【16】Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension - Types, Causes, and Diagnosis\n\n【17】1.  Dyspnea (difficulty breathing).\n\n【18】2.  Angina (heart attack).\n\n【19】3.  Dizziness.\n\n【20】4.  Syncope (fainting).\n\n【21】Left heart failure and failure to thrive are always present in pediatric patients. Pneumonia may appear within the first two months of life. The presence of a cardiac murmur at the aortic area is the most noticeable aberrant result on physical examination. The other cardiac problems associated are as follows:\n\n【22】1.  Patent ductus arteriosus (continuous aperture between the two main blood arteries exiting the heart).\n\n【23】2.  Coarctation of the aorta.\n\n【24】3.  Aortic dilatation.\n\n【25】4.  Aortic regurgitations (inadequate aortic valve closure resulting in reverse blood flow via the aortic valve).\n\n【26】5.  Aortic aneurysm (aortic ballooning).\n\n【27】6.  Aortic dissection (rip in the aorta's interiors).\n\n【28】How to Diagnose Unicuspid Aortic Valves?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【29】In order to assess the aortic valve morphology, including the exact morphology of the aortic valve as well as the severity of aortic stenosis and regurgitation, the following tests can be done:\n\n【30】1.  Magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【31】2.  Cardiac computed tomography.\n\n【32】3.  Multislice tomography angiography.\n\n【33】4.  Echocardiography.\n\n【34】In most individuals, echocardiographic imaging enables for accurate diagnosis of aortic valve morphology. Furthermore, it can discriminate between actual and false unicuspid aortic valves.\n\n【35】As the absence of cusp separation during aortic valve opening displays the eccentric teardrop opening in a unicommissural unicuspid aortic valve, echocardiography is best used to assess the unicuspid aortic valve.\n\n【36】How Is the Unicuspid Aortic Valve Treated?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Patients withunicuspid aortic valve develop symptoms of aortic stenosis 20 to 30 years sooner than those with a normal trileaflet aortic valve. The unicuspid aortic valve has a bimodal presentation, with older patients having a less aggressive type and younger patients having a more aggressive version. The techniques for unicuspid aortic valve treatment vary greatly between adults and children. In children, the most common procedures are:\n\n【38】1.  **Aortic Balloon Valvuloplasty:** A surgery that extends the aortic valve to alleviate the symptoms of aortic stenosis.\n\n【39】2.  **Surgical Valvotomy:** A minimally invasive treatment that involves the opening of a constricted heart valve.\n\n【40】3.  **Commissurotomy:** Surgery to enhance blood flow across the heart valves.\n\n【41】4.  **The Ross Operation:** Heart valve replacement surgery.\n\n【42】Some are palliative operations that may be linked to persistent or recurring valve malfunction and reintervention because severe acommissural form frequently requires these therapies from infancy.\n\n【43】*   **Aortic Valve Replacement -** Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the most often used therapeutic method in adults. Many people require AVR in their forties, on average, in their third decade of life. This procedure can be done when the maximal aorta diameter exceeds 5 cm. Isolated aortic stenosis is the most prevalent of the various valve diseases linked with unicuspid aortic valves. Symptoms of aortic stenosis usually appear when the:\n\n【44】1.  Transvalvular mean gradient exceeds 40 mmHg.\n\n【45】2.  Aortic jet velocity exceeds four meter per second.\n\n【46】3.  The valve area is less than one centimeter square.\n\n【47】**Conclusion:**\n\n【48】The unicuspid aortic valve is an uncommon congenital cardiac defect of the aortic valve that usually manifests in the third to fifth decade of life. It might cause significant valve malfunction, as well as accompanying clinical appearance and other problems. Echocardiography is the foundation of the imaging technology used to detect unicuspid aortic valves. Multi-modality imaging has played a major part in diagnosis and may increase diagnostic accuracy. The unicuspid aortic valve is frequently misdiagnosed as a bicuspid aortic valve, yet there are important differences between the two. It is critical to accurately identify aortic valve morphology in order to select the optimal treatment. Adults and children have various treatment techniques. Many unicuspid aortic valve sufferers may require surgical intervention at a young age.\n\n【49】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【50】无关删除-1:<u>*   The unicuspid aortic valve  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5566075/\n*   Unicuspid Aortic Valve  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.041835\n*   Unicuspid Unicommissural Aortic Valve: An Extremely Rare Congenital Anomaly  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4473628/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Bleeding in the retinal vessels can occur when the retina's tiny blood vessels get damaged due to injury or disease. This condition can be caused due to systemic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. It may also be caused due to an injury and sudden increase in intraocular (eye) pressure. The retina is a sensory membrane of the eye. It is present at the back of the eyes. The light that enters the eye falls on the retina. The light is carried to the brain through this retina and interpreted as an image. The retina contains nerve bundles and blood vessels. The nerves carry the sensory signals to the brain. The retina contains light-sensitive cells called rods and cones that interpret incoming light as images.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Retinal Hemorrhage?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】The types of retinal hemorrhage depend on the structures affected. The retinal hemorrhage may be classified based on the location, cause, and origin of the hemorrhage. The types of retinal hemorrhage may include:\n\n【4】1.  **Flame-Shaped Hemorrhage:** Flame hemorrhages are named due to the shape of the hemorrhage. It resembles the shape of a feather or flame. This type of hemorrhage can be caused due to hypertension, anemia, or other blood disorders. Any damage to the retinal artery can lead to this type of hemorrhage.\n\n【5】2.  **Vitreous and Preretinal Hemorrhage:** This type of hemorrhage in which the retinal hemorrhage diffuses to the vitreous membrane. When the blood diffuses through the vitreous membrane, it settles down in this layer. This type of hemorrhage can be caused due to new blood vessel growth in the eyes. This may be caused due to conditions such as blood pressure, diabetes, or other blood disorders. Sometimes these conditions can also be caused without any underlying causes.\n\n【6】3.  **Blot Hemorrhages:** This type of hemorrhage occurs in deeper layers of the eyes. It forms a uniform blot on the eyes. This condition may be caused due to diabetes, rare blood disorders, and other rare conditions.\n\n【7】4.  **Roth Spots:** This type of hemorrhage presents a white spot in the center of the hemorrhage. This may be caused due to underlying disorders such as diabetes, leukemia, endocarditis (inflammation of the inner layers of the heart), and hypertension.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Autonomic Dysreflexia ,Hyperreflexia - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Complications and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Angioid Streaks - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n5.  **Other Conditions:** The other type of hemorrhage may be caused due to various underlying conditions.\n    </u>\n\n【9】What Are the Causes of Retinal Hemorrhage?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The following may be the causes of retinal hemorrhage;\n\n【11】1.  Systemic medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and infections.\n\n【12】2.  Blood disorders such as anemia, leukemia, and lupus erythematosus (an inflammatory condition of the skin).\n\n【13】3.  Conditions of the eye such as macular degeneration and other age-related conditions.\n\n【14】4.  Head injuries may be caused due to accidents or falls.\n\n【15】5.  A change in eye pressure due to activities such as scuba diving, sudden change in altitude, and decreased oxygen levels.\n\n【16】6.  Retinal bleeding may also be caused due to medications such as Aspirin that act as blood thinners.\n\n【17】7.  It may also be caused due to sudden activities such as rigorous physical work, severe cough, vomiting, and sexual activities.\n\n【18】What Are the Symptoms of Retinal Hemorrhage?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The retina is very crucial for vision. Any small injury can cause disturbances or changes in vision. It may be associated with disturbances or changes in vision, such as blurring of vision or blind spots. This condition can affect one or both eyes. If the retinal hemorrhage progresses to the vitreous media, it is known as vitreous hemorrhage. If the hemorrhage is smaller, it may or may not have any symptoms. If the hemorrhage is bigger, it may have symptoms such as:\n\n【20】1.  **Floaters:** There may be floaters in the vision. It may be seen as spots in the vision due to the eye hemorrhage.\n\n【21】2.  **Obstruction in Vision:** There may be an obstruction in vision following the hemorrhage of the eyes. This may be seen as cobwebs, lines, or streaks.\n\n【22】3.  **Blurring of Vision:** There may be blurred vision associated with retinal hemorrhage.\n\n【23】4.  **Red Tint:** There may be a red tint associated with retinal hemorrhage. The gradient of tint may be dependent on the amount of hemorrhage.\n\n【24】5.  **Disturbance in Morning Vision:** There may be disturbances in morning vision. This may be caused due to obstruction of vision due to clots.\n\n【25】How to Diagnose Retinal Hemorrhage?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【26】Eye specialists know all about the various kinds of retinal drains. An enlarged eye test utilizing an instrument called a cut light can uncover a retinal discharge. An eye specialist can likewise utilize exceptional devices to snap a photo within the eye. Sometimes, a color will be infused into a vein in the wrist or arm. The color will stream into the retina's veins, permitting the specialist to take an exceptionally clear picture. An imaging procedure called OCT likewise helps eye specialists better see the retinal drain. The eye specialist will take an intensive history, getting information about the injury, prescription, blazes or floaters, and exercises, such as scuba jumping or high-elevation climbing. They will likewise get some information about any illnesses or hidden conditions one may have. They may likewise need to have an expert request blood tests or other indicative methodology to check whether the patient has a basic disease, for example, diabetes, hypertension, contamination, or vein problems, that might have caused the retinal discharge. To direct treatment, the eye specialist must work with your essential consideration specialist or your expert.\n\n【27】How Is Retinal Hemorrhage Treated?\n----------------------------------\n\n【28】Treatment of retinal drain relies upon the seriousness and the reason. At times, the drain is little and can be checked while it mends on its own over weeks or months. In different cases, hidden conditions should be blessed to assist the patient with recuperating. The treatment of retinal hemorrhage depends upon the degree and cause. At times, if the hemorrhage is small, it can just be monitored as it disappears on its own. This might take weeks or months if it is preretinal. Hidden conditions should be assessed and treated to enable the patient to recover at the earliest. In diabetic retinopathy or other conditions causing new blood vessel proliferation, laser treatment can be beneficial to prevent further recurrences.\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】Retinal Hemorrhage is a condition of the eye that can be caused due to various factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and other blood disorders. It can also be caused due to accidents or rigorous physical activity. It may or may not present with symptoms. Sometimes the hemorrhage can be really small and develop later. The retina is a sensitive part of the eye, and symptoms may quickly show. Hence one should consult a doctor as soon as one may develop symptoms of visual disturbances.\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>*   Retinal Hemorrhage  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560777/\n*   Retinal Haemorrhage  \n    https://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/vitreous-hemorrhage-diagnosis-treatment-2</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Huffing has been practiced for ages now but has gained popularity in recent years, and the graph of; people involved has remarkably surged; variable factors; can be the reason considered, like low cost; availability, peer influence, and rapid mood elevation. A significant correlation has been demonstrated between alcohol consumption and huffing, which states the; population that is alcoholic is most likely to be involved in activities like huffing. Adolescents involved carry out acts that can be fatal as well; thus various laws; have been implemented to control the practice of toxic inhalation but are difficult to implement due to the inability to regulate and restrict the availability of the substance of abuse as these are the day-to-day used products.\n\n【2】What Is Substance of Abuse and How Are They Used to Cause the Effect?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Substances of abuse or the products used in huffing mainly contain volatile liquids commonly made up of butane, lead, propane, toluene, ethyl acetate, or naphthalene.\n\n【4】The products that are commonly used due to their easy access and low cost are spray paint, permanent markers, correction fluid, glue, lighter fluid, hairspray, gasoline, kerosene, and mothballs. These substances are generally packed in a container, and the bottle is placed; over the mouth or nose and inhaled to obtain the desired state of euphoria. Abusive is also sprayed; directly into the nose or mouth, or applied over; the sleeves or collars of the dresses that are inhaled at the intervals; the effect lasts for a short duration, and so the individuals; inhale the substances repeatedly.\n\n【5】What Effect Does an Inhalant Have on the Body and Organs?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】After inhalation or abuse, a person enters a state of euphoria that is similar to a state of alcohol consumption, but the duration of effect is shorter in comparison to alcohol.\n\n【7】**Effect of Inhalant on CNS:**\n\n【8】Similar to other methods to gain the feeling of euphoria, inhalants also target the central nervous system, and the activity; of the brain is slowed down. An individual experiences the following symptoms:\n\n【9】*   Tremors and uncontrollable shaking on long-term use of abuse.\n\n【10】*   Seizures.\n\n【11】*   Euphoria (feeling high).\n\n【12】*   Dizziness.\n\n【13】*   Double or blurred vision as it also affects eyesight.\n\n【14】*   Change in personality and behavior due to damage to the brain.\n\n【15】*   Memory loss.\n\n【16】The abuse also affects other organs like the lungs, liver, kidney, peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal system, muscles, and bones when used for long durations; the severity of the damage; depends on the quantity, frequency, and duration of the use.\n\n【17】The effect of inhalant is quick as the fumes dissolve in the fatty tissue of the brain within seconds of passing from nose to lungs to heart and brain; it can also; cause sudden sniffing death within seconds of inhalation, or cause permanent coma or paralysis, inability to think, talk, walk depending on the inhalant used.\n\n【18】Death after the use of inhalants may occur due to heart rhythm irregularities leading to cardiac arrest, suffocation, asphyxiation, or aspiration.\n\n【19】How Is Inhalation Disorder Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【20】Diagnosis of inhalant-related psychotic disorders is purely based on the signs and symptoms presented by the individual can range from mild headache and disorientation to life-threatening suffocation, irregular heart rate, etc. if a patient is brought to the emergency room is usually in a state of euphoria and is disoriented, the vitals are elevated, breath smells like the odor of the substance of abuse, which can help confirm the diagnosis. Blood and specific urine analysis help to detect the quantity and the substance of abuse as inhalants are not detected by normal drug urine analysis. The clinical picture usually is presented as elevated liver enzymes; the gas chromatography; technique can also be used.\n\n【21】**Differential Diagnosis:**\n\n【22】As inhalant-induced psychiatric disorders resemble mental health disorders, the differential diagnosis is as follows:\n\n【23】*   Conduct disorder.\n\n【24】*   Antisocial personality disorder.\n\n【25】*   Alcohol abuse and dependence.\n\n【26】*   Cannabis abuse and dependence.\n\n【27】*   Temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\n【28】*   Psychosis.\n\n【29】*   Polysubstance dependence.\n\n【30】*   Gambling.\n\n【31】*   Delinquency.\n\n【32】*   Physical and sexual abuse.\n\n【33】How Are Inhalant Related Disorders Treated?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Treatment mainly aims at discontinuing the inhalation and reverting the symptoms or controlling the further damage. Treatment options similar to other mental health disorders include cognitive behavioral therapy, family therapy, activity and engagement programs, and rehabilitation programs.\n\n【35】**Inhalant Abuse or Overdose:**\n\n【36】An inhalant overdose occurs when a large amount of toxic substance is inhaled, causing severe symptoms; or death. Inhalant overdose can occur to anybody, even the first-time; user as well; it does not; require you to be an abuser for a long period. It is usually caused by solvents and aerosol sprays that are highly concentrated with a large number of active ingredients; stop sniffing deaths; usually occur due to suffocation when inhalation occurs in closed spaces or as the heart fails to function.\n\n【37】How Is Overdose Treated?\n------------------------\n\n【38】Inhalant overdose causes life-threatening symptoms including seizures; and cardiac arrhythmia, or the heart completely stop beating; therefore, the; primary treatment involves emergency room doctors who carry out symptomatic treatment to control the seizures and revert the function of the heart. No treatment modalities have been found to date to revert the effect of inhalant intoxication.\n\n【39】**Conclusion:**\n\n【40】Inhalant-related psychiatric disorders are conditions where individuals generally in the adolescent age group use abusive inhalants like paints, kerosine, and white markers to experience a state of euphoria similar to that of alcohol, but inhalant-infused; euphoria is short-termed, which leads to repeated; inhalation by the addict. The symptoms include euphoria, tremors, disorientation, slurred speech, blurred vision, etc. Its treatment includes symptomatic cure and therapies to promote discontinuing the habit to prevent further complications.\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>*   nida.nih.gov- inhalants drug fact  \n    https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugfacts/inhalants\n*   medscape-inhalant related psychosis  \n    https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/290344-differential.\n*   clevelandclinic-inhalant- abuse, diagnosis  \n    https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15742-inhalant-abuse#diagnosis-and-tests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

A capsular ligament and articular cartilage separate two long bones that are articulated against one another. The joint, like any mechanical component, is prone to wear and tear based on its use or abuse, particularly in sports, athletics, old age, and arthritis.\n\n【2】What Are the Principal Contents of the Knee Joint?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The knee consists of three main bony components and an array of ligaments, cartilage, blood, nerve, and muscle supply. The components can be sub-classified as follows:\n\n【4】**Bony Components**\n\n【5】*   The thigh bone or femur.\n\n【6】*   The shin bone or tibia.\n\n【7】*   The kneecap or patella.\n\n【8】**Ligaments**\n\n【9】*   Anterior cruciate ligament.\n\n【10】*   Posterior cruciate ligament.\n\n【11】*   Medial collateral ligament.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome - Types, Causes, Diagnosis and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS) - Causes, Manifestations, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Lateral collateral ligament.\n    </u>\n\n【13】**Cartilage**\n\n【14】*   Medial meniscus.\n\n【15】*   Lateral meniscus.\n\n【16】The joint is outlined by a layer of a fluid-filled membrane known as the synovial membrane.\n\n【17】1.  Muscles.\n\n【18】2.  Blood vessels.\n\n【19】3.  Nerves.\n\n【20】What Are the Knee Muscles That Knee Stretch Exercises Benefit?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Knee stretching exercises are not targeted at the knee joint per se. These exercises aim to benefit the muscles and tendons surrounding the knee joint, which are directly affected by the exercises mentioned in this article. The muscles and tendons that are targeted by these exercises are as follows:\n\n【22】*   The quadriceps.\n\n【23】*   The hamstrings.\n\n【24】*   The calves.\n\n【25】*   The hip muscles.\n\n【26】*   The iliotibial band.\n\n【27】**Exercises for Knee Strengthening**\n\n【28】Knee exercises are paramount to keep the joints healthy and stable for extended periods. Although exercises are prescribed in the postoperative recovery phase following knee surgeries, certain exercises help keep an individual healthy, especially if they are prone to work that causes repetitive strain or wears and tear to the knee joint. Several exercises can easily be performed at home enlisted as follows:\n\n【29】*   **Knee Straightening Exercises**: This is one of the more amateur and beginner-level exercises for the knee. It involves the individual straightening their knees and stretching their hips. This results in a loosening of the surrounding muscles and tendons of the knees. It is especially beneficial in individuals who have obesity or have recently undergone knee surgery.\n\n【30】*   **Leg Straightening Exercises**: This is a build-up to the previously mentioned knee straightening exercise. It involves the extension of the entire leg, causing the knee joint to be extended. It allows the muscles and tendons around the knee joint to relax and loosen up. It is also beneficial for the articular cartilage and the joint's synovial membrane, keeping the blood flow intact in the region.\n\n【31】*   **Hamstring Stretches (Lying)**: This exercise is of moderate difficulty. It involves the individual lying down on their back and extending their leg upwards. One of the most crucial aspects to bear in mind during this exercise is to lie on a rigid surface to prevent any injury to the spine or unnecessarily over-exert the hip joint. It is recommended to lie flat on an exercise mat before performing it. The exercise is intended to benefit the hamstring muscle that crosses along the rear of the knee. Any tightness or pain in the hamstring muscle can be relieved by regularly performing this exercise.\n\n【32】*   **Hamstring Stretches (Sitting)**: This exercise follows the previously mentioned lying-down exercise to stretch the hamstring muscles. The exercise is highly recommended for runners and athletes. By virtue of their profession, these individuals are prone to over-exert their knee joints. The sitting hamstring stretch exercises are usually performed after a training session involving running that causes significant tightness in the hamstring muscles.\n\n【33】*   **Quad Stretches (Standing)**: These exercises are aimed toward the front of the knee. To perform this exercise, the individual needs to push their weight against a hard surface and stretch their quad muscles. The stretches can be felt in the front of the knee joint and the thighs. It is essential for runners and obese individuals.\n\n【34】*   **Calf Stretches**: These exercises are also beneficial for runners and athletes who over-exert their calf muscles. It involves standing up and pushing the body against a rigid surface, and extending the leg backward. The calf muscles, when tightened, can result in increased stress on the knee joint.\n\n【35】What Are the Benefits of Knee Stretch Exercises?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】The muscles in and around the knee joint tend to get taut and tight due to regular use, let alone excessive wear and tear. The knee stretch exercises mentioned above help relieve the tightness from these muscles, thus resulting in less likeliness for an individual to develop the following problems:\n\n【37】*   Knee pain.\n\n【38】*   Knee stiffness.\n\n【39】*   Injury to the joint or muscles due to excessive or repetitive strain.\n\n【40】What Are the Exercises to Avoid?\n--------------------------------\n\n【41】Although knee stretching and strengthening exercises are necessary for people with specific problems or in the postoperative recovery phase, specific exercises must be avoided, as they may result in increased pain or worsening of the condition that already affects the knee. The exercises that are not recommended are:\n\n【42】*   **Deep Squats**: These exercises must be avoided because they result in increased pressure on the knee joint, especially in obese individuals.\n\n【43】*   **Lunges and Jumps**: Lunges and jumps cause compression of the knee joint, particularly the articular disc present within the joint space.\n\n【44】*   **Running**: Running for long periods and overexerting oneself is also one of the exercises that need to be avoided, specifically in postoperative recovery patients.\n\n【45】When to See a Doctor?\n---------------------\n\n【46】While many common causes of knee pain can be treated at home, see a doctor if the knee pain is sudden and is associated with any of the following:\n\n【47】*   Sudden snap or pop.\n\n【48】*   Sudden movement loss.\n\n【49】*   Sudden swelling.\n\n【50】*   A feeling of buckling or giving out.\n\n【51】*   Being stuck in one position and unable to release the knee from that position.\n\n【52】All of these symptoms could indicate a serious knee injury and therefore should prompt a visit to a specialist. A tear of the meniscus, one of the \"shock absorbers\" in the knee joint, is a common example of such an injury.\n\n【53】**Conclusion**\n\n【54】The knees are two of the body's largest and most heavily used joints. It is no surprise, then, that knee pain is both common and difficult to ignore. Knee exercises are essential to keep the joints healthy. Although knee stretching and strengthening exercises are necessary for people with specific problems or in the postoperative recovery phase, specific exercises must be avoided, as they may result in increased pain or worsening of the condition. The exercises help prevent future pain and discomfort and are also helpful in cases where individuals have suffered injuries and undergone surgical procedures.\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>*   How to Relieve Knee Pain Through Stretches and Exercises You Can Do at Home  \n    https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2020/sep/how-to-relieve-knee-pain-through-stretches-and-exercises-you-can-do-at-home/\n*   Knee exercises for runners  \n    https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/running-and-aerobic-exercises/knee-exercises-for-runners/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "954ce016-f403-4e46-a4ae-04db438691d6", "title": "Undifferentiated Spondyloarthropathy - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Undifferentiated Spondyloarthropathy - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\nWhat Is Undifferentiated Spondyloarthropathy?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【1】The term undifferentiated spondyloarthritis (USpA) is used to describe spondylitis symptoms and signs in people who do not meet the criteria for an accurate diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis or a related condition. If certain spondylitis symptoms are present but are not distinctive enough to warrant a specific diagnosis, a doctor may sometimes make an initial diagnosis of spondyloarthritis or unclassified spondyloarthritis.\n\n【2】Ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, juvenile spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and enteropathic arthritis are all possible diagnoses for this individual's combination of symptoms. Some people with USpA will develop ankylosing spondylitis, a more distinct type of spondylitis, over time. Over the years, a lot of people with USpA have been told that they are just anxious and depressed or that they have fibromyalgia (a chronic disorder that causes a lot of pain in the muscles and soft tissues).\n\n【3】What Are the Symptoms of Undifferentiated Spondyloarthropathy?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Pain may be the only symptom experienced by individuals with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies at times. In addition, individuals with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies experience the following symptoms:\n\n【5】*   Low back pain that lasts for a long time and starts slowly, usually radiating from the buttocks, before the age of 45 years.\n\n【6】*   General body stiffness that gets worse upon waking and improves with exercise.\n\n【7】*   A history of heel pain and swelling in the feet and hands.\n\n【8】*   A general absence of abdominal symptoms, despite the fact that up to a third of patients experience intermittent diarrhea or more than two bowel movements per day.\n\n【9】*   Intestinal inflammation can only be seen through an ileocolonscopy. The symptoms may resemble a bacterial infection or inflammatory bowel disease. There appears to be a strong connection between joint inflammation and intestinal inflammation with ongoing monitoring.\n\n【10】*   Pain in both large and small joints, mostly in the legs and feet, However, this joint pain might be more severe on one side of the body than on the other.\n\n【11】*   Inflammation of the eye.\n\n【12】*   A red bumpy rash often goes along with a fever and intermittent joint pains.\n\n【13】*   Symptoms that affect the genitals and urinary tract.\n\n【14】What Are the Causes and Risk Factors of Undifferentiated Spondyloarthropathy?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Similar to reactive arthritis, many people with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies have the genetic marker HLA-B27, indicating that this disease is inherited. In addition, a pattern of mild intestinal inflammation or Crohn's disease has been observed in family studies.\n\n【16】According to some findings, other rheumatic symptoms, such as joint pain, may be brought on by intestinal inflammation in this condition. However, it could also be caused by a germ, virus, or bacteria.\n\n【17】How Is Undifferentiated Spondyloarthropathy Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies are easy to mistake for other conditions due to the nature of their symptoms. It is less prevalent than other forms of rheumatoid arthritis. For an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, it is essential to have a trained doctor who is knowledgeable about rheumatic conditions. Many doctors are unaware of how prevalent this issue is, particularly among women. Because it is frequently overlooked, doing homework by oneself is even more important. A doctor will look at the patient's body for a physical examination and review the symptoms. Then, they will run tests to rule out digestive problems.\n\n【19】To confirm a diagnosis of undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies, a doctor may order the following tests:\n\n【20】*   An ileocolonoscopy to detect the presence of any inflammation in the intestines.\n\n【21】*   Blood tests for a number of factors, including antibodies or immune system responses.\n\n【22】*   An examination for the HLA-B27 gene. Ankylosing spondylitis can be ruled out with this test. That gene is present in more than 95 percent of people with ankylosing spondylitis but only a small percentage of people with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy. An individual with the gene does not necessarily develop ankylosing spondylitis.\n\n【23】*   The hands, feet, and hip joints may become eroded in patients. Rheumatoid arthritis-related joint damage may look something like these.\n\n【24】How Is Undifferentiated Spondyloarthropathy Treated?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy does not currently have a cure, but patients can live full and productive lives with proper treatment. Medication, physical therapy, and exercise are typically the most common primary treatments for USpA. Applying heat or ice can also help alleviate joint pain for some patients.\n\n【26】*   **Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):**\n\n【27】The majority of USpA patients will begin treatment by taking prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medications like Diclofenac or Ibuprofen. Pain and inflammation can be temporarily reduced with NSAIDs.\n\n【28】*   **Biologics:**\n\n【29】When nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone do not alleviate symptoms, healthcare professionals may prescribe biologics. These can be self-injected or given by infusion into a vein in the office of a doctor. Although biologics are approved for the treatment of specific spondyloarthropathies like ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease-associated arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, the FDA has not approved any biologics for the treatment of undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy. However, it is believed that patients with this disorder may benefit from biologics; their use is considered \"off-label\" because they have not been approved by the food and drug administration (FDA) for undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy.\n\n【30】Biologics are divided into two categories:\n\n【31】1\\. Most of the time, biologics, like tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), are the first group of drugs that doctors recommend to patients. This is because they reduce inflammation in the body by binding to and neutralizing TNF.\n\n【32】2\\. Interleukin 17 inhibitors, a newer class of drugs, make up the second group of biologics.\n\n【33】*   **Corticosteroids:**\n\n【34】Joint pain and inflammation can be reduced with the help of corticosteroids. These can be taken orally or locally by injecting them directly into the joint or joints where the patient is experiencing pain. Most of the time, corticosteroids are taken for short periods of time.\n\n【35】*   **Exercise:**\n\n【36】For the treatment of undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy, exercise is very important. Stiffness and pain are alleviated by regular movement. Light exercise, like going for a walk, can help a person who is in pain get better when it happens. If the pain is too great, stretching while sitting or lying down is better. For USpA patients, there is no best exercise. All exercise is good, as long as it is low-impact (walking or swimming) and done often. A physical therapist can pair the patient with an appropriate exercise and stretching program or help them exercise on their own. Checking with a healthcare provider is advised before beginning an exercise program. Starting slowly and gradually building up stamina and strength. It is advised not to push oneself to the point of pain.\n\n【37】*   **Surgery:**\n\n【38】Surgery may be beneficial for some patients who cannot be helped by medication or exercise. However, for USpA patients, this is typically the last option.\n\n【39】**Conclusion**\n\n【40】Most people can live a full life with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy, despite the physical and emotional effects it can have on daily activities. The disease can be managed with the right combination of medication, medical care, and self-management through healthy lifestyle choices. For example, if the patient smokes, they are advised to make an effort to quit because smoking has negative effects and can make their condition worse. Any inquiries about the disease's potential treatments or management should be discussed with the healthcare provider.\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>*   Undifferentiated Spondyloarthropathies  \n    https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/u/undifferentiated-spondyloarthropathies.html\n*   Overview of Undifferentiated Spondyloarthritis  \n    https://spondylitis.org/about-spondylitis/overview-of-spondyloarthritis/undifferentiated-spondyloarthritis/\n*   Undifferentiated Spondyloarthritis: A Longterm Followup  \n    https://www.jrheum.org/content/37/6/1195</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "e792664f-b8bf-4036-89a0-13bbf0855f1e", "title": "All About Majocchi's Granuloma", "text": "【0】All About Majocchi's Granuloma\nWhat Is Majocchi's Granuloma?\n-----------------------------\n\n【1】Majocchi’s granuloma is a rare deep folliculitis caused by a fungal infection. It is an infection that affects the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. According to condition and clinical manifestation, this condition is divided into two types. It is also known as nodular granulomatous perifolliculitis or granuloma trichophyticum. Dermatophyte fungal infection is the reason behind this condition. It infects different body parts such as hair, skin, and nails.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Majocchi's Granuloma?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Following are the two types of Majocchi’s granuloma:\n\n【4】*   **Perifolliculitis:** This type usually appears as perifollicular papules or bumps. It mainly affects the lower part of the body due to penetrating trauma.\n\n【5】*   **Subcutaneous Nodules:** This type of majocchi’s granuloma usually affects immunocompromised patients. This type mainly affects the upper part of the body. It is clinically represented as a group of nodules.\n\n【6】What Are the Causes of Majocchi's Granuloma?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Majocchi’s granuloma is caused by infected hair follicles, where the fungi enter through the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, causing the infection. The following are the etiological factors associated with Majocchi’s granuloma:\n\n【8】Fungi that cause this infection are:\n\n【9】*   Trichophyton rubrum.\n\n【10】*   Trichophyton mentagrophytes.\n\n【11】*   Trichophyton tonsurans.\n\n【12】*   Trichophyton violaceum.\n\n【13】*   Epidermophyton floccosum.\n\n【14】*   Non-dermatophyte molds.\n\n【15】1.  If a person has a longstanding or recurrent infection in the body. For instance, preexisting dermatophytosis puts a person at a greater risk of developing this condition.\n\n【16】2.  If a person lives in a place with a tropical climate.\n\n【17】3.  If there is a cutaneous trauma on the skin, for example, a cut from shaving.\n\n【18】4.  If a person is on topical steroids or antineoplastic therapy.\n\n【19】5.  If a person had chemotherapy or an organ transplant and is on immunosuppressant drugs, such as alpha inhibitors.\n\n【20】6.  Animals are the carrier of pathogenic fungi. The following are the most common carriers of the diseases:\n\n【21】*   Cats.\n\n【22】*   Guinea pigs.\n\n【23】*   Mice.\n\n【24】*   Rats.\n\n【25】*   Hamsters.\n\n【26】As the condition is contagious, sexual activity or contact with the other person might spread it. Moreover, touching an infected person’s hair or nail fragments can also cause this infection to spread.\n\n【27】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Majocchi's Granuloma?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Following are the signs and symptoms associated with Majocchi’s granuloma:\n\n【29】*   **Irregular Patches:** This condition shows redness and irregular patches on the affected site.\n\n【30】*   **Scaly Plaque:** During this type of condition, there is an erythematous plaque with crusts seen at the site.\n\n【31】*   **Pustules:** They are small, swollen pus-filled blisters or bumps on the skin. They are usually sized four to six millimeters and red.\n\n【32】*   **Nodules:** It is an abnormal growth of the tissue that develops under the skin layers. This abnormality can be developed under the deeper layer of the skin or on the internal organs. They are at least one centimeter in size.\n\n【33】*   **Scaling:** At the foot's sole, this symptom is seen.\n\n【34】*   **Shape of the Toenails:** Irregular or abnormally yellow toenails.\n\n【35】How to Diagnose Majocchi's Granuloma?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【36】The following are the diagnostic methods used for Majocchi’s granuloma:\n\n【37】*   **Physical Examination:** The condition represents the skin's non-tender, unilateral purple nodules or erythematous (red rashes) lesions. Doctors check for these signs on the body and move to the next diagnostic option to confirm the condition.\n\n【38】*   **Hair Samples:** During this step, the doctor scrapes the hair from the affected area and checks for any infection trace to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【39】*   **Mycology:** During this step, the fungal cultures are microscopically tested and evaluated to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【40】*   **Biopsy:** During this diagnostic step, from the affected area, the tissue or skin biopsy sample is collected and sent for testing. All the biopsy sections are examined under polarized light and checked for abnormalities.\n\n【41】What Is the Prognosis of Majocchi's Granuloma?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【42】As the condition is contagious, there are high chances of recurrence and spread. In addition, the study shows that the condition remains uncured in areas such as nails, feet, or other sites. Moreover, after giving antifungal therapy, there are high chances of developing post-inflammatory pigments, atrophic scarring, and alopecia.\n\n【43】How to Manage Majocchi's Granuloma?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【44】The following management options are available for Majocchi’s granuloma:\n\n【45】1.  **Pharmacological Therapy:** In the cases of majocchi’s granuloma, the infection is penetrated to the deeper layer of the skin. Due to this reason, topical antifungal medications are not effective. However, systemic prescription of antifungal drugs is effective. The drug therapy should be continued until the wound is closed, which takes four to eight weeks. The following are the medications that can be prescribed:\n\n【46】    1.  Terbinafine - 250 milligrams/day for four to six weeks.\n\n【47】    2.  Griseofulvin - 0.5 to 1 gram/day for four to six weeks.\n\n【48】    3.  Itraconazole - 100 to 200 milligrams twice daily for 20 to 30 days.\n\n【49】    4.  Voriconazole - 200 milligrams twice daily for four months.\n\n【50】    5.  Ketoconazole - 200 milligrams/day for 30 to 90 days.\n\n【51】2.  **Traditional Therapy:** The traditional therapy for this condition includes oral potassium iodide, filtered radiation, and topical administration of Dimethylamino-6-Benzothiazole.\n\n【52】3.  **Nitrogen Therapy:** This next step can be used after antifungal systemic medication therapy. This therapy is used for the drainage of toxins and cell healing.\n\n【53】4.  **Surgical Approach:** During this mode of treatment, surgical incision, drainage, and excision are used. Each option is recommended depending on the site and the severity of the condition. For instance, in the case of deep fungal infections in immunosuppressed patients, excision is recommended along with other drug therapy.\n\n【54】5.  **Multi-Therapy Approach:** In the case of severe conditions, this mode of treatment is used. It is a combination of surgical therapy and pharmaceutical therapy. The combination of surgery and Fluconazole, surgery and Griseofulvin, or Amphotericin B and Terbinafine was used.\n\n【55】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Majocchi's Granuloma?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】According to the type of lesion, the following are differential diagnoses associated with Majocchi’s granuloma:\n\n【57】**Papule:**\n\n【58】*   Folliculitis.\n\n【59】*   Acne vulgaris.\n\n【60】*   Lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei.\n\n【61】*   Insect bite.\n\n【62】*   Cutaneous leishmaniasis.\n\n【63】*   Granulomatous rosacea.\n\n【64】*   Disseminated toxoplasmosis.\n\n【65】*   Kaposi sarcoma.\n\n【66】**Nodule:**\n\n【67】*   Erythema nodosum.\n\n【68】*   Erythema induratum Bazin.\n\n【69】*   Furunculosis.\n\n【70】*   Sarcoidosis.\n\n【71】*   Cutaneous leishmaniasis.\n\n【72】*   Kaposi sarcoma.\n\n【73】*   Foreign body granuloma.\n\n【74】*   Lymphocytoma cutis.\n\n【75】*   Thrombophlebitis.\n\n【76】*   Squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【77】**Plaque:**\n\n【78】*   Bacterial cellulitis.\n\n【79】*   Eosinophilic cellulitis.\n\n【80】*   Chemical cellulitis.\n\n【81】*   Sarcoidosis.\n\n【82】*   Lupus vulgaris.\n\n【83】*   Cutaneous leishmaniasis.\n\n【84】*   Stasis dermatitis.\n\n【85】*   Psoriasis.\n\n【86】*   Contact dermatitis.\n\n【87】**Conclusion**\n\n【88】Majocchi’s granuloma is a condition that affects a deeper layer of the skin. Due to the complications and severity of the condition, it is highly recommended to check with the doctor at the first sign of the condition. Moreover, along with the therapy, regular follow-up visits are highly recommended.\n\n【89】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【90】无关删除-1:<u>*   Majocchi granuloma  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/majocchi-granuloma\n*   MAJOCCHI GRANULOMA  \n    https://www.aocd.org/page/MajocchiGranuloma\n*   Majocchi’s granuloma: current perspectives  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5968791/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "56d73d18-eeab-40af-b6f7-4f48133993c7", "title": "Is Coronavirus Lockdown Worsening Childhood Obesity?", "text": "【0】When the pandemic began, most countries around the globe had implemented lockdowns to curb the spread of the Coronavirus infection. Schools and colleges were shut down without further notice, and children were not allowed to step out of the house to play. Even with the advent of vaccines, parents are still reluctant to send their children out to play, which is justifiable. The pandemic has not ended still. This has negatively impacted their diet, physical activity, and sleep (a study conducted by the University at Buffalo). According to another study, a lack of physical activity combined with unhealthy snacking has led to the worsening of childhood obesity.\n\n【1】Are Children Really Gaining Weight?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【2】A study, that was published in the journal called Obesity, examined 41 obese children throughout March and April and compared it to behaviors recorded a year back in Verona, Italy. This study was conducted and led by Steven Heymsfield (a professor at the Louisiana State University Pennington Biomedical Research Center) and Angelo Pietrobelli (a professor at the University of Verona in Italy). The study found that these children consumed an additional meal every day, slept more than usual, and spent almost five hours every day on the phone, television, and computer. They also noted a drastic increase in the consumption of red meat, junk food, and sugary beverages. The study also noted a decline in physical activity by two hours per week.\n\n【3】The school helps children maintain a routine around mealtimes, physical activity, and sleep, which are important lifestyle factors associated with the risk of obesity. This is why children typically gain more weight during summer vacation, as this routine gets disturbed when they are home. This led to the study to check if children gained more weight while being confined at home for such a long time, and it did find unhealthy behavior in obese children.\n\n【4】Why Are Children Gaining Weight During Lockdown?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】**The following are some causes of weight gain:**\n\n【6】1.  Spending most of the time idle in front of the television, smartphone, or video games.\n2.  Snacking on sweets and fried food between meals.\n\n【7】3.  As they are not allowed to go play with their friends, physical activity suffers a decline.\n\n【8】4.  Some parents give their children chocolates or chips as positive reinforcement.\n\n【9】5.  A change in routine can affect them mentally, and they might start comfort eating.\n\n【10】6.  Not being able to meet their friends and grandparents might also have the same effect.\n\n【11】7.  Sleeping during the day.\n\n【12】8.  Staying awake late and midnight snacking.\n\n【13】9.  Consuming high-calorie and low-nutrient foods and drinks.\n\n【14】How Is Childhood Obesity Harmful?\n---------------------------------\n\n【15】Childhood obesity can affect your child physically, socially, and emotionally.

Find a way to include a healthy vegetable in every meal.\n\n【49】**2) Keep Them Hydrated:**\n\n【50】Encourage them to carry their water bottle and keep sipping water the entire day. This will keep them hydrated and full. When they feel full, they are less tempted to snack on sugary things.\n\n【51】**3) Include Healthy Snacks:**\n\n【52】Do not encourage them by giving them ice creams, chips, and chocolate in between meals. Make it a habit to give them fruits or nuts. You can make healthy fruit sorbet or give them Greek yogurt and berries in place of ice creams.\n\n【53】**4) Educate Them About Portion Sizes:**\n\n【54】We do not want you to completely deprive your child of his or her favorite chocolate and chips. You can teach them to portion out their food before they eat anything. Instead of giving them an entire bag of chips to snack on, dish it out in small portions.\n\n【55】**5) Ask Them to Pay Attention to Signs of Hunger and Satiety:**\n\n【56】Teach them how to pick up signs and signals the body shows when it is time to start and stop eating. Tell them not to wait until they are starving or overeat until they feel stuffed.\n\n【57】**6) Exercise:**\n\n【58】If you ask your child to work out or exercise alone, it is never going to happen. Instead, exercise together as a family. When they see you working out daily, they get encouraged. Go for a walk together or do yoga at home. Play any sport that they are interested in.\n\n【59】**7) Be Supportive:**\n\n【60】Do not nag or keep insisting your child follow a diet plan or physical activity. Educate them to make healthy choices and control their portions on their own. Let them be as independent as possible.\n\n【61】**8) Do Not Use Food as a Punishment or Reward:**\n\n【62】Positive reinforcement is good, but make sure the incentives and rewards do not involve food.\n\n【63】**9) Limit Screen Time:**\n\n【64】Kids usually tend to spend hours staring at digital screens, and in recent years due to COVID restrictions, they are forced to stare at smartphones, laptops, and computers for educational purposes. Though schools are reopening now, online education still tends to prevail at times and in parts of the world whenever cases surge. To prevent this excessive screen time, allow only one to two hours every day for television or video games. Encourage them to draw, paint, play with their toys, or dance the rest of the time.\n\n【65】**Some other things that might help are:**\n\n【66】*   Do not let them eat meals or snacks while watching television, as they might not pay attention to the feeling of fullness and overeat.\n*   Stock foods that are low on calories and high on nutrition. But make sure you give them chocolates and other treats occasionally.\n\n【67】*   Let them do chores that help burn calories, such as mowing the lawn, gardening, washing the car, or cleaning the house. Assign age-appropriate tasks every day to keep them engaged.\n\n【68】**Conclusion**:\n\n【69】A healthy diet and physical activity can help your child stay fit during this lockdown. These simple tips will prevent or minimize the risk of childhood obesity, not only during the COVID-19 pandemic but all year long. Use this time wisely and lay a strong foundation for a lifetime of good health.\n\n【70】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【71】* * *\n\n【72】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Most Common Causes of Child Obesity?**\n\n【73】Following are a few causes of child obesity:  \n\\- Limited physical activities.  \n\\- Excessive mobile phone usage.  \n\\- Video game addiction.  \n\\- Excessive junk food intake.  \n\\- Lack of proper rest.  \n\\- Disturbed sleeping cycle.  \n\\- Excessive isolation.\n\n【74】#### **2.**删除换行**Can Childhood Obesity Be Considered an Epidemic?**\n\n【75】At present, childhood obesity affects around thirty percent of the children population, and thus, it can be considered an epidemic condition.

The most significant risk factor for emphysema is cigarette smoking. Smoking stimulates inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells, which release elastase and cause elastolysis and emphysema. A characteristic feature of emphysema is the barrel chest which is a rounded and enlarged chest appearance due to hyperinflation. Typically, the anteroposterior to transverse ratio is 5:7 or 1:2, but in the case of emphysema, it becomes 1:1 due to hyperinflation. Depending on the zonal distribution, there are two types of emphysema: centrilobular emphysema and pan-lobular emphysema.\n\n【2】What Is Panlobular Emphysema?\n-----------------------------\n\n【3】Panlobular emphysema is an irreversible chronic disease that keeps worsening daily. It typically affects the acini, which can cause obstruction and hence, make it difficult to breathe. It is the end portion of the tracheobronchial tree, including alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. It affects the lower lobe of the lungs more severely. It evenly distributes the disease and uniformly destroys the acinus and the secondary pulmonary lobules.\n\n【4】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Panlobular Emphysema?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The signs and symptoms include:\n\n【6】*   Chest tightness.\n\n【7】*   Wheezing.\n\n【8】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【9】*   Recurrent respiratory infections.\n\n【10】*   Persistent cough.\n\n【11】*   Excess sputum production.\n\n【12】*   Difficulty in performing daily activities.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I have emphysema.

This enzyme is produced by the liver and secreted into the bloodstream to protect the lungs. The enzyme helps inhibit the elastase enzyme; therefore, all the elastin is broken down, resulting in emphysema.\n\n【25】**Ritalin Lung:** It is seen in intravenous Ritalin (methylphenidate) abusers. It is also known as excipient lung disease. Methylphenidate is commonly used in cases of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and narcolepsy in adults. It is a structural analog of Amphetamine. Exposure to the talc-containing methylphenidate causes alveolar damage via talc granulomatosis, or there is a secondary infection relating to talc exposure resulting in the production of elastases, thereby causing alveolar destruction.\n\n【26】**Obliterative Bronchiolitis:** It is a rare condition caused by inhalation of chemicals, exposure to a respiratory virus, or an autoimmune disorder. It is also known as obliterative bronchiolitis or constrictive bronchiolitis. It is a type of bronchial inflammation with submucosal peribronchial fibrosis. It can also be associated with graft versus host disease following a lung or bone marrow transplant. It is characterized by concentric luminal narrowing of membranous and respiratory bronchioles due to submucosal and peribronchial inflammation and fibrosis without any intraluminal granulation tissue or polyps/ polyposis. Diffuse parenchymal inflammation is absent. It is also known as a popcorn lung since workers of a microwave popcorn plant had inhaled diacetyl, a chemical compound used for flavoring, and developed obliterative bronchiolitis.\n\n【27】**Swyer-James Syndrome:** It is a rare lung condition that involves either the entire lung or a portion of the lung that can get affected. It retards the growth of the affected lung compared to the other lung. The condition typically follows a viral respiratory infection such as adenovirus or Mycoplasma pneumonia infection in infancy or early childhood. The typical feature of a CT (computed tomography) scan is the affected lung being hyperlucent with diminished vascularity.\n\n【28】What Are the Lab Investigations to Be Carried Out?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】The following factors can make the diagnosis:\n\n【30】*   **Radiographic Imaging**: Such as a chest X-ray or a computed tomography (CT) scan.\n\n【31】*   **Pulse Oximetry**: To measure the oxygen saturation levels in the blood.\n\n【32】*   **Arterial Blood Gas Analysis:** It measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide dissolved within the blood. It helps in evaluating how effectively the lungs are able to bring in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the body.\n\n【33】*   **Pulmonary Function Test or Spirometry**: To measure the lung volume and capacities.\n\n【34】*   **Electrocardiogram:** To check the heart function.\n\n【35】Although these tests help identify a case of emphysema, pan-lobular emphysema can be diagnosed with a CT scan. The most common characteristic features seen in a CT are:\n\n【36】*   Decreased lung attenuation.\n\n【37】*   Few visible pulmonary vessels in abnormal areas.\n\n【38】*   Bullae or cysts are usually absent.\n\n【39】What Is the Treatment Modality for Panlobular Emphysema?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】The treatment of pan lobular emphysema aims to reduce the symptoms and slow the disease progression.\n\n【41】The treatment may vary depending on the cause. Still, the treatment protocol remains the same:\n\n【42】*   **Bronchodilators:** Drugs that relax the tubules' muscles and dilate the airways, such as short and long-acting beta-agonists and anticholinergics.\n\n【43】*   **Corticosteroids**: Drugs that help to reduce the inflammation of the airways.\n\n【44】*   **Combined Inhalers:** Bronchodilators and corticosteroids combined as one inhaler.\n\n【45】*   **Antibiotics**: Drugs to fight against bacterial infection.\n\n【46】*   **Flu or Pneumonia Vaccine**: To reduce the chances of developing a respiratory illness.\n\n【47】*   **Mucolytics:** Helps in lysis or breaking down the secretions such as Guaiphenesin.\n\n【48】*   **Pulmonary Rehabilitation** includes exercise, disease management, and proper counseling to stay healthy and active.\n\n【49】*   **Lung Transplant:** May be required in severe cases.\n\n【50】What Are the Complications of Panlobular Emphysema?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【51】The complications include\n\n【52】*   Respiratory insufficiency.\n\n【53】*   Respiratory tract infection.\n\n【54】*   Pneumonia.\n\n【55】*   Respiratory failure.\n\n【56】How Is Panlobular Emphysema Different From Centrilobular Emphysema?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【57】Pan lobular emphysema typically affects the secondary pulmonary lobules, particularly the lower lobes, whereas centrilobular emphysema affects the upper lobes. Also, pan-lobular emphysema can occur from various causes, but centrilobular emphysema is most commonly caused by smoking.\n\n【58】**Conclusion:**\n\n【59】Panlobular emphysema is a type of emphysema. In emphysema, the alveoli are destroyed and ruptured with a decreased exchange of gasses during respiration. As a result, emphysema is commonly associated with difficulty breathing, sputum production, and wheezing. The potential causes are alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and aging. Although there is no cure for pan lobular emphysema, only symptomatic relief can be provided to slow down the disease progression and improve the patient's quality of life. Bronchodilators can be helpful for anti-inflammatories such as corticosteroids, antibiotics, and mucolytics. A lung transplant remains the last resort in very severe cases of emphysema.\n\n【60】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【61】无关删除-1:<u>*   Panlobular emphysema  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/panlobular-emphysema\n*   Centrilobular emphysema and panlobular emphysema: two different diseases  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC470076/\n*   Siencedirect - Panlobular emphysema  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0096021716318611</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "b0b5206c-953c-4148-82bb-1e600ad9bcc1", "title": "Lance-Adams Syndrome: Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Lance-Adams Syndrome: Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】Lance-Adams syndrome is a rare neurological condition that is characterized by involuntary jerking movements that occur days or weeks after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a lifesaving approach that involves fast and hard chest compressions on a person whose breathing or heartbeat has stopped due to a heart attack or drowning.\n\n【2】What Is Lance-Adams Syndrome (LAS)?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】Lance-Adams syndrome (LAS) is a rare complication of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is accompanied by sudden, brief, involuntary, and shock-like body jerks. Lance-Adams syndrome is seen in patients who have regained consciousness after medical emergencies like a heart attack or being drowned in water. Usually, the involuntary jerks seen in Lance-Adams syndrome are triggered intentionally or by external stimuli. The involuntary jerking movements are stopped when the patient is asleep or under rest. Lance-Adams syndrome is different from post-hypoxic seizures, which take place when the patient is completely unconscious. Post-hypoxic seizures are seizures (sudden uncontrolled brain disturbances) that result from reduced oxygen supply to the brain.\n\n【4】What Is Posthypoxic Myoclonus (PHM)?\n------------------------------------\n\n【5】Posthypoxic myoclonus is a neurological complication that involves uncontrollable jerks following a hypoxic brain injury (brain injury due to lack of oxygen). Posthypoxic myoclonus is of two types: acute and chronic. Acute posthypoxic myoclonus occurs within twelve hours of hypoxic brain injury and is seen in completely unconscious patients. The chronic post-hypoxic myoclonus occurs days or weeks after hypoxic brain injury and is seen in patients who are conscious. The chronic variant of post-hypoxic myoclonus is also known as Lance-Adams syndrome.\n\n【6】What Are the Causes of Lance-Adams Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The exact cause of Lance-Adams syndrome has not been found. However, researchers suggest that it occurs following a hypoxic brain injury. Hypoxic brain injuries are injuries of the brain which are caused due to restricted oxygen supply to the brain. Reduced oxygen supply to the brain leads to damage and death of the brain cells. The different causes of hypoxic brain injuries are as follows. They are\n\n【8】*   Cardiac arrest (sudden stoppage of heart functioning and breathing accompanied by loss of consciousness).\n\n【9】*   Strangulation or suffocation.\n\n【10】*   Untreated low blood pressure.\n\n【11】*   Untreated cases of severe anemia (a condition which is characterized by the lack of potent red blood cells in the blood to carry the required amount of oxygen to the body tissues).\n\n【12】*   Drug overdose (misusing the prescribed dosage of drugs intentionally or using illicit drugs).\n\n【13】*   Drowning.\n\n【14】*   Electrocution.\n\n【15】*   Smoke inhalation for a prolonged period of time.\n\n【16】*   Carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n【17】*   Lung injury.\n\n【18】*   Severe traumatic head injuries.\n\n【19】*   Injuries caused due to bullets and explosions that may trigger bleeding by damaging the blood vessels.\n\n【20】*   Severe asthmatic attacks.\n\n【21】*   Certain surgical complications or problems that are caused due to anesthesia.\n\n【22】*   Stroke (blockage in the blood supply to the brain or bursting of a blood vessel inside the brain).\n\n【23】What Are the Symptoms of Lance-Adams Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【24】There is no specific group of symptoms to identify Lance-Adams syndrome. However, the common features seen in patients with Lance-Adams syndrome are as follows. They are\n\n【25】*   Repeated sudden shock-like jerking movements of the legs and hands.\n\n【26】*   Difficulty in speaking.\n\n【27】*   Lack of coordination.\n\n【28】*   Loss of balance.\n\n【29】*   Abnormal walking style.\n\n【30】*   Difficulty in performing simple tasks like eating, buttoning the shirt, and writing.\n\n【31】*   Change in levels of consciousness.\n\n【32】*   Behavioral disturbances.\n\n【33】*   Frequent falls.\n\n【34】*   Difficulty in understanding spoken or written language.\n\n【35】*   Poor memory.\n\n【36】*   Difficulty in swallowing.\n\n【37】*   Abnormal eye movements.\n\n【38】*   Inability to pay attention or focus on one particular stuff.\n\n【39】*   A feeling of tightness around joints and muscles which may be painful.\n\n【40】*   Loss of bladder control (sudden urge to urinate).\n\n【41】*   Difficulty in breathing.\n\n【42】How to Diagnose Lance-Adams Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【43】There is no specific test to diagnose Lance-Adams syndrome. However, certain tests help in finding out Lance-Adams syndrome by ruling out the possibilities of other conditions which have similar symptoms. They are as follows:\n\n【44】*   The doctor makes a detailed examination of the jerking movements when the patient is completely conscious, with the postural imbalance and lack of coordination.\n\n【45】*   **Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) Scan:**\n\n【46】A single photon emission tomography scan of the brain helps in obtaining a three-dimensional image showing the blood flow activity inside the brain. This helps to identify the areas inside the brain which are having abnormalities in the blood supply. SPECT scans of patients with Lance-Adams syndrome may show areas with deficient blood flow in the brain.\n\n【47】*   **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):**\n\n【48】Computed tomography of the brain is an imaging technique that uses special X-rays and a computer to obtain images of various views of the brain. A CT scan of the brain helps to find any abnormal growth, bleeding, injuries, and other brain infections. Magnetic resonance imaging is a painless procedure that uses radio waves, a large magnet, and a computer to obtain detailed images of the brain. MRI of the brain gives detailed information about any abnormalities present in the brain and is considered to give more precise results than a CT scan. Normally MRI and CT scan does not show many changes in a person with Lance-Adams syndrome. However, these imaging techniques help to rule out the possibilities of other neurological conditions with similar symptoms.\n\n【49】*   **Electroencephalogram (EEG):**\n\n【50】An electroencephalogram is a test that is used to measure the electrical activity of the brain using metal discs attached to the scalp of the patient. EEG helps to detect the areas of brain abnormalities like seizures, swelling, and injuries. Even though EEG is not much use in the diagnosis of Lance-Adams syndrome, in some cases, it helps to find out the areas of abnormal activity inside the brain.\n\n【51】How Is Lance-Adams Syndrome Treated?\n------------------------------------\n\n【52】There is no established treatment for Lance-Adams syndrome. However, some treatment options are being carried out to make the patient get relief from certain symptoms of the disease. They are as follows:\n\n【53】*   Medications to stabilize the uncontrolled electrical activity of the brain are given to the patient.\n\n【54】*   Medications to control the restlessness of the legs, behavioral disturbances, and to improve learning skills have shown effectiveness in some patients.\n\n【55】*   Physical therapy has shown effective results in a few patients. It is a therapy in which trained professionals help the patients to improve their body movements and overcome their disabilities to lead a better life through certain exercises.\n\n【56】*   In patients who are prone to frequent falls, additional supportive devices like a wheelchair that aid in the movement of patients is to be used.\n\n【57】**Conclusion:**\n\n【58】Early recognition and accurate diagnosis followed by proper management is the key to improving the symptoms experienced by the patient with Lance-Adams syndrome. Even though management of this condition is challenging, initiating medications and rehabilitation programs at the earliest helps the patient to lead a better life.\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【60】无关删除-1:<u>*   Lance-Adams Syndrome  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3309367/#:~:text=Lance%2DAdams%20syndrome%20(LAS),or%20weeks%20after%20the%20event\n*   Lance-Adams syndrome: Difficulties surrounding diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment after cardiac arrest  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4173475/\n*   Post-hypoxic Myoclonus: Current Concepts, Neurophysiology, and Treatment  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039948/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It occurs due to an inflammatory type III hypersensitivity reaction following the infection with certain streptococcal bacterial species strains. This disease specifically results from certain bacterial strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, also known as nephrogenic streptococci. The disease primarily affects the renal glomeruli and kidneys' tiny blood vessels. It is most commonly seen in children one to two weeks after encountering a sore throat or six weeks post skin infection. It is mainly associated with decreased urine production, blood in the urine, high blood pressure, and edema.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is a type of glomerulonephritis. An infection caused by a strain of streptococcus bacteria. The disorder usually develops after infections caused by group A Streptococcus (group A strep) bacterial species. These infections include:\n\n【4】*   Strep throat (streptococcal infection in the throat and tonsils).\n\n【5】*   Scarlet fever (bright red rash covering almost the entire body, with strep throat and high fever).\n\n【6】*   Impetigo (highly contagious streptococcal skin infection of infants and young children).\n\n【7】Therefore, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is not a bacterial infection of the kidneys. Instead, it occurs due to the body’s immune system defending against strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo.\n\n【8】After the appearance of scarlet fever symptoms, usually, ten days are required for the disease to develop. After initiating impetigo symptoms, it takes approximately three weeks for poly streptococcal glomerulonephritis to develop. Other etiologic factors of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis include bacterial infections such as:\n\n【9】*   Endocarditis (inflammation and infection of the heart's inner lining).\n\n【10】*   Enterocolitis (infection of both intestines).\n\n【11】*   Pneumonia.\n\n【12】*   Intraventricular shunt infections.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Post-streptococcal Arthritis - Clinical Features and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Pseudomonal Septicemia Skin Lesions - Features, Diagnosis, Treatment and Complications</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Erysipelas - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Viral (hepatitis B and C infections, human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus).\n\n【14】*   Fungal infections (coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis).\n\n【15】*   Parasitic infections (malaria, leishmania, and toxoplasmosis).\n    </u>\n\n【16】**Risk Factors:**\n\n【17】*   **Poor Personal Hygiene -** If the person is not practicing good personal hygiene, he may be a source of bacterial infection.\n\n【18】*   **Overcrowded Places -** Overcrowded places are prone to more infections due to a lack of hygiene and improperly cleaned places.\n\n【19】*   **Low Socioeconomic Status (Poor People) -** People below the poverty line cannot keep good hygiene practices and, therefore, can catch infections easily.\n\n【20】These factors are important predisposing factors for streptococcal infection outbreaks. This explains a higher incidence of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in developing countries.\n\n【21】*   Genetic factors play a role since about 40 % of patients with the disease report a positive family history. However, there is no specific gene found to cause post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.\n\n【22】What Is the Epidemiology of Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The disease may develop in people of any age, but it most frequently affects children between six to ten years of age. Skin and throat infections are relatively common in children. But, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is a rare complication of these infections. This disease causes the small blood vessels to be inflamed in the filtering units of the kidneys (glomeruli). Hence, the kidneys filter less urine.\n\n【24】The condition is not commonly seen today in developed countries like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Central Europe because antibiotic prophylaxis and personal hygiene have improved patient conditions.\n\n【25】Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritisis the most frequent cause of kidney injury in young children, especially in the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and worldwide. The clinical symptoms of the disease are more frequently seen in males than females. Racial factors are not found to play any role in the occurrence of the disease.\n\n【26】What Are the Symptoms of Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Clinical symptoms may include any of the following:\n\n【28】*   Reduced urine output.\n\n【29】*   Rust-colored or dark reddish-brown urine.\n\n【30】*   Swelling (generalized edema), abdominal swelling, swollen face or eyes, swollen feet, ankles, and hands.\n\n【31】*   Hematuria (visible blood in the urine).\n\n【32】*   Joint pain (arthralgia).\n\n【33】*   Stiffness or swelling of the joints.\n\n【34】*   Decreased tendency to pee.\n\n【35】*   Exhaustion and fatigue.\n\n【36】*   Anemia.\n\n【37】*   Hypertension (high blood pressure).\n\n【38】*   Weight loss.\n\n【39】*   Malaise.\n\n【40】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【41】*   Anorexia.\n\n【42】Some of the children are mildly symptomatic or completely asymptomatic. Hematuria, edema, and high blood pressure are the classic triad of glomerulonephritis. Most patients have a history of recently encountered streptococcal infections like pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or impetigo.\n\n【43】What Are the Diagnostic Tests for Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】*   **Medical History -** The family and medical history of the affected patient should be thoroughly investigated carefully.\n\n【45】*   **Physical Examination -** A complete physical examination shows facial swelling (edema), especially around the eyes. Abnormal sounds may be produced in the heart and lungs that can be heard with a stethoscope. High blood pressure is usually observed.\n\n【46】*   **Anti-DNase B Test -** A blood test is done to check for antibodies to a proteinaceous substance produced by group A streptococcus bacteria.\n\n【47】*   **Serum ASO (and Streptolysin O) Titer Test -** This blood test checks for a strep infection.\n\n【48】*   **Serum Complement Levels -** High serum complement levels suggest the level of inflammation in the body.\n\n【49】*   **Urinalysis -** The physical, biochemical, and microscopic urine examination is usually carried out.\n\n【50】*   **Throat Cultures -** An important investigation for the affected patient and family members.\n\n【51】What Is the Treatment of Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】There is no specific therapeutic cure for this disorder. It is a self-limiting disease. Treatment is mainly aimed at relieving the symptoms.\n\n【53】*   Decreasing edematous swelling by reducing salt and water intake.\n\n【54】*   Bed rest and immobilization are usually preferred in the initial days of the condition.\n\n【55】*   Diuretics (medication that increases urine flow) are usually prescribed.\n\n【56】*   Managing hypertension through blood pressure drugs.\n\n【57】*   Antibiotics are prescribed to destroy any persistent streptococcal bacteria in the body.\n\n【58】*   Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs are not found to be effective.\n\n【59】What Is the Prognosis of Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【60】Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is a self-limiting condition that usually goes away by itself after a few weeks to several months. It has an excellent prognosis in children. However, it may worsen and lead to long-term (chronic) kidney failure in a few adult patients. Rarely can it progress to end-stage renal disease, which requires dialysis and kidney transplantation.\n\n【61】**Conclusion**\n\n【62】Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is a kidney disease with a good prognosis, especially in children. But in a few cases, the disease can progress to end-stage kidney disease or nephrotic syndrome. A team of a specialized team of doctors should be consulted for the treatment of this disease and extend good patient care.

Most of these happen due to a **poor management of the problem** and also due to a general lack of awareness among the public about the repercussions of these problems. An amputation of a limb is a life-altering disability. Often, this procedure is undergone by the sole earning member of the family, and this causes a financial crisis within the household.\n\n【1】**Ten Points for the Prevention of Diabetic Foot Problems:**\n\n【2】1.  I am your foot and want to be with you always. Please take good care of me.\n2.  Inspect me **twice a day** to look for abnormal findings.\n3.  If you find callosities or ulcerations, please consult a podiatric surgeon to prevent complications.\n4.  Please check me for early signs of infections and **take immediate action**.\n5.  If you find anything abnormal, the first and most important thing you should do is ‘offload’ me, that is, you will not bear any weight on me.\n6.  If the blood circulation to the foot is low, please take the doctor’s advice to revascularize me, if required.\n7.  Please consult your podiatric surgeon to discuss the best type of **diabetic footwear** for me.\n8.  Please share these tips for foot care in diabetics with all your friends who have this condition, so that, they will take good care of their feet too.\n9.  For my sake, please keep your blood sugar levels in excellent control with the expert advice of a diabetologist.\n10.  Please do not allow me to be amputated, unless the infection in me threatens to take your life.\n\n【3】**Why Should Amputations Be Avoided in a Diabetic Patient?**\n\n【4】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【5】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-3:<u>Is there any possibility of full recovery after detachment of severed right hand thumb?</u>\n\n【7】My grandfather is suffering from the side effects of his medicines. Please help.\n\n【8】What can we do for faster recovery of diabetic foot ulcer?\n\n【9】In diabetes, the blood vessels are the major target organs. So, all the organs in the body subsequently get involved. By the time the lower limb has a **peripheral obstructive vascular disease**, nearly all the organs are already affected by ischemia. The blood vessels of the heart are also greatly damaged. Many studies have shown that in a diabetic patient, walking, even with the best of a prosthesis, strains the heart by over 15%. Many studies have proven that in a diabetic patient who walks routinely with a below-knee prosthesis, there is a 50 % **mortality rate** in five years due to cardiac failure, and with an above-knee prosthesis, there is a 50 % mortality rate in three years due to cardiac failure. Thus, the primary reason we try to prevent major amputations in diabetic patients is not to improve the quality of life but to **increase their longevity**.\n\n【10】In a diabetic patient, one of the significant tissue changes is due to ‘nonenzymatic glycation' which affects all the soft tissues in the patient’s body. This, in turn, immensely lowers the **cell-mediated immunity**. In such a case, if a lower limb infection occurs, and it is improperly managed, the disease can spread like 'wildfire,' and can cause a loss of limb or even life.\n\n【11】The surgical treatment of lower limb infections in people with diabetes is managed with proper debridement. Once the infected areas are **thoroughly debrided**, the tissue is sent for bacterial and fungal culture and sensitivity. The patient is then administered culture-specific antibiotics and if required, anti-fungal medication. An appropriate wound dressing, strict offloading of the involved limb, and supportive therapy are necessary.\n\n【12】**Reconstructive and Corrective Foot and Ankle Surgeries:**\n\n【13】Another serious foot and ankle problem which can happen in an uninformed diabetic is osteoarthropathy of the foot and ankle bones. This is also called the ‘**Charcot foot**.' In this condition, the foot bones become soft, and lose their density, due to the autonomic neuropathy occurring in diabetes. As an analogy, if we were to place a wooden board dipped in water for over six weeks, imagine how it would be. Soft, sodden, spongy, and friable. Is that right? So also in Charcot foot syndrome. When a patient walks with these **soft feet bones**, they develop fractures, erosion, and severe destruction. When detected early, they can be managed conservatively. Whereas in untreated cases, the foot and ankle bones become severely destroyed, and usually the patient is subjected to a below-knee amputation. In specialized centers though, the foot can be salvaged by doing a '**reconstructive foot and ankle surgery**' with excellent results.\n\n【14】The diabetic foot and lower limb diseases that we commonly come across include extensive lower limb necrotizing fasciitis, diabetic foot infections including **gangrene** with peripheral vascular disease, and Charcot’s foot, some with a marked destruction of the foot and ankle bones and grossly deformed toes and feet. These deformed feet and toes can develop high-pressure points, and callosities and ulcers, which in these immunocompromised patients are **portals for bacterial entry** leading, as said earlier, to limb and life-threatening infections. Hence these foot abnormalities must be surgically corrected. In many cases, a suitable molded footwear and proper foot care can avoid serious complications and prevent surgery.\n\n【15】删除2:<u>For more information consult a **diabetic foot ulcer specialist online** --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/diabetologist/diabetic-foot%20-ulcer</u>\n\n【16】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【17】* * *\n\n【18】#### **1.**删除换行**Why Is Foot Care Important for Diabetics?**\n\n【19】Foot care is important to diabetic people because it is the region where most of the lesions or wounds begin in these patients. Also, the wound healing capacity of people with diabetes is very low. If they are prone to wounds or infections, they have more possibilities of suffering from severe complications.\n\n【20】#### **2.**删除换行**How Should Diabetic People Care for Their Feet?**\n\n【21】Diabetic people should follow the below tips to care for their feet:  \n\\- Inspect the feet every day.  \n\\- Bathe your feet in lukewarm water.  \n\\- Be gentle while cleaning your feet.  \n\\- Moisturize your feet regularly.  \n\\- Cut your nails carefully.  \n\\- Never treat the corn in the feet yourself.  \n\\- Always wear clean and dry socks, especially in winter.  \n\\- Try wearing socks that are made for patients with diabetes.\n\n【22】#### **3.**删除换行**How Can Diabetics Check Their Feet?**\n\n【23】Diabetics need to take special care of their feet. They need to visit the doctor to ensure that their feet are in a healthy state. A proper blood flow should be regulated to the legs. Avoid sitting with your legs down for a long period of time. Wash your feet regularly.\n\n【24】#### **4.**删除换行**Is Diabetic Foot Curable?**\n\n【25】Diabetic feet are hard to cure completely. The best way is to prevent the first occurrence of diabetic foot. If the feet are prone to infections, then it becomes very hard to manage. In most cases, patients with diabetic feet undergo amputation surgery in the first five years.\n\n【26】#### **5.**删除换行**What Is the Recommended Lotion for Diabetic Feet?**\n\n【27】Foot creams that are given for diabetes will depend on the health condition of the patient. The cream that is suitable for one patient might not be favorable for the other. So, it is better to get recommendations from diabetologists and dermatologists before using foot creams. You can get help from icliniq.com.\n\n【28】#### **6.**删除换行**Why Should Diabetics Cut Their Toenails?**\n\n【29】The condition of diabetes and toenails are related to each other. If a diabetic patient trims the nail too much, it might lead to ingrown nails. If the nails are not cut, then it might lead to the accumulation of dirt. Both these cases are harmful to diabetic people. It is necessary for them to keep the toenails clean.\n\n【30】#### **7.**删除换行**Why Are Soaking Feet Bad for Diabetics?**\n\n【31】It is bad for diabetic people to soak their feet because it will tend to increase the risk of infection if the skin tends to break down. The temperature of the water should be carefully noted if the patient is having damage to the nerves. If the water is too hot, then there are chances of burning your skin.\n\n【32】#### **8.**删除换行**What Happens to Your Feet When You Are Diabetic?**\n\n【33】A prolonged condition of diabetes might cause diabetic neuropathy. It is a condition in which the patient suffers severe damage to the nerves. It might also cause pain and tingling sensation in the feet. It might also lead to sores or cuts in the feet. You can ask your doctor to provide tips for maintaining a healthy foot.\n\n【34】#### **9.**删除换行**Can Diabetic People Use Vaseline on Their Feet?**\n\n【35】Diabetes people can use Vaseline or lotions on their feet. They should make sure that the Vaseline or lotions do not stay in between the toes. This might cause severe dryness and fungal infections.\n\n【36】#### **10.**删除换行**What Are the Signs of Diabetic Feet?**\n\n【37】The different signs of diabetic feet are:  \n\\- Changes in temperature of the skin.  \n\\- Changes in the color of skin.  \n\\- Pain in the legs.  \n\\- Swelling in the ankle or foot.  \n\\- Infection of toenails with fungus.  \n\\- Open sores that show slow healing.  \n\\- Corns.  \n\\- Dry cracks in the skin, especially around the heel.  \n\\- Calluses.\n\n【38】#### **11.**删除换行**How Can Diabetics Improve Circulation in Feet?**\n\n【39】In order to improve the circulation in the feet, the patient has to follow a few tips.

The mental, physical and emotional system varies from person to person depending upon the type of eating disorder. People who suffer from eating disorders tend to develop an unhealthy relationship with food, weight, or appearance. These types of disorders can be easily treated but, if left untreated, can be life-threatening. Eating disorders are caused by factors such as brain biology, genetics, mental health problems, and social and cultural ideals. Eating disorders can be associated with psychological complications and serious medical issues. Individual or group therapy can be effective in treating eating disorders.\n\n【2】What Is Eating Disorder?\n------------------------\n\n【3】An eating disorder is characterized by abnormal eating behavior that negatively affects a person's mental and physical health. The most common eating disorders are bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. Eating disorders can harm the digestive system, heart, bones, mouth, and teeth of the person. They are often seen in young adults and teenagers.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Eating Disorders?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【5】The types of various eating disorders and their symptoms are:\n\n【6】*   **Anorexia Nervosa:** It is also called anorexia and is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder. It is characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight, abnormally low body weight, and a distorted perception of shape or weight. People who suffer from anorexia have to put a lot of effort into losing weight. It involves symptoms such as restricted eating, intense fear of gaining weight, mild anemia, brittle nails, slower pulse rate, low blood pressure, brain damage, yellowish skin, severe constipation, multiple organ failure, infertility, lethargy, and distorted body shape.\n\n【7】*   **Bulimia Nervosa:** It is also known as bulimia is a serious and potentially life-threatening eating disorder. It includes a lack of control over eating habits. In the case of bulimia, the person tends to eat a large quantity of food in a short period of time. The person is usually preoccupied with body shape and weight and judging oneself with self-perceived flaws. The symptoms include acid reflux disorder, sore throat, intestinal reflux, dehydration, and gastrointestinal problems.\n\n【8】*   **Binge Eating Disorder:** Thisinvolves eating too much regularly and feeling of lack of control over eating. The person may feel disgusted, ashamed, or guilty after binge eating. The person tends to eat even if he does not feel hungry. The person might eat alone to hide his binge habit due to embarrassment. The symptoms involve eating a large amount of food, eating even if the person is not hungry, and feeling guilty, distressed, or ashamed about eating and eating fast food.\n\n【9】*   **Avoidant/ Restrictive Food Intake Disorder:** Itis associated with failing to meet minimum daily nutrition requirements. The person may avoid eating food with color, smell, taste, or texture that the person does not like to eat or think it may lead to choking. The disorder can cause failure in gaining weight, nutritional deficiency, or weight loss. Symptoms include lack of appetite or interest in food, upset stomach, abdominal pain, drastic weight loss, and gastrointestinal problems.\n\n【10】What Are the Causes of Eating Disorders?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【11】There is no exact cause of an eating disorder. The other factors involved are:\n\n【12】*   **Genetic and Biology:** People may consist of genes that increase the risk of developing an eating disorder.

{"seq_id": "69754815-4a36-478b-8b1e-6b18347475b1", "title": "Caustic Substances Injuries and Poisoning - An Overview", "text": "【0】Caustic Substances Injuries and Poisoning - An Overview\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Caustic ingestions can readily harm people of all ages and are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Children account for 80 percent of all cases of caustic ingestion in the US (United States). For the best results, surgical and medicinal treatments must be coordinated for caustic ingestions, which call for urgent care. Clinicians need to be aware of potential problems and accessible resources. Most ingestions (especially those involving children) are not poisonous and can be treated at home, but successful outcomes depend on prompt triage, thorough evaluation, and the initiation of treatment at the appropriate time.\n\n【2】What Is the Etiology of Caustic Substance Injuries or Poisoning?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Caustic ingestion can be caused by intentional or unintentional consumption, such as suicidal behavior in adults. Accidental ingestion is more common in youngsters. Children frequently consume everyday home products like ammonia or bleach. Most caustic exposures (76 percent) involve oral intake, and almost all (93 percent of cases) occur at home. The majority of these ingestions (more than 80 percent) were not deliberate. Typically, either an acid or an alkali is consumed. These groups differ from one another in terms of pathophysiology and method of care.\n\n【4】What Is the Pathophysiology of Caustic Substance Injury or Poisoning?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The pathophysiology varies depending on whether an acid or an alkali is present. Alkalis are chemicals with a pH (potential of hydrogen) above 7.0, and liquefaction necrosis (a pattern of cell death) usually occurs above 11.5 as a threshold for causing direct tissue damage. In contrast to coagulation necrosis, which is a form of cell death brought on by a reduction in blood flow, liquefaction necrosis involves rapid tissue dissolution. Digestive enzymes are released once the cells are lysed and start to break down the stromal architecture. Alkalis speed up the mucosa's early breakdown, allowing for more serious injury and penetration. The length of contact and alkali strength, as with all exposures, dictate the severity of the wound. However, if left in contact with tissue for a long enough period of time, even low amounts of alkali chemicals can seriously harm it.\n\n【6】If the pH is less than 2, coagulation necrosis is a more likely mechanism by which acids will harm the body. When tissue is hypoxic (reduced oxygen supply), or ischemic (restricted blood flow), coagulative necrosis is the default mode of necrosis for the majority of the body. The undamaged tissue stroma is thought to operate as a protective barrier against additional injury, which is why damage is thought to be less severe in acidic ingestions. The moderate alkali surface of the esophageal mucosa may aid in neutralizing acidic chemicals, further reducing the risk of harm.\n\n【7】What Are the Symptoms of Caustic Substance Poisoning?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The possible symptoms of caustic substance injury or poisoning are:\n\n【9】**Immediate Symptoms:**\n\n【10】*   The pain in the mouth and throat can become intense, especially when swallowing, and it usually starts within minutes.\n\n【11】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Zinc Toxicity: Causes, Signs, Diagnosis & Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Gurvits Syndrome - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Boric Acid Toxicity - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Drooling.\n\n【13】*   Difficulty swallowing.\n\n【14】*   Vomiting.\n\n【15】*   Vomiting blood.\n\n【16】*   A person may experience very low blood pressure (shock), trouble breathing, or chest pain in severe situations involving potent caustics, which could result in death.\n    </u>\n\n【17】**Late Symptoms:**\n\n【18】*   In the hours following consumption, the first week afterward, or at any other moment in between, perforation of the esophagus or stomach can happen, frequently following vomiting or violent coughing.\n\n【19】*   The mediastinum, which is the space between the lungs, or the pleural cavity, which is the space around the lungs, may both be perforated by the esophagus. Either scenario results in extreme chest pain, a fever, a rapid heartbeat, a quick breathing pattern, very low blood pressure, and the requirement for surgery.\n\n【20】*   When the stomach perforates due to peritonitis, acute abdominal pain develops.\n\n【21】*   Scarring of the esophagus causes constriction (stricture), and it may also impair the swallowing muscles, both of which make it difficult to swallow. Strictures frequently appear weeks after a burn, occasionally in burns that at first only displayed minor symptoms.\n\n【22】*   Years after suffering an injury, people with esophageal scars or damage may develop esophageal cancer.\n\n【23】How Is Caustic Substance Injury or Poisoning Assessed?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】In order to choose the best course of action, the history of a patient with suspected caustic ingestion must take into account five fundamental factors. The \"5 W's\" are an effective mnemonic that has been compiled from several writings on this subject. This part includes a quick evaluation of important history.\n\n【25】*   **Who:** In this section, patient demographics are important. Find out the patient's age and weight, as well as whether any friends, family, or witnesses are with them.\n\n【26】*   **What:** The properties of drugs and toxins consumed.\n\n【27】*   **When:** The time and date when the food was consumed.\n\n【28】*   **Where:** The method of poisoning as well as the area where it occurred, might be used to identify any environmental elements that might be confusing.\n\n【29】*   **Why:** Once the patient has stabilized, the clinician must determine intentionality since it may have a significant impact on discharge plans.\n\n【30】Patients who have consumed caustic substances may exhibit vomiting, drooling, and oral and tongue edema. Some individuals may exhibit vocal alterations, stridor (a high-pitched whistling sound during breathing due to abnormal airflow in the lungs), and respiratory discomfort in addition to upper airway edema. If a vessel has been eroded, hematemesis (vomiting blood) might be present. Mediastinitis (inflammation and swelling of the mediastinum, the space in the chest between the lungs) or peritonitis (inflammation of the membrane peritoneum that lines the stomach and protects the internal organs) can happen if the esophagus or stomach is ruptured, respectively. The physical examination comprises the typical main and secondary assessments found in emergency rooms.\n\n【31】How Is Caustic Substance Injury or Poisoning Evaluated?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Airway, breathing, and circulation are the main focuses of the evaluation. The appropriateness of ventilation, mental status function, and cardiac functioning must all be given particular consideration during the comprehensive assessment. Patients that are unstable should be continuously telemetry monitored and have their vital signs checked every fifteen minutes until they are stable.\n\n【33】A complete blood count, a metabolic profile that includes electrolytes, and an arterial or venous blood gas are some of the lab tests that can be acquired. Simple radiographs of the chest and abdomen can reveal pneumomediastinum (the area in the chest between the two lungs - mediastinum - is filled with air) or free air.\n\n【34】After the initial resuscitation has been completed in cases of caustic ingestion, it is important to assess the degree of the injury because this will inform the subsequent care procedures. Endoscopy has long been used as a way to assess gastrointestinal damage. For the examination of lesions, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) has been suggested as an alternative to endoscopy.\n\n【35】How Is Caustic Substance Injury or Poisoning Treated?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】In patients exhibiting impending respiratory failures symptoms, such as drooling and voice abnormalities, the airway should be protected. According to one study, 50 percent of people who consumed caustic had to be intubated. Access to intravenous fluids must be obtained. Management will be determined by the substance that was consumed. The current guideline for caustic injury is to dilute with water. However, this has minimal efficacy because the damage is usually detected within the first few minutes following the accident. It is not advisable to utilize activated charcoal or induce emesis in these patients.\n\n【37】Patients who have suspected peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, or mediastinitis will need emergent surgery to determine the extent of the damage. If there is little indication of these, CECT of the neck, chest, and abdomen may be done to ascertain the severity of the injury.\n\n【38】1.  **Grade I:** Organs that appear normal.\n\n【39】2.  **Grade II:** Soft tissue inflammation and increased mucosa from edema.\n\n【40】3.  **Grade III:** Post-contrast wall enhancement is not present.\n\n【41】*   Grade I typically denotes early discharge and no endoscopy.\n\n【42】*   If CECT is non-diagnostic, Grade II often denotes non-operative therapy and endoscopy.\n\n【43】*   Although it is debatable, certain Grade II burns may benefit from intravenous corticosteroids. Grade III denotes an urgent surgical procedure.\n\n【44】The conventional procedure in emergency surgery is a laparotomy, which aims to remove all necrotic tissue. The extent of the wounded surfaces determines what is removed, with options ranging from minor surgeries like a pancreaticoduodenectomy to resection of particular areas.\n\n【45】What Is the Prognosis of Caustic Substance Injury or Poisoning?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】The severity of the initial damage determines the prognosis the most, with mild-moderate ingestions having the best prognosis and severe ingestions necessitating emergency surgery having the most difficulties. Grade III or higher injuries require prompt emergency surgery as well as post-operative care. If surgery is necessary, patients typically recover worse since the risk of complications, including mediastinitis and perforation, is considerable.\n\n【47】The quality of life following radical excision or esophageal reconstruction should be a very important topic that the surgical team discusses with the patient. According to one study, quality of life ratings significantly declined when compared to populations at large. Although it should not determine whether surgery is done or not, it is crucial to talk to the patient and prepare them for potential issues.\n\n【48】**Conclusion**\n\n【49】In conclusion, poisoning from caustic compounds is a serious public health issue.

The lesions often develop on the extremities but may spread to the chest and hands. Tiny nodules and blister-like lesions are often the first sign that appears after a skin injury. The tiny nodules crust over and join together, creating round to oval coin-shaped spots. In darker skin tone people, these spots are brown colored, while in lighter skinned people, the spots are pink or red colored. These raised, scaly spots usually last for weeks or months. The spots can be extremely itchy. This itch worsens while relaxing or trying to sleep. Some people experience burning or stinging sensations. The skin between the spots becomes extremely dry. Scratching the itchy spots can break open the skin and may develop an infection. An infected site appears as yellow or golden crusts, streaks of red or brown, swelling, pus discharge, and pain. As the spots begin to clear, they flatten out. The center of the spot clears first with skin discoloration. Sometimes, new spots may begin as older ones clear. Large, raised patches are seen if flare-ups progress instead of the classical coin-shaped spots.\n\n【28】How Is Nummular Eczema Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【29】Nummular eczema is diagnosed by,\n\n【30】*   Complete medical history.\n\n【31】*   Complete clinical examination of the skin. A superficial skin scraping may also be taken for investigation.\n\n【32】*   An allergy test is suggested when an external allergic reaction is noted.\n\n【33】How Is Nummular Eczema Treated?\n-------------------------------\n\n【34】Medications and lifestyle changes can help to treat nummular eczema.\n\n【35】**1) Medications:**\n\n【36】Corticosteroids, Tacrolimus ointments, Pimecrolimus cream, or tar cream may be prescribed. Sometimes oral and intralesional steroid therapy may be prescribed depending on the lesion severity. You may also need to see a doctor to rule out other skin disorders that can look like nummular dermatitis. Cover the affected area with moist bandages and protect it while it heals. Consuming antihistamines can relieve itch and discomfort. Antibiotics like Erythromycin, Flucloxacillin are often prescribed in case of infection. Ultraviolet light treatment is given in case of severe itching. Daily hydrate skin, especially on the legs with moisturizer after showering. Sometimes, Methotrexate, Azathioprine, or Cyclosporine are also prescribed.\n\n【37】**2) Lifestyle Changes:**\n\n【38】There is no cure for nummular eczema. However, lifestyle changes and avoiding triggers can help manage the trigger.\n\n【39】For this, try to avoid the following:\n\n【40】*   Any irritants like wool, household cleaners, and chemicals may trigger your symptoms.\n\n【41】*   Too much bathing with hot water and harsh soap.\n\n【42】*   Stress.\n\n【43】*   Use fragrance-free fabric softener and dryer sheets.\n\n【44】*   Activities that scrape, cut, and abrade the skin surface.\n\n【45】**3) Nummular Eczema Diet:**\n\n【46】At present, there is no specific diet for nummular eczema. But it is better to eat a nutrient-rich, balanced diet and maintain moderate body weight.\n\n【47】**Foods to Eat:**\n\n【48】Some healthy foods that possess anti-inflammatory properties are:\n\n【49】*   Fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids or fish oil supplements.\n\n【50】*   Plant-based omega-3 sources - flaxseeds, walnuts, and green leafy vegetables.\n\n【51】*   Healthy monounsaturated fats - olive oil and canola oil.\n\n【52】*   Antioxidants and healthy carbohydrates - fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n\n【53】*   Anti-inflammatory - turmeric and ginger spices.\n\n【54】**Foods to Avoid:**\n\n【55】*   Trans fats or hydrogenated oils - margarine and fried foods.\n\n【56】*   Unhealthy saturated fat - butter, full-fat dairy, the skin of poultry, red meats.\n\n【57】*   Omega-6 fatty acids - corn or cottonseed vegetable oils.\n\n【58】*   High sugar and refined carbohydrates foods - highly processed foods.\n\n【59】How to Prevent Nummular Eczema?\n-------------------------------\n\n【60】Self-care helps to get better treatment results and have fewer new flare-ups. These self-care tips include:\n\n【61】*   Take lukewarm water baths and showers for not more than 20 minutes.\n\n【62】*   Apply a fragrance-free moisturizing cream or ointment after each shower.\n\n【63】*   Use mild, odorless, and less allergic skin care products for dry skin.\n\n【64】*   Keep a humidifier when indoor air is dry.\n\n【65】*   Protect the skin from any injury or harsh chemicals.\n\n【66】*   Avoid scraping, cuts, and other injuries, and protect the skin with gloves during household chores.\n\n【67】*   To prevent any extra irritation, wear cotton gloves under waterproof gloves.\n\n【68】*   Reduce stress through meditation, yoga, and biofeedback therapy.\n\n【69】*   Avoid overheating, as sweating can irritate sensitive skin, leading to a flare-up.\n\n【70】*   Avoid sitting next to a fireplace, campfire, or anything that can increase body heat and dry the skin.\n\n【71】*   Wear loose-fit clothes that are made of soft and breathable fabric.\n\n【72】*   Rough-feeling fabric like wool, rayon, nylon, polyester, acetate, latex, and spandex and tight clothing can irritate the skin and trigger flare-ups.\n\n【73】*   Drink alcohol in moderation or quit.\n\n【74】*   Heavy drinking can trigger new flare-ups.\n\n【75】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Nummular Eczema?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【76】*   Tinea corporis.\n\n【77】*   Plaque psoriasis.\n\n【78】*   Pityriasis rosea.\n\n【79】What Is the Prognosis of Nummular Eczema?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【80】The prognosis is usually good. With appropriate treatment, nummular eczema improves within one year. However, this is a chronic condition, with some lesions completely fading off and some resolving over time. Lesions on the legs and feet often heal late and may leave some spots.\n\n【81】**Conclusion:**\n\n【82】Nummular eczema is a chronic skin inflammatory condition that produces blisters, breaks open, and oozes out. It is a non-contagious skin condition. Although the symptoms of nummular eczema are troublesome, they can be treated completely with early diagnosis, proper medications, and some healthy lifestyle changes.\n\n【83】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【84】* * *\n\n【85】#### **1.**删除换行**What Triggers Nummular Eczema?**\n\n【86】The common triggering factors include:  \n\\- Heat and humidity.  \n\\- A skin injury and infection, as in a bug bite or scrape.  \n\\- Alcohol.\n\n【87】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is the Prognosis of Nummular Eczema?**\n\n【88】The prognosis is usually good.

The bottom of the foot contains a thick band of tissue known as the plantar fascia. It extends from the heel bone to the toe. The condition usually occurs due to overuse or strain of the plantar fascia. Symptoms of plantar fasciitis include pain and tenderness in the heel or arch, especially when taking the first few steps in the morning or after sitting for extended periods. The plantar fascia helps support the foot arch and provides shock absorption during walking, running, and jumping.\n\n【2】What Is Endoscopic Plantar Fasciotomy?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【3】Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy is a minimally invasive surgical option. A tiny camera, called an endoscope, is used to visualize the plantar fascia and release it through small incisions in the foot. This procedure can be less painful and result in faster recovery than an open incision. Conservative treatment, like orthotic devices or heel pads, painkillers, corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy, may relieve 80 percent of cases. Individuals not responding to conservative methods will go for surgical options like endoscopic plantar fasciotomy.\n\n【4】Who Is Eligible for Endoscopic Plantar Fasciotomy?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy is typically recommended for patients with chronic plantar fasciitis that has not responded to non-surgical treatments such as physical therapy, orthotics, or anti-inflammatory medication. The procedure is also used for some cases, which include the following.\n\n【6】*   Individuals with severe heel pain that interferes with daily activities.\n\n【7】*   Those who cannot continue physical activities due to the pain.\n\n【8】*   Individuals who have these symptoms for six months or more.\n\n【9】Certain factors cause some risks, complications, or delay the recovery period, which include:\n\n【10】*   **Diabetes** is caused by the body's inability to produce or effectively use insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Type 1 and type 2 are the two primary categories of diabetes.\n\n【11】*   **Venous Insufficiency**: It is caused by the body's inability to produce or effectively use insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels.\n\n【12】*   **Peripheral Neuropathy** is nerve damage affecting the peripheral nervous system, responsible for transmitting sensory information between the body and the brain.\n\n【13】How to Perform Endoscopic Plantar Fasciotomy?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The endoscopic plantar fasciotomy procedure is usually outpatient and takes about an hour to complete. The patient is placed under local or regional anesthesia, and a small incision is made on the side of the heel. A cannula (a slotted tube) is placed through the incision against the plantar fascia. The entire procedure is done with the help of a cannula. The endoscope (a medical device with a flexible tube equipped with a camera and light source) is inserted through the incision. The surgeon uses it to visualize the damaged portion of the plantar fascia. A small scalpel or laser removes the damaged tissue, and the endoscope is removed. Once the incision has been sutured, dressing and a splint are applied to the foot.\n\n【15】What Are the Different Types of Plantar Fasciitis Surgery?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Surgical options for plantar fasciitis relieve pressure and tension on the plantar fascia, reduce pain and inflammation, and correct any underlying foot structure problems.\n\n【17】*   **Plantar Fascia Release Surgery:** This procedure involves cutting part of the plantar fascia (the thick band of tissue that extends from the heel to the toes) to relieve tension and reduce pain. The goal is to alleviate pressure on the fascia and reduce inflammation, causing pain. This procedure can be done through an open incision or minimally invasively using endoscopic techniques.\n\n【18】*   **Stabilization Surgery:** This procedure involves repairing the ligaments and other structures that support the foot's arch to provide stability and reduce stress on the plantar fascia. The goal is to correct foot structure problems that may contribute to the development of plantar fasciitis.\n\n【19】*   **Calcaneal Osteotomy:** This procedure involves cutting the calcaneus (the heel bone) to realign the foot and reduce stress on the plantar fascia. This is typically done in cases where the heel bone has shifted out of its normal position, causing excessive pressure on the plantar fascia.\n\n【20】What Are the Benefits of Endoscopic Plantar Fasciotomy?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy has several advantages over traditional open surgery, including:\n\n【22】*   **Minimal Incision**: The endoscopic procedure minimizes the risk of scarring and infection by making a small incision.\n\n【23】*   **Quick Recovery Period**: Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy allows faster recovery than traditional surgery, enabling patients to return to normal activities sooner.\n\n【24】*   **Less Pain:** Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy causes less pain and discomfort than open surgery.\n\n【25】*   **Improves Accuracy:** The endoscope provides the surgeon with a clear view of the damaged tissue, enabling them to remove only the affected area and preserve healthy tissue.\n\n【26】*   **Better Cosmetic Results**: The small incision and minimally invasive nature of endoscopic plantar fasciotomy result in a more aesthetically pleasing outcome than open surgery.\n\n【27】How Long Is the Recovery Time for Endoscopic Plantar Fasciotomy?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】The recovery process after endoscopic plantar fasciotomy is relatively quick and painless compared to traditional open surgery. Most patients can return to normal activities within a few weeks. However, complete recovery typically takes about three to six months. During the recovery period, healthcare professionals will suggest post-operative instructions, which include wearing a splint or brace, using crutches or a walker, and avoiding weight-bearing activities for a specified period. In addition, physical therapy and other rehabilitation exercises are recommended to promote healing and improve the flexibility and strength of the foot and ankle.\n\n【29】**Conclusion**:\n\n【30】Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy is an effective and minimally invasive surgical procedure for treating plantar fasciitis. This procedure offers several advantages over traditional surgical methods, including minimal incision, quicker recovery, less pain, improved accuracy, and better cosmetic results. The choice of procedure depends on the individual patient's condition and needs. However, not all patients with plantar fasciitis may require surgery, as conservative treatments have to be tried first. Surgical intervention is the best choice if conservative treatments cannot manage the condition.\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>*   Endoscopic Plantar Fasciotomy: A Minimally Traumatic Procedure for Chronic Plantar Fasciitis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3117526/\n*   Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy in the treatment of chronic heel pain  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2552945/\n*   Percutaneous release of the plantar fascia.

While various variables can lead to the development of arthritis, food can significantly impact how the condition is managed. Some foods make arthritis symptoms worse by increasing bodily inflammation.\n\n【2】What Are the Different Types of Arthritis?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Chronic joint inflammation is a common health issue called arthritis. It is classified depending on the kind; it hurts joints, breaks bones, and damages other bodily components.\n\n【4】*   **Osteoarthritis:** The most prevalent variety, osteoarthritis, is non-inflammatory, and there are more than 100 different varieties. In actuality, osteoarthritis may be detected in up to 40 percent of men and 47 percent of women during their lifetimes.\n\n【5】*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):** In rheumatoid arthritis, the tissue lining the joints on both sides of the body is attacked by the body's own immune system. It could also have an impact on other bodily components.\n\n【6】*   **Psoriatic Arthritis:** It is a form of arthritis that some sufferers with psoriasis experience. It is a type of Inflammatory arthritis.\n\n【7】*   **Gout:** A kind of arthritis defined by excruciating pain, redness, and joint soreness. When too much uric acid crystallizes and accumulates in the joints, pain, and inflammation result. Another prevalent form of inflammatory arthritis is gout.\n\n【8】Can Diet Relieve Arthritic Pain?\n--------------------------------\n\n【9】A person's diet can help:\n\n【10】*   Lower the body's inflammatory response levels.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    ADA Test - Purpose, Procedure, Diagnosis, and Result</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    CT Myelogram - Uses, What To Expect, and Associated Risks</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Managing Inflammatory Rheumatism With Diet and Nutrition</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Keep a healthy weight.\n\n【12】*   Encourage tissue health and recovery.\n\n【13】*   In most cases, inflammation helps the body fight off infection and promotes the healing of wounds, protecting it from injury. However, persistent symptoms might emerge when inflammation lasts for a long time.\n    </u>\n\n【14】Inflammation levels are influenced by what a person consumes. Certain foods can cause inflammation, while others can reduce it. Numerous studies, according to the Arthritis Foundation, demonstrate how anti-inflammatory foods can lessen the discomfort and development of arthritis. Inflammation levels are also influenced by a person's body weight. Cytokines, which are immune cells that worsen inflammation, are produced by fat cells. A reasonable weight may be maintained by food, which may aid with inflammation and lessen pressure on the joints. And last, some foods can cause a certain form of arthritis. For instance, eating many purine-rich foods might cause a gout episode.\n\n【15】What Are the Foods to Avoid for Arthritis?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【16】**Unhealthy Fats:** Different kinds of fat make the body more inflammatory.\n\n【17】The following activities should be avoided by someone with arthritis, according to the Arthritis Foundation:\n\n【18】*   **Omega 6 Fatty Acids:** These acids are present in high concentrations in a number of oils, including maize, safflower, sunflower, and vegetable. Omega-6 fatty acids are not dangerous when consumed in moderation, although many Americans take large amounts of them.\n\n【19】*   **Saturated Fat:** Meat, butter, and cheese are all sources of saturated fat. Less than 10 percent of a person's daily calorie intake should come from saturated fat.\n\n【20】*   **Trans Fats:** This fat elevates inflammatory levels, lowers \"good\" cholesterol, and increases \"bad\" cholesterol.\n\n【21】**Extra Sugar:** According to researchers, those who regularly consume sugar-sweetened soda are at an elevated risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Regular consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks can also cause obesity, inflammation, and other chronic ailments. Sugar is often added to items. Always read the nutrition facts on breakfast cereals, sauces, and soft drinks since these items may have a surprisingly high added sugar content.\n\n【22】**Salt-Rich Meals:** Consuming too much salt or sodium may raise the risk of autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It could make RA symptoms worse. High salt intake can also elevate blood pressure and a person's chance of contracting other chronic illnesses, including renal and cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and stroke. Ideally, people should consume at most 2,300 milligram (or one teaspoon) of salt daily.\n\n【23】**Nightshades:** Solanine is present in a group of plants known as nightshades. The possibility that nightshades cause arthritic pain has not been proven by studies. Research on animals indicated that many nightshades might reduce inflammation. Conversely, solanine-rich foods may affect the gut flora and promote inflammation. However, the Arthritis Foundation encourages people with arthritis to cut nightshades out of their diet for a few weeks before reintroducing them one at a time.\n\n【24】Vegetable nightshade species include:\n\n【25】*   Bell pepper.\n\n【26】*   Tomatoes\n\n【27】*   Eggplant.\n\n【28】*   Potatoes\n\n【29】A person can keep note of any reactions they experience to a particular dish by keeping a food diary. They should cut out nightshades from their diet if they cause problems after being reintroduced.\n\n【30】**Purine-Rich Food Sources:** A doctor may recommend a low-purine diet in addition to drugs for gout sufferers. The body turns purines, which are found in diets, into uric acid. A gout episode can develop from an accumulation of uric acid in the circulation.\n\n【31】The following foods are rich in purines, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\n\n【32】*   Beer and other alcoholic beverages.\n\n【33】*   Meats like gammon, bacon, or lunch meats.\n\n【34】*   Certain shellfish like mussels and scallops.\n\n【35】*   Organ meat like liver.\n\n【36】A 2018 study found that various purine-rich foods, such as beans, cauliflower, and mushrooms, have no association with the risk of gout.\n\n【37】**AGEs, or Advanced Glycation End Products:** AGEs are inflammatory substances that can build up in tissues, especially as people age. AGE levels are frequently higher in people who have disorders like diabetes and RA. Therefore, lowering AGE levels might aid in lowering inflammation. The AGE levels in the body are raised by both fat and sugar. High-temperature cooking and specific food processing techniques also raise AGE levels in food.\n\n【38】**Red and Processed Meats:** Diets rich in dairy products and processed red meat may make arthritis symptoms worse. Some researchers have suggested red meat consumption has also been connected to the early onset of arthritis. However, plant-based diets may lessen the signs and symptoms of arthritis.\n\n【39】**Refined Substances:** Added sugars and grains that have undergone further processing to remove fiber and minerals are examples of refined carbs. White bread, various baked products, and sweets are a few examples of foods high in refined grains. High-refined carbohydrate diets may make arthritic inflammation worse. Consuming refined carbohydrates has been linked to an increased risk of obesity and can also raise insulin resistance. These two things are arthritic risk factors.\n\n【40】**Conclusion:**\n\n【41】It's crucial to pay attention to one's diet if they have arthritis and stay away from anything that can worsen it. Meals that should be avoided or consumed in moderation include processed and fried meals, sugar, dairy products, red meat, gluten, alcohol, nightshade vegetables, and salt. Instead, consume meals like fresh fruits and vegetables, lean protein sources, and whole grains high in minerals and antioxidants.

Psychomotor development may be normal in full-term or nearly full-term children with benign convulsions. However, the seizures may be brief and frequent.\n\n【2】What Is the Pathophysiology of Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Benign familial neonatal convulsions are inherited in an autosomal dominant trait. The following may be the pathophysiology of the disease:\n\n【4】*   M-type potassium channel mutation.\n\n【5】*   Epilepsy predisposition.\n\n【6】*   Ion channel dysfunction.\n\n【7】What Are the Synonyms for Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The synonyms include:\n\n【9】*   Benign familial neonatal seizures.\n\n【10】*   Benign familial neonatal epilepsy.\n\n【11】*   Benign neonatal convulsions.\n\n【12】*   Benign neonatal epilepsy.\n\n【13】What Is the Cause of Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The causes of benign familial neonatal convulsions may involve rotavirus infection, vitamin B12 deficiency, and low central nervous system zinc levels. However, the most accepted cause is the presence of self-limiting dysfunction in voltage-gated or ligand-gated ion channels.\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【16】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【17】Zellweger Syndrome: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【18】Neonatal Canavan Disease - Causes, Clinical Features, Diagnosis, Management and Outcome\n\n【19】Effects of Asthma on Pregnancy - Associated Risks and Management\n\n【20】**Potassium Channel Dysfunction:**\n\n【21】Most affected families with benign familial neonatal convulsions have abnormalities in the genes coding for KCNQ3 and KCNQ2 potassium channels. The dysfunction causes it in only two chromosomes: BFNC1, a locus on band 20q13.3, and BFNC 2 on band 8q24. This defect causes defective repolarization of the neuronal membrane leading to neonatal seizures. But these abnormalities in the neuronal membrane do not cause seizures in the later period of life. This may be the result of homeostasis in the brain. It is believed that the potassium channels get upregulated to compensate for the deficiency in the function of the defective channels.\n\n【22】**Defective Neurotransmitter Development:**\n\n【23】The infant's brain differs electrophysiologically during early development. Gamma-aminobutyric acid has a paradoxical excitatory effect. Glutamate synapses develop slowly and show delayed expression of the Cl or K ions cotransporter KCC2 and NKCC1. The direct inhibition in the infant's brain is presynaptic. The neuronal membrane homeostasis is maintained along with the postsynaptic excitatory postsynaptic responses and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials when approaching the adult state.\n\n【24】What Is the Epidemiology of Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Benign familial neonatal convulsions are not rare but not common either, and very few cases have been reported. Underreporting may be the issue. At times, the seizure present during the first few months of birth may resolve as the child grows. The cases are usually reported from parts of Western Europe, China, and Japan. Males and females are affected equally in benign familial neonatal convulsions. Benign familial neonatal convulsions have an onset as early as two days after birth; in some cases, it may take up to several weeks. Other members of the family who are unaffected have a higher risk of developing epilepsy in the later stages of life. Studies have shown that family members of the affected individual have a genetic defect in the potassium channel.\n\n【26】**What Is the Prognosis for Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions?**\n\n【27】The incidence of seizures in later stages is around 11 to 16 %. The prognosis for benign familial neonatal convulsions is good, and the condition resolves with no neurologic sequelae.\n\n【28】**Patient Education**:\n\n【29】The individuals affected with benign familial neonatal convulsions are counseled and educated about the risks to the family members. Reassurance is given to individuals as it is a benign condition. However, families need to be alerted about the dangers of developing epilepsy. The risks of developing minor neurologic problems are the same as the general population.\n\n【30】What Are the Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Individuals with benign familial neonatal convulsions are checked for other causative elements for neonatal seizures, such as perinatal or prenatal stroke, fever, perinatal asphyxia, persistent lethargy, pertinent maternal illness, drug abuse, neurologic abnormalities, or signs of metabolic dysfunction.\n\n【32】Suggested diagnostic criteria given by miles and homes involve:\n\n【33】*   Normal neurologic evaluation findings.\n\n【34】*   Absence of alternate etiologic findings.\n\n【35】*   Normal intellectual and developmental outcomes are retrospective criteria.\n\n【36】*   Positive family history of infantile or newborn criteria.\n\n【37】*   Early onset of seizures in the neonatal period or infancy.\n\n【38】**Physical Examination Findings:**\n\n【39】The findings are normal during the interictal period, and neurologic findings also do not show any abnormalities.\n\n【40】**Diagnostic Considerations:**\n\n【41】Individuals with benign familial neonatal convulsions are checked for other causative elements for neonatal seizures and a diagnosis for meningoencephalitis or intracranial hemorrhage, which is treatable during early stages. However, these conditions may only present as seizures in the early stages of life. Also, child abuse should be suspected in neonates post-delivery. Other considerations involve vitamin B6 deficiency, arteriovenous malformations, maternal drug abuse, and tuberous sclerosis.\n\n【42】What Is the Differential Diagnosis for Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】**The differential diagnosis includes:**\n\n【44】*   Viral encephalitis.\n\n【45】*   Pediatric febrile seizures.\n\n【46】*   Focal (partial) epilepsy.\n\n【47】*   Neonatal seizures.\n\n【48】*   Neonatal meningitis.\n\n【49】*   Neonatal injuries in child abuse.\n\n【50】*   Intellectual disability.\n\n【51】*   Infantile spasm (west syndrome).\n\n【52】*   Frontal lobe epilepsy.\n\n【53】*   Aseptic meningitis.\n\n【54】What Are the Investigations for Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】**Investigations include:**\n\n【56】**Laboratory Tests:**\n\n【57】*   Chemistry tests to obtain a basic metabolic panel for calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium levels, thyroid function tests, and check for vitamin B levels.\n\n【58】*   Basic blood tests to check for complete blood count activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time.\n\n【59】*   Lumbar puncture checks for cerebrospinal fluid to rule out occult blood or neonatal meningoencephalitis.\n\n【60】Other investigations include computed tomography, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to rule out intracranial hemorrhage or structural lesions.\n\n【61】What Is the Treatment for Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【62】Antiepileptic medications help in reducing or preventing the occurrence of status epilepticus. During the antiepileptic treatment, the seizures may subside, but the electroencephalography may show abnormalities. Antiepileptic medications do not alter the potassium channels, whereas other drugs may affect the potassium transporter. Medications are selected based on the following:\n\n【63】1.  Appropriateness of the drug on infants.\n\n【64】2.  Lack of serious side effects.\n\n【65】The condition is benign, so it becomes an important factor in selecting medicines. The drugs used are generally Phenobarbital, Benzodiazepines, Fosphenytoin, and Levetiracetam.\n\n【66】**Conclusion**\n\n【67】Benign familial neonatal convulsion is a condition that causes recurrent seizures in a newborn child. Gene mutations usually cause it. Treatment is mostly a medical approach. Families of the affected child are advised to undergo genetic counseling and medical screening due to the risk of developing epilepsy.\n\n【68】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【69】无关删除-1:<u>*   Neonatal Seizures  \n    https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2300188\n*   Benign and severe early-life seizures: a round in the first year of life  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5952424/\n*   Neonatal Seizures: An Update on Mechanisms and Management  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818833/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The condition is also known as Lehman syndrome or neural crest syndrome. Lateral meningocele syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of abnormal pouches, or outpouches, at the lining of the spinal cord (meninges), that protrude through the spinal column. These outpouches are known as lateral meningoceles, and they can cause a variety of symptoms. LMS is caused by mutations in the genes that control the development of neural crest cells. These cells are responsible for the formation of various structures in the body, including the spinal cord, the peripheral nervous system, and the bones and tissues of the face and skull.\n\n【2】What Are the Neural Crest Cells?\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】A neural crest is a group of cells that forms during embryonic development in vertebrates. These cells are derived from the ectoderm, the outermost layer of cells in the developing embryo.\n\n【4】The neural crest cells are unique as they have the ability to migrate throughout the developing embryo and differentiate into a wide variety of cell types. This versatility is what gives the neural crest its importance in the formation of many structures in the body, including the peripheral nervous system, the adrenal glands, the bones and cartilage of the face and skull, and the pigment cells of the skin and hair.\n\n【5】What Are the Causes of Lateral Meningocele Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The causes of neural crest disorders can be complex and varied and may involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some of the known causes of neural crest disorders include:\n\n【7】*   **Genetic Mutations:** Many neural crest disorders are caused by mutations in genes that control the development and function of these cells. These mutations can be inherited from one or both parents or arise spontaneously during development.\n\n【8】*   **Environmental Factors:** Exposure to certain environmental factors during pregnancy, such as alcohol, drugs, and certain medications, can increase the risk of neural crest disorders. Maternal infections and illnesses during pregnancy can also affect the development of the neural crest.\n\n【9】*   **Chromosomal Abnormalities:** Certain chromosomal abnormalities, such as deletions or duplications of specific regions of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), can disrupt the normal development and function of the neural crest.\n\n【10】What Are the Symptoms of Lateral Meningocele Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】*   **Scoliosis:** LMS is often associated with scoliosis, a condition in which the spine curves abnormally to one side. The severity of scoliosis can vary and may require treatment with braces or surgery.\n\n【12】*   **Neurological Symptoms:** LMS can cause various neurological symptoms, including muscle weakness, numbness, tingling, and pain in the arms and legs. In severe cases, it can lead to paralysis.\n\n【13】*   **Hydrocephalus:** In some cases, LMS can cause a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, a condition known as hydrocephalus. This can lead to symptoms such as headache, nausea, and vomiting and may require treatment with a shunt to drain the excess fluid.\n\n【14】*   **Other Skeletal Abnormalities:** LMS may also be associated with other skeletal abnormalities, such as abnormalities of the bones in the hands and feet or abnormal curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis).\n\n【15】*   **Cardiovascular Abnormalities:** Some people with LMS may also have heart and blood vessel abnormalities, such as aortic aneurysms or mitral valve prolapse.\n\n【16】What Is the Diagnosis of Lateral Meningocele Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Here are some of the diagnostic tools used to diagnose LMS:\n\n【18】*   **Physical Examination:** A doctor may perform a physical exam to look for signs of scoliosis, spinal abnormalities, and other characteristic features of LMS.\n\n【19】*   **Imaging Studies:** Imaging studies such as X-rays, CT (computed tomography) scans, and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans can be used to visualize the spine and identify lateral meningoceles or other abnormalities.\n\n【20】*   **Genetic Testing:** LMS is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which provides instructions for making a neurofibromin protein. Genetic testing can help identify mutations in this gene and confirm a diagnosis of LMS.\n\n【21】*   **Neurological Evaluation:** A neurological evaluation may be performed to assess for any signs of nerve damage or dysfunction, such as weakness, numbness, or tingling.\n\n【22】*   **Other Tests:** Other tests may be ordered as needed to assess for any associated complications, such as echocardiography to evaluate for cardiovascular abnormalities or tests to evaluate for hydrocephalus or other neurological issues.\n\n【23】What Are the Treatment Options for Lateral Meningocele Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Some of the treatment options for LMS:\n\n【25】*   **Surgical Intervention:** In cases where lateral meningoceles are causing spinal cord compression or other neurological symptoms, surgery may be required to remove or repair the meningoceles and alleviate pressure on the spinal cord. The type of surgery used will depend on the specific location and severity of the meningoceles.\n\n【26】*   **Orthopedic Management:** If scoliosis or other spinal abnormalities are present, treatment may include braces, spinal fusion, or other orthopedic interventions to help correct the curvature of the spine and prevent further progression.\n\n【27】*   **Management of Associated Complications:** If a person with LMS has associated complications such as hydrocephalus, cardiovascular abnormalities, or other medical issues, treatment may involve a team of medical professionals working together to manage each aspect of the condition.\n\n【28】*   **Physical Therapy:** Physical therapy may be recommended to help improve muscle strength, coordination, and balance and to prevent muscle contractures and other complications associated with LMS.\n\n【29】*   **Pain Management:** If a person with LMS is experiencing pain related to their condition, pain management strategies such as medications, injections, or other interventions may be recommended.\n\n【30】*   **Genetic Counseling:** Individuals with LMS may benefit from genetic counseling, which can help them understand the inheritance pattern of the disorder and provide information on reproductive options.\n\n【31】**Conclusion:**\n\n【32】Lateral meningocele syndrome is a complex and rare disorder that can affect multiple systems in the body. While LMS can present a wide range of symptoms, a diagnosis of LMS is typically based on a combination of clinical features, imaging studies, and genetic testing. Treatment options for LMS aim to manage specific symptoms and complications and may involve a team-based approach that includes specialists from various medical fields. While there is currently no cure for LMS, with appropriate management and treatment, individuals with LMS can still lead fulfilling lives. Further research and advancements in understanding this disorder may help improve outcomes and provide better management strategies for those affected by LMS.\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>*   Lateral meningocele syndrome  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/lateral-meningocele-syndrome/\n*   Lateral meningocele syndrome  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/lateral-meningocele-syndrome\n*   Lateral meningocele syndrome  \n    https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/9873/lateral-meningocele-syndrome</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Circulating tumor markers (found in blood, bodily fluids, stool, and urine).\n\n【15】2.  Tumor tissue markers (found within the tumor, especially seen in the tumor samples).\n\n【16】An ideal tumor marker should be highly specific (detect specific tumor and avoid false-positive results) and sensitive (detect early tumor and lower false-negative rate). Tumor markers are detected using the “tumor marker test.” A tumor marker test helps in cancer diagnosis, to assess cancer response to the treatment, and to check for cancer recurrence. Tumor marker test in cancer diagnosis has less specificity. Only your healthcare provider can suggest a tumor marker test to detect cancer.\n\n【17】What Is the Role of Tumor Marker Test in Cancer?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The role of the tumor marker test in cancer diagnosis includes,\n\n【19】*   To help in cancer monitoring that assesses the cancer risk in individuals.\n\n【20】*   To help in cancer diagnosis. For example, the CA-125 tumor marker helps in ovarian cancer diagnosis.\n\n【21】*   To determine the cancer stage by assessing the cancer spread (metastasis).\n\n【22】*   Helps in cancer prognosis.\n\n【23】*   Certain tumor markers help doctors in planning out treatment to which cancer can respond in a better way. For example, breast cancer patients with Her2/neu positive will respond well to Herceptin therapeutic drug treatment.\n\n【24】*   Helps in determining the recurrence rate of cancer.\n\n【25】How Is Tumor Marker Test Done?\n------------------------------\n\n【26】Tumor markers can be detected through different tests. It includes blood tests, urine tests, and biopsy. The most common tumor marker test is a blood test. If a blood test or urine test for tumor marker testing is carried out, then your blood sample or urine sample is taken and sent for pathological examination. These tests will detect the circulating tumor markers and their association with cancer.\n\n【27】Some tumor markers are associated with specific cancer, but some other tumor markers may have an association with multiple cancers. In a biopsy, tissue from the affected area is removed and sent for pathological examination. It detects the presence of tumor tissue markers. All these tumor marker tests should be carried out only if your doctor asks you to do so.\n\n【28】What Are the Different Tumor Marker Tests Used in Cancer Detection?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Tumor marker tests are used in cancer screening, early detection of cancer, cancer diagnosis, determining the prognosis, assessing how well cancer responds to treatment, monitoring the condition, and determining the cancer recurrence. Cancer diagnosis by tumor marker tests alone does not provide an accurate diagnosis as it has low specificity. Elevated tumor marker levels are not seen in all cancers. Some tumor markers are seen specifically in certain cancers, which helps in the early detection of that particular cancer. Let us see some of the common tumor marker tests used in cancer detection below,\n\n【30】*   **PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) Test:** PSA test helps in determining the PSA levels in the blood. Prostate cancer can be detected by elevated PSA levels in the blood. PSA levels with 4.0ng/ml (nanograms/milliliter) and below are considered normal. Prostate cancer patients are seen with PSA levels of more than 4.0ng/ml. But in certain cases, PSA levels less than 4.0mg/ml are also associated with prostate cancer. If your doctor finds your PSA level to be higher, then he will suggest tests furthermore to look for prostate cancer.\n\n【31】*   **CA (Cancer Antigen) 125 Test:** CA 125 test is used in ovarian cancer detection. It is used in cancer monitoring during and after treatment and checks for any cancer recurrence after treatment. The normal range of CA-125 is 0-35 units/ml. Above 35 units/ml of CA-125 is abnormal and can be seen in ovarian cancer. However, high levels of CA-125 always do not mean that you have cancer. So if you have high CA-125 levels, then you may need a further test for cancer diagnosis.\n\n【32】*   **CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen) Test:** CEA test detects the amount of CEA in the blood. The normal CEA level is 0-2.5 ng/ml. Levels greater than 10ng/ml are suggestive of any extensive disease and levels greater than 20ng/ml describe that cancer may be spreading. High levels of CEA tumor markers are seen in colorectal cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, etc.\n\n【33】*   **CA 15-3 and CA 27-29 (Cancer Antigen 15-3 and 27-29) Test:** It helps in measuring CA 15-3 and CA 27-29 levels in the blood. These are cancer antigens found in breast cancer. The normal level of CA 15-3 is 30units/ml, and high levels of CA 15-3 are seen in metastatic breast cancer. Normal CA 27-29 should be equal to or less than 38 units/ml. Levels higher than this indicate active breast cancer in individuals.\n\n【34】*   **Alpha-fetoprotein (AFA) Test:** This test measures the amount of alpha-fetoprotein in blood. Normal levels of alpha-fetoprotein are between 10ng/ml to 20ng/ml. Elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein are seen in liver cancer, ovarian, and testicular cancers.\n\n【35】*   **Thyroglobulin Test:** It is a tumor marker test that helps in guiding thyroid cancer treatment. Normal levels of thyroglobulin are 3-40 ng/ml in a healthy patient. High levels of thyroglobulin are seen in Graves’ disease, thyroiditis, and thyroid cancer. The presence of thyroglobulin in blood after thyroidectomy describes that a part of the thyroid tumor (cancer) or normal thyroid remains. It also detects cancer recurrence in thyroid cancer.\n\n【36】*   **Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) Test:** HCG as a tumor marker is seen in germ cell tumors, testicular tumors, choriocarcinoma (a malignant tumor that develops from trophoblastic cells), etc.\n\n【37】What Are the Drawbacks of Tumor Marker Tests?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【38】The major drawbacks of tumor marker test include,\n\n【39】1.  It cannot detect all cancers as some cancers have no association with tumor markers.\n\n【40】2.  A tumor marker test cannot diagnose cancer accurately as it has low specificity.\n\n【41】3.  Not used in cancer diagnosis or screening in low-risk patients.\n\n【42】How Reliable Are Tumor Marker Tests?\n------------------------------------\n\n【43】Tumor marker tests are not highly reliable in cancer diagnosis. Due to its low specificity, the tumor marker test alone is not enough to diagnose cancer. Your healthcare provider will suggest you have further tests for accurate cancer diagnosis.\n\n【44】**Conclusion:**\n\n【45】Tumor markers, otherwise known as cancer markers, are used in cancer screening, diagnosis, assessing prognosis, assessing the cancer response to the treatment, monitoring the condition, and checking for cancer recurrence. They are not highly reliable in cancer diagnosis and screening. This is due to its low specificity giving out false-positive or false-negative results. Additional tests may be suggested further by your doctor for diagnosing cancer with high accuracy.\n\n【46】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【47】* * *\n\n【48】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Types of Tumor Makers?**\n\n【49】Tumor markers are classified into two types. They are circulating tumor markers and tumor tissue markers. Some cancer patients' blood, urine, stool, or other bodily fluids contain circulating tumor markers. Tumor tissue markers are found in actual tumors, usually in a sample of the tumor removed during a biopsy.\n\n【50】#### **2.**删除换行**What Blood Test Show Tumor Markers?**\n\n【51】Cancer is diagnosed and treated using blood and other laboratory tests such as tissue analysis, urinalysis, and tumor markers. Cancer SEEK is a blood test that detects DNA mutations and protein biomarkers associated with various cancers.\n\n【52】#### **3.**删除换行**What Is the Normal Tumor Marker Level?**\n\n【53】   \n2.5 ng/ml is considered normal. The normal range may differ slightly depending on the brand of assay used. Levels greater than ten ng/ml indicate extensive disease, while levels greater than 20 ng/ml indicate metastatic disease.\n\n【54】#### **4.**删除换行**Do Tumor Markers Detect all Cancers?**\n\n【55】Along with other tests, tumor marker tests can help doctors diagnose cancer and recommend a treatment plan for an individual. An elevated level of a circulating tumor marker may indicate the presence of cancer and can sometimes aid in diagnosing cancer, but it is not sufficient to diagnose cancer.\n\n【56】#### **5.**删除换行**What Are the Limitations of Tumor Markers?**\n\n【57】One of the limitations of tumor markers is that a non-cancerous disease or condition can elevate them. Some tumor markers can be elevated in healthy people. Some tumor markers are specific to a specific type of cancer, whereas others may be elevated in various cancers.\n\n【58】#### **6.**删除换行**Are Tumor Markers Useful?**\n\n【59】Tumor markers can predict a tumor's response to treatment and prognosis. Researchers have found that it is useful in screening tests that help to detect cancer early before symptoms appear.\n\n【60】#### **7.**删除换行**What Happens if Tumor Markers Are High?**\n\n【61】A high level of tumor markers indicates that they are more likely to develop cancer. Typically, a biopsy is required to diagnose or rule out cancer. However, tumor marker tests that use tumor cells may aid in diagnosing cancer.\n\n【62】#### **8.**删除换行**What Are Tumor Markers?**\n\n【63】A tumor marker is found in or produced by cancer cells or other cells present in the body in response to cancer or certain benign conditions that provides information about cancer, such as how aggressive it is, what type of treatment it may respond to, or whether it is responding to treatment.\n\n【64】#### **9.**删除换行**Can Stress Raise Tumor Markers?**\n\n【65】According to one study, stress hormones can affect the function of some neutrophils, perhaps prompting dormant cancer cells to activate.

The term masochism is often associated with sadism, as these individuals mainly obtain sexual pleasure by causing pain or violence to their partners; these individuals often alter their roles as they feel aroused by inflicting pain and experiencing pain in different instances.\n\n【3】What Are Types of Masochism?\n----------------------------\n\n【4】Sigmund Freud classified masochism as follows:\n\n【5】**Erotogenic:** This is the most basic type of Masochism and is associated with pleasure in experiencing pain. Erotogenic Masochism is considered the foundation of the other two types of Masochism. Erotogenic Masochism or sexual Masochism derives sexual pleasure or excitement by either abusing themselves by:\n\n【6】*   Binding themselves.\n\n【7】*   Piercing.\n\n【8】*   Applying mild electrical shocks.\n\n【9】*   Burning themselves (using candle wax or other burns).\n\n【10】They even involve partners to obtain sadistic pleasure, which includes activities like:\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】Triple X Syndrome - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management\n\n【14】Mental Health Issues Influencing Sexual Violence In Adults\n\n【15】*   Bound.\n\n【16】*   Blindfolded.\n\n【17】*   Spanked.\n\n【18】*   Humiliated by being urinated on.\n\n【19】*   Forced to cross-dress.\n\n【20】*   Part of simulated rape.\n\n【21】**Feminine:** Feminine Masochism is a complex phenomenon where masochist desires are fulfilled by treating partners or themselves like a child brings pleasure to the person. This type of Masochism involves acts like punishing and other childlike behaviors.\n\n【22】**Moral:** Moral Masochism is based more on self-suffering than pleasing others; these people gain satisfaction by pushing their limits and strength and bearing pain.\n\n【23】How Does a Masochistic Personality Develop?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Masochistic or self-defeating personality is commonly observed in children with a strict childhood or over-controlling parents. Research has found that the parents of masochists usually do not give their children any freedom of expression or decision-making; these parents expect complete obedience and discipline.\n\n【25】The children are loved only when they present expected behaviors. These children grow up very stubborn and have aggressive behaviors as they hold grudges and wish revenge but cannot do so due to a lack of power. This mental war affects the personality of an individual. Masochists often complain, are least creative, and have stagnant or stunted social and professional growth.\n\n【26】What Are Masochistic Personality Traits?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【27】Following are the behavioral patterns which, when observed in oneself or others, a person can be determined as masochistic:\n\n【28】*   **Overworked:** These individuals work to a limit and beyond by pushing themselves to meet the targets. These behaviors are self-abusive in a way.\n\n【29】*   **Humiliation:** Masochists feel humiliated from the inside but never express how they feel about themselves.\n\n【30】*   **Unloved:** These individuals always feel like nobody loves them and always put in extra effort to be accepted by everyone around them.\n\n【31】*   **Have Solid Built:** Physical stature proves the defense to abuse or a history of childhood abuse.\n\n【32】*   **Difficulty in Denying:** It is impossible for a masochist to say no to anyone or anything; instead, these individuals put in extra effort to prove their worth.\n\n【33】*   **Weaning:** Complaining nature is observed commonly amongst these people; they complain a lot but never find solutions to their problems.\n\n【34】*   **Abusive Relationships:** These individuals continue to be in abusive or toxic relationships where they are abused or humiliated. They consider it as a way of maintaining pride.\n\n【35】*   **Guilt:** These individuals feel trapped and find it difficult to enjoy without guilt being accompanied.\n\n【36】How Is Masochism Diagnosed?\n---------------------------\n\n【37】The diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) has defined certain guidelines and criteria for diagnosing Masochism. These guidelines include\n\n【38】*   Physical behaviors were the patient-reported repeated and intense arousal on being humiliated, beaten, bound, or abused.\n\n【39】*   Their fantasies, intense urges, or behaviors become an embarrassment and cause significant distress or impair functioning at work and in social situations.\n\n【40】*   The condition has been present for more than six months.\n\n【41】How to Get Over Masochism?\n--------------------------\n\n【42】Masochism is a mental disorder, but to some extent, satisfaction with slight pain is a part of human nature and is considered normal. But when this urge is beyond control and affects personal life, it is important to seek help from the partner by discussing desires, thoughts, and fantasies, as most partners understand and help overcome the problem. In cases where the disorder is not cured by discussion or self-control, help can be taken from organizations with certified sex therapists who can guide in reducing masochistic behaviors and help in safety planning and treating underlying mental health disorders, if any are present.\n\n【43】How Are Masochistic Disorders Treated?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【44】Masochistic disorders are self-diagnosed and do not require treatment if the physical symptoms, urge, and fantasies are controllable. But psychotherapy is the most common treatment method in cases of distress or impairment. Such patients are counseled and trained to control their sexual desires and fantasies.\n\n【45】**Medications:** Various medications are used to control compulsive behaviors. These medications include\n\n【46】*   **Antidepressants:** Antidepressants treat various mental health disorders like anxiety and depression. These medications do not help overcome masochistic behaviors directly but help control thoughts and lower sex drive.\n\n【47】*   **Androgens:** These medications reduce the levels of sex hormones like testosterone, which help control the sex drive and are considered an effective therapy.\n\n【48】**Sex Therapy:** Sex therapy is a treatment method where a person is analyzed and guided to overcome social distress. The therapist discusses the social and psychological history; the therapist will explore the onset and cause of the symptom and use it to eliminate the cause and control the sexual desires. The therapist may also assess and focus on the following:\n\n【49】*   Safety planning and harm reduction to employ when engaging in BDSM activities\n\n【50】*   Skills for navigating urges as they arise and mindfulness exercises or self-soothing techniques for reducing distress\n\n【51】*   Co-occurring psychological conditions, such as mood disorders.\n\n【52】**Conclusion:**\n\n【53】Masochistic behaviors are mental disorders where a person derives pleasure from experiencing or eliciting pain. These disorders have onset during early adulthood and may progress with age if left unnoticed. Individuals should address the disorders themselves or their partners to prevent severe, life-threatening violent activities.\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>*   Treatment of an unusual case of masochism  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9805290/\n*   Masochism  \n    https://hhma.org/healthadvisor/aha-masochis-bha/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

In addition, radiation can kill sperm cells and the stem cells that produce them.\n\n【56】*   Radiation therapy to the brain can harm the pituitary gland, reducing testosterone and sperm production.\n\n【57】*   Infertility can result from surgery for tumors of the reproductive organs and pelvic cancers, which can harm these organs and adjacent nerves.\n\n【58】*   High doses of radiation are used in stem cell transplants, such as bone marrow transplants and peripheral blood stem cell transplants.

Men of reproductive age undergoing cancer therapy can opt for this. In the laboratory, semen samples are collected and examined under a microscope. The sperm is then frozen and saved for future use.\n\n【67】*   **Gonadal or Testicular Shielding -** When the regions of the body surrounding the testes are being treated with radiation, testicular shielding can be done. Gonadal shielding is a process in which a protective cover is placed on the body's exterior to screen the testicles from scattered radiation to the pelvis.\n\n【68】*   **TESE (Testicular Sperm Extraction) -** Males who cannot produce a sperm sample undergo testicular sperm extraction (TESE). A medical process that includes collecting sperm and preserving it for future use.\n\n【69】*   **TTF (Testicular Tissue Freezing) -** Most hospitals still consider testicular tissue freezing (also known as testicular tissue cryopreservation) an experimental operation. This surgery may be possible for males who have not reached puberty and are at high risk of infertility.\n\n【70】What Alternatives Do Women Have for Preserving Their Fertility?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【71】*   **Oocyte Cryopreservation -** Egg freezing or oocyte cryopreservation is a process that involves removing and freezing the ovary eggs. These preserved eggs can be used for in vitro fertilization procedures in future life.\n\n【72】*   **Embryo Freezing or Embryo Banking** is a cryopreservation procedure for saving eggs for the future.\n\n【73】*   **Ovarian Shielding (Also Known as Gonadal Shielding) -** Similar to testicle shielding, it is a process in which a protective cover is placed over the ovaries and other elements of the reproductive system on the outside of the body to prevent them from scattering.\n\n【74】*   **Oophoropexy** is a procedure that involves transposing the ovaries away from the body area exposed to radiation.\n\n【75】*   **Radical Cervicectomy** is a procedure to treat women with early-stage cervical cancer who want to start a family. The cervix, surrounding lymph nodes, and the top section of the vagina are all removed during this procedure. The uterus is then joined to the remaining vaginal wall with a specific ring that acts as the cervix.\n\n【76】**Conclusion**\n\n【77】It is essential to link cancer treatment and sexual dysfunction or infertility. Because it is not always feasible to foresee how the body will respond to treatment, there are no apparent reasons for cancer therapy to induce or elicit specific side effects. Younger people and cancer survivors should always take steps to preserve their fertility, as sexual health is linked to overall health.\n\n【78】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【79】无关删除-1:<u>*   Female Fertility Issues and Cancer  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fertility-women\n*   Male Fertility Issues and Cancer  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fertility-men</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

However, uterine polyps can also affect women of reproductive age. These polyps are benign (non-cancerous) growths attached to the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus). Though the endometrial polyps are usually non-cancerous, some polyps can be cancerous or progress to become cancerous.\n\n【2】What Are Endometrial Polyps?\n----------------------------\n\n【3】Endometrial polyps are abnormal growths in the endometrium of the uterus. The polyps contain glands, stroma, and blood vessels that project from the endometrium to occupy and fill the uterine cavity. It can affect women at the reproductive and post-menopausal phase of life. The size of the endometrial polyp can range from 5 mm (millimeters) to a large polyp that fills the entire cavity.\n\n【4】The polyps are usually located in the fundus (the hollow part of the uterus that is in the top, away from the cervical opening), especially in the corneal area (a funnel-shaped portion in the upper uterine body which receives the insertion of the fallopian tubes). The endometrial polyp is referred to as pedunculated, if it is attached to the surface of the uterus by a narrow elongated pedicle (a stalk-like structure that connects an organ or other part to the body).\n\n【5】The polyps are called sessile, if the stalk is absent and they have a flat base. The polyps appear smooth, spherical, or cylindrical , and are tan to yellow in color. In the presence of endometrial polyps, the endometrium may be normal or become hyperplastic (increased number of cells in an organ or tissue).\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Endometrial Polyps?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Some women with endometrial polyps remain asymptomatic, while some women experience the following symptoms:\n\n【8】*   Abnormal uterine bleeding.\n\n【9】*   Vaginal bleeding after menopause.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What is the reason for bleeding after sex without any other symptoms?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What could cause irregular periods with spotting and cramps?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Why did PET scan show no issue when the patient has a biopsy-proven carcinoma in the uterus?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Frequent, unpredictable, and long menstruation.\n\n【11】*   Infertility.\n\n【12】*   Bleeding between periods.\n    </u>\n\n【13】What Are the Causes of Endometrial Polyps?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The exact cause of endometrial polyps are unknown. The endometrial polyps are thought to be related to estrogen stimulation, which can be due to an increase in the concentration of estrogen receptors.\n\n【15】The following risk factors can increase the formation of endometrial polyps:\n\n【16】*   Increased estrogen production.\n\n【17】*   Exogenous estrogen administration in hormone replacement therapy.\n\n【18】*   Tamoxifen drug administration for breast cancer treatment.\n\n【19】*   Hypertension.\n\n【20】*   Obesity.\n\n【21】*   The presence of Lynch syndrome (a genetic condition that leads to cancer) or Cowden syndrome (a genetic disorder that presents with multiple non-cancerous growths and increased risk for certain types of cancers).\n\n【22】How Do Endometrial Polyps Develop?\n----------------------------------\n\n【23】The exact cause of endometrial polyps are not known. Several theories were proposed to explain the development of endometrial polyps. It was thought that estrogen stimulation, and decreased expression of progesterone can result in the development of endometrial polyps. Some researchers thought that an imbalance between the mitotic activity and apoptosis plays a role in the development of endometrial polyp.\n\n【24】Other theories suggest that chromosomal abnormalities cause formation of endometrial polyps. It was found that Tamoxifen drug used in the treatment of breast cancer has estrogenic effects on the uterus. It promotes the growth of polyps by inhibiting apoptosis.\n\n【25】Endometrial polyps can develop as a result of localized chronic inflammation in the endometrium. Chronic inflammation causes the formation of new blood vessels. Inflammation is initiated and controlled by mast cells. These mast cells are higher in endometrial polyps. These cells induce the formation of blood vessels and an increase in the blood vessel density is considered a polyp. The polyps can be inflammatory in nature or hormone dependent.\n\n【26】What Are the Complications Associated With Endometrial Polyps?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Endometrial polyps can cause various complications, including abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility due to implantation failure, and malignant transformation. Abnormal bleeding is caused due to stromal congestion within the polyp resulting in venous stasis and apical necrosis. The implantation failure can be due to mechanical obstruction or biochemical effects of the polyps.\n\n【28】A small fraction of endometrial polyps undergo malignant transformation. The common cancer subtypes associated with endometrial polyps are endometrioid adenocarcinoma and serous adenocarcinoma. The risk of developing cancer is associated with factors such as the size of the polyp (polyps above 15 mm), age, hypertension, obesity, hormone replacement therapy, and the use of Tamoxifen.\n\n【29】How Are Endometrial Polyps Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【30】Several methods are available to diagnose endometrial polyps.\n\n【31】It includes the following:\n\n【32】*   **Transvaginal Ultrasonography**: An ultrasound probe is inserted through the vagina to reach the uterine cavity. The polyps are visualized as hyperechogenic lesions with regular borders. Sometimes, cystic glands are visible within the polyp.\n\n【33】*   **Color-flow or Power Doppler Study:** Color-flow Doppler is used to determine the single feeding vessel of the endometrial polyps. It aids in the identification of the typical single vessel pattern of endometrial polyp, in contrast to multiple vessel patterns in hyperplasia and malignant lesions.\n\n【34】*   **Sonohysterography or Saline Infusion Sonography:** Sonohysterography increases the contrast of the endometrium and helps in determining the size and location of the endometrial polyps. Saline infusion may increase the sonographic details. It also helps in diagnosing myometrial and adnexal abnormalities.\n\n【35】*   **Histological Examination:** The histological examination of the biopsied tissue reveals the presence of stroma with a dense fibrous tissue, glandular abnormalities, and thick-walled blood vessels. The polyps appear similar to cystic hyperplasia during every stage of the menstrual cycle.\n\n【36】How Are Endometrial Polyps Treated?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【37】The treatment of endometrial polyps depend on the symptoms, fertility issues, and malignancy.\n\n【38】The treatment options include the following:\n\n【39】*   **Conservative Surgery** \\- Hysteroscopic polypectomy is the mainstay treatment for the removal of endometrial polyps. Dilation and curettage along with the use of polypectomy forceps help in investigating the abnormalities. However, it is associated with limitations such as missing a polyp.\n\n【40】*   **Conservative Non-surgical Treatment -** Asymptomatic women with polyps less than 10 mm size require observations alone. Hormone combined therapy in postmenopausal women may reduce the development of endometrial polyps.\n\n【41】*   **Levonorgestrel Intrauterine System -** The Levonorgestrel intrauterine system prevents the development of endometrial polyps in women under estrogen replacement therapy and Tamoxifen drug.\n\n【42】*   **Dienogest and Danazol -** Dienogest and Danazol are used to prepare the endometrium in patients undergoing hysteroscopic surgery. It reduces the thickness of the endometrium and the severity of the bleeding during surgery.\n\n【43】**Conclusion**\n\n【44】Endometrial polyps are common in women and are a significant cause of infertility. It also acts as a precursor to malignancy. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential to prevent the progression of the polyps and the risk of complications.\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>*   Endometrial polyps: Pathogenesis, sequelae and treatment  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6501471/\n*   Endometrial polyps  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007636.htm\n*   Endometrial polyp  \n    https://radiopaedia.org/articles/endometrial-polyp</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Newborn babies with low birth weight and premature term are more likely to be at risk of getting neonatal seizures. It is a neurological condition that occurs suddenly due to various factors. In the first month of their life, neonates have immature brain development. Due to different pathophysiology and clinical manifestation, it is comparatively difficult to recognize and diagnose its signs and symptoms.\n\n【2】Newborns have immature brain development, which makes them unique and more vulnerable to external and pathological triggers. As a result, if these triggers are given to the brain, it is very much likely to get provoked, resulting in seizures. Seizures can cause severe damage to homeostasis and the brain. In infants, it can cause neurological impairment, developmental growth delay, or in extreme conditions, death. Because of this, it is very important to diagnose them as soon as possible.\n\n【3】What Are the Types of Neonatal Seizures?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【4】There are four main types of neonatal seizures seen in children such as:\n\n【5】1.  **Subtle Seizures**: It has very mild symptoms, so it is easy to miss them. There is almost a 50 percent chance that seizures are of this type. There are subtle seizures in neonates, such as ocular, oral, apnea-related, autonomic phenomena, and limb movements. An electrocardiogram is required to diagnose this type of seizure.\n2.  **Clonic Seizures**: These types of seizures are commonly related to changes in the electroencephalogram. Almost two to three movements per second are seen with this type of seizure. For instance, a fast contraction is immediately followed by a slow relaxation phase. This type of seizure involves the face, arms, legs, or trunk. This type of seizure can be focal, multifocal, bilaterally symmetrical, or asymmetrical.\n3.  **Tonic Seizures**: This extreme and rigorous kind of seizure causes loss of consciousness. The duration of this type is almost 20 seconds with a sudden contraction of muscles which usually occurs while a person is sleeping. This type of seizure usually affects one extremity, especially eye deviation. This type of seizure can be focal or unilateral or bilaterally symmetrical or asymmetrical. Usually, premature babies are more affected by it.\n4.  **Myoclonic Seizures**: These types of seizures have frequency-like waves and are non-rhythmical. For instance, it occurs in a pattern of sudden shock and relaxation. Usually, this type of seizure occurs due to alcohol consumption, fever, light stimulation, or infectious conditions. This type of seizure is seen in babies due to premature birth or congenital metabolism defect. This type of seizure can be focal, multifocal, bilaterally symmetrical, or asymmetrical.\n\n【6】What Are the Causes of Neonatal Seizures?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【7】There are the following causes behind seizures in neonates:\n\n【8】*   Sudden decrease or gradual decrease of oxygen level during or before birth owing to premature detachment of the placenta.\n*   Stroke that occurs before or after birth.\n*   Blood clot in the brain.\n*   Bleeding in the brain.\n*   Infectious conditions include bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis. Also, systemic infections associated with the central nervous system can be the reason behind this condition in neonates.\n*   Developmental birth defects related to the brain.\n*   Electrolyte and sugar imbalances cause many complications.\n*   Metabolic disorders, causing such as hypoglycemia, phenylketonuria, or pyridoxine dependency.\n*   Mothers are addicted to drugs and have drug withdrawal symptoms. These drugs can be alcohol, barbiturates, heroin, cocaine, or methadone. There are chances of babies being born with conditions such as seizures.\n*   Also, it is an autosomal dominant inherited condition. This suggests that either one of the dominant genes can be the reason behind this condition.\n\n【9】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Neonatal Seizures?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】From subtle to severe movements, seizures can be very complex to diagnose. Additionally, neonates with seizures show the same movements as normal babies would. Some symptoms are seen according to their type, such as:\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】The Neonatal Sepsis and Shock\n\n【14】Will seizures slow my daughter's growth and development?\n\n【15】Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome - Causes, Symptoms, Complications and Treatment\n\n【16】**1) Symptoms of Subtle Seizures**:\n\n【17】*   Random movements of eyes such as fluttering, blinking, or rolling.\n*   Unusual tongue movements, such as sucking, smacking, or chewing movements.\n*   Unusual movement of legs, such as hyper paddling or bicycling movements.\n*   Long pauses in breathing, also known as apnea.\n*   Struggling movements.\n\n【18】**2) Symptoms of Clonic Seizures**:\n\n【19】*   Rhythmic jerking-like movements of face and limbs.\n\n【20】**3) Symptoms of Tonic Seizures**:\n\n【21】*   Visible tightening of the body muscles.\n*   Turning the eyeball to one side along with the face.\n*   Stretching of a particular side of limbs.\n\n【22】**4) Symptoms of Myoclonic Seizures**:\n\n【23】*   Quick jerking-like movements of a single side of the body.\n\n【24】How to Diagnose Neonatal Seizures?\n----------------------------------\n\n【25】Investigation of seizures should be as immediate as possible after recognizing the sign. The following are investigation options:\n\n【26】**1) Physical Examination**: If neonates have unusual physical movements at the time of delivery, the doctors should immediately provide them with medical attention.\n\n【27】**2) Plasma Examination**:\n\n【28】*   Blood glucose.\n*   Urea and electrolytes examination.\n*   Blood gas- CO2 (carbon dioxide), bicarbonate, and lactate examination.\n*   Liver function test.\n*   Full blood count.\n*   Blood cultures.\n*   Virology tests.\n\n【29】**3) Urine Examination**:\n\n【30】*   Cultura- Bacterial.\n*   Virology test.\n\n【31】**4) CSF (Cerebral Spinal Fluid) Examination**:\n\n【32】*   Bacterial culture.\n*   Virology.\n*   Glucose.\n*   Protein.\n\n【33】**5) Imaging**:\n\n【34】*   Cranial ultrasound.\n*   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n*   Electroencephalogram is a very useful tool to diagnose the electrical activity of the brain.\n\n【35】**6) Other**:\n\n【36】*   Throat swab for viral infection.\n*   Bacterial and viral swabs for skin or other organ infections.\n\n【37】How to Manage Neonatal Seizures?\n--------------------------------\n\n【38】Usually, the management of seizure activity has three main components such as observing, assessing, and managing. The following are the options to manage seizures in neonates:\n\n【39】*   It is essential to first identify the signs of seizures in neonates. Moreover, identifying the underlying reason behind this condition is equally essential.\n*   Anticonvulsant medication is prescribed to control seizures. Additionally, doctors prescribed Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, or Lorazepam.\n*   If the diagnosis suggests a condition such as low or not enough oxygen in the brain hypothermia treatments are recommended. This involves cooling down the newborn’s body and brain by a few degrees, along with close monitoring. As the vitals get back to normal, the body temperature is brought back to normal.\n\n【40】**Conclusion:**\n\n【41】Neonatal seizures can be fatal if not diagnosed at an early stage. Moreover, it is a condition that requires interdisciplinary medical care and attention. It is very important for parents and doctors to recognize the first sign of this condition. If a seizure lasts more than five minutes in children patients should immediately seek medical attention. A delay of a few minutes can be life-threatening in severe cases.\n\n【42】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【43】* * *\n\n【44】#### **1.**删除换行**Does Neonatal Seizure Occur as a Result of Xantheine Oxidase Deficiency?**\n\n【45】Xantheine oxidase refers to the type of enzyme that helps in the process of oxidative conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine which in turn converts to uric acid. A deficiency of the xantheine oxidase enzyme can result in hereditary xanthinuria. This condition is characterized by kidney symptoms causing increased levels of xanthine in the urine. Some of the clinical features of this condition lead to intractable seizures in neonates. \n\n【46】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is the Duration of Medical Intervention in Neonatal Seizures?**\n\n【47】Neonatal seizures are usually treated with anti-seizure medications to control the seizures. Even though the symptoms of neonatal seizures subside within three days, they are at higher risk of chronic, unprovocative seizures. Hence, the anti-seizure medications are maintained for several months to avoid the risk of seizures and early-life epilepsy. Long-term use of anti-seizure medications is associated with potentially toxic neurological effects. \n\n【48】#### **3.**删除换行**Explain Neonatal Focal Seizure?**\n\n【49】It is referred to as a focal neonatal seizure because the abnormality in the brain's electrical activity occurs in one or more areas of only one side of the brain. Genetic mutations commonly cause them. The clinical presentation of a focal seizure depends on the side of the brain affected. Hence, focal seizure of the brain's right side affects the body's left part. \n\n【50】#### **4.**删除换行**Is Phenobarbital the Drug of Choice in Neonatal Seizures?**\n\n【51】Phenobarbital is one of the most preferred medications for neonatal seizures. They are usually preferred for their long exposure to use in neonates and their intravenous absorption. They have been shown to decrease the duration and severity of the seizure. However, the effectiveness of this medication is still controversial. \n\n【52】#### **5.**删除换行**Explain Benign Neonatal Seizure?**\n\n【53】Benign neonatal seizures refer to a rare genetic condition with autosomal dominant inheritance. It affects newborns within the first few days of life, and the episodes of seizures stop after 15 weeks. Seizures usually last for a minute and are tonic-clonic seizures. This condition is often controlled with the administration of phenobarbital. The management of this condition depends on the severity of the seizures. \n\n【54】#### **6.**删除换行**How Are Neonatal Seizures Treated?**\n\n【55】Immediate diagnosis and prompt treatment are necessary in cases of neonatal seizures. The healthcare provider will initially work on identifying the condition's underlying cause. The affected child is prescribed anti-convulsant medication to control the seizures. In severe cases, when the affected child lacks oxygen supply to the brain, they are managed with hypothermia treatment.\n\n【56】#### **7.**删除换行**Are Neonatal Seizures a Serious Condition?**\n\n【57】Neonatal seizures can occur for a short period and may not even reoccur. But rarely, in severe cases, it can result in neurological impairment, delay in growth, and rarely, in extreme cases, it may even be fatal. This condition can cause some serious impairments in the affected child’s brain. Hence, this condition requires immediate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. \n\n【58】#### **8.**删除换行**What Is the Normal Duration of a Neonatal Seizure?**\n\n【59】Seizures that affect neonates are generally momentary and impermanent, and it may be difficult to evaluate the condition during this stage of life. The episodes of seizures usually last about ten seconds to two minutes. A longer duration of episodes in neonates can also occur during this age. They are shown to occur during the first 28 days of the affected child's life. \n\n【60】#### **9.**删除换行**Is It Possible to Identify Neonatal Seizures?**\n\n【61】It is extremely difficult to identify and diagnose a neonatal seizure. The symptoms of neonatal seizures are not obvious and may even mimic the normal movements of healthy babies. Confirming a neonatal seizure only through an electrical brain recording is possible. The commonly noted movements during a seizure are bicycling, continuous eye deviations, and frequent changes in muscle tone. \n\n【62】#### **10.**删除换行**What Causes Neonatal Seizures?**\n\n【63】Neonatal seizures can occur due to various causes, such as when the affected child has a cerebrovascular accident before or after birth. Other causes are bleeding or dislodged blood clots in the brain. It can also occur when there are brain defects, electrolyte imbalances, infections obtained before birth, or a lack of oxygen to the child during birth. Rarely it may occur due to genetic reasons.\n\n【64】#### **11.**删除换行**What Are the Common Signs and Symptoms of Neonatal Seizures?**\n\n【65】The signs and symptoms of neonatal seizures are difficult to identify. The common signs and symptoms are pedaling movements of the legs, struggling movements, breathing difficulties, and tongue protrusion. The symptoms of clonic seizures are rapid jerking movements of the body. The body, legs, and arms stiffen in tonic seizures. \n\n【66】#### **12.**删除换行**What Is the First Line of Medication in Neonatal Seizures?**\n\n【67】The first medication preferred in neonatal seizures is anti-epileptic drugs, especially phenobarbital. They are generally given at 25 micrograms per milliliter (mg/mL). The second choice of drug is phenytoin at a dosage of 3 mcg/mL (micrograms per millimeter). The affected babies are closely monitored when they are on these medications. These medications may be continued for many months. \n\n【68】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【69】无关删除-1:<u>*   Neonatal Seizure  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554535/\n*   Neonatal Seizures  \n    https://publications.aap.org/neoreviews/article-abstract/13/4/e213/88397/Neonatal-Seizures?redirectedFrom=fulltext?autologincheck=redirected\n*   Neonatal seizures  \n    https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/conditions/neonatal-seizures</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Epiglottitis:**\n\n【180】Epiglottitis refers to the swelling and inflammation of the epiglottis (which acts as a valve to prevent food or drink from entering the windpipe), which results in blocking up the airway. It is potentially a life-threatening condition.\n\n【181】**What Causes Epiglottitis?**\n\n【182】*   The most common bacteria involved is Haemophilus influenzae type B, through infected persons.\n\n【183】*   Streptococcus pneumoniae commonly causes bacterial pneumonia.\n\n【184】*   In addition, viruses that cause shingles and chickenpox, along with respiratory infections, also result in epiglottitis.\n\n【185】*   Fungi, which cause yeast infections, are also responsible for causing inflammation of the epiglottis.\n\n【186】*   Other causes include:\n\n【187】*   Swallowing a foreign object.\n\n【188】*   Inhaling chemicals and smoking crack cocaine.\n\n【189】*   Throat injury due to trauma.\n\n【190】**What Are the Symptoms of Epiglottitis?**\n\n【191】Common symptoms include:\n\n【192】*   Sore throat.\n\n【193】*   A high fever.\n\n【194】*   Hoarse voice.\n\n【195】*   Painful swallowing.\n\n【196】*   Restlessness.\n\n【197】*   Breathing through mouth.\n\n【198】**How to Diagnose Upper Respiratory Tract Infection?**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【199】**1\\. Common Cold:** The presence of rhinovirus infection, coupled with the absence of signs of a bacterial infection or respiratory illness, is sufficient to diagnose the common cold. It is a clinical diagnosis where diagnostic testing is not necessary. In the case of influenza, specimens are obtained as close to symptom onset as possible. Therefore, nasal aspirants and swabs are the best specimens to test.\n\n【200】**2\\. Sinusitis:** Proper medical history and physical examination aid in diagnosis. Sinusitis examination is done on the ears, nose, and throat for swelling, drainage, or blockage. An endoscope (a small lighted optical instrument) to check the inside of the nose. If necessary, computed tomography is recommended.\n\n【201】**3\\. Laryngitis:** A culture is taken in case of exudate in the oropharynx or overlying vocal folds. Direct or indirect laryngoscopy (a method used to view the larynx, including vocal cords) can be taken to view the larynx. Analysis of vocal fold movement to check asymmetry and aperiodicity with reduced mucosal waves and incomplete vibratory closure.\n\n【202】**4\\. Bacterial Pharyngitis:** In bacterial pharyngitis, rapid strep swabs can be used to rule it out.\n\n【203】**5\\. Rhinitis:** In case of any underlying infection, a culture examination is carried out to rule out whether the infection is caused due to bacteria or fungi. If symptoms persist due to severe conditions of the disease, a biopsy is taken to diagnose cancer.\n\n【204】**6\\. Epiglottitis:** A throat examination is carried out using a fiber-optic tube. The throat and blood culture to determine the cause of infection. X- rays of the throat and chest are taken to determine the severity of inflammation and infection.\n\n【205】How to Treat Upper Respiratory Tract Infections?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【206】**1\\. Common Cold:**\n\n【207】Certain drugs and antibiotics can cure common colds.\n\n【208】*   **Decongestants:** Decongestants help to relieve congestion, swelling, and runny nose.

Decongestant nasal sprays (Afrin) can also help.\n\n【209】*   **Analgesics:** Analgesics are used to get relief from pain. Painkillers and antipyretic medicines treat common colds associated with fever and body pain.\n\n【210】*   **Cough Medicines:** Cough suppression medications are used to block the cough reflex. Some may thin and loosen the mucus, making it easier to clear the airways.\n\n【211】*   **Antihistamines:** Antihistamines are drugs used to treat allergic rhinitis, common cold, influenza, and other allergies.\n\n【212】**2\\. Sinusitis:**\n\n【213】Simple sinusitis is treated with :\n\n【214】*   Decongestants - to relieve congestion.\n\n【215】*   Nasal saline irrigation.\n\n【216】*   Drinking fluids.\n\n【217】*   Over-the-counter cold and allergy medications.\n\n【218】If symptoms persist:\n\n【219】*   Antibiotics (seven days in adults and ten days in children).\n\n【220】*   Oral or topical decongestants.\n\n【221】*   Intranasal steroid sprays.\n\n【222】In untreatable cases, surgery is needed to correct structural problems depending on the computed tomography scan results.\n\n【223】**3\\. Pharyngitis:**\n\n【224】In case of strep throat, Amoxicillin and Penicillin are prescribed. It is necessary to complete the entire course of antibiotics to prevent infection from worsening or recurring. The complete course lasts for about seven to ten days.\n\n【225】**4\\. Laryngitis:**\n\n【226】Antibiotics are prescribed for bacterial infections. For chronic laryngitis, antihistamines, pain relievers, and glucocorticoids are prescribed. In the case of vocal cord dysfunction, surgery is indicated. Vocal cord polyp removal is the most common procedure carried out in patients.\n\n【227】Avoiding excess alcohol consumption and quitting smoking are necessary to lower the risk of inflammation.\n\n【228】**5\\. Rhinitis:**\n\n【229】Decongestants may relieve symptoms. Decongestants such as Oxymetazoline and Phenylephrine are used in the form of nasal spray, whereas Pseudoephedrine is taken orally. Antibiotics are not effective in case of acute rhinitis. Antihistamines control runny noses, but some cause drowsiness and some other problems in older people.\n\n【230】**6\\. Epiglottitis:**\n\n【231】Administration of antibiotics is done to treat bacterial infection. In severe cases, a cricothyroidotomy procedure is carried out. This procedure allows air into the lungs while bypassing the larynx.\n\n【232】**Conclusion:**\n\n【233】Upper respiratory tract infections may vary from the common cold to life-threatening illnesses like acute epiglottitis. These infections most commonly occur during the winter season and, if left untreated, can result in serious complications. An interprofessional team approach best manages and helps in achieving positive outcomes. Patients should be encouraged to be at rest, drink ample fluids, quit smoking, and continue with the prescribed medications. A proper diagnosis and timely approach aid in a better prognosis of the condition.\n\n【234】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【235】无关删除-1:<u>*   hopkinsmedicine- URTI  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/upper-respiratory-infection-uri-or-common-cold\n*   clevelandclinic- URTI  \n    https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4022-upper-respiratory-infection.\n*   ncbi  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532961/.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "6ef2160e-a006-4a42-b6fb-d1861188f1fe", "title": "Periodontitis", "text": "【0】What Is Periodontitis?\n----------------------\n\n【1】Periodontitis is one of the most common oral conditions that affect the supporting structures of teeth (periodontium) along with gums, including both soft and hard tissues (bone). They can show many symptoms but the common one for which a patient seeks professional help is mobile teeth.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes?\n--------------------\n\n【3】Periodontitis can be caused by various microorganisms that colonize the plaque (soft deposits on teeth) or calculus (hard deposits on teeth). Hence, the predisposing causative factors include:\n\n【4】*   Improper oral hygiene maintenance including improper brushing methods or habits leads to plaque accumulation, thereby calculus formation, and ultimately recession of gums.\n\n【5】*   The wrong method of toothbrushing can lead to abrasion of teeth but also, the recession of gums.\n\n【6】*   The juvenile or early adolescent variant of periodontitis is mainly because of genetic correlation.\n\n【7】*   An ongoing gingival condition can develop or proceed into affecting the surrounding supporting structures.\n\n【8】*   Any periapical infection caused by a cavity or other causes may proceed to periodontitis.\n\n【9】*   Hormonal changes, smokers, and old age.\n\n【10】*   Nutritional deficiency like vitamin C deficiency.\n\n【11】*   Autoimmune or immune disorders like leukemia (blood cancer).\n\n【12】*   Medications and certain conditions like diabetes (very common).\n\n【13】What Are the Different Types of Periodontitis?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【14】There are various types of periodontitis (periodontal diseases) based on the period of onset or how long the condition prevailed, and its association with various factors as follows:\n\n【15】1. **Chronic periodontitis:**\n\n【16】This indicates that the condition had been there for a long time, that is greater than 15 days to one month, and can be further divided into localized or generalized. If it involves six or fewer teeth, it is called localized, and more than six is called generalized. This can be seen in adults, more commonly.\n\n【17】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【18】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-3:<u>My teeth are wearing away and roots are exposed.What do I do?</u>\n\n【20】无关删除-3:<u>I have yellow stains in my teeth.May I use whitening toothpastes?</u>\n\n【21】My gums are itchy after eating. Please help.\n\n【22】2\\. **Aggressive periodontitis:**\n\n【23】Interestingly, this is seen in teenagers and sometimes young adults and is more severe than any other form as it causes rapid destruction of the tissues. Also, plaque and calculus are not the major causative factor. It is mainly attributed to the defective killing property of neutrophils (WBC). Again, they are further divided into localized (incisors and molars, near circumpubertal age) and generalized (three or more teeth other than first molars and incisors, less than 30 years). It is also called early-onset or juvenile periodontitis.\n\n【24】3\\. **Associated With Systemic Conditions Like Diabetes:**\n\n【25】*   Multiple mobile teeth with bone loss and multiple abscesses can be seen.\n\n【26】*   Necrosed or ulcerated tissue with yellowish-white or grayish slough (necrotizing periodontal disease).\n\n【27】4\\. **Associated With Endodontic Lesions:**\n\n【28】Retrograde infection from tooth apex or root of the tooth reaching the supporting structures of the tooth.\n\n【29】What Is the Difference Between Gingivitis and Periodontitis?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】The difference between gingivitis and periodontitis is that gingivitis affects only the gums that surround the oral cavity and does not affect bone or other attachment and supporting apparatus of the tooth, whereas, periodontitis affects all the supporting and attachment structures including gums and both hard and soft tissues of the tooth. It can be noted that gingivitis may or may not proceed to periodontitis.\n\n【31】What Are the Symptoms?\n----------------------\n\n【32】Healthy gums are pale pink with firm consistency, surrounding the neck of the tooth, and can have some normal brownish-black melanin pigmentation. When periodontitis is present, a person can witness the following symptoms:\n\n【33】*   Gum bleeding and swelling.\n\n【34】*   Halitosis (bad breath).\n\n【35】*   Mobile teeth.\n\n【36】*   Recession (migration of the gums apically).\n\n【37】*   Sensitivity.\n\n【38】*   Gaps between teeth or change in position of teeth.\n\n【39】*   Pain or tenderness while touching the teeth or chewing.\n\n【40】*   Change in the pattern of bite or occlusion.\n\n【41】*   Sometimes, it can be associated with pus discharge.\n\n【42】*   Any black or chalky white hard deposits on teeth (important to notice as this may cause periodontitis in near future or could have caused).\n\n【43】How Is the Condition Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------\n\n【44】A dentist is a trained physician to diagnose and treat this condition. Moreover, the majority of the patients present with bad breath, mobile teeth, sensitivity, stains, and deposits or pain while chewing.\n\n【45】Initially, a detailed history will be recorded of the patient including personal, medical, previous dental, current complaint, and drug histories which will lead to a provisional diagnosis of the condition. Next, the doctor will go for a clinical examination, wherein the status of gums will be checked, and look into symptoms like gum bleeding, the extent of deposits, depth of the gingival sulcus (pocket between gum and root surface of the tooth), along with hard tissues (teeth). For mobility, a fremitus test is also done to check for the causative factor of mobility. If it is due to defective occlusion, it can be corrected by a different treatment modality.\n\n【46】After all, if required, the patient is asked to get an X-ray to check for the extent of bone loss or the presence of any other condition. And, based on all these, the diagnosis is made, and the treatment plan is formatted and carried out.\n\n【47】How Is the Condition Managed?\n-----------------------------\n\n【48】The treatment can be classified into conservative and surgical.\n\n【49】1\\. **Conservative Management:**\n\n【50】Conservative management involves the following:\n\n【51】*   Since it is associated with microbes, oral (in severe cases or with the abscess) and topical antibiotics are prescribed, along with mouthwashes.\n\n【52】*   Scaling and root planing is a very important procedure in which the deposits and stains are manually cleaned by the dentist followed by cleaning and planing the root surfaces.\n\n【53】*   The patient is advised to maintain complete oral hygiene, especially the brushing technique is taught and demonstrated. The modified bass sulcular method is advised for all but patients who have undergone periodontal surgery may follow the charter’s method.\n\n【54】*   For tooth sensitivity, toothpaste can be used to relieve sensitivity until the gums heal or the causative factor (here, recession) is cured by surgery.\n\n【55】*   For tooth mobility, splinting (joining together of teeth with dental material) can be done after correcting deflective occlusion and scaling.\n\n【56】*   Excessively mobile teeth or teeth with poor prognosis can be extracted or removed.\n\n【57】*   Gingival curettage (scraping off of dead, necrosed, or infected gum tissue from the pocket of the tooth) following deep scaling and root planing.\n\n【58】*   Control or treatment of the systemic conditions that had caused it.\n\n【59】2. **Surgical Management:**\n\n【60】The surgical management is done for severe defects and for the tooth that has a better prognosis after the surgery and involves:\n\n【61】**Flap surgery:**\n\n【62】*   The gum tissue is deflected in order to remove the pocket or alter the pocket along with deep scaling so that the attachment of soft tissues can be improved by reattaching the tissue to the same location or altering the placement of the reflected tissue to a new position either apically (towards the apex of the root of the tooth) or coronally (towards the crown of the tooth). This procedure is done under local anesthesia and chairside.\n\n【63】*   For bone loss, bone grafting can be done. If there is excessive bone loss that cannot be treated with a bone graft because of questionable prognosis, reshaping the available bone to mimic the normal structure of bone can be done.\n\n【64】*   Other surgical management procedures can be used based on the condition, which has to be discussed with and decided by the dentist.\n\n【65】*   After the surgery, a gum (gingival) pack is placed on the surgical site for 7 to 10 days to aid in healing and avoid any gum injury or infection\n\n【66】**Follow-ups:**\n\n【67】Once the treatment is done, the patient is recalled for further examination and review in a week and then in a month or six months to one year once based on the severity of the condition. During the follow-up, the oral examination is done and once a satisfactory level of healing is achieved, the next step of treating the other conditions like endodontic (root canal treatment), filling, or replacing the missing or extracted tooth (prosthesis), can be done.\n\n【68】What Are the Complications?\n---------------------------\n\n【69】It should be known that periodontitis is not just a condition affecting the oral cavity but also plays a role in systemic conditions like diabetes. There is an evident relation between these two as one can cause the other. Hence, treating periodontitis is important as it can cause or affect many systemic diseases.\n\n【70】Locally, it can cause a periodontal abscess (collection of pus within periodontal tissues), deflective occlusion, pain while chewing, loss of teeth due to mobility, etc.\n\n【71】What Are the Preventive Measures That Can Be Taken?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【72】It is always better to prevent any condition before it takes up a disease form. To prevent periodontitis, the following things can be done:\n\n【73】*   Maintain oral hygiene and follow proper brushing techniques.\n\n【74】*   Quit smoking.\n\n【75】*   Keep overall health normal.\n\n【76】*   Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.\n\n【77】*   Have a regular dental checkup yearly once at least.\n\n【78】*   When in doubt, consult the dentist.\n\n【79】**Conclusion:**\n\n【80】Since periodontitis is a very common condition, it is necessary to be aware of the same. A minor doubtful change in the oral cavity needs medical attention. Consult a dentist regarding diagnosis, details, and treatment of any conditions affecting the periodontium. The sooner the attention, the more high chances to save the tooth and supporting structures.\n\n【81】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【82】* * *\n\n【83】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Causes of Periodontitis?**\n\n【84】Periodontitis can be caused due to following reasons:  \n\\- Diabetes.  \n\\- Aging.  \n\\- Periodontal problems.  \n\\- Poor oral hygiene.  \n\\- Infections in the oral cavity.\n\n【85】#### **2.**删除换行**What Are the Stages of Periodontal Disease?**\n\n【86】The four stages of periodontal disease are:  \n\\- Stage 1 - Gingival inflammation with the initial lesion.  \n\\- Stage 2 - Gingival inflammation with the early lesion.  \n\\- Stage 3 - Gingival inflammation with the established lesion.  \n\\- Stage 4 - Gingival inflammation with the advanced lesion.\n\n【87】#### **3.**删除换行**What Does Periodontal Disease Look Like?**\n\n【88】Periodontal disease causes the mobility of the tooth. The poor health of the periodontium contributes to the loss of bone. This will result in the tooth, which is unstable. The teeth will have a lot of calculus deposition. It will be accompanied by bad breath.\n\n【89】#### **4.**删除换行**Can I Survive With Periodontal Disease?**\n\n【90】Periodontal disease is common in older people. People usually survive with periodontal disease for a more extended period. It is typically harmless if it has been caused by the age factor alone. If periodontal disease has occurred due to underlying health conditions, then it might be necessary to get treatment for improving the medical condition. If the health issues persist for a long time, then the periodontal disease will become severe.\n\n【91】#### **5.**删除换行**What Are the Ways to Fix Periodontal Disease?**\n\n【92】Periodontal disease can be cured by scaling and root planing procedures. This will provide the first line of treatment. Hand scaling and ultrasonic scaling are two beneficial procedures. In case of severe periodontal infections, surgical procedures are advised for the patient. The patient will be recommended to take antibiotics or antimicrobial medications along with the dental treatment procedure.\n\n【93】#### **6.**删除换行**What Are the Microorganisms That Cause Periodontal Disease?**\n\n【94】The organisms that are known to cause destruction to the periodontal health are:  \n\\- Streptococcal gingivostomatitis.  \n\\- Streptococcus mutans.  \n\\- Streptococcus species.\n\n【95】#### **7.**删除换行**Which Is the Best Mouthwash for Periodontal Disease?**\n\n【96】The best mouthwash for periodontal disease is Chlorhexidine. The mouthwash should be mixed with water before use. After mixing with water, the mouthwash is used for gargling. The gargled water is spitted out. If you have severe periodontal infections, you should ask your dentist to recommend specific mouthwashes. Also, the directions of usage will be guided by the dentist.\n\n【97】#### **8.**删除换行**What Are Some of the Early Warning Signs of Periodontal Disease?**\n\n【98】The early warning signs of periodontal disease are:  \n\\- Red or swollen gums.  \n\\- Bad breath.  \n\\- Painful chewing.  \n\\- Tender or bleeding gums.  \n\\- Loose teeth.  \n\\- Receding gums.  \n\\- Sensitive teeth.\n\n【99】#### **9.**删除换行**Do Periodontal Pockets Heal?**\n\n【100】Most of the periodontal pockets heal by scaling and root planing procedures. In severe cases, it would not heal completely. In such cases, another sitting of the scaling procedure can be attempted. If the bacterial load does not reduce, the surgical treatment option might be required. If the pocket is not healed, then there would be an additional increase in the bacterial load.\n\n【101】#### **10.**删除换行**Will Tooth Extraction Cure Periodontal Disease?**\n\n【102】Extraction can be a solution for a tooth that is shaking. After the removal of the tooth, there would be a missing space. Only the tooth will be removed in the extraction procedure, but the gums will remain. The problems in the gums will not be rectified with the extraction procedure.\n\n【103】#### **11.**删除换行**What Is the Diagnosis Method for Periodontal Disease?**\n\n【104】Diagnosis can be made clinically by a dentist. Initially, the risk assessment of the condition will be made. Then, the health condition of medically compromised patients will be noted. If any blood tests and urine tests are required, the dentist will recommend you to proceed for those tests. In this way, the prognosis of periodontal disease will be identified.\n\n【105】#### **12.**删除换行**How Do You Differentiate Periodontitis From Gingivitis?**\n\n【106】It is possible to differentiate periodontitis and gingivitis by observing a few clinical features and severity of the condition. If there is inflammation only in the gingiva, then the condition is referred to as gingivitis. The most severe form of gingivitis is periodontitis. In periodontitis, there would be extensive bleeding and tooth mobility. The pocket formation will also be noticed in periodontitis.\n\n【107】#### **13.**删除换行**Does Listerine Help Periodontitis?**\n\n【108】Listerine mouthwash is an excellent solution for reducing the bacterial load. It is known to kill the microorganisms in the oral cavity for up to 12 hours. If used after meals, the number of microorganisms will be reduced by rinsing with Listerine mouthwash.\n\n【109】#### **14.**删除换行**Can Periodontitis Be Reversed?**\n\n【110】It is tough to reverse the condition of periodontitis. But, it is possible to reduce the severity and intensity of the bacteria and other microorganisms. Appropriate treatment procedures can reverse the initial stage of periodontitis, which is gingivitis.\n\n【111】#### **15.**删除换行**What Happens If the Periodontal Disease Goes Untreated?**\n\n【112】If the periodontal infection is left untreated, it can lead to health issues and making somebody more susceptible to a range of health conditions, including cancer of the pancreas, kidney, and blood. It is necessary to treat the periodontal condition as soon as possible.\n\n【113】#### **16.**删除换行**Can My Teeth Be Saved If I Have Periodontal Disease?**\n\n【114】Yes, it is entirely possible to save your teeth if you still have periodontal problems. The tooth that is shaking does not necessarily fall off. The advancements of periodontal splints help in maintaining the stability of the teeth.\n\n【115】#### **17.**删除换行**Can Salt Water Rinse Heal Gum Infection?**\n\n【116】Rinsing with a saltwater solution will help you to heal gum infection. To prepare the saltwater solution, dissolve half to one teaspoon of salt in a warm glass of water and gently swish it for 30 seconds. This solution will help to soothe irritated gum tissue and vanish the infection. They will allow your gums to heal.\n\n【117】#### **18.**删除换行**How Long Does It Take for Periodontitis to Develop?**\n\n【118】The time taken for the condition of periodontitis depends on the individual. It can occur as both acute and chronic conditions. The acute type develops rapidly, and the chronic type takes a long time. Aggressive periodontitis occurs in a short time.\n\n【119】#### **19.**删除换行**Can I Kiss Someone With Periodontal Disease?**\n\n【120】At first, periodontal disease is not contagious. It cannot spread through direct contacts like handshakes and hugs. With periodontal disease, the bacteria gets transmitted through kissing. If you kiss for a long time, then there will be vast chances of spreading the infection to your partner.\n\n【121】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【122】无关删除-1:<u>*   Microbiology of Dental Decay and Periodontal Disease  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8259/\n*   Periodontal Disease  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554590/\n*   What is periodontitis?  \n    https://www.efp.org/for-patients/what-is-periodontitis/\n*   Periodontal Disease  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/conditions/periodontal-disease.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "c993fa07-815b-4bf0-9726-3b6e68de8b06", "title": "Bulbar Urethral Stricture - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Bulbar Urethral Stricture - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction:**\n\n【1】The obstruction of the urine flow through the urethra results in urethral strictures. Bulbar meaning bulb-shaped. Depending on the etiology, the urethral strictures are classified as traumatic and non-traumatic. Traumatic injuries are caused due to trauma, whereas non-traumatic injuries are caused by infection. The traumatic strictures result in disruption of the urethra with blockage of the urethral lumen, ending with fibrotic gaps between the urethral ends. In contrast, non-traumatic strictures result in fibrosis of the segment of the urethra involved.\n\n【2】What Is Bulbar Urethral Stricture?\n----------------------------------\n\n【3】Bulbar meaning bulb-shaped. It is a bulb-shaped narrowing of the urethra- that is connected to the bladder. The narrowing of the urethra reduces the flow of urine and makes it more painful to pass the urine. This condition is more common in men due to longer urethra.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes?\n--------------------\n\n【5】*   Injury.\n\n【6】*   Urethral instrumentation.\n\n【7】*   Infection.\n\n【8】*   Non-infectious inflammatory conditions.\n\n【9】*   Congenital abnormality.\n\n【10】*   Malignancy.\n\n【11】*   Idiopathic.\n\n【12】What Are the Signs and Symptoms?\n--------------------------------\n\n【13】*   Weak urinary flow.\n\n【14】*   Splaying of the urinary stream.\n\n【15】*   Frequent urination.\n\n【16】*   Urinary urgency.\n\n【17】*   Straining while urinating.\n\n【18】*   Pain during urination.\n\n【19】*   Prostate infection.\n\n【20】*   Inability to empty the bladder completely.\n\n【21】*   In severe cases, they are unable to urinate.\n\n【22】What Are the Types of Urethral Strictures?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Urethral strictures after blunt trauma are classified into two types:\n\n【24】*   **Pelvic Fracture-Associated Urethral Strictures:** It occurs in fifteen percent of severe pelvic fractures. They are treated with suprapubic tube placement and delayed urethroplasty (surgical repair of the urethral defect) three months later. Instead of suprapubic tube placement, earlier intervention with endoscopic realignment may be used. But the majority of individuals require urethroplasty (surgical repair of the urethral defect).\n\n【25】*   **Blunt Trauma-Associated Urethral Strictures:** Blunt trauma to the perineum results in compression of the bulbar urethra against the pubic symphysis and causes crush injury. These individuals are treated with suprapubic tubes and delayed urethroplasty (surgical repair of the urethral defect).\n\n【26】How to Diagnose?\n----------------\n\n【27】*   The physician asks for thorough medical history that the individual experiences regarding any of the symptoms of urethral strictures.\n\n【28】*   Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and ultrasound are also helpful in detecting urethral strictures.\n\n【29】*   **Cystoscopy -** Endoscopic procedure done with the help of a cystoscope that is carried through the urethra.\n\n【30】*   **Urethrography -** Radiographic procedure that records the integrity of the urethra. It is a retrograde procedure that helps in identifying urethral strictures.\n\n【31】**How to Select an Individual for Surgery?**\n\n【32】The treatment plan depends on the following features:\n\n【33】**Selection of Surgical Technique:** The selection of appropriate surgical technique depends on the individual and stricture features.\n\n【34】**Selection Criteria of an Individual:**\n\n【35】*   **Age:** Older individuals are preferred candidates for end-to-end anastomosis instead of grafting, whereas grafting is a preferred choice for younger individuals.\n\n【36】*   **Body Mass Index:** Obese individuals are not preferred for grafting as it increases the risk of bleeding and sexual dysfunction.\n\n【37】*   **Previous Surgery:** In individuals with a history of previous surgery, the retrograde blood supply to the bulbar urethra is compromised, which causes necrosis (cell death) and results in earlier recurrence.\n\n【38】**Stricture Features:**\n\n【39】*   **Etiology:** Urethral strictures due to blunt trauma require end-to-end anastomosis.\n\n【40】*   **Site:** Urethral strictures in the distal side require grafting as end-to-end anastomosis may cause sexual dysfunction.\n\n【41】*   **Length:** Urethral strictures up to two centimeters are ideal for end-to-end anastomosis.\n\n【42】What Is the Treatment Plan?\n---------------------------\n\n【43】Initial treatment involves widening the urethral tube by cutting the urethral strictures with the help of a cystoscope.\n\n【44】**Dilatation and Urethrotomy:**\n\n【45】*   Urethral dilatation using endoscopic approaches includes- direct vision internal urethrotomy, laser urethrotomy, and self-intermittent dilation.\n\n【46】*   But these approaches worsen the strictures and make it difficult for further surgical repair.\n\n【47】*   Hence, these approaches have a low success rate.\n\n【48】*   From the review, it is found that performing intermittent self-dilation may reduce the recurrence rate after an endoscopic procedure.\n\n【49】**Urethroplasty:**\n\n【50】*   Urethroplasty refers to the open reconstruction of the urethra.\n\n【51】*   This procedure has eighty to ninety-five percent success rates.\n\n【52】*   The success rates depend on clinical factors such as cause, length, and location of the strictures.\n\n【53】*   Urethroplasty can be performed safely for all age groups.\n\n【54】*   For treating bulbar urethral strictures, anastomotic (with or without preserving bulbar arteries and corpus spongiosum) urethroplasty is performed.\n\n【55】*   The replacement is done either with a buccal mucosal graft, full-thickness graft, or split-thickness skin graft and is done in a single visit.\n\n【56】**Urethral Stent:**\n\n【57】*   The use of urethral stents has been banned in recent days.\n\n【58】*   In 1996, a permanent urethral stent was approved for men with bulbar urethral strictures.\n\n【59】*   In Europe, a thermo expandable urethral stent is available for use which is not approved by the United States.\n\n【60】**What to Do in Case of an Emergency?**\n\n【61】When in case of acute urinary retention, emergency treatment is performed. These include the following options.\n\n【62】1.  The first approach is urethral dilatation and catheter placement. This procedure is done in an emergency department or an operating room.\n\n【63】2.  The advantage of this approach is that the urethra remains patentable for a period of time.\n\n【64】3.  The success rates are relatively low.\n\n【65】4.  The second approach is the insertion of a suprapubic catheter with a drainage system. It is done in the emergency department or an operating room. The advantage of this technique is that it does not disrupt the scar and interfere with future definitive surgery.\n\n【66】5.  Following urethroplasty, the individual must be under supervision for a period of one year since the recurrence occurring possibility is higher during this period.\n\n【67】**What Are the Tips and Tricks for Performing Bulbar Urethroplasty?**\n\n【68】**Preparing the Individual for Surgery:**\n\n【69】*   It is suggested that the individual should lie in the simple lithotomy position using the Allen stirrups.\n\n【70】*   This reduces the compression on the popliteal fossa, which causes neuro-muscular problems.\n\n【71】*   The use of inflatable compression sleeves reduces the risk of vascular problems in the legs.\n\n【72】*   Furthermore, they provide relaxation of the muscles of the lower limb.\n\n【73】*   Performing under general anesthesia with controlled blood pressure reduces bleeding during the procedure.\n\n【74】**Preparation of Urethra for Surgery:**\n\n【75】*   It is recommended to insert three French scale guidewires through the urethra to avoid problems during surgery.\n\n【76】*   It also helps in the faster, easier, and safer urethral opening.\n\n【77】**Conclusion:**\n\n【78】Nowadays, it is difficult to choose the exact surgical management for strictures that are not obliterated. Indeed, different surgical techniques have evolved, and none has emerged as the best solution for repair as they have similar success and complication rates.

Several factors, such as the weak immunity of the patient, the need for frequent hospitalization, surgical procedures, or blood transfusion, are contributory factors. Immunocompromised individuals must undergo these procedures frequently in the hospital setting, and the risk of nosocomial infection (hospital-acquired infection) increases fourfold. The most common viral infections in dialysis patients are hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and occasionally HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).\n\n【2】What Is Hepatitis?\n------------------\n\n【3】The word hepatitis stands for inflammation of the liver. Inflammation in the liver can occur for various reasons, such as viruses, alcohol, medications, or certain immunological or genetic conditions. The most prevalent type of hepatitis is hepatitis A, B, and C. Dialysis patients are more likely to get hepatitis B and C. The virus can spread by using multi-dose medicine vials and from contaminated medical equipment. Liver infections caused by hepatitis B and C may result in serious consequences like liver cancer, liver failure, or even death. Hepatitis C cannot be prevented by vaccination, while hepatitis B can be. However, the hepatitis B vaccine should be taken before they become dependent on dialysis.\n\n【4】What Is Dialysis?\n-----------------\n\n【5】In a healthy individual, the kidneys normally filter the blood, eliminating dangerous wastes and extra fluid and converting and excreting it as urine. However, when the kidney stops working, the function of the kidney is compensated by a medical procedure called dialysis.\n\n【6】Dialysis is a technique used to eliminate waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys cease to function normally. It frequently entails redirecting blood to a machine to be cleansed.\n\n【7】Dialysis is a life-saving procedure because when the kidney fails to function normally, the body accumulates waste materials and fluid to dangerous levels. This can result in various unpleasant symptoms and be fatal if left untreated. Dialysis removes these undesirable chemicals and fluids from the blood.\n\n【8】Dialysis is of two types; hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\n\n【9】*   Hemodialysis involves pumping blood from the body into a device that functions as an artificial kidney and then returning the blood to the body through tubes attached to the device.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Is dialysis required for a renal failure patient with a GFR of 13?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Can dialysis be replaced with medicines for treating diabetic kidney patients?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Hepatitis E - Causes, Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【11】*   Peritoneal dialysis uses the patient's abdominal lining as a natural filter. Waste is removed using a cleansing fluid called dialysate and rinsed in and out of the patient's abdomen in cycles. However, what is noteworthy is that of these two types of dialysis, hemodialysis has the greatest risk of causing hepatitis.\n\n【12】How Is Hepatitis Linked to Dialysis?\n------------------------------------\n\n【13】Hemodialysis is regarded as one of the most invasive treatments performed outside an operating room since blood is exposed to the environment directly during filtration. Additionally, even though there is a danger of infection with invasive surgery, hemodialysis patients are at exceptionally high risk. According to some researchers, infections, including hepatitis, are the second most common cause of death in dialysis users. Infections linked to dialysis can develop in various systems, including the bloodstream, bones, lungs, and skin. Patients who contract infections while receiving dialysis can lose their lives, become disabled, require hospitalization, or have long-lasting infections (chronic diseases).\n\n【14】The significant risk of infections among dialysis patients is brought on by numerous circumstances, like the proximity of patients to one another, the rapid turnover of patients between sessions, and the condition of the dialysis recipient. Numerous dialysis patients have other medical issues and impaired immune systems, which increases their vulnerability to infections, particularly when preventive procedures have not been fully adhered to by the dialysis team.\n\n【15】Additionally, contributory factors that are equally crucial to an elevated risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among the hemodialysis patient population are:\n\n【16】*   Inadequate HCV screening.\n\n【17】*   Excessive exposure to blood and blood products.\n\n【18】*   The nosocomial transmission of HCV in hemodialysis units\n\n【19】*   Prolonged dialysis periods.\n\n【20】The hepatitis B virus (HCB) is spread through blood. Research has shown that HD patients have been found to have a higher likelihood of becoming chronic carriers of HBV in addition to having an elevated risk of infection.\n\n【21】Quick Facts Regarding Hepatitis C and Dialysis\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【22】*   Patients receiving hemodialysis infected with hepatitis C (HCV) have higher mortality rates.\n\n【23】*   HCV infection rates in the hemodialysis population vary globally between one percent to more than 70 percent.\n\n【24】*   In the United States, it is 14 percent overall and ten times greater than the general population.\n\n【25】How Can Hepatitis Be Prevented In Dialysis Patients?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】To prevent hepatitis in a dialysis patient, identifying the risk factors that can cause hepatitis is crucial. The factors that can lead to hepatitis are poor healthcare quality in hemodialysis facilities. These include:\n\n【27】*   Contamination of the dialysis machines.\n\n【28】*   Insufficient cleaning and disinfecting of the surroundings.\n\n【29】*   Improper interaction between medical personnel and patients.\n\n【30】*   Equipment.\n\n【31】*   Wrong handling of parenteral drugs.\n\n【32】To prevent hepatitis, the following preventive measures can be taken.\n\n【33】*   All dialysis patients must have the HBV vaccine.\n\n【34】*   To avoid the nosocomial spread of bloodborne pathogens, including hepatitis virus, hemodialysis units should ensure installation and adherence to stringent infection-control protocols.\n\n【35】*   It is recommended that hemodialysis units include regular observational audits of infection-control practices in their performance reviews.\n\n【36】*   Sufficient time should be given between dialysis sessions and machine and surface disinfection.\n\n【37】*   During dialysis, place gloves strategically around the device to allow easy access.\n\n【38】*   When choosing new equipment, it is important to consider disinfection efficiency.\n\n【39】*   Strict adherence to the recommended infection control procedures, ongoing monitoring of HBV markers in hemodialysis patients, immunization of patients and staff, and hepatitis B treatment for those on hemodialysis should be observed.\n\n【40】*   Regardless of prior vaccination, every new patient in a dialysis center must have their HBV markers checked. All patients in the center should undergo routine screenings every three to four months.\n\n【41】*   It is not recommended to isolate HCV-infected individuals or use special equipment for them unless necessary during local outbreaks.\n\n【42】**Conclusion:**\n\n【43】Despite being less frequent, HBV and HCV remain significant sources of health hazards among dialysis patients. With each additional dialysis session, the risk of exposure rises, reaching its peak in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Therefore, countering their spread and lowering the risk of long-term consequences is important.\n\n【44】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【45】* * *\n\n【46】#### **1.**删除换行**Which Hepatitis Develops Due to Dialysis?**\n\n【47】Patients undergoing dialysis are at risk of developing hepatitis B and C. However, hepatitis C is more prevalent in patients undergoing dialysis. Infection with hepatitis B and C can result in adverse complications of liver failure, cancer, and even death. \n\n【48】#### **2.**删除换行**Why Does Hepatitis Occur With Dialysis?**\n\n【49】If the hospital does not follow proper protocols of infection control, then patients have an increased risk of developing hepatitis. The hepatitis virus gets transferred to the dialysis patient by using multi-dose drug vials or contaminated medical equipment.\n\n【50】#### **3.**删除换行**What Is the Main Contributory Factor for Death in Hemodialysis Patients?**\n\n【51】Cardiovascular diseases and infections like hepatitis are said to be the most common cause of death in dialysis patients. In addition, diseases of the circulatory system and diseases of the endocrine, nutritional, metabolic, and genitourinary systems may lead to death among dialysis patients.\n\n【52】#### **4.**删除换行**How Frequent Is Hepatitis in Dialysis Patients?**\n\n【53】The prevalence of hepatitis B virus among hemodialysis patients was 7.3 percent, whereas the hepatitis C prevalence was 3.2 percent. Hepatitis B and C were more common in males between 60 to 80 years of age. The hepatitis C virus has a higher risk for mortality among hemodialysis patients.\n\n【54】#### **5.**删除换行**Why Is the Hepatitis B Vaccine Administered to Hemodialysis Patients?**\n\n【55】Hepatitis B infection causes severe complications in the liver. Hemodialysis patients are more susceptible to the hepatitis B virus since their blood is passed externally for hemodialysis. Therefore, studies recommended kidney patients take four shots of the hepatitis B vaccine before undergoing dialysis.\n\n【56】#### **6.**删除换行**Can Hepatitis Cause Kidney Dysfunction?**\n\n【57】Hepatitis C can cause chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury. It is caused by the formation of immune complexes and cryoglobulins (protein obtained from plasma), along with inducing a direct cytopathic effect (structural changes in cells). Acute kidney injury can develop due to systemic vasculitis (inflammation of arteries and veins) caused by hepatitis C.\n\n【58】#### **7.**删除换行**What Are the Organs Damaged by Hepatitis?**\n\n【59】The liver is most frequently affected by hepatitis due to inflammation. The liver is the most important organ that is essential for processing nutrients, filtering blood, and fighting against infections. When inflammation of the liver develops, its functioning is impacted.\n\n【60】#### **8.**删除换行**Does Dialysis Benefit Damaged Liver?**\n\n【61】Liver dialysis detoxifies the liver in individuals with liver failure. When there is dysfunction of the liver, there is a build-up of toxins like bile and fatty acids within the body due to the failure of the liver to clear toxins. In addition, hemodialysis in liver failure patients can remove ammonia and urea.\n\n【62】#### **9.**删除换行**Can Dialysis Harm the Liver?**\n\n【63】Dialysis does not affect the functioning of the liver. Studies suggest long-term repetitive dialysis can induce stress and reduce tissue perfusion and oxygenation. This can have a detrimental effect on the functioning of various organs, including the liver. \n\n【64】#### **10.**删除换行**What Is the Major Risk Of Dialysis?**\n\n【65】There is an increased risk of developing various infections and sepsis in dialysis. The infections can cause multiple organ failure. Other risks include exacerbation of malnutrition, hypostatic pneumonia (slow-progressing lung disease), falls, cardiac diseases, and venous thromboembolism (blood clots in veins). \n\n【66】#### **11.**删除换行**What Are the Indications to Stop Dialysis?**\n\n【67】When dialysis cannot improve the patient’s quality of life or in patients where the kidney starts functioning normally on its own, the glomerular filtration rate returns to normal. The kidneys start functioning when the underlying cause gets treated. However, abruptly stopping dialysis without proper kidney function can lead to death.\n\n【68】#### **12.**删除换行**What Is the Most Preferred Treatment for Hepatitis?**\n\n【69】Hepatitis is treated with antiviral medications. The most preferred antiviral medications for treating hepatitis B are Entecavir, Tenofovir, Adenofovir, Lamivudine, and Telbivudine, which fight the virus and reduce their ability to damage the liver. The effective therapy for hepatitis C is Pegylated interferon and Ribavirin.\n\n【70】#### **13.**删除换行**Which Hepatitis Can Cause Serious Damage to the Liver?**\n\n【71】Hepatitis C spreads through blood and can cause serious damage to the liver, and is contagious. Hepatitis C induces liver inflammation that causes severe liver damage. Even if the patient is asymptomatic, not treating hepatitis C can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. \n\n【72】#### **14.**删除换行**Does Hepatitis Infection Shorten Lifespan?**\n\n【73】Most patients with chronic hepatitis C can live longer lives if timely intervention is achieved to prevent liver damage. If the condition is left untreated the virus can cause life-threatening damage to the liver. Individuals with hepatitis B can live a long and healthy life with adequate treatment.\n\n【74】#### **15.**删除换行**What Is the Risk of Sudden Death During Dialysis?**\n\n【75】One in four hemodialysis patients may die suddenly. The death occurs twelve hours following the procedure or between the long 72-hour weekend interval between dialysis. Cardiovascular complications are the main cause of death in hemodialysis patients. \n\n【76】#### **16.**删除换行**What Are the Signs of the Last Stage in Dialysis Patients?**\n\n【77】Patients experience various symptoms as the kidney disorder progresses. Signs for the last stage in dialysis patients are fatigue, drowsiness, reduced urination or inability to urinate, itchy and dry skin, weight loss, headache, bone pain, nausea, bruising, and skin or nail changes.\n\n【78】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【79】无关删除-1:<u>*   Viral hepatitis in hemodialysis: An update  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4936461/\n*   Hepatitis C Management and Hemodialysis  \n    https://www.kidney.org/professionals/KDOQI/12-10-1601\n*   Prevention and treatment of hepatitis B in patients on hemodialysis and vaccination of hemodialysis health personnel against hepatitis B  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16381247/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Blood disorders are a group of conditions that affect the components of the blood, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Medical history provides important clues to help diagnose blood disorders, determine their underlying causes, and guide appropriate treatment.\n\n【2】What Are Blood Disorders?\n-------------------------\n\n【3】The whole body’s health may be impacted if the bloodstream is not functioning properly. It is crucial that individuals are aware of some of the prevalent blood problems that might impact them. Blood malignancies and various blood disorders can have an impact on a person. Anemia, bleeding diseases including hemophilia and blood clots, and blood malignancies like leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma are examples of common blood illnesses.\n\n【4】The study of blood in health and illness is known as hematology. It involves issues with the blood arteries, bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, and proteins that control bleeding and clotting, as well as issues with the red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and clotting (hemostasis and thrombosis). A physician who uses this specialized expertise to treat patients with blood disorders is known as a hematologist.\n\n【5】What Are the Reasons Why Medical History Is Important?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】*   **Identifying Risk Factors:** Finding risk factors is a crucial step in managing and avoiding a variety of medical diseases, including blood disorders. The following are a few risk factors for blood disorders:\n\n【7】1.  **Genetics:** Some blood conditions are hereditary, which means that parents can pass them on to their offspring. For instance, thalassemia and sickle cell anemia are more prevalent in specific ethnic groups.\n\n【8】2.  **Age:** As people get older, the chance of developing certain blood conditions rises. Leukemia, for instance, is more prevalent among elderly persons.\n\n【9】3.  **Toxic Exposure:** There is a higher chance of having blood problems if one is exposed to certain chemicals, radiation, or other poisons.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Kindly explain whether fat burner medications interfere with anti-rabies vaccine.</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Are there any other alternative sedatives to opioids that interact less with Valium dose?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Does low weight of fetus lead to early termination of pregnancy?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n4.  **Infection:** Hepatitis B or C, HIV, and the Epstein-Barr virus are a few illnesses that might raise the chance of having blood problems.\n\n【11】5.  **Medication:** Some medicines, such as blood thinners or chemotherapy treatments, might influence the blood and raise the risk of blood problems.\n\n【12】6.  **Chronic Illnesses:** Autoimmune diseases and liver disease are two examples of chronic illnesses that might raise the likelihood of blood problems developing.\n\n【13】7.  **Factors Related to Lifestyle:** Smoking and diets lacking in essential minerals like iron or vitamin B12 might raise the chance of developing blood problems.\n    </u>\n\n【14】*   ****Family History:**** Given that several blood illnesses can be passed down from parents, family history is a significant risk factor for many blood disorders. Blood illnesses that may have a hereditary component include, for instance:\n\n【15】1.  **Hemophilia:** It is a rare hereditary condition that impairs the body's capacity to create blood clots. Typically, it is passed on to male children by the mother.\n\n【16】2.  **Sickle Cell Anemia:** Red blood cells with sickle cell anemia have an abnormal structure that makes them more susceptible to deterioration. Sickle cell anemia is a genetic blood condition. Those of African heritage are more likely to experience it.\n\n【17】3.  **Thalassemia:** The synthesis of hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells that transports oxygen throughout the body, is impacted by thalassemia, a hereditary blood illness.\n\n【18】4.  **Von Willebrand Disease:** A hereditary illness that interferes with the blood's capacity to clot correctly is Von Willebrand’s disease. The most prevalent hereditary bleeding condition is this one.\n\n【19】*   **Medication History:** Examples of drugs that can have an impact on blood include:\n\n【20】1.  **Chemotherapy Medicines:** Although they are frequently used to treat cancer, chemotherapy drugs can raise the risk of anemia, infection, and bleeding while also damaging healthy blood cells.\n\n【21】2.  **Blood Thinners:** Although they are intended to prevent blood clots, blood thinners like Warfarin and Heparin can increase the risk of bleeding.\n\n【22】3.  **Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Medications (NSAIDs):** NSAIDs, including Aspirin or Ibuprofen, can decrease platelet function and raise the risk of bleeding.\n\n【23】4.  **Medications:** Some medications, like Penicillin, can lower white blood cell levels, which raises the possibility of infection.\n\n【24】5.  **Immunosuppressive Medications:** Immunosuppressive medications, including corticosteroids, can weaken the immune system and raise the risk of bleeding and infection.\n\n【25】6.  **Hormonal Birth Control:** Contraceptives containing hormones, such as birth control tablets, might raise the risk of blood clots.\n\n【26】All prescription, over-the-counter, herbal, and vitamin medicines should be disclosed to the patient's healthcare practitioner. With the use of this knowledge, medical professionals may ascertain whether a patient's medication is a factor in their blood problem and create a treatment strategy that takes all drugs into consideration.\n\n【27】*   **Previous Medical History:** The underlying cause of a patient's blood issue may be revealed by examining their prior medical history. Cancer that impacts blood cell formation, for instance, may be indicated by a history of chemotherapy or radiation treatment. An underlying autoimmune or infectious etiology of the blood problem may be indicated by a history of autoimmune diseases or infections.\n\n【28】*   **Environmental and Occupational History**\n\n【29】1.  The evaluation of a patient's exposure to numerous environmental elements, including air and water quality, chemical exposure, and radiation exposure, is known as their environmental history. Patients who reside in locations with high air pollution levels may be more susceptible to respiratory conditions, while those who reside close to hazardous waste sites may be more susceptible to certain malignancies.\n\n【30】2.  On the other side, an occupational history focuses on a patient's work environment and any potential exposure to workplace dangers, including chemicals, radiation, or physical dangers like noise or repetitive activity. It is well recognized that some occupations, such as construction or mining, carry a higher risk of contracting illnesses like lung disease or hearing loss.\n\n【31】3.  Environmental history and occupational history can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing some diseases in addition to identifying potential health hazards. For mesothelioma, a kind of cancer that affects the lining of the lungs, exposure to asbestos at work is a recognized risk factor.\n\n【32】*   **Lifestyle Factors:** Diet and exercise are examples of lifestyle variables that might affect the development and treatment of blood diseases. For instance, an iron-deficient diet can cause anemia, but regular exercise can enhance blood flow and reduce the risk of blood clots. The patient's lifestyle characteristics can assist in pinpointing probable blood disease contributing factors and direct the most effective therapeutic approaches.\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】Medical history is a crucial instrument in the diagnosis and treatment of blood diseases in light of the above. A detailed medical history can help identify the underlying causes of a patient's disease and direct the best course of action. In order to guarantee the safe and successful management of blood diseases, it is crucial for healthcare professionals to get a thorough medical history.\n\n【35】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【36】无关删除-1:<u>*   THE APPROACH TO A PATIENT WITH A BLEEDING DISORDER  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3410146/\n*   Blood Disorders  \n    https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/blood-disorders</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The auditory brainstem response test helps to determine how the cochlea (a snail-shaped organ in the inner ear), brain, and the auditory nerve (hearing nerve) are responding to the sounds. It is also known as brainstem auditory. Usually, the sound heard in the ears is converted from mechanical to electrical signals in the cochlea (a snail-shaped organ in the inner ear), which is further transmitted to the brain by the auditory nerves (the eighth cranial nerves). An auditory brainstem response audiometry test can detect any defects in the hearing pathway. Auditory brainstem response tests are very safe and painless procedures used to measure the thresholds of the nerve fibers in the hearing pathway.\n\n【2】How Is the Auditory Brainstem Response Test Done?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Auditory brainstem response (ABR) tests are safe and painless procedures done by audiologists (specialists in hearing and balance disorders). Audiologists attach an adhesive electrode to the scalp and ears.\n\n【4】**Procedure to Attach Electrodes During the Test:**\n\n【5】*   Even-numbered electrodes are placed on the right side of the scalp, and odd-number electrodes are placed on the left side of the scalp.\n\n【6】*   Positive electrodes are placed on the vertex (highest point on the head).\n\n【7】*   Two electrodes are placed on the right and the left ear lobes.\n\n【8】*   One ground electrode is placed on the lower side of the forehead.\n\n【9】**The Procedure of Sound Induction in the Ears:**\n\n【10】*   A sound is produced by the earphones at 80 to 90 decibels normal hearing levels (dBnHL) for adult patients, and if the patient has hearing loss, it is reduced to 60 to 70 decibels sensational hearing.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I am hearing a strange noise only at night.

It is altered depending on the age (longer in newborns and decreases with age) and stimulation intensity. Different anatomical points and latency (delay) periods for the generation of waves one to five are as follows:\n\n【19】**Wave I**: The wave is generated at the distal part (away from the center) of the auditory nerve (the eighth cranial nerve) and the latency period measures around 1.5 milliseconds.\n\n【20】**Wave II**: This wave is generated in the proximal part (towards the center) of the auditory nerve with a latency period of 2.5 milliseconds.\n\n【21】**Wave III**: Cochlear (part of the inner ear) nucleus and superior olivary complex (brainstem nucleus) is related to this wave having a latency period of 3.5 milliseconds.\n\n【22】**Wave IV**: It is related to the upper olivary complex (brainstem nucleus) and auditory nerve fibers. The latency period is 4.5 milliseconds.\n\n【23】**Wave V**: It is associated with the lateral lemniscus (nerve tract of the brainstem that transfers the sound from the cochlea nucleus to other parts of the brain). The latency period is around 5.5 milliseconds.\n\n【24】*   Wave IV and wave V are affected due to lesions present on the brain stem.\n\n【25】**Wave Amplitude**: It measures the height between the wave peak and depression points of the wave (trough).\n\n【26】How is Peripheral and Central Hearing Loss Assessed?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】**Assessment of Peripheral Hearing Loss:**\n------------------------------------------\n\n【28】*   Due to delayed latency of wave I.\n\n【29】*   Absence of all waveforms.\n\n【30】*   Indicates cochlear defects.\n\n【31】**Assessment of Central Hearing Loss:**\n\n【32】*   The long duration between wave I and wave V.\n\n【33】*   Indicates brainstem defects.\n\n【34】*   Increased latency between wave I to wave III indicates hearing nerve defects.\n\n【35】*   Increased latency between wave III to wave V indicates cochlear nerve (the eighth cranial nerve) defects like neuromas.\n\n【36】*   The absence of waves IV and V indicates lesions affecting the pons (part of the brain).\n\n【37】What Are the Indications for the Auditory Brainstem Response Test?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Indications for auditory brainstem response test are as follows:\n\n【39】*   For diagnosing hearing loss in newborns, children, and adults.\n\n【40】*   To diagnose the effectiveness of artificial hearing aids, cochlear implants (an artificial device placed in the inner ear bones surgically), and bone-anchored hearing aids in patients in vestibular rehabilitation centers (rehabilitation centers for hearing and speech therapies for the patients).\n\n【41】*   Early screening of hearing, speech, and language development in newborns and children.\n\n【42】*   For early diagnosis of the auditory nerve (the eighth cranial nerve) lesions like acoustic neuromas (non-cancerous tumors compressing the nerve connecting the inner ear and the brain).\n\n【43】*   For diagnosing and treating brainstem tumors while doing surgical procedures like intracranial cerebral-pontine angle tumor removal to preserve the auditory nerve (the eighth cranial nerve).\n\n【44】*   For diagnosis of neurological (nerve) disorders like multiple sclerosis (a disease damaging the outer covering of the nerves).\n\n【45】What Is the Preparation Done Before Performing the Auditory Brainstem Response Test?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】*   Auditory brainstem auditory tests are done while sleeping for children younger than six months.\n\n【47】*   This test is usually done only when the child is in a still position or sleeping with their eyes closed.\n\n【48】*   Anesthesia or sedation is used to perform the test on children between six months to seven years old.\n\n【49】*   For children above seven years of age, tests are performed in the hospital (audiology department).\n\n【50】*   The patients undergoing auditory brainstem tests under anesthesia or sedation are advised not to drink and eat six hours before the test.\n\n【51】**Conclusion:**\n\n【52】Auditory brainstem response audiometry tests are one of the most important diagnostic tools used for detecting cancerous or non-cancerous tumors of the brain or hearing nerve tumors, severity or type of hearing loss, and defects related to the inner ear. It helps to detect any defect in the hearing pathway, which is the brainstem's response to the sound transferred from the cochlea (inner ear organ) to the brain through the hearing nerve. ABR (auditory brainstem response test) has served as a boon for the medical field for early diagnosis and screening of newborn babies with suspected hearing loss so that early intervention and management can be done to prevent any delay in speech and language development in the child.\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>*   Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR)  \n    https://www.asha.org/public/hearing/auditory-brainstem-response/\n*   Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) Test  \n    https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/abr-test.html\n*   Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) Evaluation  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/hearing-loss/auditory-brainstem-response-abr-evaluation\n*   Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) with Sedation or Anesthesia  \n    https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/family-resources-education/health-wellness-and-safety-resources/helping-hands/auditory-brainstem-response-with-sedation-or-anesthesia</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Benign mesenchymal tumors frequently occur in the oral cavity and typically present as well-circumscribed lesions (though rarely some lesions may be poorly circumscribed). These lesions tend to exhibit slow growth, persistence, and non-tenderness. Nearly 95 percent of these soft tissue enlargements in the oral cavity are considered for surgical treatment or excision biopsy by oral surgeons.\n\n【2】What Are the Different Types of Oral Benign Tumors?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The different types of oral benign tumors are:\n\n【4】1.  **Irritation Fibroma**: These are common reactive soft tissue lesions or enlargements that occur in response to chronic irritation or traumatic forces on the oral mucosa. These lesions present exophytic, dome-shaped, and firm or compressible masses in the oral cavity. The oral mucosa overlying these lesions may appear normal or frequently ulcerated due to underlying oral trauma. Further, it is very common for these lesions to affect either the buccal (near the cheek) or labial (towards the lip) mucosa in the oral cavity.\n\n【5】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Gallbladder Polyps -Types, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Myxofibromas of the Jaws - Diagnostically Challenging Benign Tumors</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Mesenchymal Hamartoma - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n2.  **Epulis Fissuratum (Inflammatory Fibrous Hyperplasia)**: It is a condition characterized by hyperplasia (increased number of cells) of dense connective tissue in the oral cavity. It is usually caused by chronic oral irritation from denture edges. The enlargement commonly affects the oral vestibule (a space between lips and cheeks) and is characterized by fissures that correspond to the surface of the denture.\n3.  **Peripheral Ossifying Fibroma (Peripheral Fibroma)**: These are reactive soft tissue tumors and are commonly found on the gingiva (gums) or attached alveolar mucosa. They may present as ulcerated lesions with a pinkish-to-red mucosal color. These tumors are most frequently observed in adolescents or young adults. Microscopically, a notable feature is the formation of a mineralized product within the fibrous stroma, which aids in their characteristic diagnosis.\n\n【6】4.  **Schwannoma**: This benign neoplasm affects the Schwann cells (a type of non-neuronal cells). The tumors are not only firm but also encapsulated, exhibiting a freely movable consistency. Recurrence of these tumors is uncommon following surgical excision.\n5.  **Neurofibroma**: These benign neoplasms affecting the Schwann cells are known as neurofibromas. They can occur as solitary lesions. In the case of multiple neurofibromas, they manifest in various areas of the oral cavity. These lesions are typically fixed to the surrounding structures and exhibit a firm or compressible tendency when felt by the dentist.\n\n【7】6.  **Traumatic Neuroma**: These benign tumors are considered to be a reactive proliferation of nerve bundles following nerve amputation. They can occur in cases of traumatic amputation of nerves, particularly in large peripheral nerve-based areas such as the tongue and lower lip. These lesions may cause pain upon palpation. Also, multiple neuromas unassociated with trauma are typically characteristic of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN, inherited endocrine system disorder) type 2B syndrome.\n7.  **Granular Cell Tumor**: These benign neoplasms or tumors are also known as granular cell myoblastomas. The tumor cells originate from Schwann cells. In these tumors, the lesions are attached or fixed to the surrounding local structures, with the most common location being the dorsum of the tongue. Microscopically, these lesions exhibit an extremely infiltrative nature into the surrounding tissues.\n\n【8】8.  **Rhabdomyoma of the Oral Mucosa**: This is a rare benign neoplasm originating from skeletal muscles. These tumors are exclusively located in areas where skeletal muscle is present, with the tongue being a common site. Furthermore, these tumors are fixed to the surrounding structures or local tissues.\n9.  **Congenital Epulis**: This is a benign soft tissue enlargement that primarily affects the attached alveolar mucosa in young infants. Approximately 90 percent of these lesions occur in female infants.\n\n【9】10.  **Peripheral Ossifying Fibroma**: These are reactive soft tissue lesions or enlargements that typically occur on the gingiva or attached alveolar mucosa in the oral cavity. Microscopic evaluation of these tumors reveals giant cells that are identical to those typically found in central giant cell granuloma infections.\n11.  **Pyogenic Granuloma**: These are soft tissue enlargements or reactions that occur in response to minor oral injury or oral mucosal irritation. They can be found on any oral mucosal surface, potentially affecting any age group. However, they are most commonly observed on the gingiva in children and females during pregnancy. Pyogenic granulomas have a characteristic compressible, lobulated, and pedunculated appearance. These lesions frequently present with ulcerations, and their initial growth rate in the oral cavity is quite rapid.\n\n【10】12.  **Lymphangioma**: These are benign developmental overgrowths that occur in the lymphatic vessels and are therefore not true neoplasms. However, they can be quite discomforting as they present on the neck or tongue, leading to difficulties with breastfeeding, eating, and speaking for infants. This condition primarily affects infants below two years of age. The lesions on the tongue are compressible and fixed to the surrounding structures.</u>\n\n【11】What Is the Management of Mesenchymal Lesions/Benign Tumors?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The focus of oral and maxillofacial surgeons is not only to relieve patient discomfort and prevent the potential aggravation of benign tumors but also to establish a long-term successful prognosis to prevent tumor recurrence. Microscopic diagnosis plays a crucial role in differentiating between various types of oral lesions or tumors. The prognosis for benign tumors is usually excellent. However, tumors such as pyogenic granuloma and peripheral ossifying fibroma may have a possibility of recurrence. Therefore, excision biopsy and surgical removal of these benign tumors help in the complete elimination or management of the tumor site. In the case of recurring tumors of mesenchymal origin, the treatment typically involves re-excision. However, treatment approaches may be modified during pregnancy or in cases involving early childhood lesions. Unless the benign tumors cause airway obstruction, it is generally not recommended to treat such lesions in infancy or pregnancy due to the increased risk of hemorrhage in such cases.\n\n【13】**Conclusion**\n\n【14】To conclude, although benign tumors may be asymptomatic, they can still cause patient discomfort and have the potential to progress into severe lesions or neoplasms, especially if the underlying causative factor or trauma is left untreated. Timely diagnosis and surgical management of these tumors can lead to an excellent long-term prognosis for affected patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These pressure differences can lead to certain problems in the ear. This can even happen while driving up a mountain or in any circumstances that can cause an air pressure difference. The condition caused while traveling in an airplane is known as the airplane ear.\n\n【2】What Is Airplane Ear?\n---------------------\n\n【3】The airplane ear, also known as ear barotrauma, barotitis media, or aerotitis media, is the stress of the eardrum that occurs when the air pressure in the environment and the air pressure in the middle ear are not balanced. In normal conditions, the pressure in the middle ear equals the atmospheric pressure. But when the plane is in its descent or while taking off, the rapid change in altitude results in a change in the air pressure in the cabin.\n\n【4】One may feel a blockage or pressure in the ear, which usually goes away once the airplane is landed. However, in some cases, the symptoms can persist beyond that. Self-care tips such as yawning or chewing gums can help to overcome the symptoms of this condition. However, when the symptoms are severe consult a doctor.\n\n【5】What Are the Symptoms of Airplane Ear?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【6】The airplane can affect one or both ears. The symptoms seen in airplane ears are:\n\n【7】*   Discomfort or pain in the ear.\n\n【8】*   Feeling of blockage or stuffiness in the ear.\n\n【9】*   Muffled hearing.\n\n【10】*   Moderate hearing loss.\n\n【11】If an individual has severe airplane ear, then the following symptoms can be seen:\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-3:<u>Is it safe to opt train travel while recovering from a ruptured eardrum?</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-3:<u>Ears feel clogged while in a closed room. Why?</u>\n\n【16】I have a static sound in my ears after I was exposed to a gunshot noise. Kindly advise.\n\n【17】*   Severe ear pain.\n\n【18】*   Increased ear pressure.\n\n【19】*   Severe hearing loss.\n\n【20】*   Tinnitus (constant ringing or buzzing sound in the ear).\n\n【21】*   Vertigo (feeling that the surrounding is spinning).\n\n【22】*   Bleeding from the ear.\n\n【23】How Does a Person Get Airplane Ear?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【24】The tube which connects the middle ear to the back of the throat is called the eustachian tube. The eustachian tube opens and closes when we swallow or yawn, which will help to regularize the air pressure within the middle ear and the surrounding environment. So when there is a change in air pressure rapidly, then the air behind the eardrum will be either less or more than in the environment. This can even affect the sound vibrating through the eardrums well as the hearing bones. So when the airplane takes off or lands, the air pressure difference will result in pressure on the eardrum either from the inside or from the outside, and the person will have pain or discomfort. Also, hearing can be affected.\n\n【25】How Is Airplane Ear Diagnosed?\n------------------------------\n\n【26】These conditions usually get back to normal once the person comes back to the land, and medical intervention is not needed in most cases. However, consult a healthcare provider if the symptoms persist and do not subside. The doctor will examine the ears and may do a hearing test (audiometry) or measure the eardrum pressure (tympanometry).\n\n【27】What Can Be Done to Relieve Symptoms of Airplane Ear?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】One can follow these things in order to help ease the symptoms of airplane ear:\n\n【29】*   **Stay Awake** \\- Do not sleep at the time of take-off or landing of the airplane. This will keep the passenger aware of the changes and react to the same. An individual can divert by listening to music, talking to fellow passengers, or relatives traveling together.\n\n【30】*   **Swallow or Yawn** \\- Try swallowing or yawning when a person starts to experience discomfort. This will help the eustachian tube to open. When the eustachian tube is open, it will help to regularize the pressure difference. For babies, feeding them or giving them a pacifier at the time of take-off and descent will help to ease out the airplane ear as they will be swallowing.\n\n【31】*   **Blowing Nose** \\- Blow the nose gently to alleviate the pressure.\n\n【32】*   **Blowing Air Through the Nose** \\- Keeping the mouth closed and nose pinched, and blow out air. This will help more air to pass into the eustachian tube.\n\n【33】*   **Decongestants** \\- Take decongestants if suffering from nasal congestion from cold or allergies.\n\n【34】*   **Ear Plugs** \\- This will help to regulate pressure within the ears.\n\n【35】*   **Chewing Gums** \\- Chewing gums will help to open up the eustachian tube and help to regularize the pressure.\n\n【36】*   **Reconsider the Travel Plans** \\- Postpone the travel plan when there is a cold, sinus infection, nasal congestion, or ear infection, if possible.\n\n【37】What Are the Complications Associated With Airplane Ear?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】The airplane ear is usually not associated with any complication, but in rare instances can cause complications like a ruptured eardrum, where the patient will have a sudden event that goes away suddenly. The perforated eardrum heals on its own and does not require medical attention. However, seek medical help if an individual experiences the following symptoms with a perforated eardrum:\n\n【39】*   Hearing loss.\n\n【40】*   Tinnitus (ringing sound in the ear).\n\n【41】*   Discharge from the ears.\n\n【42】*   Vertigo (a feeling of surrounding spinning).\n\n【43】What Are the Risk Factors?\n--------------------------\n\n【44】The conditions that can block the eustachian tube or affect its functioning can be a risk factor. The common risks are:\n\n【45】*   Small eustachian tubes like in infants and toddlers.\n\n【46】*   Common cold.\n\n【47】*   Sinusitis.\n\n【48】*   Allergic rhinitis.\n\n【49】*   Middle ear infections.\n\n【50】**Conclusion**\n\n【51】Flying in an airplane can cause some trouble to the ear, which will be corrected once the person gets back to land. There is no need to be worried about this condition. This is very commonly seen in anyone who travels via airways, but the intensity of the symptoms might vary from person to person; for some, the symptoms will be unnoticeable, while for some, it can be irritating. There are several ways in order to prevent as well as manage the symptoms, which will help the persons traveling via airplane. Staying awake, using earplugs, chewing gums, and consuming decongestants are some of the options that will help in relieving the pain.\n\n【52】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【53】* * *\n\n【54】#### **1.**删除换行**How to Rule Out Inner Ear Barotrauma?**\n\n【55】A personal and physical history can help rule out inner ear barotrauma. This includes ear examinations, hearing tests, tests for ear balance, and other auditory tests. Physical examination is done using an otoscope. An otoscope is a specially lighted instrument to help providers look for damage in the eardrum, infections, or other problems.\n\n【56】#### **2.**删除换行**How Long Does Airplane Ear Last?**\n\n【57】The airplane ear is caused by the accumulation of fluid or mucous in the middle ear during a flight. This is usually caused by the variation in the atmospheric pressure during the flight. It can last for a few minutes to a few days. \n\n【58】#### **3.**删除换行**What Type of Hearing Loss Is the Result of Damage to the Inner Ear?**\n\n【59】The damage to the hair cells in the inner ear is called Sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL). Damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve or the brain's central processing centers can also cause the condition. It is an unexplained, rapid hearing loss, all at once or over a few days. \n\n【60】#### **4.**删除换行**How Loud Sounds Damage the Ear?**\n\n【61】Sudden exposure to loud noise and continuous exposure to loud noises can cause hearing loss. It causes damage to the cells in the cochlea. Hearing loud noises for long durations causes the hair cells in the ear to overwork, causing them to die faster.\n\n【62】#### **5.**删除换行**Can Barotrauma Cause Hearing Loss?**\n\n【63】The damage caused to the ear due to the difference in pressure between the inside and outside parts of the ear is called barotrauma. It can be a cause of pain and hearing loss that can be permanent. Pressure difference that is sudden and severe can cause damage to the tympanic membrane, causing bleeding and hearing loss.\n\n【64】#### **6.**删除换行**What Does the Medical Term Aerotitis Media Mean?**\n\n【65】Acute inflammation in the middle ear due to the pressure variation in the middle ear space and the airplane cabin is called aerotitis media. It is becoming more common as more people are involved in travel. It is usually temporary and gets better fast.\n\n【66】#### **7.**删除换行**How Do You Treat Ear Barotrauma at Home?**\n\n【67】Chewing gum or candy while traveling on flights can help to prevent the condition. Drinking water frequently can also help. Swallow saliva if nothing is available.

They are of different types, namely,\n\n【2】*   Whiteheads or closed comedones.\n\n【3】*   Blackheads or open comedones.\n\n【4】*   Solar comedones.\n\n【5】*   Microcomedones.\n\n【6】*   Macrocomedones.\n\n【7】*   Giant comedones.\n\n【8】What Are Whiteheads or Closed Comedones?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【9】The hair follicles are a tunnel-like structure that gets the shape of a bump when filled with a plug. A single bump is called comedo, while a group of bumps is called comedones. Closed comedones are formed when the underlying hair follicles are closed by a plug formed by oil or dead skin cells. These closed comedones most commonly occur on the face, neck, chest, and back. Closed comedones appear white or yellow in color and are rightly called whiteheads.\n\n【10】In Whom Are Whiteheads Prevalent?\n---------------------------------\n\n【11】Although most commonly seen in adolescents, closed comedones can occur among people of all groups. In a few cases, individuals might get whiteheads only after they become adults. It has been reported that almost every individual develops whiteheads at some point in their life.\n\n【12】Where Do Whiteheads Most Commonly Occur?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【13】Since closed comedones are formed due to the trapping of dead skin cells and oil inside the hair follicle, it can occur anywhere in the body where sebaceous glands are present.\n\n【14】However, closed comedones most commonly occur in the following areas:\n\n【15】*   Face - Nose, forehead, cheeks, chin, and around the lips.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What are the best ways to control acne?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Top 10 Questions on Acne</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Adult Acne: A Common Problem</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Upper arms.\n\n【17】*   Neck.\n\n【18】*   Chest.\n\n【19】*   Back.\n\n【20】*   In rare cases, it can also be seen in the scalp, ears, thighs, armpits, butt, and genitals.\n    </u>\n\n【21】How Are Blackheads Different From Whiteheads?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Both blackheads and whiteheads are types of comedonal acne; the difference is that blackheads are open comedones and whiteheads are closed comedones. Blackheads appear like dark spots on the skin, while whiteheads appear white or yellow in color. The appearance of blackheads might seem like they contain trapped dirt, but that is not the case. The color is only due to irregular light reflection. In whiteheads, the formed oil plug is not exposed to air, so it does not appear black or brown like open comedones.\n\n【23】What Causes Whiteheads?\n-----------------------\n\n【24】The formation of closed comedones has been attributed to the inflammation of sebaceous glands or hair follicles. Sebaceous glands are located close to the skin, producing sebum, an oily substance that hydrates the hair and skin. Most of these sebaceous glands are connected with a hair follicle. Inflammation of the hair follicle or sebaceous gland can occur due to any of the following:\n\n【25】*   Abnormal Keratin Formation - Keratin is a protein needed to grow and repair hair, nails, and skin.\n\n【26】*   Raised sebum production.\n\n【27】*   Presence of an increased number of acne-producing bacteria.\n\n【28】In addition to this, specific makeup and hair care products might also aggravate the formation of closed comedones. Using oily creams and lotions can clog the hair follicles, resulting in the formation of closed comedones.\n\n【29】How Are Whiteheads Manifested?\n------------------------------\n\n【30】As they are only a mild form of acne, closed comedones usually do not exhibit any symptoms except for slight pain in some cases. The presence of white or yellow bumps on the skin is the characteristic feature of closed comedones.\n\n【31】What Is the Effect of Whiteheads?\n---------------------------------\n\n【32】Whiteheads are not a severe condition that affects the physical health of an individual. But the effect it brings on the appearance has a mental and psychosocial impact.\n\n【33】Can Closed Comedones Spread From One Person to Another?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Closed comedones are not caused by any microorganism and, therefore, not contagious; that is, they cannot be spread from one person to another.\n\n【35】How Can We Identify Whiteheads?\n-------------------------------\n\n【36】Since whiteheads or closed comedones are easily recognizable, visual examination is all that is needed to identify them. Even without the help of a healthcare professional, it can be identified. However, a dermatologist's assistance should be sought when it occurs with severe acne.\n\n【37】How Can We Treat Whiteheads?\n----------------------------\n\n【38】The following methods can treat whiteheads that appear on the face:\n\n【39】**A. Over-the-Counter Medications:**\n\n【40】1.  **Salicylic Acid -** It acts by dissolving the dead skin cells that clog the pores and removing the affected skin layer. These are available in the form of cleansers or lotions. These should be used for a period of at least eight weeks to have the maximum effect.\n\n【41】**B. Prescription Medications:**\n\n【42】When over-the-counter medications are not helpful, prescription medications can be taken with advice from a dermatologist. The following are the prescriptions medicines most commonly suggested:\n\n【43】1.  **Benzoyl Peroxide -** It helps treat whiteheads by removing the bacteria which aggravates the formation of acne. An important side-effect of using Benzoyl peroxide is irritation; however, lower concentrations do not produce much skin irritation. Washes or face-on gel are the available forms.\n\n【44】2.  **Azelaic Acid -** A naturally found acid in wheat, rye, and barley called Azelaic acid, helps remove the bacteria and decrease swelling.\n\n【45】3.  **Retinoids -** Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that prevent the clogging of pores, which is evident by the peeling or color change in the skin.\n\n【46】4.  **Oral Contraceptives -** In women, taking oral contraceptive pills along with the above topical treatment has been proved to have an additive effect.\n\n【47】**C. Other Treatment Methods:**\n\n【48】1.  **Microdermabrasion -** In this method, the superficial layer of the skin is removed to unclog the pores. This is usually done with the help of a specialized pump.\n\n【49】2.  **Laser Skin Resurfacing -** In cases where there is excess sebum production, laser skin resurfacing is advised. During this procedure, short, concentrated, pulsating light beams are targeted on the whiteheads, which reduces the amount of sebum produced.\n\n【50】3.  **Chemical Peels -** In some cases, a mild chemical is used to peel off the top layer of skin, thus treating whiteheads.\n\n【51】What Should I Do to Manage Whiteheads?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【52】*   Do not touch or squeeze the whiteheads.\n\n【53】*   Clean the items like helmets, pillow covers, cell phones, sunglasses, clothes, etc. that come in contact with your face.\n\n【54】*   Be cautious while shaving in areas where whiteheads are present.\n\n【55】What Should I Do to Prevent Whiteheads?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【56】*   Use a mild cleanser and warm water to wash your face.\n\n【57】*   Do use non-comedogenic makeup products.\n\n【58】*   Always use a moisturizer.\n\n【59】*   Do not forget to remove the makeup before going to bed.\n\n【60】*   Take frequent hair baths.\n\n【61】*   Do not touch your face often.\n\n【62】*   Make sure the hair care products do not contact your face.\n\n【63】Can I Squeeze My Whiteheads?\n----------------------------\n\n【64】It is not advisable to squeeze the whiteheads for the following reasons:\n\n【65】*   There can be a scar formation.\n\n【66】*   Bacteria can enter the whiteheads and bring about an infection.\n\n【67】*   Skin irritation can occur.\n\n【68】**Conclusion:**\n\n【69】Whiteheads or closed comedones are a widely prevalent, less severe condition. However, they can have a severe toll on the mental health of the affected individual. Therefore, it is advisable to reach out to a dermatologist and get the earliest treatment when it occurs.\n\n【70】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【71】* * *\n\n【72】#### **1.**删除换行**How Do You Get Rid of Closed Comedones?**\n\n【73】Closed comedones or clogged pores can be treated with the help of over-the-counter products like salicylic acid or glycolic acid. In severe cases, your dermatologist might prescribe some medications for treating clogged pores, or blemish extraction procedures can also treat clogged pores.\n\n【74】#### **2.**删除换行**Can We Squeeze Closed Comedones?**\n\n【75】Closed comedones are similar to blackheads. However, they have a small opening that connects them to the skin, and professional guidance might be required to squeeze the closed comedones out of the skin.\n\n【76】#### **3.**删除换行**How Long Does a Closed Comedo Last in Our Skin?**\n\n【77】A closed comedo can last for between a week to three weeks. However, in some, it can last for more than three weeks and might require professional treatments and medications to cure.\n\n【78】#### **4.**删除换行**Why Do Some People Have More Closed Comedones?**\n\n【79】Closed comedones are common and are seen more among pre-teenagers and teenagers, as sebaceous glands produce excess amounts of oil during these years of life. Also, if you notice that you get more closed comedones constantly, you might have a type of acne problem called comedonal acne.\n\n【80】#### **5.**删除换行**Is It Compulsory to Have Treatments for Curing Closed Comedones? Or Do They Go Away on Their Own?**\n\n【81】Treatment requirements depend upon the severity of closed comedones you have. Most cases do not require any treatment. However, some severe issues with the constant and increased number of closed comedones need dermatologists’ help.\n\n【82】#### **6.**删除换行**How to Stop the Formation of Closed Comedones?**\n\n【83】Having an appropriate skincare regime can help avoid the formation of closed comedones.

This leads to the development of psychiatric illnesses, like depression and anxiety. Stress is an important factor in the etiology of various psychocutaneous disorders; it can be environmental, physical, or psychological factors. A few skin conditions with psychiatric illness are discussed here for further understanding.\n\n【2】What Is the Association Between Skin and Psychology?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】We have to agree that the skin is the largest organ. This enormous site gives possibilities to get affected at various places of the skin. Healthy and glowing skin provides a higher level of confidence and charm. But, when the mental stability of a person is known to get disturbed, then they might lose interest in dressing themselves up well. Also, in severe cases, they might engage in different abnormal habits that can be disastrous both for the physical and mental health. The surrounding family members are also affected because of the poor and unhealthy habits.\n\n【4】The association between psychology and dermatology is studied in detail in psychodermatology. It is a recent advancing branch. Psoriasis, acne, and eczema that are caused due to psychological issues are discussed in this field of psychology. Medical reports suggest that people who are overstressed are more likely to be affected by such psychological conditions. Surveys also show that the anxiety and depression level was very high in patients who suffer from skin problems due to psychological issues.\n\n【5】What Is Delusional Parasitosis?\n-------------------------------\n\n【6】Delusional parasitosis is primarily a psychiatric disorder. These patients had a false belief that they are already infested with some parasite that brings them with bits of skin scales, lint, and other specimens to prove their existence. Any imbalance in the chemical secretions in the brain can result in delusional parasitosis. Usage of cocaine can also cause this condition. In this disorder, patients have a preoccupation with an imagined defect in appearances, such as thinning of hairs, large nose, small genitals and breast, excessive greasiness of the face, and persistent burning sensation in the face. In all such patients, an interview is required with the treating psychiatrist to know the depth of illness and treat accordingly with antipsychotic medicine.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】Stress in a Broad Perspective - More Than Merely a Mental Illness!!\n\n【10】Can anxiety and stress cause frequent urination?\n\n【11】My husband behaves weirdly in the bedroom. What is wrong with him?\n\n【12】What Is Dermatitis Artefacta?\n-----------------------------\n\n【13】It is primarily a psychiatric illness, but the patient will be reported to the dermatologist.\n\n【14】The dermatitis artefacta patients will be presented with various types of bizarre skin lesions, with sharp geometric borders surrounded by normal skin mainly involved in the self-approachable areas of the body, and these lesions do not mimic other dermatoses.\n\n【15】These lesions may be done unconsciously (in the dissociated state) or consciously (for satisfying some unconscious needs). The supportive approach is necessary, which includes avoiding direct discussion of the self-inflicting nature of the lesions. If the patient is explained about their behavior also, they tend to deny it. Most patients improve after stressful life events are over. Relaxation exercise may be helpful and dermatological treatment is symptomatic only. Topical corticosteroids might be necessary for overcoming the condition. If the cause is known to be depression, then antidepressants might be necessary. A multidisciplinary approach might be needed for overcoming this condition.\n\n【16】How Is Neurotic Excoriation Associated With Skin Disorders?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Neurotic excoriation results from a repetitive and compulsive desire to pick, scratch, or rub the skin. In this condition, the patient is aware of the activity but unable to stop this. Unlike dermatitis artefacta, neurotic excoriation can be expressed as a symptom of depression. Stress is the leading cause of neurotic excoriation. This habit of picking and scratching is known to provide a certain degree of psychological satisfaction in the individual. They can do it knowingly or unknowingly, and this habit becomes their routine. They are not worried about the inferior expression they might create among the others in public. Dermatological treatment is symptomatic only.\n\n【18】Why Is Dermatitis Artefacta Associated With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Dermatitis artefacta is considered an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Obsessive condition is the one in which the individual experiences repetitive thoughts to perform a particular activity or think about a specific thought. This is often seen along with compulsions faced by the individual to do a specific normal or abnormal behavior. The abnormal behavior can be identified in the initial stages itself, whereas the compulsive behavior will take a very long time to be identified. Here, the patient with dermatitis artefacta tries to continue their scratching behavior in response to the compulsive thoughts in mind.\n\n【20】What Is Trichotillomania?\n-------------------------\n\n【21】Trichotillomania is a condition in which the person has to urge to pull out their hair in a mild or aggressive manner due to the obsessive thoughts they have. They often do this as a self-harm behavior. Most of the patients affected by this condition have poor self-esteem and are known to avoid any social setup.\n\n【22】What Is Munchausen Syndrome?\n----------------------------\n\n【23】Patients with this illness are notorious hospital hoppers. They present with a dramatic and false story of illness in successive visits to hospitals and OPD (outpatient department). This is also known as a factitious disorder. Even though an actual health issue does not exist with the patient, they create a false notion that they are sick. Poor self-esteem and childhood abuse is the main cause. In other cases, it is difficult to identify the reason for the occurrence of this syndrome. Patients with Munchausen syndrome are known to be good attention seekers.\n\n【24】**Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy:**\n\n【25】This is usually seen in pediatric practice, where the illness is fabricated by the mother. It is also seen in dependent persons like the old and the handicapped, where the illness is fabricated by their caretaker to get rid of them. This proxy disorder is noted in the father also.\n\n【26】These illnesses stress the fact that only treating dermatological illness is not sufficient in all skin diseases. We must read and understand the psyche and needs of the patient before giving some treatment.\n\n【27】Temporary conditions of these psychological problems do not require any special treatment options. In order to overcome the skin disorder, the psychiatric issues should be resolved first. Psychotherapy treatment is often recommended along with medications.\n\n【28】You can also contact icliniq.com.\n\n【29】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【30】* * *\n\n【31】#### **1.**删除换行**Can Skin Problems Be Caused by Emotional Stress?**\n\n【32】Stress, such as emotional stress, can aggravate skin issues. Stress can also worsen skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, and rosacea. In certain cases of acute stress, conditions such as skin rashes and blisters may be caused.\n\n【33】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is Meant by the Mind-Skin Connection?**\n\n【34】Mind-skin connection is a psychological theory that relates the mind and the skin.

It helps to understand the disease entity and determine the treatment protocol. Medical imaging is one of the most advanced methods for visualizing tissues in detail. Among all the imaging methods, ultrasound is the most commonly used. Because of its non-invasive nature and economic cost, it is very popular among medical professionals. Certain physical and mechanical rules must be followed for a good ultrasound image.\n\n【2】Most importantly, the accurate orientation of the transducer tip and its closeness to the anatomical structure is necessary for proper imaging. In certain gynecological cases, the transvaginal approach is preferred for imaging pelvic organs. Detailed knowledge of this approach is necessary for proper imaging.\n\n【3】What Is the Ultrasound in Gynecology?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【4】Gynecological ultrasound or gynecological sonography is a non-invasive technique. In this procedure, ultrasound sound waves are projected toward the organs through a transducer. These soundwaves bounce off the organs like an echo and are captured by the transducer, which then processes these data from an image of the object. The most commonly used method for ultrasound in gynecology is the trans-abdominal approach. This method is very useful for imaging the abdominal structure. Pelvic structures are viewed through the anterior abdominal wall in this method. As a result, several errors may happen. These are:\n\n【5】*   As the distance between the transducer and the pelvic region increases, a lower frequency must be used to minimize image distortion.\n\n【6】*   The beam degrading effect of the anterior abdominal wall, specifically in obese patients, distorts the images.\n\n【7】The transvaginal approach for ultrasound was first introduced in 1985. This method reduces the distance between the probe and the pelvic structures, allowing the use of higher frequency for better image quality.\n\n【8】Who Are Eligible for This Process?\n----------------------------------\n\n【9】Any woman above the age of sixteen is eligible for this procedure. Also, this technique can be used for transgender men, transgender women, and people who identify as asexual, intersex or non-binary person.\n\n【10】What Are the Indications?\n-------------------------\n\n【11】Indications for the use of transvaginal ultrasound are:\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【14】Vesicovaginal Fistulas - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【15】What are the different tests available to detect PCOS?\n\n【16】Is it possible that I got pregnant with only foreplay and no intercourse?\n\n【17】**Evaluation of Pregnancy:**\n\n【18】Various stages and types of pregnancy can be evaluated in this method.\n\n【19】1.  **Fetal Evaluation**: Baby’s various physical structures, like the heart, head, and spine, are evaluated in this method. Any physical anomalies can be detected at this stage.\n\n【20】2.  **Nature of Pregnancy**: The nature of pregnancy, whether intrauterine (normal pregnancy) or ectopic pregnancy (fertilized egg is implanted outside the main cavity of the uterus).\n\n【21】3.  **Abortive Process**: The success of abortion is evaluated in this technique.\n\n【22】**Infertility:**\n\n【23】Baseline screening of the pelvic structures, their anatomy, the thickness of the lining, and the presence of any anomalies are identified in the technique. Follicular assessment and its monitoring (stages of maturation of the follicles) can be done through this process. A saline infusion sonogram is employed in trans vaginal technique to access the uterine cavity three-dimensionally.\n\n【24】*   **Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**\n\n【25】This is the first liner of an imaging method for the detection of uterine bleeding both in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Structural causes of the bleeding, like polyps (small limp of cells), adenomyosis (increase in the thickness of the uterus), leiomyomas (a group of benign smooth muscle tumors), and hyperplasia can be identified by this technique.\n\n【26】*   **Presence of Infection**\n\n【27】Transvaginal sonography is used to detect pelvic inflammatory disease (infection of the upper reproductive system, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries).\n\n【28】*   **Examination of Non - Gynecologic Entities**\n\n【29】Non-gynecological structures like the urinary bladder, urethra, and distal-most portion of the uterus are examined by this process. Pathological conditions like urethral diverticula (formation of unwanted pockets in the urethra), periurethral masses, and funneling of the urethra can be diagnosed by this method.\n\n【30】What Is the Procedure?\n----------------------\n\n【31】The procedure for this technique can be divided into three parts:\n\n【32】**Equipment:**\n\n【33】The machinery used for this procedure includes:\n\n【34】*   Ultrasound machine with a transvaginal ultrasound probe (Transducer, the frequency of the transducer is 5 to 7.5 MHz with an effective range of 7 to 10 centimeters).\n\n【35】*   Ultrasound gel.\n\n【36】*   Probe cover.\n\n【37】*   Table for proper positioning of the patient.\n\n【38】The technician will perform transvaginal ultrasonography, and after completion, the sonography images are uploaded into the PACS ( Picture archiving and communication system) for analysis.\n\n【39】**Patient Preparation:**\n\n【40】Before starting the procedure, patients should be explained about the process, and written consent must be taken. For juvenile patients, parents' consent should be taken. A female attendant must be present in the examination, and patients’ dignity must be maintained. A full bladder is recommended for this procedure as it can displace the adjacent bowel loops. Patients are asked to undress from the waist and cover themselves with a gown. For examination purposes, patients are placed in the lithotomy position (supine position of the body when the patient is face-up, arms to the sides, but the legs are separated and raised).\n\n【41】**Scanning Procedure:**\n\n【42】The probe is covered with a latex condom to prevent contamination, and coupling gel should be placed inside the tip of the condom. The transvaginal transducer should be inserted into the lower vaginal canal under direct vision, with the transducer marker at the 12 o’clock position. To minimize discomfort, the transducer is pointed slightly downward towards the rectum while gently advancing into the vaginal canal. The probe is placed in the distal vagina or against the external cervical wall. The scanning procedure includes:\n\n【43】*   For the sagittal scanning probe is moved in side to side direction.\n\n【44】*   The transducer is moved in 90-degree angulation for the transverse and semi-coronal orientation.\n\n【45】*   The transducer penetration should be changed for different structures to bring them within the field of view/focal zone.\n\n【46】What Are the Contraindications?\n-------------------------------\n\n【47】The contraindications regarding transvaginal ultrasound include:\n\n【48】*   Pediatric patients.\n\n【49】*   Recent vaginal surgery.\n\n【50】*   Premature rupture of the placenta during pregnancy.\n\n【51】*   Bleeding is associated with conditions like placenta previa (the placenta covers all the parts of the baby’s exit).\n\n【52】*   Imperforated hymen.\n\n【53】What Are the Shortcomings?\n--------------------------\n\n【54】The complications associated with this procedure are very minimal. Mild pain, discomfort, or rupture in the vaginal wall can be observed. One of the limitations of this procedure is the viewing field is limited. That is why it is often followed by transabdominal ultrasonography.\n\n【55】**Conclusion:**\n\n【56】The traditional transabdominal approach is not sufficient for imaging the pelvic structures. Transvaginal ultrasound provides better visualization of the female genital organs. It also helps in the observation of the fetus and urinary tract. Moreover, because of its non-invasive nature and better resolution. It is gaining popularity. Proper patient motivation and communication before the procedure are essential for a successful outcome.\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>*   Routine gynecological ultrasound: look at the bladder and the ureters!  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162668/\n*   Transvaginal Ultrasound for the Diagnosis of Abnormal Uterine Bleeding  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28005589/\n*   Sonography Gynecology Infertility Assessment, Protocols, And Interpretation  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572093/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Within that, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a talk intervention therapy to give recognition to negative thoughts and associated behavior patterns. In contrast, mindfulness is the practice of bettering oneself. Certain medical researchers thought of inventing CBT with Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, the MBSR approach of 1979, to bring about change. Hence, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy came into evolution with a mindful ideology.\n\n【2】What Is Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】As the name reveals, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a psychological intervention that chiefly includes CBT and mindfulness techniques with related strategies. It helps achieve a state of consciousness or knowledge of ourselves and our emotions. As a result, people gain an overall thoughtfulness and sensitivity to the current environment, whether internal or external.\n\n【4】How Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Works?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】MBCT relies on cognitive behavioral therapy, whether the talk intervention or teaching on depression and its cons. So, it works by the following mechanisms.\n\n【6】*   Besides, when a person’s depression after time gets revised to distress, this aids an automatic cognitive process inducing a depressive episode. MBCT helps eliminate this automatic theme. In addition, it guides one to have no concern about triggers and helps in accepting them without self-judgment.\n\n【7】*   Depression is all about low mood and related symptoms. Depression, in many instances, develops negative thoughts and beliefs, which is the bitterest part. These views, in turn, take off happiness resulting in fear and exhaustion. By educating a person to see themselves as distinct from their thoughts, MBCT paved the way for abolishing negative memories.\n\n【8】*   The depressive patient feels relief when disconnecting the self from emotions during the intervention. And so, he avoids further enduring thoughts. In contrast, even when one induces such negative thoughts, he would attempt to resolve them by transforming to positive ones.\n\n【9】What Includes in the Mindfulness-Based Intervention?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The mindfulness-based cognitive approach is a group intervention complete with eight sessions for eight succeeding weeks. The weekly session takes two hours to enumerate mindfulness and allows several homework assignments. However, the approach gives many mindfulness-allied works amidst the session. Supplementally, the intervention has a long-span session at the end of the fourth week.\n\n【11】****Techniques:****\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【14】Female Sexual Arousal Disorder: Break the Shackles and Seek Help!!\n\n【15】Mindfulness-Based Interventions in Pregnant Population - An Overview\n\n【16】Does having a social disorder that inhibits free expression in group settings cause depression?\n\n【17】However, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is based upon the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy; MBCT also allies with several mindfulness techniques to make the person more engaged with relaxation.\n\n【18】*   **Three-Minute Breathing Space:** Daily implementing three-minute breathing exercises with appropriate inhales and exhales.\n\n【19】*   **Body Scan Exercise:** It is lying down and taking deep breaths. Then, slowly bring attention towards the feet and gradually follow other parts. This will eventually scan the entire body. Hence, exercise is preferred largely for stress relief.\n\n【20】*   **Meditation****:** By breathing and focusing on a particular object or thought, one can meditate with mindfulness. Meditation involves self-organization or guidance, providing attention and awareness of the body and thoughts. Practicing regularly gains sound mental health and an emotionally stable man.\n\n【21】*   **Mindful Exercises:** Mindfulness practice is a kind of meditation with an emphasis on the present circumstances. Here, the person senses the feeling and other stuff of the environment still without judgment. The practices comprise some exercises in relieving distress that can be employed daily. These include; mindful breathing, concentration, releasing tension, walking meditation, attention to the body, and guided imagery.\n\n【22】*   **Mindfulness Stretching:** Stretching with proper breathing manners and mindfulness is good mindfulness stretching. Inhaling and exhaling along the stretches elicit relaxation and concentration of muscles, breathing, and emotions.\n\n【23】*   **Yoga:** Physical, mental, and spiritual practices all come together to unite in yoga. Therefore, it promotes power, stability, and flexibility. MBCT embraces specific yoga poses carrying mindfulness.\n\n【24】Where Can Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Be Applied?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】MBCT largely provides awareness of ourselves and our feelings and thoughts rather than turning them. It articulates guidance on paying attention and concentration without any interpretation or judgment. Hence, MBCT is beneficial in the following illnesses and scenarios.\n\n【26】*   Major depressive disorder (MDD).\n\n【27】*   Depression is allied with other mental conditions.\n\n【28】*   Anxiety.\n\n【29】*   Stress.\n\n【30】*   Chronic pain.\n\n【31】*   Bipolar disorder.\n\n【32】*   In combination with antidepressant medication.\n\n【33】*   Treatment-resistant depression.\n\n【34】*   Relapses of depression.\n\n【35】*   Eating disorders.\n\n【36】*   Psychotic conditions.\n\n【37】*   Lack of happiness.\n\n【38】*   As adjunctive therapy provokes welfare in people with cancer, diabetes, and epilepsy.\n\n【39】What Is the Impact of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】People are conquering their self-allied themes and feelings after the intervention. Most people say they have a good impact on overall mental health, hitting satisfactory well-being wholly from a harmful life. They exhibit more awareness and confidence than those who didn’t take the therapy. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in adjuvant with or without another approach educates how to know and accept the issue instead of relieving it. Also, to do with mental health, the therapy offers an overall ideology of the partition of the true self and true and false beliefs. MBCT can provide relaxation and stress relief.\n\n【41】How Effective Is Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】The mindfulness-based intervention seems to highlight other interventions in one such way, serving not further yield automatic cognition, a trigger of depression. This equates to the effectiveness of MBCT.\n\n【43】*   Medical researchers conducted a meta-analysis in Denmark and proved that MBCT is adequate and suitable against major depressive disorder relapsing.\n\n【44】*   MBCT is as effective as antidepressant sustenance for recurring depression, as per the article published in Lancet.\n\n【45】*   Scientific studies verified that MBCT reduces about 50 percent of the chances of relapse in recurrent depression patients.\n\n【46】*   One study estimated and provided the measure of distress, stress, anxiety, exhaustion, compassion, and soundness is thus improved.\n\n【47】*   Eventually, researchers also stated that MBCT alleviates the carving of certain substance addictions.\n\n【48】With the above conveyed points, the mindfulness-based approach has multiple pros, yet its effectiveness has been proven with pieces of evidence. However, having said that MBCT has a limitation on those effects sustaining for the long-term. However, a supplemental study is required to elaborate on the impact of MBCT on eating disorders and psychotic conditions.\n\n【49】**Conclusion:**\n\n【50】Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is a psychological intervention that chiefly includes CBT and mindfulness techniques with related strategies. Any psychotherapy has its unique theme and serves the best and is most effective once engaged wisely and accordingly. MBCT is ideal and responsible for caution or care regarding the accessible challenges and dangers. If one notice our close ones facing depression or have a negative belief about life, it is best to have a doctor consultation as early as possible.\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>*   Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy: theory and practice  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22340145/\n*   Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Anxiety and Depression  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5679245/\n*   Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for Primary Care Patients  \n    https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03272516</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Dementia is an impairment in cognitive function caused by various underlying diseases or conditions like Alzheimer's disease.\n\n【2】Depression is a constant sadness that affects a person's day-to-day activities. Both are commonly noted in the older age group of 60 years and above. However, studies show that people with preexisting psychiatric disorders have an alleviated degree of symptoms as the brain ages.\n\n【3】Dementia and depression have similar clinical symptoms, but utterly different treatment approaches; hence it is essential to diagnose them carefully. Some patients might have both. Treatment for depression is more promising than treatment for dementia. The physiological functions of all the vital organs in the body, including the brain, peak in their thirties and then start to decrease in their sixties to about 60 % to 80 %. A decrease in the brain's weight is also noted at 60 years of age and above. Old age is the most common period for developing disorders like dementia and depression.\n\n【4】How to Differentiate Between Dementia and Depression?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Elderly patients are at a greater risk of developing disorders and other medical comorbidities that add to cognitive and mood-related changes. It is challenging to differentiate and diagnose these two disorders. The following are the different ways used to distinguish between the two.\n\n【6】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【7】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>My father has dementia and pulled out a Foley catheter.

This baseline will help the physician notice any changes and act upon them.\n\n【12】*   Observing the patient very carefully and enquiring about the patient from his friend, family, or staff from assisted facilities where the patient resides will help in telling us about their cognitive and functional behavior, which might otherwise be missed.\n\n【13】*   Patients suffering from depression are more likely to bring their problems to their doctor's attention, whereas patients with dementia might be unaware of them. In addition, certain patients should be screened for pseudodementia, where patients suffer cognitive impairment along with depression.\n\n【14】*   Early stages of dementia can easily be neglected as they correspond to the signs of aging. Still, clinical signs to diagnose dementia a doctor would be missed appointments, inability to follow given instructions, poor hygiene, and grooming.\n\n【15】*   Depression can be diagnosed as a more chronic low-mood state with or without cognitive impairment.\n\n【16】*   The onset duration for depression is weeks to months, whereas, for dementia, it is months to years.\n\n【17】*   The mood is always low in depression and fluctuates in dementia.\n\n【18】*   Depression is chronic and responds to treatment, but dementia is chronic and deteriorates over time.\n\n【19】How to Treat Depression and Dementia?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【20】**1\\. Treating Depression in Patients With Dementia:** Depression can worsen the problem of dementia, whereas treating depression can improve functional levels in dementia.\n\n【21】*   **Non-pharmacological Approach:** Interventions targeting the patients and caregivers are essential. Arranging a daycare for the patients and engaging them in different social and interactive activities. Educating the caregivers about the various caregiving skills.\n\n【22】*   **Pharmacological Approach:** After starting the non-pharmacological approach, it is essential to start pharmacological treatment. This involves starting the patient on antidepressant medications like Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Paroxetine, Citalopram, Escitalopram, Venlafaxine, Bupropion, Mirtazapine, Nortriptyline, Methylphenidate, Duloxetine. Initially, they are started on a low dose and titrated slowly. Treatment response can be seen in eight to 12 weeks.\n\n【23】**2\\. Treating Depression in Patients With Dementia:** Dementia is a slowly progressing disorder that has no complete cure. Still, we can slow the disease's progress and reduce the severity of symptoms by medications and starting specific therapies. The medications for dementia are Cholinesterase inhibitors (Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Galantamine). The brain has a chemical called acetylcholine which helps send signals to certain types of nerve cells. In patients with dementia, these chemical-acetylcholine levels are decreasing, and the loss of nerve cells is increasing. Cholinesterase inhibitors prevent the enzyme cholinesterase from breaking down this important messenger chemical of the brain (acetylcholine). These medications have proven to improve symptoms of dementia-like improvement in the patient's memory and daily activities like bathing, eating, and hygiene.\n\n【24】**3\\. Psychological Therapies for Dementia:** This offers additional support to the patient and their families apart from medications.\n\n【25】**4\\. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy:** This therapy aims at organizing daily and weekly group activities for the patients. It also plans an exercise routine for the patient. This helps patients with mild to moderate dementia and helps improve the patient’s problem-solving skills, memory, communication, etc. They often have unique themes for their activities and are conducted twice weekly or as recommended. The activities can include crosswords, puzzles, drawing, and music.\n\n【26】**5\\. Behavioral Therapy for Dementia:** In this therapy, it is crucial to understand the source of the behavior and suggest alternatives to eliminate the source. For example, the standard behavior of the patient can be, wandering outside the house due to restlessness; this can be addressed by resolving the patient’s restlessness by keeping him engaged in other activities like gardening, exercising, or anything of the patient’s interest. Family members should always inform the medical team about their parent’s behavioral changes.\n\n【27】**6\\. Treating for Depression:** Depression alone can be treated with the antidepressants mentioned above; patients can join social help groups for the elderly fighting depression. They can take one on one counseling sessions regularly with a psychologist. There is always an underlying cause leading to depression in older people as they would have gone through or will be going through a lot in life. The underlying cause should be dealt with, and support from friends and family will help such patients to recover sooner.\n\n【28】**Conclusion:**\n\n【29】Various studies show that depression is more commonly seen in patients with dementia than in those who do not have this condition. In addition, studies reveal that men are more prone to developing these disorders than women. Depression and dementia are widely seen in low-income and middle-income older adults. In such situations, accurate diagnosis and immediate treatment are crucial.\n\n【30】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>*   What Are the Treatments for Dementia?  \n    https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/dementia-treatments-overview\n*   Differentiating among Depression, Delirium, and Dementia in Elderly Patients  \n    https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/differentiating-among-depression-delirium-and-dementia-elderly-patients/2008-06\n*   Depression is linked to dementia in older adults  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29023080/#:~:text=Depression%20and%20dementia%20are%20both,of%20patients%20with%20vascular%20dementia</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The tears or lacerations extend from the perineum to the anus (or rectum) and include the muscles responsible for opening and closing the anus. It can often lead to morbidities like wound breakdown or perineal pain, loss of bowel control, and sexual dysfunction in women.\n\n【2】What Are the Primary Risk Factors for Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The risk factors for obstetric anal sphincter injuries are as follows-\n\n【4】*   First vaginal delivery.\n\n【5】*   Heavy baby.\n\n【6】*   Fetal distress or post-delivery.\n\n【7】*   A persistent occipito-posterior position during delivery.\n\n【8】*   Prolonged labor.\n\n【9】*   Shoulder dystocia (when one or both shoulders of the baby get stuck during vaginal delivery).\n\n【10】*   Midline episiotomy (incision made from the middle of the vaginal toward the anus).\n\n【11】*   An instrumental vaginal delivery.\n\n【12】*   Mother has weak tissue or short perineum.\n\n【13】*   Infibulation.\n\n【14】*   Maternal diabetes.\n\n【15】*   Waterbirth.\n\n【16】What Are the Symptoms of Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Obstetric anal sphincter injuries can significantly impact women by impairing their quality of life. The following symptoms can be noticed after an OASIS injury -\n\n【18】*   Perineal pain.\n\n【19】*   Edema and bruising due to tight sutures, infection, or wound breakdown.\n\n【20】*   Urinary retention and defecation problems in the postpartum period.\n\n【21】*   Dyspareunia (genital pain before, during, or after sexual intercourse).\n\n【22】*   Altered sexual function.\n\n【23】*   In severe cases - abscess formation wound breakdown, and rectovaginal fistulae formation.\n\n【24】*   Anal incontinence and anorectal symptoms.\n\n【25】How Are Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries Classified?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Perineal tears that occur commonly during vaginal birth are graded based on severity as-\n\n【27】**1\\. Grade 1** \\- Injury to perineal skin only.\n\n【28】**2\\. Grade 2** - Injury to the perineum involving perineal muscles (not the anal sphincter).\n\n【29】**3\\. Grade 3** (through external anal sphincter muscle).\n\n【30】*   **3a** - Less than 50 % of external anal sphincter thickness torn.\n\n【31】*   **3b** - More than 50 % of external anal sphincter thickness torn.\n\n【32】*   **3c** - Both external and internal anal sphincter torn.\n\n【33】**4\\. Grade 4** - Injury to the perineum involving the anal sphincter complex and anal epithelium.\n\n【34】The first-grade and second-grade injuries usually do not require any intense reparative surgery. Instead, the doctors can simply suture the area on the delivery table. As a result, the healing and postoperative outcomes are primarily good.\n\n【35】The third-grade and fourth-grade perineal tears are obstetric anal sphincter injuries. They are more severe injuries and require reparative surgery.\n\n【36】How to Prevent Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】During delivery, sometimes it becomes impossible to avoid obstetric anal sphincter injuries due to the circumstances, but the following measures can be taken to prevent obstetric anal sphincter injuries-\n\n【38】*   **Head Control** - Slowing down the delivery of the head and using only the uterine expulsive efforts.\n\n【39】*   **Perineal Support** - Application of warm compresses to the perineum and intrapartum perineal massage.\n\n【40】*   Delivery position.\n\n【41】*   **Episiotomy** - Restricted use of episiotomy is preferable in women having a spontaneous vaginal delivery.\n\n【42】*   **Other Factors** \\- Antepartum perineal massage, pushing position, open versus closed glottis pushing, Ritgen’s maneuver, water birth, and delayed pushing (in women with epidural) do not show any protective effect on the anal canal.\n\n【43】*   Commencing perineal massage from 35 weeks of the pregnancy.\n\n【44】What Is the Management of Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】*   In the delivery or operating room, obstetric anal sphincter injuries repairs are carried out in the delivery room or the operating room.\n\n【46】*   It can be commonly repaired under local anesthetic, general or regional anesthesia.\n\n【47】*   **Sutures** - After analyzing the severity, location, and depth of injury, stitches are placed by the doctors to repair the tear. Sutures can be absorbable as well as non-absorbabe.\n\n【48】*   **Repair of the Anal Mucosa** - The mucosal repair can be carried out with an interrupted vicryl suture or continuous submucosal suture.\n\n【49】*   **Repair of the External and Internal Anal Sphincters** \\- Suturing is done by either end-to-end repair or overlap repair techniques. The procedure is also known as sphincteroplasty (sphincter repair).\n\n【50】*   Women with anal incontinence following OASIS should be referred for pelvic floor physiotherapy.\n\n【51】What to Expect After Repair of Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】*   **Prophylactic Antibiotics** - After the procedure, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics to prevent infections and postpartum perineal wound complications. Second-generation Cephalosporins are usually prescribed.\n\n【53】*   **Postoperative Bowel Regimen** - It varies from patient to patient. It consists of laxatives and bulking agents to avoid constipation and any damage to the repaired tissues from the passage of hard stool. The bowel motions in the immediate postoperative period may threaten the integrity of the repair, so bowel confinement techniques are used.\n\n【54】*   **Postoperative Analgesia** - To relieve perineal pain due to trauma. As Opioids have a constipating effect, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) in conjunction with Acetaminophen are preferred.\n\n【55】*   **Bladder Catheterization** - Perineal trauma and postpartum urinary retention are closely associated.\n\n【56】Is It Possible to Have a Normal Vaginal Delivery After Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【57】Experiencing an obstetric anal sphincter injury during one delivery does not imply that it will happen again during future deliveries. After a successful repair surgery of obstetrical anal sphincter injuries, most women can safely deliver the baby vaginally in a future pregnancy. However, the doctor may suggest a cesarean section (C-section) delivery to prevent future obstetric anal sphincter injuries.\n\n【58】**Conclusion**\n\n【59】Obstetric anal sphincter injuries are a significant cause of morbidity after vaginal delivery. Few measures can be taken during delivery to diminish the risk of occurrence. Careful examination after every delivery is vital to avoid missing an obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS). A close follow-up should be scheduled after the systematic repair of the entire anal sphincter complex. Most women following OASIS can have a vaginal delivery. Post-delivery evaluation of symptoms and anal function testing can help guide the choice of a future mode of delivery.\n\n【60】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【61】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH - Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26637088/\n*   Diagnosis and Treatment of Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries: New Evidence and Perspectives  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8347477/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Thick bands of connective tissues surround these joints, forming a capsule, and a thin membrane that lines the undersurface of the joint capsule is called the synovium. It produces a fluid called synovial fluid, which helps in the lubrication of the joint.\n\n【2】What Is Synovial Osteochondromatosis?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【3】Synovial osteochondromatosis is also called synovial chondromatosis; it is a rare non-cancerous (benign) condition that involves the synovium. It can affect any joint in the body but commonly occurs in the knee joint, followed by the hip, elbow, and shoulder joints. It may also affect the temporomandibular joint or the ankle. Due to the abnormal growth of the synovium during the disease, it produces nodules, which break off from the synovium, become loose bodies, and roll in the joint space. These loose bodies get calcified or ossified, and the condition is called synovial osteochondromatosis. It causes severe pain, may damage the cartilage, and also lead to osteoarthritis (a condition in which the joints become inflamed due to damage to the cartilage). It affects people between 30 and 50 years, and males are affected up to four times more than females. In some rare cases, the loose chondral bodies may appear as extra-articular lesions (outside the joint capsule), which usually occurs in synovial lined bursal tissue or tenosynovium and is called tenosynovial chondromatosis or bursal chondromatosis. It is usually seen in the fifth decade of life and rarely affects children and individuals below the age of 20 years.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Synovial Osteochondromatosis?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Synovial osteochondromatosis is of two types; primary and secondary.\n\n【6】1.  **Primary Synovial Osteochondromatosis:** It is a monoarticular disorder, and the cause of the same is unknown. It is also called Reichel syndrome, as it was first described by German surgeon Friedrich Reichel in the year 1900. It is the formation of new chondrocytes and their proliferation. Primary synovial osteochondromatosis can be distinguished into three stages:\n\n【7】*   **Phase I:** Inflammation of the synovium (synovitis) without the loose bodies.\n\n【8】*   **Phase II:** Nodular synovitis, along with the loose bodies.\n\n【9】*   **Phase III:** The presence of loose bodies with the resolution of synovitis.\n\n【10】1.  **Secondary Synovial Osteochondromatosis:** It results from mechanical changes in the joint due to arthropathy (joint disease) or denotes loose chondral bodies that occur secondary to joint pathology like trauma, infections, osteoarthritis, etc. The articular nodules ossify frequently and are large and vary in size, compared to the primary form in which the nodules are small and uniform in size.\n\n【11】What Are the Causes of Synovial Osteochondromatosis?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The cause of synovial osteochondromatosis is unknown; it is not inherited (not genetic) but may occur spontaneously. However, bone morphogenic protein, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin - 6 are found to be elevated in the loose fragments and joints of the affected people. The loose bodies vary in number and may even combine to form large bodies. These loose bodies result in pathological and mechanical wear of the joint, leading to the erosion of the joint surface, and the condition is hence classified as a benign neoplastic lesion.\n\n【13】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Synovial Osteochondromatosis?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Some of the signs and symptoms of synovial osteochondromatosis include:\n\n【15】*   Pain and swelling of the affected joint.\n\n【16】*   Locking or catching sensation in the joint.\n\n【17】*   Pain increases on weight bearing and is also present during rest.\n\n【18】*   Tenderness and stiffness of the joint.\n\n【19】*   Increase in joint effusion (accumulation of fluid in the joint) with increased activity.\n\n【20】*   Difficulty in the movement of the joint.\n\n【21】*   Nodules are felt at the joints that are close to the skin.\n\n【22】How Is Synovial Osteochondromatosis Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【23】It is required to diagnose and treat synovial osteochondromatosis as early as possible to relieve pain and prevent the progression of the condition. Synovial osteochondromatosis can be diagnosed with a medical history and physical examination followed by a radiological evaluation. The patient usually presents with pain in the joint; swelling may also be present in some cases, and the joint is tender and swollen on palpation. Radiological evaluation helps differentiate primary and secondary types and synovial osteochondromatosis from osteoarthritis.\n\n【24】*   **X-ray:** It reveals the presence of loose bodies in the joint space; the number and size can also be determined. Small bodies may not be visible in an X-ray and require an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. If no pathology is present, it may be diagnosed as primary synovial osteochondromatosis.\n\n【25】*   **Other Tests:** Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an MRI arthrography (use of contrast material during the MRI scan), or computed tomography (CT Scan) is recommended for an accurate diagnosis, as small loose bodies may not be visible under an X-ray. It also helps to diagnose the signs of osteoarthritis and the presence of tissue fluid in the joint space.\n\n【26】How Is Synovial Osteochondromatosis Managed?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【27】*   The management of synovial osteochondromatosis depends on the symptoms of the condition; sometimes, the doctor may consider observation with periodic monitoring of the disease progression as an option. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are prescribed to relieve pain and inflammation. Administration of corticosteroid injections into the joint space may be sometimes preferred.\n\n【28】*   In advanced cases with nodular synovitis, the presence of large loose bodies, or those developing neurological symptoms, and restricted joint movements due to degenerative changes, surgical intervention may be necessary. The two surgical methods include open surgery and arthroscopic surgery. The surgical technique depends on the number and size of the loose bodies, along with the condition of the synovium. However, arthroscopic surgery has been favored recently, as the incisions are smaller and it causes less pain and scarring than open surgery. The main objective is to remove the loose bodies, along with partial or complete removal of the synovium (synovectomy).\n\n【29】*   Arthroscopic surgery involves the induction of general anesthesia and the application of tourniquets. Small incisions are made at the site; a tiny camera is inserted through one opening, and surgical instruments are inserted through the other. The camera displays the condition of the disease on the monitor, following which the loose bodies are removed with the help of arthroscopic graspers, and the excision is performed with shavers and graspers. The area is irrigated and cleaned, and the loose bodies are sent for histopathological examination. The instruments are withdrawn, and the surgical site is then sutured with non-absorbable sutures. A sterile dressing is done, followed by immobilization of the joint, and pain relief medications are prescribed.\n\n【30】*   Post-surgical instructions include the application of ice for three to seven days, following which sutures are removed, and sterile bandages are placed. Physiotherapy is advised to achieve a full range of motion in around four to eight weeks.\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】Synovial osteochondromatosis is a rare, benign condition affecting the synovium of the joints, especially the knee joint, and is characterized by severe pain, swelling, and difficulty in movement. It occurs due to abnormal growth of the synovium, forming nodules, which break off and result in the formation of loose bodies that harden by calcification. Treatment depends on the symptoms and severity of the disease, and initial phases are managed by nonsurgical treatment, and severe cases are managed by arthroscopic surgery followed by physiotherapy.\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>*   Arthroscopic Management of Synovial Osteochondromatosis of the Elbow  \n    https://www.arthroscopytechniques.org/article/S2212-6287(20)30398-4/fulltext#relatedArticles\n*   Synovial Chondromatosis  \n    https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/synovial-chondromatosis/\n*   Synovial Chondromatosis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470463/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Some patients, apparently asymptomatic, keep testing positive long after recovering. Such patients are in a dilemma if they should end their quarantine and come out, or if they are still capable of infecting others.\n\n【2】The other most confusing topic is reinfection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There have been reports of COVID-19 recovered patients testing positive and showing symptoms again. This has resulted in a lot of questions about immunity and antibodies against this new Coronavirus. But, most health authorities state that reinfection is not possible in the first three months after recovery. Then why do so many patients keep testing positive?\n\n【3】With the scarcity of COVID-19 testing, not everyone who initially tests positive receives follow-up testing. And according to CDC guidelines (United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), isolation is ended based on how the patient feels after ten days of onset of symptoms and not on retesting. And there is still confusion about what a positive follow-up test means.\n\n【4】What Are the Current Guidelines for Isolation of COVID-19 Patients?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】As of January 2022, these are the updated guidelines given by CDC:\n\n【6】*   COVID-19 patients with a mild illness: 10 days of isolation.\n\n【7】*   People who are critically ill (needing hospitalization, intensive care, or mechanical ventilation): It may be necessary to extend the period of isolation and precautions to at least ten days and up to 20 days after the onset of symptoms, as well as after the fever has subsided (without the use of fever-reducing medication) and symptoms have improved.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    COVID-19 and Lupus</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Coronavirus (COVID-19) - Awareness and Prevention</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Coronavirus and Homeopathy</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   People who are immunocompromised, whether mildly or severely, may have a longer infectious period: Extend the period of isolation to at least 20 days (day zero is the first day of symptoms or a positive viral test). To identify the optimum duration of isolation and precautions, use a test-based strategy and confer with an infectious disease specialist.\n\n【9】*   Recovering patients include: Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 can have detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory specimens for up to 3 months after the onset of disease. Replication-competent viruses have not been reliably collected from these patients and thus are unlikely to be infectious.\n    </u>\n\n【10】Should Recovered COVID-19 Patients Get Retested Before Ending Isolation?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】According to the CDC, isolation can be ended if a patient do not have any symptoms, and it has been ten days since the onset or if a patient did not have a fever in the last 24 hours without using medicines. The point to be noted is that loss of smell and taste might last for several months and will not influence the end of isolation. A negative test is not required to be around others for most people. If the doctor asks a patient to get tested again to see if they are still infectious, please repeat the test.\n\n【12】These recommendations do not apply to people with severe COVID-19 or extremely weak immune systems.\n\n【13】When Can Immunocompromised or Severely Ill COVID-19 Patients Be Around Others?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Recovered immunocompromised or critically ill COVID-19 patients might have to stay home in isolation for up to 20 days. Such patients might have to get retested before their isolation ends.\n\n【15】What Is Known So Far About COVID-19 Reinfection?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】To date, this is not enough information available that supports reinfection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Data do show that people who have recovered from COVID-19 may harbor low levels of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in their bodies for as long as three months after diagnosis. So, some recovered people will continue to test positive the next three months even if they do not necessarily transmit the infection to others.\n\n【17】Cases with COVID-19 reinfection are present but are rare. More research is needed. This is why the CDC advises recovered patients with new symptoms to get evaluated for reinfection. If a person develop influenza-like symptoms after recovering from COVID-19, make sure they isolate themselves and consult the doctor for the possible causes and if retesting is needed.\n\n【18】**Findings That Do Not Support Reinfection:**\n\n【19】1.  The concentrations of the Coronavirus reduce significantly in the nasal cavity and throat after the onset of symptoms.\n\n【20】2.  The capacity of the virus to replicate decreases after the onset of symptoms. In mild to moderately sick COVID-19 patients, viruses capable of replicating and spreading have not been recovered after ten days following the start of symptoms. Only in some severely ill and immunocompromised individuals, viruses capable of replicating have been documented between 10 and 20 days after the onset of the symptoms.\n\n【21】3.  One study demonstrated that people with a positive contact did not get infected if the exposure to the infected person started 6 days or more after the person's illness onset.\n\n【22】4.  A study conducted by CDC in Korea, where 285 patients who persistently tested positive, including 126 patients that again developed COVID-19 symptoms, showed that they did not infect their 790 contacts. And scientists were unable to isolate replication-competent viruses (viruses that can replicate) from 108 of these patients.\n\n【23】**Current Findings That Might Indicate Reinfection:**\n\n【24】1.  In a study conducted on workers of a nursing facility to see the future of asymptomatic patients, 1 out of the 48 staff members showed a positive result more than 20 days after the primary diagnosis.\n\n【25】2.  In another reported case, a mildly infected patient tested positive for replication-competent virus around the 18th day after symptom onset.\n\n【26】3.  Also, experts suggest that reinfection is possible within one or two years of initial infection if proper COVID management measures such as vaccination, masks, and social distancing are not followed.\n\n【27】4.  The immunity offered by COVID is short-lived, and failing to get vaccinated can cause reinfections even within months of initial exposure.\n\n【28】After Recovering, Are COVID-19 Patients Immune?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【29】When a virus attacks the body's cells, the immune system gets activated, which sends cells to fight the virus off. These immune cells also send signals to warn other cells by releasing proteins called interferons. Interferons signal neighboring cells to prepare to fight the virus off. But the SARS-CoV-2 virus blocks these interferons. So, the immune system gets activated, but the cells in the body do not become defensive. So the virus keeps replicating in the cells of the lungs and goes deeper.\n\n【30】As the immune system gets activated, it does produce antibodies against the virus, and survivors of COVID-19 did show high levels of antibodies to the virus. However, some people showed very low levels of antibodies in their blood. So, recovered COVID patients cannot be considered immune, and more studies have to be conducted to determine immunity to reinfection by this virus, even up to 3 months of infection.\n\n【31】How Long Do COVID-19 Antibodies Last?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【32】A United Kingdom study found that immunity against COVID-19 could decline within months. Almost 60 % of the patients in the study demonstrated a potent antibody response; only 17 % retained the same levels of antibodies three months later. And in some cases, it became completely undetectable. This means people can still get reinfected during seasonal waves of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and it is possible that vaccines may not provide long-term protection.\n\n【33】Why Do Some COVID-19 Patients Continuously Test Positive After Recovery?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】In some recovered patients, the detection of viral RNA through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the throat swab can give positive results. Scientists claim that these are just viral particles left behind after the active infection. There is no proof still available that suggests that these viral particles can replicate and infect others.\n\n【35】### Is It Conclusive That Recovered COVID-19 Patients Who Test Persistently Positive Are Not Contagious?\n\n【36】Even though the detected viral RNA in recovered patients is low in concentration, and it is unlikely that such people can infect others, there is no hard and fast rule in medicine. Although no evidence supports such a spread, there still might be a chance that a minimal percentage of such recovered patients who keep testing positive might still be contagious.\n\n【37】If a Recovered COVID-19 Patient Is Identified as a Contact of a New Case, Should They Be Tested or Quarantined?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】According to the CDC, if the patient recovered from COVID-19 less than three months back and had a positive contact in that period, then retesting and quarantine are not needed. But, if it is more than three months, then the patient should be quarantined and tested.\n\n【39】**Conclusion:**\n\n【40】While there are contradictory findings of the viral genetic material found in patients after the time window to be able to replicate and be contagious, most doctors suggest it is not a possibility for recovered patients to be contagious after the initial 10 to 20 days. But, some doctors are warning their patients about the possibility of extremely rare cases where immunocompromised and severely ill but recovered patients may still be contagious. This makes the people wonder if the guidelines for how long the Coronavirus lasts in the body should be changed. Such recovered people might act as reservoirs for the virus and potentially cause local outbreaks later on. Even though there is no proof, there is still a minute chance of that happening.\n\n【41】So until everyone gets vaccinated, it is essential to continue safety precautions, such as physical distancing, masks, and frequent hand hygiene, to control the spread of the virus.\n\n【42】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【43】* * *\n\n【44】#### **1.**删除换行**How Soon May I Contract COVID Again?**\n\n【45】Reinfected or infected individuals exhibit symptoms. Most COVID-19 virus-infected individuals create fighter cells and antibodies, which are proteins that fight infections. In the first three months following the initial infection, the likelihood of reinfection for recovered people appears to be relatively low.\n\n【46】#### **2.**删除换行**Why Does COVID-19 Reinfection Occur?**\n\n【47】Viruses, including the one that causes COVID-19, are ever-evolving. Variations (new strains of the virus) that enhance the risk of reinfection may evolve due to these alterations.\n\n【48】#### **3.**删除换行**Can Anyone Get COVID Three Times?**\n\n【49】Multiple infections are becoming more and more common, according to studies. Doctors discovered that even if a person is immunized, infections by a virus that occur a second or third time increase the risk to their health.\n\n【50】#### **4.**删除换行**Is COVID Reinfection More Serious?**\n\n【51】Although the severity of the symptoms during reinfection is less severe than during the initial infection, some persons may still experience severe COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n【52】#### **5.**删除换行**Is COVID Becoming Worse Each Time?**\n\n【53】Some persons experience more serious COVID-19 symptoms, such as a high temperature, a chronic cough, and breathlessness, which frequently signify pneumonia. A person may experience minor symptoms for about a week before they quickly get worse.\n\n【54】#### **6.**删除换行**What Is the COVID Immunity Duration?**\n\n【55】The body usually takes up to 11 months to develop natural SARS-CoV-2 immunity after infection. The body's immune cells and proteins can identify and eliminate the pathogen if reencountered, preventing disease and lessening the severity of illness.\n\n【56】#### **7.**删除换行**How Soon Do the Symptoms of the Omicron Variant Show Up?**\n\n【57】Previous recommendations by WHO (world health organization) stated that COVID symptoms could occur between 2 to 14 days after a person is infected with the virus.\n\n【58】#### **8.**删除换行**How Long Till an Individual Test Positive for Omicron?**\n\n【59】With an at-home fast test, COVID-19 patients typically test for a virus that comes positive within six to ten days. It might last longer with an RT PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test)  \nMany COVID-19 individuals can give positive results for the virus for weeks or even months, according to experts in infectious diseases. A PCR test scans the body for virus bits. A test result may be positive even if a person has been cured of the illness and no longer exhibits symptoms since the test can still identify virus particles in the body. They have a lower chance of being able to determine if the virus is active or whether a person is contagious.\n\n【60】#### **9.**删除换行**What Distinguishes Omicron From Delta?**\n\n【61】Omicron may not cause breathing problems as it mostly multiplies in the throat, whereas Delta may result in more serious symptoms if critical. Omicron has minor side effects; normally, lung involvement is minimal, and patients do not require oxygen.\n\n【62】#### **10.**删除换行**How Can One Get Rid of COVID Quicker?**\n\n【63】One can take the following actions to recover from COVID quickly   \n\\- Maintain a routine.-   \n\\- Spend time away from social media and COVID-19 news.   \n\\- Consume wholesome meals and get enough liquids.   \n\\- Continue to be active.   \n\\- Get lots of rest.   \n\\- Avoid using alcohol, cigarettes, and other drugs.  \n\\- Taking proper medications suggested by the doctor.\n\n【64】#### **11.**删除换行**How Long Are People Contagious for Omicron?**\n\n【65】Early on, throughout an ailment, persons are usually most contagious. Most Omicron transmission occurs between one to two days before the onset of symptoms and two to three days after.\n\n【66】#### **12.**删除换行**Can You Test Negative While Having COVID?**\n\n【67】If the test is negative, it is improbable that the individual had COVID-19 at the time of the test, and the nasal swab sample did not contain any antigens. However, it is possible that the test resulted in a false negative even though there is the presence of antigens.\n\n【68】#### **13.**删除换行**Is COVID Possible Without a Fever?**\n\n【69】One of the typical signs of COVID-19 is a fever. Still, individuals might also have other symptoms like a cough or other respiratory issues without a temperature or a very mild one, especially in the early stages.\n\n【70】#### **14.**删除换行**Are PCR Tests Reliable?**\n\n【71】The results are quite accurate when a medical expert properly carries out RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). However, the quick test may miss some cases for antigen. COVID-19 analyses the virus for certain proteins. Once a fluid sample has been taken using a long nasal swab, certain antigen tests can deliver results within a few minutes.\n\n【72】#### **15.**删除换行**COVID: Does It Start Up Suddenly?**\n\n【73】The signs of COVID-19 can appear gradually. While COVID-19 symptoms can arise as soon as two days after infection, they can also manifest anywhere between two and fourteen days. Anyone can experience minor to major symptoms. Possible signs include chills or a fever.\n\n【74】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【75】无关删除-1:<u>*   https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0814-updated-isolation-guidance.html  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0814-updated-isolation-guidance.html\n*   https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html#Patients-with-Persistent-or-Recurrent-Positive-Tests  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html#Patients-with-Persistent-or-Recurrent-Positive-Tests\n*   https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html\n*   https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19  \n    https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "773d78ce-d0e7-4ba4-9bb0-b3e561d98749", "title": "Lipids, Their Types, and Management in Cardiovascular Disease", "text": "【0】Lipids, Their Types, and Management in Cardiovascular Disease\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Abnormal lipids have long been known to increase the chance of developing coronary artery disease, which can potentially result in a heart attack. At first, increased cholesterol levels were thought to constitute a risk, but today, even atypical components, as seen in dyslipidemia, are classified as risk factors. Fat metabolism is an intricate process. Excess fat and lipid levels can precipitate various diseases, affecting the cardiovascular system.\n\n【2】**What Are Lipids?**\n--------------------\n\n【3】Found in the bloodstream and throughout the body, lipids are molecules that play important roles in living organisms. Although they primarily act as energy reservoirs, they also play essential roles in protection, insulation, and lubrication for all the cells of the body. They are fatty, oily, and waxy and are primarily composed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen molecules.\n\n【4】**What Are the Different Types of Lipids?**\n\n【5】There are three basic groups of lipids, namely:\n\n【6】*   **Phospholipids:** They contribute to two percent of dietary lipids. For the body’s cells to function efficiently and have a protective barrier or outer membrane, it is crucial to consume phospholipids.\n\n【7】*   **Sterols:** They are the lesser-known type of lipids but are essential as they are required for the synthesis of vitamin D, bile salts, and sex hormones. Cholesterol is a classic example of sterols.\n\n【8】*   **Triglycerides:** Also known as triacylglycerols, they make up at least 95 percent of the lipids in the diet and are usually found in processed food, fried food, vegetable oils, milk, butter, cheese, and some meats. They are also found in corn, avocados, and nuts.\n\n【9】What Are the Various Function of Lipids in the Body?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Lipids are associated with the following primary biological functions of the body -\n\n【11】*   **Energy Storage Reservoir:** The energy provided by the diet is stored in the adipose tissues of the body (otherwise known as fat cells). When the body is deficient in energy, for example, when an individual is fasting, these fat cells provide energy to the body to meet the requirements.\n\n【12】*   **Regulate Body Temperature:** The lipids present in the body often act as the body’s temperature regulators. People having less fat percentage tend to feel cold and experience fatigue. Additionally, fatty acid deficiency also leads to pressure sores.\n\n【13】*   **Regulate and Signal Hormone Production:** Lipids are required for the production of several hormones, for example, female hormones. Omega-3 fatty acids play a crucial role in regulating cholesterol levels and blood clotting factors.\n\n【14】*   **Insulates and Protects the Body From Extreme Temperatures:** Fatty tissue insulates the body from extreme temperatures and maintains the internal body temperature.\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease- Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Serotonin-Induced Heart Disease - Effects, Risk Factors, Diagnosis and Symptoms</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    LDL Cholesterol - Definition, Risks, and Tests</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   **Aid Digestion:** Lipids help in the digestion of fat-soluble nutrients (vitamins A, D, E, and K) and also increase their bioavailability for the body’s efficient utilization.\n\n【16】*   **Help Functional Processes of the Body:** Lipids also help in several functional processes, such as memory storage, nerve impulse transmission, and formation of tissues. They also participate in the formation of membranes of the nerve cells and help improve brain activity and its functions.\n    </u>\n\n【17】What Is Cholesterol?\n--------------------\n\n【18】Cholesterol is the most common form of sterols. Produced by the liver, it is essential for the normal functioning of the body. A few functions of cholesterol are as follows:\n\n【19】*   Synthesize various hormones, such as sex hormones, and glucocorticoids.\n\n【20】*   Produce bile (a digestive fluid made and released by the liver). It helps in the breakdown of complex lipids and fats into simpler derivatives.\n\n【21】*   Synthesize vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in regulating phosphorus and calcium in the body.\n\n【22】**What Are Lipoproteins?**\n\n【23】They are a type of protein on which cholesterol molecules adhere and travel through the bloodstream. Lipoproteins are of three types:\n\n【24】*   **LDL or Low-Density Lipoprotein -** Otherwise known as bad cholesterol.\n\n【25】*   **VLDL or Very Low-Density Lipoprotein -** They are also known as bad cholesterol.\n\n【26】*   **HDL or High-Density Lipoprotein -** Otherwise known as good cholesterol.\n\n【27】LDL and VLDL travel through the bloodstream, delivering to the cells that need them. An increase in their levels precipitates fatty deposition and accumulation in the walls of blood vessels. These deposits hamper normal blood flow, making LDL and VLDL a type of bad cholesterol. An increase in their levels can make people susceptible to heart disease. In contrast, HDL molecules absorb the excess or unwanted cholesterol present in the body and route it to the liver. On reaching the liver, numerous processes are initiated that flush the excess cholesterol from the body. Hence, HDL is termed good cholesterol as it reduces cardiovascular disease risk.\n\n【28】**What Are the Normal Ranges of LDL and HDL for an Individual?**\n\n【29】The normal ranges of HDL and LDL can vary from one individual to another. However, the optimal ranges of LDL for an adult are as follows:\n\n【30】*   **Optimal Range -** Less than 100 mg/dL (milligrams per decilitre).\n\n【31】*   **Near-optimal Range -** 100-129 mg/dL (for patients with prior history of heart disease).\n\n【32】*   **Borderline High -** 130-159 mg/dL.\n\n【33】*   **High -** 160-189 mg/dL.\n\n【34】*   **Extremely High -** 190 mg/dL and above.\n\n【35】The adult ranges for HDL start with 40 mg/dL. A high level of HDL indicates good protection against cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【36】**What Happens When the Blood Lipids Are Elevated?**\n\n【37】When the levels of blood lipids increase, they precipitate a medical condition commonly known as dyslipidemia or hyperlipidemia. Such an abnormal increase in lipid levels can lead to various diseases and put the organs at risk. Hyperlipidemia is a common condition and can affect people of all ages. Hyperlipidemia is also the primary cause of cardiovascular disease. It makes people susceptible to atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the accumulation of fats in the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood. This, in turn, makes the blood vessels stiff, impairing their elasticity and also decreasing their cross-sectional lumen, both of which impede efficient blood flow.\n\n【38】What Are the Risk Factors for Hyperlipidemia?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【39】The following factors make a person susceptible to hyperlipidemia:\n\n【40】*   Tobacco abuse.\n\n【41】*   Excessive stress.\n\n【42】*   Diminished or absent physical activity and exercise.\n\n【43】*   Obesity.\n\n【44】*   Unhealthy diet, especially involving excessive amounts of processed foods.\n\n【45】*   Alcohol abuse.\n\n【46】*   Increased blood sugar levels.\n\n【47】*   Underactive thyroid.\n\n【48】What Are the Symptoms Associated With Hyperlipidemia?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】Increased cholesterol, as such, does not have any associated symptoms. Symptoms are only elicited when other organ systems have been affected by hyperlipidemia and fail to function properly. Following are cardiovascular symptoms elicited by a hyperlipidemic patient:\n\n【50】*   Chest pain.\n*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【51】*   Jaw pain.\n\n【52】*   Chest pain radiating to the back, shoulders, and arms.\n\n【53】*   Chest tightness.\n\n【54】*   Increased blood pressure.\n\n【55】What Are the Consequences of Hyperlipidemia?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【56】The presence of excess or unwanted fat leads to the exertion of the heart and its associated structures, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Fats and lipids accumulate within the blood vessels, blocking them. This blockage impedes heart function as it limits blood and oxygen supply. If not managed appropriately, hyperlipidemia can lead to the following conditions:\n\n【57】*   Heart attack.\n\n【58】*   Stroke.\n\n【59】*   Coronary heart disease.\n\n【60】*   Peripheral artery disease.\n\n【61】What Measures Can People Take To Manage Their Lipid Levels?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【62】People can take the following measures to keep themselves healthy and free of cardiovascular diseases:\n\n【63】**1\\. Blood Tests -** A lipid screening, also known as a lipid profile and lipid panel, allows people to track the lipid content in the blood.\n\n【64】**2\\. Dietary Modifications -** Consuming a healthy diet, having good amounts of fruits and vegetables, and healthy fats can help people prevent hyperlipidemia. Minimal consumption of processed food, trans fats, and alcohol can help effectively manage lipid levels.\n\n【65】**3\\. Lifestyle Modifications -** It is important to be physically active to effectively manage lipid levels. People should aim to devote at least 30 minutes a day to activities like walking, running, cycling, swimming, weight lifting, resistance training, or any outdoor sport. Mediation and yoga can also be incorporated to help deal with stress.\n\n【66】**4\\. Medications -** Doctors may prescribe certain medications to hyperlipidemic patients, such as:\n\n【67】*   **Statins:** Such as Atorvastatin or Lovastatin.\n\n【68】*   **Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitors:** For example, Ezetimibe.\n\n【69】*   **Bile Acid Sequestrants:** Such as Cholestyramine and Colestipol.\n\n【70】**Conclusion**\n\n【71】Lipids are fatty molecules found in the blood and throughout the body. They play crucial roles and aid in the normal functioning of the body and various organ systems. An abnormal increase in lipid levels commonly referred to as hyperlipidemia and dyslipidemia, exerts an excess load on the cardiovascular system. The heart tends to work harder to distribute blood, nutrients, and oxygen. Several measures can be taken to ensure a balance in the levels of lipids and prevent cardiovascular diseases. A combination of a healthy diet, routine check-ups, exercise, de-stressing activities, and medication (for patients wherein the other methods fail to provide results) can help improve the levels of good cholesterol and decrease the levels of bad cholesterol, thereby aiding heart health.\n\n【72】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【73】无关删除-1:<u>*   Cardiovascular prevention: Frontiers in lipid guidelines  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6964168/\n*   Blood Cholesterol, Blood Lipids, and Heart Health  \n    https://uhs.umich.edu/cholesterol\n*   ACC/AHA lipid guidelines: Personalized care to prevent cardiovascular disease  \n    https://www.ccjm.org/content/87/4/231\n*   Lipid Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk: A New Strategy Is Required  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.667428</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Because sensory innervation to the face is highly redundant, a combination of anesthetic procedures is frequently required to produce the best outcomes. In addition, the growing senior population means that an increasing number of older individuals may seek eye surgery. Therefore, administrators will seek cooperation from anesthesia providers in implementing techniques that improve operating room efficiency to manage rising patient numbers while also satisfying organizational goals aimed at budgetary austerity.\n\n【2】Cataract surgery is the most frequent ocular surgical treatment, and a local anesthetic method is usually recommended. However, anesthesia supply differs globally in terms of resources and experience. Therefore, intraconal and extraconal needle blocks are routinely utilized. Even though the techniques are generally safe, severe rare sight and life-threatening problems have occurred due to incorrect needle placement. Unfortunately, most practicing anesthesiologists are reluctant to conduct regional ocular blocks because of a lack of formal training.\n\n【3】An intraconal (retrobulbar) block is performed by injecting local anesthesia into the region of the orbital cavity (the muscle cone) behind the globe produced by the four recti muscles and the superior and inferior oblique muscles. The extraconal (peribulbar) block was created as a safer alternative to the retrobulbar block in which the needle tip was kept outside the muscle cone.\n\n【4】What Is the Anatomy and Physiology of the Eye?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The trigeminal nerve has three branches:\n\n【6】1.  Ophthalmic nerve (V1).\n\n【7】2.  Maxillary nerve (V2).\n\n【8】3.  Mandibular nerve (V3).\n\n【9】The first division (V1) and the second division (V2) innervate the brow and midface. The ophthalmic division (V1) passes along the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. The nerve is divided into the supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves inside the orbit.\n\n【10】The maxillary division (V2) leaves the foramen rotundum after traveling along the inferolateral wall of the cavernous sinus. The zygomatic nerve arises from the pterygopalatine fossa and enters the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure, dividing it into the zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal nerves. V2 becomes the infraorbital nerve after entering the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure. The anterior superior alveolar nerve gives branches before the infraorbital nerve exits the infraorbital canal. The skin of the nose, eyelids, and face receive sensory innervation from the terminal nasal, labial, and palpebral branches.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】Trigeminal Neuralgia\n\n【14】Levobunolol Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution 0.5 % - Uses, Mechanism of Action, Precautions, and Side Effects\n\n【15】Subtenon Infiltration Anesthesia - Uses, Advantages, and Disadvantages\n\n【16】What Are the Indications of Ophthalmic Nerve Block?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】When deciding on the best anesthetic route, anatomical location and length of the surgery are taken into account.\n\n【18】*   Surgeries of the eye- Intraocular and periocular surgeries.\n\n【19】*   Management of sinus, oculoplastic, and lacrimal surgery.\n\n【20】*   Reconstruction of the face.\n\n【21】*   For the management and treatment of headaches caused due to migraine.\n\n【22】*   Neuralgias of the face, both primary and secondary.\n\n【23】*   Dermatologic treatments.\n\n【24】What Are the Contraindications of Ophthalmic Nerve Block?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】*   **Absolute Contraindications:** Refusal of the patient, pre-existing anesthetic allergy\n\n【26】*   **Relative Contraindications:** Infection at the injection site, anatomic distortions (traumatic, post-surgical, or due to underlying disease), coagulation or bleeding disorders, and inadequate patient cooperation.\n\n【27】What Are the Targeted Nerve Blocks?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【28】**1\\. Retrobulbar Block:**\n\n【29】An alcohol swab or povidone-iodine is used to prepare the inferior lid. The rim of the lower orbit is then palpated, and the globe is superiorly shifted to increase the gap between the orbital floor and the globe. Next, the needle is placed into the skin at or just superior to the level of the inferior orbital rim with the needle bevel-up (to limit the possibility of globe perforation). Next, the needle is moved along the orbital floor until the first \"pop\" is felt, indicating that the needle has passed through the orbital septum. The needle is then turned 45 degrees medially and superiorly and progresses through the second \"pop,\" which indicates passing through the muscle cone and access into the intraconal area.\n\n【30】2\\. **Supraorbital Block:**\n\n【31】The supraorbital nerve is a branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. It divides into a superficial medial branch and a deep lateral branch after passing through a supraorbital notch (73.8 percent) or foramen (26.2 percent). The notch is usually felt and identifying this location aids in precise placement and targeted blockage. The needle is placed from an inferolateral location 0.19 inches below the supraorbital foramen or notch and progresses cautiously to avoid foramen penetration. The superior eyelid, brow, forehead, and anterior region of the scalp are all anesthetized by regional supraorbital blocking. Compared to local tissue infiltration, it has the advantage of anesthetizing a greater area with a lesser volume of anesthetic.\n\n【32】**3\\. Supratrochlear Block:**\n\n【33】Another branch of V1 leaves the supraorbital border medially to the supraorbital nerve. This placement is estimated by locating the supraorbital margins three millimeters medial to a vertical line drawn from the medial canthus. The block is given by inserting a needle into the place where the supratrochlear nerve comes out at the supraorbital border and gently extending along the direction of the nerve. This block is frequently used in combination with the supraorbital block to optimize anesthesia of the forehead.\n\n【34】**4\\. Nasociliary Block:**\n\n【35】Inside the orbit, the nasociliary nerve gives branches off the ophthalmic nerve. The sphenoid, ethmoid, frontal sinuses, anterior septum, lateral nasal cavity, ala of the nose, and nose tip are all supplied by branches of the nerve. Anesthetic blocks are best directed at the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina, providing anesthetic to the infratrochlear nerve. Because epinephrine is rarely administered to lessen the risk of retinal artery spasms, the duration of action of this block is shortened.\n\n【36】**5\\. Infratrochlear Block:**\n\n【37】Another branch of V1 is the infratrochlear nerve. The infratrochlear nerve, a branch of the ophthalmic nerve, passes into the orbit alongside the medial rectus muscle. It supplies the medial canthus's inferior part, the nose's lateral part, the medial conjunctiva, and the caruncle. This nerve's external position, which is felt below the trochlea, allows for targeted blocking through infiltration at the superomedial orbit. This block is frequently used in the anatomic regions during nose surgery or skin laceration repairs.\n\n【38】**6\\. Anterior Ethmoid Block:**\n\n【39】The anterior ethmoid nerve is divided into internal and external nasal branches that innervate the anterior septum, the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, the nasal bone, and skin up to the tip of the nose. The anterior ethmoidal foramen is 1.5 cm deep and placed medially from the midway point between the posterior palpebral fold and the forehead. A tiny gauge needle (25 to 27 gauge) is used for this block, accomplishing a continuous injection while withdrawing the needle. A needle inserted nine mm above the medial canthal tendon's superior border will prevent damage to the lacrimal sac.\n\n【40】**7\\. Infraorbital Block:**\n\n【41】The maxillary branch runs along the inferior orbital rim inside the infraorbital groove before coming out of the infraorbital foramen, which is about one centimeter below the lower rim of the orbit. The infraorbital nerve and its branches provide a sensory supply to the lower eyelid, lateral nose, upper lip, and maxillary teeth with sensory information. As a result, this nerve block can be used for several lower eyelid and maxillofacial surgeries. The block can be executed intraorally but requires accurate landmark identification. The intraoral approach is performed by inserting a needle superiorly parallel to the upper second premolar and moving it toward the foramen. To avoid injection into the foramen, careful palpation is required. The extraoral method is simple to understand. However, supplementary vasoconstrictive medicine is not advised because of the closeness of the facial nerve.\n\n【42】**8\\. Zygomaticofacial and Zygomaticotemporal Nerve Blocks:**\n\n【43】The zygomatic nerve arises from the maxillary nerve as it passes out of the pterygopalatine fossa. The zygomaticofacial branch extends from the zygomatic bone onto the face, innervates the surrounding skin, and can be anesthetized laterally at the inferolateral orbital rim.\n\n【44】The zygomaticotemporal branch enters the temporal fossa through a foramen, innervates the temporal skin, and gives secretomotor fibers to the lacrimal nerve.\n\n【45】The zygomaticotemporal branch will be targeted by an anesthetic applied to the concave surface of the posterolateral orbital rim and progress inferiorly to the level of the lateral canthus.\n\n【46】**9\\. Facial Nerve Blocks:**\n\n【47】The facial nerve block anesthetizes the periocular branches of the facial nerve during ocular surgery to minimize excessive blinking during surgery by orbicular muscle akinesia. The three traditional approaches are O'Brien's block, Atkinson block, and Van Lint block. In various ocular surgeries, including cataract surgery, pterygium excision, keratoplasty, dacryocystorhinostomy, glaucoma operations, and minor oculoplastic treatments, using a facial nerve block as a local anesthetic approach may be desirable.\n\n【48】What Are the Complications of the Ophthalmic Nerve Block?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】Complications differ widely based on the method used. Retrobulbar blockage increases the chances of retrobulbar bleeding, globe damage, optic nerve or extraocular muscle injury, and central spread accompanied by depression in the brain stem. Other periocular local and regional blocks provide the following risks:\n\n【50】*   Ecchymosis (a discoloration of the skin due to bleeding below the skin), hematoma, and bleeding and infection.\n\n【51】*   Local tissue injury and swelling.\n\n【52】*   Anesthesia is injected into the veins.\n\n【53】*   Nerve damage, whether temporary or permanent.\n\n【54】*   The anesthetic's systemic toxicity.\n\n【55】*   Anesthetic-induced allergic response.\n\n【56】**Conclusion**\n\n【57】Eye blocks offer good anesthesia for ocular surgeries and have a high success rate. Both needle and cannula orbital injections can provide adequate anesthesia and akinesia, but they can also have significant local and systemic consequences. Knowledge of orbital anatomy and training is required to perform orbital regional anesthesia.\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>*   Local And Regional Anesthesia in Ophthalmology and Ocular Trauma  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK574554/\n*   Ophthalmic regional anaesthesia: A review and update  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3658342/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This damage may be due to several underlying reasons. The prompt diagnosis, as well as treatment of rheumatic heart disease, is crucial in order to sustain and recover the standard functioning of the heart as well as the cardiovascular system as a whole. Rheumatic fever is one of the main reasons that lead to rheumatic heart disease. But not all cases or episodes of rheumatic fever may end in rheumatic heart disease. Those rheumatic infections that are left untreated generally persist in the patient and flow into the bloodstream, lodging the infective organism in the heart and blood vessels. Over time, the toxins released by these infective agents hamper the regular functioning of the heart by causing a significant level of damage to the heart valves.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Rheumatic Heart Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Throat infections that are caused due to Streptococcal A, result in rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever can be defined as an inflammatory response of the throat that is autoimmune in nature. This infection is referred to as strep throat or throat pharyngitis. Rheumatic fever is mostly seen in the younger age group, especially during childhood. If left untreated, this infection may cause life-long disability and hamper several vital organs, such as the heart. Mentioned below are some of the causes of rheumatic heart disease.\n\n【4】*   Sore throat due to Streptococcus pyogenes.\n\n【5】*   Upper respiratory tract infection.\n\n【6】*   Scarlet fever.\n\n【7】*   Continuous unhygienic practices.\n\n【8】*   Family history of rheumatic heart disease.\n\n【9】*   Low socioeconomic status.\n\n【10】*   Acute rheumatic fever.\n\n【11】*   Malfunctioning of the immune system.\n\n【12】*   Recurrent scarring of the cardiac valves.\n\n【13】*   Pregnant women suffering from rheumatic heart disease.\n\n【14】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Rheumatic Heart Disease?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】There are several symptoms, such as those mentioned below, of rheumatic heart disease that a patient suffering from rheumatic fever may clinically manifest.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【17】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-3:<u>What can cause knee pain with swelling?</u>\n\n【19】I am experiencing numbness in my legs and getting tired easily.

Mentioned below are several diagnostic measures for determining the presence of rheumatic heart disease. Before suggesting any diagnostic tools, the healthcare provider will evaluate the patient thoroughly for clinical manifestations. A physical exam, as well as detailed medical and drug history, is recorded. Family history is also questioned.\n\n【55】*   Complete blood profile.\n\n【56】*   Evaluating the increased immune response.\n\n【57】*   Echocardiogram or a heart ultrasound in order to find a narrowed or leaking heart valve.\n\n【58】*   Electrocardiogram to assess the electrical conduction of the heart.\n\n【59】*   Auscultation.\n\n【60】What Is the Treatment for Rheumatic Heart Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】As of today, there is no established cure for a person suffering from rheumatic heart disorder. Thus the damage to the valves of the heart is permanent. Mentioned below are some of the options that can help patients with severe states of rheumatic heart disease.\n\n【62】*   Surgical correction of valves of the heart.\n\n【63】*   Repair of heart valves.\n\n【64】*   Medication to correct the clinical manifestations of rheumatic heart disorder.\n\n【65】*   Blood thinners.\n\n【66】*   Antibiotic therapy for a rheumatic fever- Benzathine Penicillin G intramuscular every four weeks as per the healthcare provider for several.\n\n【67】What Are the Complications of Rheumatic Heart Disease?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【68】Rheumatic heart disease is a condition that is a result of untreated and long-standing rheumatic fever. If diagnosed at an early stage, rheumatic heart disease can be successfully prevented. But in the majority of the cases, early detection is next to impossible due to financial constraints and limited healthcare access to the infected individual. Mentioned below are a few complications of rheumatic heart disease.\n\n【69】*   Arrhythmia or abnormal rhythms of the heart.\n\n【70】*   Atrial fibrillation or abnormal heartbeat in the upper chambers of the heart is called the atrium.\n\n【71】*   Heart failure since the heart does not work efficiently and fails to pump blood throughout the cardiovascular system and the body.\n\n【72】*   Stroke.\n\n【73】*   Blood clots.\n\n【74】What Is the Prognosis of Rheumatic Heart Disease?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【75】The prognosis of rheumatic heart disease varies depending on the severity of the disease and the patient's overall health. People with mild RHD may not experience any symptoms and may have a normal life expectancy. However, people with moderate to severe RHD may experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. These symptoms can interfere with daily activities and may lead to heart failure.\n\n【76】**Conclusion**\n\n【77】Rheumatic heart disease is a direct result of rheumatic fever that has not been diagnosed or treated; nevertheless, there several reasons that may cause this disease. Rheumatic heart disease is preventable. Once the disease is contracted, it cannot be treated. The disease is permanent and demands a long-term management strategy. The individual continues to live life with a positive outlook by management of the symptoms of rheumatic heart disease. The important strategy for keeping rheumatic heart disease at bay is the prompt treatment of throat infections by following antibiotic therapy. Patients suffering from rheumatic heart disease that is well-managed may live a high-quality life with the correct treatment, which can even delay or completely prevent an episode of heart failure.\n\n【78】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【79】无关删除-1:<u>*   Prevalence of Rheumatic Heart Disease Detected by Echocardiographic Screening  \n    https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa065085\n*   Circulation  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.774307</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Though gingivitis remains a reversible condition upon correct management through oral prophylaxis, chemical or mechanical plaque control measures, and adequate oral hygiene, periodontitis is unlikely to be reversed when it is continuously progressive and often irreversible with progressing destructive state of disease and inflammation. In periodontitis, unlike in gingivitis, the host response is invoked and the oral immune defense is breached resulting in clinical attachment level loss (CAL) observed by the dentist in patients suffering from periodontal disease. This attachment loss that may be clinically visible is in fact a destruction of the periodontium that is continually progressing to destroy the underlying alveolar bone that supports the tooth. Hence the tooth in question is affected easily and can exfoliate as a result of mobility and long-term infection.\n\n【3】What Are the Risk Factors of Periodontitis?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【4】The risk factors though numerous for periodontitis mainly are subdivided into two types namely, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.\n\n【5】**A. Modifiable Risk Factors:**\n\n【6】These risk factors are associated with the detrimental habits, systemic health, and oral hygiene status of the individual. Inadequate oral hygiene or lack of correct tooth brushing either by lack of adequate time or technique results in the build-up of bacterial plaque. Anaerobic microorganisms in fact have an easy colonizing capacity; some of the major oral pathogens are Agrobacterium, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola, etc. These organisms as a result of inadequate oral hygiene initiate the release of host inflammatory mediators and as a result clinical inflammation and gross destruction in periodontitis. Tobacco smoking is a major detrimental habit that is associated by research with both attachment loss and bone loss, hence remains a major factor for releasing TSNAs (tobacco-specific nitrosamines) due to nicotine components that would be potentially carcinogenic and can impair the immune defense significantly in the oral cavity and eventually in the circulatory system. People who continue tobacco smoking also are at an increased prevalence of suffering from oral infections in spite of dental or oral prophylactic treatment if they continue the habit. Pregnancy is similarly another risk factor associated with periodontal disease because of hormonal fluctuations and untreated gingivitis that can induce an inflammatory response leading to periodontitis. Diabetes mellitus is another common risk factor because of impaired primary wound healing and the presence of pathologies that would enhance the breakdown of periodontal tissue, severe periodontal disease always has a two-way connection or relationship as per traditional research with diabetes mellitus.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-3:<u>I lost four teeth due to weakness and mobility.

Non Modifiable Risk Factors:**\n\n【13】**Aging:** Older age is associated with loss of dexterity. In older individuals due to lesser oral hygiene practice or because of the systemic or impaired health conditions there is an aggravation or worsening periodontitis. This is because of severe plaque deposition and local immune or inflammatory response induced in the host.\n\n【14】**Genetic Disorders:** The etiology or development of several systemic genetic diseases like Downs syndrome, Ehler Danlos syndrome, or Crohn's syndrome is linked with the direct manifestation of periodontitis in these individuals.\n\n【15】What Are the Clinical Symptoms of Periodontitis?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Signs or clinical symptoms of active periodontal infections or disease process includes these:\n\n【17】*   Active gingival tissue bleeding or gum bleeding either on slight provocation or by chewing hard food.\n\n【18】*   Tooth pain or tooth mobility or a bad taste in the mouth, or bad breath can be evident.\n\n【19】How to Stage Periodontitis?\n---------------------------\n\n【20】The periodontitis can be staged as follows,\n\n【21】Staging of periodontitis is traditionally classified on the severity and extent of periodontal management required by the dental surgeon or periodontist. The extent of periodontal disease is dependent on factors discussed earlier i.e. clinical attachment loss, radiographic bone loss (observed by 2D or 3D imaging radiographic modalities), and tooth loss.\n\n【22】*   **Stage I:** Initial periodontitis.\n\n【23】*   **Stage II:** Moderate periodontitis.\n\n【24】*   **Stage III:** Severe periodontitis with the potential for individual tooth loss.\n\n【25】*   **Stage IV:** Severe periodontitis with the potential for tooth loss.\n\n【26】How to Grade Periodontitis?\n---------------------------\n\n【27】Grading is similarly done by the dentist upon individual risk assessment clinically to measure or implicate the risk assessment factors that are used to describe the rate of progression of the disease. This is again based on the individual's evidence for associated risk factors whether it is smoking, pregnancy, or cases of diabetes mellitus or other systemic diseases.\n\n【28】*   **Grade A:** Low rate of progression causing periodontal destruction.\n\n【29】*   **Grade B:** Expected rate of progression causing periodontal destruction.\n\n【30】*   **Grade C:** High risk of progression causing periodontal destruction.\n\n【31】How to Manage Periodontitis?\n----------------------------\n\n【32】Though the initial measure for prevention of gingival and periodontal disease remains oral prophylaxis or deep cleaning by the dentist, in moderate to severe forms of periodontitis, the patients need to be not only educated by the dentist on the importance of implementing strict oral hygiene, chemical or mechanical forms of plaque control like flossing, interdental brushing, mouth washing, etc. but also follow regular dental follow-up regimens to clear the recurring plaque responsible for the clinical attachment loss. Lifestyle modification, dental antimicrobial therapy, and prophylaxis are extremely beneficial in the long-term maintenance of oral health in these cases. In severe periodontal disease either through advanced modalities like laser or gingival surgical procedures, the dentist can attempt to save the eventual tooth loss. However, it may not be possible in severe or chronic cases where the tooth mobility is severe due to infections, bone loss, or systemic disease.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】To conclude, periodontitis is a major risk factor apart from oral disease in itself for our general systemic health and should be treated timely by the dentist with regular follow-up and oral hygiene education to maintain long-term stability of natural teeth and for preventing its loss.\n\n【35】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【36】* * *\n\n【37】#### **1.**删除换行**Can Periodontitis Be Cured?**\n\n【38】Periodontitis can not be cured completely. It is an advanced gum and jawbone disease which can be managed by deep cleaning around the teeth by the dentist, surgical procedures like flap surgery, gingival grafts, bone grafts, etc, and antibiotics. The patient should maintain oral hygiene with brushing and flossing.\n\n【39】#### **2.**删除换行**Is Periodontitis a Serious Disease?**\n\n【40】No, periodontitis is not a serious disease. It is an infection of gums and bone around teeth, which causes bleeding and swelling in the gums, and loose and mobile teeth. It can be treated by cleaning teeth, antibiotics, and surgical procedures. Oral hygiene should be maintained by brushing and flossing.\n\n【41】#### **3.**删除换行**Does Periodontitis Hurt?**\n\n【42】Periodontitis is an infection in the gums that is usually painless, but others might have a slight dull pain due to the infection and inflammation which can be managed by painkillers and antibiotics.\n\n【43】#### **4.**删除换行**Is Periodontitis Lifelong?**\n\n【44】No, periodontitis is not a lifelong condition. It is severe inflammation and infection of the gums and underlying bone supporting the teeth, which can be treated by antibiotics, scaling, root planing by the dentist, and surgical procedures like flap surgery and soft tissue grafting, and bone grafting.\n\n【45】#### **5.**删除换行**How Long Does Periodontitis Take To Heal?**\n\n【46】Periodontitis is an advanced gum disease caused due to deposits around teeth and poor oral hygiene. It can be treated with a cleaning procedure by a dentist which heals the gums within 2 weeks. Regular follow-up checkups with the dentist are essential to maintain gum health.\n\n【47】#### **6.**删除换行**Is Periodontitis Cancerous?**\n\n【48】No, periodontitis is not a cancerous condition but, there is an increased risk of developing cancer that can be associated with periodontal disease.\n\n【49】#### **7.**删除换行**How Much Does Periodontitis Treatment Cost?**\n\n【50】The treatment cost depends upon the procedure performed. A cleaning procedure called scaling would cost around Rs 500 - 1500, and a surgical procedure like flap surgery costs around Rs 3000 to 5000 per quadrant. The treatment cost varies greatly according to the place of the dental office and the severity of the disease.\n\n【51】#### **8.**删除换行**Should I Be Worried About Periodontitis?**\n\n【52】Periodontitis is a common gum disease that occurs due to poor oral hygiene causing hard deposits called tartar to accumulate around teeth. This leads to the loosening of the teeth due to the loss of gum and bone support. It can be managed and prevented through oral hygiene practices, and deep professional cleaning done by a dentist.\n\n【53】#### **9.**删除换行**Can Periodontitis Happen Suddenly?**\n\n【54】No, periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the gum and underlying bone that supports teeth. The milder form of the gum disease called gingivitis progresses to periodontitis, if not treated, and this happens over months or years.\n\n【55】#### **10.**删除换行**Where Does Periodontitis Start?**\n\n【56】Periodontitis is caused due to infection by bacteria, damaging the s gums supporting the teeth, which spreads to bone tissue if not treated. Gingivitis progresses to periodontitis when not treated for months or years.\n\n【57】#### **11.**删除换行**Will Gums Grow Back After Periodontitis?**\n\n【58】No, the gums which have been damaged and have receded due to periodontitis will not grow back. Gum health can be improved and can be prevented from getting worse through practicing good oral hygiene and regular deep cleaning by a dentist.\n\n【59】#### **12.**删除换行**How Fast Does Periodontitis Spread?**\n\n【60】Periodontitis can spread from gums to the bone and other tissues surrounding the teeth, but slowly over months or years. But the disease may spread rapidly in a few patients who have aggressive periodontitis. Hence, it is advised to maintain good oral hygiene by proper brushing and flossing and visiting a dentist for professional cleaning of teeth.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "ad9ff040-3bd2-4335-9e54-b70cddda6cf5", "title": "Facial Feminization Surgery - An Overview", "text": "【0】Facial Feminization Surgery - An Overview\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】The face plays an important role in identifying a person’s gender. Facial features vary from person to person, but a few unique biological features help distinguish male faces from female faces. Regardless of gender, males, and females can have similar features, but their relation to each other and position can make a difference in the face’s overall appearance. The development of facial features depends not only on the gender of a person but also genetics.\n\n【2】What Is Facial Feminization Surgery?\n------------------------------------\n\n【3】Facial feminization essentially means altering facial features to make a face look more feminine, which is achieved by undergoing a series of procedures to change an individual’s facial features that would result in an overall feminine appearance. Facial feminization surgery involves making structural changes to facial features. The facial features of men and women differ; this difference is what the brain catches to identify a person’s gender. Some features are unique to males and females. A few such features are:\n\n【4】*   **Forehead:** A stronger and more prominent forehead is commonly associated with a male face. The reason for this is the shape of the male’s forehead frontal bone. In addition, a receding hairline is also suggestive of a masculine face, which results in a further elongated look on the forehead. On the other hand, females have smaller foreheads, which helps distinguish male and female facial patterns.\n\n【5】*   **Eyebrows:** Men have a unique feature called brow ridge, which is absent in women and makes their eyebrows look protruded. This feature is absent in women, which gives their eyebrows a softer, more rounded appearance. The eyebrows in men are bushier and placed closer to the upper eyelid, which makes the eye look smaller. Women’s eyebrows are usually placed higher up and are arched, making the eye look larger and feminine. Changes in the shape of eyebrows and the distance between them can significantly impact the overall appearance.\n\n【6】*   **Eyes:** Men tend to have smaller eyes that are deep-set and placed closer to each other. Conversely, women have larger eyes that are set apart.\n\n【7】*   **Nose:** The male nose is usually larger and wider at the base than the women’s. A dorsal hump is also considered a masculine facial feature. Female noses are smaller and narrower at the base. In addition, they have curved bridges, and there tends to be a slight upward tilt at the tip of the nose.\n\n【8】*   **Cheeks and Cheekbones:** Male cheeks are not prominent, and they appear flatter. Women have fuller prominent cheeks.\n\n【9】*   **Chin and Jawline:** Men’s jawlines and chins appear larger and more chiseled. Women, on the other hand, have rounder and less defined jawlines and smaller chins.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Health Care Needs for Transgender People</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【11】*   **Lips:** Men have shorter upper lips, which are usually flat because they are placed away from the nose. Women have fuller lips which are positioned closer to the nose.\n\n【12】All these factors are considered while changing facial features to look more feminine, which is especially valid in transgender women who desire to achieve a more feminine face.\n\n【13】What Are the Indications of Facial Feminization Surgery?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Facial feminization can be beneficial to different categories of people. The main beneficiaries of this surgery are:\n\n【15】*   **Transgender Women:** A transgender person is a person whose gender identity does not match the sex registered for them at birth. Transgender people transitioning from male to female can benefit from facial feminization surgery to deal with the stigma surrounding transgender people and to achieve the desired outcome. Transgender women usually have masculine facial features, which can be made more feminine using facial feminization surgery.\n\n【16】*   **Cisgender Women:** A cisgender person's gender identity corresponds to the sex assigned at birth. Cisgender women also opt for facial feminization surgery to correct certain features that are masculine in appearance. For example, even though facial patterns are unique in men and women, certain women can develop masculine facial features. Women who desire to change this can benefit from facial feminization surgery.\n\n【17】*   **Gender Dysphoria:** Gender dysphoria is a feeling of unease or distress in individuals whose gender identity does not match their biological sex registered at birth, which can even lead to depression and anxiety if not identified and treated. Individuals with gender dysphoria can opt for facial feminization surgery for reassurance and achieve the desired facial features.\n\n【18】What Are the Different Facial Feminization Surgical Procedures?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Subtle differences in facial features make a face masculine or feminine. These changes can be in any part of the face, like eyebrows, lips, nose, forehead, or even hairline. Knowledge about these parameters can help in achieving the desired results. Different areas of the face are addressed in many procedures, depending on the alterations to be made.\n\n【20】*   **Forehead Procedures:** The forehead can be contoured by shaving off brow bone prominence to give a flat brow space. However, extensive shaving of the brow bone can expose the sinus cavity. Hence, care should be taken while performing the procedure.\n\n【21】*   **Hairline Alterations:** Hairline alteration procedures often accompany forehead procedures to address receding hairline and male pattern hair growth. Some cases may even require hair transplants to achieve the desired outcomes.\n\n【22】*   **Nose Procedures:** Rhinoplasty is a commonly done procedure to change the appearance of the nose. For example, feminine noses are smaller, with a distinct upturn at the tip, which can be achieved through rhinoplasty.\n\n【23】*   **Cheek Augmentation:** This procedure involves placing cheek implants to give a fuller appearance to the cheeks, which is an uncommon procedure because the result can be achieved without surgery through hormone therapy.\n\n【24】*   **Lip Lift:** Female lips tend to have a shorter space between the upper lip and the base of the nose. A lip lift can achieve this.\n\n【25】*   **Genioplasty:** Changes in chin shape and size can be achieved by genioplasty. However, some cases require chin reduction, and some require chin augmentation.\n\n【26】*   **Jaw Surgery:** Changing the shape of the jaw can be done to achieve a more feminine appearance. However, extensive shaving of the jaw bone exposes a major nerve that runs through the jaw. Hence, it is a fairly risky procedure.\n\n【27】*   **Tracheal Shave:** This procedure is done to reduce the protrusion of the adam’s apple, which is prominent in males.\n\n【28】What Are the Risks and Complications Associated With Facial Feminization Surgery?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Facial feminization surgery often yields great results and helps people achieve their desired facial appearance. But like any other surgical procedure, facial feminization also comes with risks and complications that should be considered while opting for the procedure.\n\n【30】Some of the common complications are:\n\n【31】*   **Changes in Skin Sensation:** Skin sensation can be altered in most patients undergoing skin feminization surgery. Some experience loss of sensation or numbness temporarily, which usually resolves on its own.\n\n【32】*   **Frontal Sinus Problems:** Surgeries involving frontal bone repair or repositioning can have complications like infection, pain, fluid collection, etc. which might require additional surgery to resolve.\n\n【33】*   **Nerve Injury:** Motor and sensory nerves are at risk of injury during facial feminization surgery. Temporary weakness or paralysis of the face may occur after surgery. The chances of these complications becoming permanent is extremely rare.\n\n【34】*   **Nasal Airway Changes:** Alterations in the airway can occur after rhinoplasty or septoplasty procedures. These complications require additional surgery to be corrected.\n\n【35】*   **Perforation of the Nasal Septum:** There is a risk of the nasal septum being perforated during rhinoplasty, which also requires additional surgical correction.\n\n【36】*   **Asymmetry:** The human face typically has slight asymmetry. Any visible asymmetry following surgery can be considered a complication and needs additional revision.\n\n【37】*   **Delayed Healing:** Delay in healing is a common complication in most surgical procedures, especially if the patient has co-morbidities, which can be addressed by changing the wound dressing or additional surgery to remove non-healed tissue.\n\n【38】*   **Damage to Deeper Structures:** Certain facial feminization surgeries have a potential risk of damaging deeper structures like the brain, blood vessels, muscles, etc. The intensity of risk depends on the site and type of procedure.\n\n【39】*   **Allergic Reaction:** Local allergies to tapes and sutures are common. However, more severe allergies to drugs during or after surgery needs additional treatment.\n\n【40】*   **Eyelid Disorders and Eye Irritation:** Surgery around the eyes can cause swelling, bleeding, and pain in the eyelids and surrounding structures. Eye irritation is also commonly seen in such cases.\n\n【41】*   **Hair Loss:** Hair loss is commonly seen in surgeries that involve placing incisions in the scalp. Hair loss is usually temporary and resolves after a few months.\n\n【42】*   **Pain:** Normally, pain from the surgery can last for 3-6 months. Any pain that lasts more than this period is abnormal.\n\n【43】*   **Discomfort Due to Implants:** Specific facial feminization procedures require placing plates, pins, or screws to help stabilize bones or other structures. Improper placement of these can cause pain and discomfort, which requires additional surgery.\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】Facial feminization surgery is a great way to boost one’s confidence and fight away insecurities. But it comes with a broad range of complications, which the patient should be aware of. However, if the benefits overweigh the risks, the patient can benefit from this procedure without fear. Experienced surgeons can help minimize the potential for risks and ensure success.\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>*   Facial Feminization: Systematic Review of the Literature  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27219232/\n*   Facial feminization - Surgical modification for Indian, European and African faces  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5343629/\n*   Facial feminization  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5343620/\n*   Overview of Facial Plastic Surgery and Current Developments  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5553462/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The lobes shrink as a result of this. Behavior, attitude, language, and movement can all be affected by frontotemporal dementia. These are some of the most frequent dementias in people under the age of 65. Frontotemporal dementia usually strikes people between the ages of 40 and 65; however, it can also affect young adults and the elderly.\n\n【2】Frontotemporal dementia affects both men and women in the same way. Frontotemporal dementia is a progressive disease, which means that symptoms worsen over time. People may only have one symptom in the early stages. Other symptoms emerge as the disease advances, and more regions of the brain are damaged. It is difficult to say how long someone suffering from frontotemporal dementia will survive. Some people live for more than ten years after being diagnosed, while others live for less than two years.\n\n【3】What Causes Frontotemporal Dementia?\n------------------------------------\n\n【4】The temporal and frontal lobes of the brain shrink in frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, some chemicals build up in the brain. It is frequently unclear what causes these shifts. Frontotemporal dementia has been linked to certain genetic alterations. However, more than half of those who develop frontotemporal dementia have no relatives who have had the disease. Researchers have discovered that frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) share genetic and molecular mechanisms. However, more research is needed to establish the link between these disorders fully.\n\n【5】When one of three genes has a mutation or a change, it causes genetic frontotemporal dementia:\n\n【6】*   Progranulin protein (GRN).\n\n【7】*   Tau protein is found in the brain (MAPT).\n\n【8】*   C9ORF72.\n\n【9】The sort of mutation a patient develops has an impact on the symptoms they experience.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-3:<u>Why is a vascular dementia patient having choking?</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>How Does Homeopathy Help in Dementia?</u>\n\n【14】Aphasia - Signs, Diagnosis and Treatment\n\n【15】What Are the Symptoms and the Types of Frontotemporal Dementia?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Frontotemporal dementia symptoms are frequently misunderstood. Family members and friends may believe that a person acts inappropriately, resulting in resentment and conflict. It is crucial to realize that people with such conditions have no control over their behaviors or other symptoms, and they are entirely unaware of their illness.\n\n【17】Since symptoms and the sequence in which they develop vary from person to person, it can be challenging to determine which kind of frontotemporal dementia a person has in the early stages. Also, because different areas of the brain are affected, the same symptoms might emerge across different illnesses and fluctuate from one stage of the disease to the next.\n\n【18】Frontotemporal diseases (FTD) are divided into three categories:\n\n【19】**1\\. Primary Progressive Aphasia:**\n\n【20】*   Changes in one's ability to speak, write and read, and understand what others are saying are part of primary progressive aphasia. Aphasia is a term used to describe difficulty utilizing or understanding words and difficulty speaking appropriately, for example, slurred speech. One or both of these symptoms may be present in people with primary progressive aphasia. They may be unable to speak or become mute. Many people with primary progressive aphasia acquire dementia symptoms.\n*   Memory, thinking, and justice issues are not often evident at first, but they might grow with time. Furthermore, as the disease advances, some patients may exhibit severe behavioral abnormalities comparable to those seen in other kinds of frontotemporal dementia.\n*   Increasing difficulty in comprehending and interpreting spoken and written language, such as difficulty selecting the proper word to use in speaking or naming items. Experiencing trouble in naming objects and using a more general term for specific items. No longer being able to decipher the meanings of words. Having hesitant telegraphic speech. Making errors in sentence structure.\n\n【21】**2\\. Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia**\n\n【22】The most frequent form of frontotemporal dementia, behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, causes personality, behavior, and judgmental alterations. People with this illness may have cognitive difficulties, although their memory may be unaffected. Extreme changes in behavior and personality are the most common indications of this kind of frontotemporal dementia.Symptoms can include the following:\n\n【23】*   Planning and sequencing issues include having difficulty realizing which steps come after another for a task.\n*   Patients lose interest in their family or the hobbies they used to like.\n*   Repeating the same act or uttering the same word repeatedly.\n*   Acting rashly or saying or doing wrong things without considering the impact on others.\n*   Difficulty in prioritizing tasks and activities.\n*   Judgment and inhibition lack.\n*   Alterations in eating habits, eating inedible stuff.\n*   Language and movement impairments may develop with time, necessitating greater care and monitoring for individuals living with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.\n\n【24】**3\\. Movement Disorders**\n\n【25】Movement issues comparable to those seen in Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis characterize rarer forms of frontotemporal dementia. The following are examples of motor-related issues observed:\n\n【26】*   Tremors and rigidity.\n*   Muscle twitches or spasms.\n\n【27】*   Coordination issues.\n\n【28】*   Swallowing problems.\n\n【29】*   Muscle deterioration.\n\n【30】*   Laughter or crying (inappropriate).\n\n【31】*   Problems with walking or falls.\n\n【32】How Is Frontotemporal Dementia Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【33】Since the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia are identical to those of other illnesses, it can be difficult to identify.\n\n【34】*   Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, for example, is frequently misdiagnosed as a mood condition like depression. To further complicate matters, a person can have frontotemporal dementia as well as another type of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, due to the rarity of this condition, physicians may be inexperienced with the signs and symptoms.\n\n【35】*   A clinician can examine the patient and inquire about their symptoms and family's medical history. In order to rule out other conditions, laboratory tests can be used, genetic testing and brain imaging can be ordered, and exams can be conducted to evaluate memory, reasoning, language, and physical abilities.\n\n【36】*   A psychiatric evaluation can assist in determining whether other mental health problems are the cause or a contributing factor.\n\n【37】*   A diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia can only be confirmed through genetic tests in familial situations or a brain autopsy conducted after a person dies.\n\n【38】*   Frontotemporal dementia is being researched to identify it early and more correctly and separate it from other varieties of dementia. Biomarkers, such as proteins or other molecules in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that can be used to track illness development or therapy effects, are one area of study. Researchers are also looking at ways to improve neuropsychological testing and brain imaging.\n\n【39】How to Treat Frontotemporal Dementia?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【40】Frontotemporal dementia presently has no remedy or specific treatment. Drugs used to cure or slow Alzheimer's disease do not seem to assist people with frontotemporal dementia, and some of them may worsen the symptoms. Certain drugs and speech therapy, on the other hand, can assist people with frontotemporal dementia in managing their symptoms.\n\n【41】*   **Medications**\n\n【42】    *   Some antidepressants, including Trazodone, may help with the behavioral issues that come with frontotemporal dementia.\n\n【43】    *   Frontotemporal dementia is occasionally treated with antipsychotic drugs like Olanzapine or Quetiapine. However, because of the danger of major adverse effects, including an increased risk of mortality, these drugs should be used cautiously in patients with dementia.\n\n【44】*   **Therapy**\n\n【45】    Speech therapy can help those who are having trouble communicating since it teaches them new ways to communicate.\n\n【46】**Conclusion:**\n\n【47】As the illness worsens, patients will need caregivers to help with everyday activities, protect their safety, offer transportation, and assist with money. The doctor will talk to them about making lifestyle changes. Find a support group for persons with frontotemporal dementia through the doctor or the internet. A support group can provide the patient with useful information targeted to their specific requirements and a place where they can share their thoughts and feelings. Receiving support, care, and compassion from those you trust can be crucial if you have been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.\n\n【48】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【49】* * *\n\n【50】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Initial Symptoms of Frontotemporal Dementia?**\n\n【51】A person with frontotemporal dementia may show initial symptoms, including personality changes such as reduced sensitivity to others' feelings, lack of social interaction, language issues such as speaking slowly, struggling to make the right words in order, or using incorrect words, and getting distracted easily.\n\n【52】#### **2.**删除换行**What Sign of Frontotemporal Dementia Is Most Noticeable?**\n\n【53】The most noticeable sign of frontotemporal dementia is a change in behavior and personality. These include inappropriate social behavior, loss of empathy, and other interpersonal skills.\n\n【54】#### **3.**删除换行**How Long Does Someone With Frontotemporal Dementia Typically Live?**\n\n【55】Studies reveal that the life expectancy of a person diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia is 7 to 8 years. The condition is not life-threatening, but the causes of the issue are serious. The one serious condition that appears when frontotemporal dementia worsens is dysphagia or difficulty in swallowing.\n\n【56】#### **4.**删除换行**What Is the Rate of Progression of Frontotemporal Dementia?**\n\n【57】Frontotemporal dementia is most commonly diagnosed in the late 40 to 60 years. However, there are also younger individuals affected. The condition is chronic, develops slowly, and worsens over time.\n\n【58】#### **5.**删除换行**What Is a Conventional Treatment for Frontotemporal Dementia?**\n\n【59】The conventional treatment available for frontotemporal dementia is administering medications. Medications such as antidepressants can minimize the behavioral problems associated with the condition. A commonly used antidepressant is Trazadone. In addition, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as Citalopram, Sertraline, and Paroxetine can be administered.\n\n【60】#### **6.**删除换行**Does an MRI Reveal Frontotemporal Dementia?**\n\n【61】There are various diagnostic tests to determine frontotemporal dementia. They are blood tests, scans such as CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), genetic testing, and post-mortem examination. For example, an MRI can be used to identify the atrophy or shrinkage of specific regions on the brain, indicating frontotemporal dementia.\n\n【62】#### **7.**删除换行**What Stage of Dementia Involves Communication Difficulty?**\n\n【63】The middle stage of Alzheimer’s disease, also called moderate Alzheimer’s, is the longest stage lasting many years showing great difficulty for the individual in communication and requiring the utmost care. The main communication issues are difficulty naming, finding words, understanding, and voicing what they understood.\n\n【64】#### **8.**删除换行**Does a Person have Dementia Know They Have It?**\n\n【65】The person who has dementia may feel confused during the initial stages. They find it difficult to remember faces, day and month, and where they are. They may feel confused for a variety of reasons depending on the situation. Therefore, they do not know that they suffer from the condition.\n\n【66】#### **9.**删除换行**What Does the Gene GRN Do?**\n\n【67】The GRN (granulin precursor) gene gives information for producing a protein called progranulin, present on the cellular surface of the lysosomes that digest and recycle materials. This gene mutation leads to frontotemporal dementia as it affects the survival of neurons and normal microglial activities.\n\n【68】#### **10.**删除换行**What Exactly Is GRN Disease?**\n\n【69】GRN (granulin precursor) disease or GRN-related frontotemporal dementia is a brain disease affecting individual’s behavior, language, and movement.

{"seq_id": "8804b885-2887-4515-91ca-65d9c28d76a3", "title": "Virus and Cancer : An Overview", "text": "【0】Virus and Cancer : An Overview\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Viruses are small organisms, and many cannot be seen through a normal microscope. When a virus enters a living cell, it crosses the membrane and releases the genome to replicate itself. Some take over the living cell by inserting DNA or RNA into the living cell. The virus inserts itself into the host cells' proteins, replicating itself when the conditions are right. The virus's DNA or RNA affects the host cell's gene, which can lead to cancer.\n\n【2】**How Can a Virus Disrupt Cell Behavior?**\n------------------------------------------\n\n【3】In addition to chemicals and radiation, which lead to cancer, the virus is another important source of mutation. Humans are more prone to many viral infections. Viruses are not similar to bacteria, even though both can cause infections. Viruses disrupt cell behavior in many ways; some are:\n\n【4】1.  Mutations and damage to the living DNA are caused by inserting the virus genome into the DNA of the living cell. This can destroy significant regulatory genes.\n\n【5】2.  The virus may have genes that destroy cell regulation. This is beneficial to the virus as it enhances the production of progeny, which may disrupt the host cell.\n\n【6】3.  Some viruses may have altered gene versions from the previous host. As a result, these genes do not function properly, and when they enter the host cell, they cause dysregulation and cancerous growth.\n\n【7】Through their mutational behavior, viruses play an important role in cancer development in many animals and humans.\n\n【8】How Does Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Cause Cancer?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The human papillomavirus has more than 150 types, called papillomas. These viruses cause papilloma, which is called a wart. Certain types of this virus develop only on the skin, while others develop on mucus membranes like the mouth, throat, or vagina. All forms of HPV can spread through contact, whereas 40 types transmit from one person to another through sexual contact. Dozens of these virus types result in cancer. Infections caused by HPV viruses are very common, but cancer caused by these viruses is not. Those affected by the infection caused by this virus do not develop cancer, but long-term infection due to certain types of HPV virus may result in cancer.\n\n【10】**HPV virus and cervical cancer:** Cervical cancer is the most common cancer seen among women, and some types of HPV viruses are the main cause. The PAP test (Papanicolaou test) reveals pre-cancerous cells in the cervix that HPV infections may cause. If any are present, this pre-cancerous cell can be eliminated or destroyed, which prevents cancer from developing. Most individuals affected by cervical cancer show HPV infections. There is no proper treatment for a cervix infected with HPV, but a vaccine can prevent it. In cases where HPV causes the growth of abnormal cells, it can be eliminated by removal or destroyed.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>What could be the reason for my low neutrophil count and ulcers?</u>\n\n【14】Parvoviral Infections - Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment\n\n【15】Chronic Pyelonephritis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【16】HPV virus also plays a significant role in some cancers affecting:\n\n【17】1.  Penis.\n\n【18】2.  Anus.\n\n【19】3.  Vaginal.\n\n【20】4.  Vulva.\n\n【21】5.  Mouth.\n\n【22】6.  Throat.\n\n【23】**Vaccine against HPV virus:** Vaccines are available which prevent HPV infections in children and young adults. This vaccine prevents almost 90% of cancers caused by the HPV virus. This can be used only as a preventive measure and does not stop or treat the existing infection caused by the HPV virus.\n\n【24】How Does Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Cause Cancer?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【25】EBV is a herpes virus known to cause the 'kissing disease.' EBV transmits from one person to another through sharing utensils, coughing, or sneezing. Compared with other herpes viruses, EBV is lifelong, even though affected people do not show symptoms after the initial few weeks. EBV infects the host cell and retains some WBCs (white blood cells) in the body. No proper treatment, medication, or vaccine exists to treat or prevent EBV infections, but these viruses do not cause serious problems.\n\n【26】EBV infections enhance the risk of:\n\n【27】1.  Nasopharyngeal cancer.\n\n【28】2.  Fast-growing lymphomas like Burkitt lymphomas.\n\n【29】3.  Hodgkin lymphomas.\n\n【30】4.  Stomach cancer.\n\n【31】How Do Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) And Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Cause Cancer?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Both HBV and HCV cause liver infections. These cause long-term infections that may result in liver cancer. Long-term HCV infection can also result in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. They get transmitted from one person to another, similar to the HIV (human immunodeficiency) virus, through needles, unprotected sex, childbirth, or blood transfusion.\n\n【33】HBV infection causes symptoms like flu or jaundice, and adults recover completely from this virus in a few months. However, the infection is prolonged in very few people, increasing cancer risk. At the same time, HCV infection causes fewer symptoms than HCV but results in prolonged infection, enhancing the risk of liver cancer. Once hepatitis B and C are diagnosed, the person is treated with medications; in severe and prolonged infections, they are treated with a combination of drugs that help get rid of HCV infections. In the case of HBV infections, there is no permanent cure, but medications can be used to reduce the risk of liver damage and liver cancer. In addition, a vaccine is available to prevent HBV infection, whereas no vaccine for HCV infection exists.\n\n【34】How Does Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Cause Cancer?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】HIV causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and does not cause cancer directly, but infections caused by HIV enhance cancer risk. HIV attacks the T-cells, the helper cells, and weakens the immune system. This allows the HPV to thrive and may result in cancer. Some of the cancers associated with HIV are:\n\n【36】1.  Kaposi sarcoma.\n\n【37】2.  Cervical cancer.\n\n【38】3.  Non-Hodgkin lymphomas.\n\n【39】4.  Anal cancer.\n\n【40】5.  Lung cancer.\n\n【41】6.  Cancer of mouth or throat.\n\n【42】7.  Liver cancer.\n\n【43】8.  Skin cancer.\n\n【44】9.  HIV infections take a long time to show symptoms, and there are no vaccines to prevent them.\n\n【45】How Does Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV 8) Cause Cancer?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】The HHV-8 virus is found in all Kaposi's sarcoma patients; the infection causes this virus to multiply in large numbers and live longer than it should. These, in the long run, change into cancerous cells. These viruses are transmitted through sex, blood transfusions, and saliva. This virus infection is lifelong but does not cause major problems in healthy people with good immune systems. HHV-8 has also been linked to some types of blood cancer.\n\n【47】How Does Human T-Lymphocytic Virus 1 (HTLV-1) Cause Cancer?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】HTLV-1 is associated with lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The HTLV-1 virus is a retrovirus used for genetic code. To multiply, they should be converted to DNA. This DNA can become part of the chromosome of the infected human cell.\n\n【49】**Conclusion**\n\n【50】Viruses are small organisms that cause many diseases in humans. They cause infections by affecting the cell's genetic makeup and potentially leading them to become cancerous. However, not all viruses cause cancer. Instead, some increase the risk of cancer by suppressing the immune system. Some of these infections can be treated through medication and prevented through vaccines. In contrast, others cannot be eradicated but can reduce cancer risk through medication and treatment.\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>*   Viruses that Can Lead to Cancer  \n    https://www.cancer.org/healthy/cancer-causes/infectious-agents/infections-that-can-lead-to-cancer/viruses.html\n*   Viruses and Human Cancer  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1994798/\n*   HPV and Cancer  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Indications for pyelolithotomy include minimally branched stones in the renal pelvis of collecting systems and excessive morbid obesity. Pyelolithotomy is also relevant in patients who are experiencing major open retroperitoneal or abdominal surgical procedures for other indications; the most common coexisting procedure is open pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction. A pyelolithotomy can be performed as a laparoscopic, open, or robotic method.\n\n【2】What Is Open Pyelolithotomy?\n----------------------------\n\n【3】Open pyelolithotomy surgery is usually applied for difficult and complex stones which are resulting in blockage or the presence of symptoms such as recurrent infection, pain, and stones that are incapable of being removed using less invasive treatments. The procedure is generally done through a flank incision that permits the best feasible access. With the ureter and kidney being exposed, the surgeon is able to locate the stones by using X-ray imaging which can also be used to locate their exact position. Once the stones are found, an incision is made into the ureter or the kidney so the stone can be extracted. Once the stones are removed, all the incisions are stitched and secured. The surface skin layers are sealed with either dissolving stitches or with surgical staples.\n\n【4】A wound drain is placed to drain any fluid from the area, and a nephrostomy tube can also be inserted. A drain is positioned into the kidney called a nephrostomy tube through the same incision operated to remove the stone. It is stitched into position and is attached to a drainage bag that drains any blood, urine, or stone fragments from the renal pelvis of the kidney. If the ureter is to be incised during surgery, a ureteric stent may be positioned. This is a soft and thin tube that sits within the ureter. Both ends of the stent are spiraled, and one loop sits within the kidney and the other within the bladder. The stent permits healing and drains urine and any stone fragments from the kidney.\n\n【5】A catheter is also placed through the urethra to drain the urine from the bladder into a bag. Depending on the area and number of stones, surgery can take two to four hours to complete and can involve a two to four days of hospital stay.\n\n【6】**What Is the Procedure for Open Pyelolithotomy?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】*   During admission into the hospital, the approximate time and preparation for the surgery are informed by the physician.\n\n【8】*   An intravenous line is obtained through circulation, preventing blood clots.\n\n【9】*   A shave of the surgical site is done just prior to the surgery.\n\n【10】*   An anesthesiologist obtains anesthesia once ready for the surgery.\n\n【11】*   After the surgery, blood pressure and pulse are checked. The wound is drained and checked for any bleeding, and the urine output from the nephrostomy tube and catheter are monitored closely.\n\n【12】*   The intravenous line is still maintained in order to provide enough nutrients after the surgery. It is removed once the person is able to drink water normally.\n\n【13】*   One can drink on the first day of surgery as advised by the surgeon.\n\n【14】*   The next day after the surgery, the person will be able to wake up from bed and can eat and drink normally.\n\n【15】*   Until one is able to eat and drink properly, the intravenous line is still kept to keep them hydrated and provide nutrients as required.\n\n【16】*   Antibiotics and painkillers will be advised by the physician to prevent infection and reduce the pain from the surgery.\n\n【17】*   The surgeon advises regular deep breathing and leg exercises after the surgery until one is fully mobile.\n\n【18】*   The physiotherapist can come and advise the person on leg exercises and give further instructions.\n\n【19】*   If the wound drainage is minimal on the second or third day, then it will be removed. Also, the catheter is removed if the urine output is sufficient.\n\n【20】*   If the nephrostomy tube has been kept, it is also removed when the urine outflow is normal, as it would lead from the kidneys down to the bladder.\n\n【21】*   If there is no pain or leakage from the nephrectomy tube, it can be removed.\n\n【22】*   The length of treatment and need for antibiotics is different in each individual and can usually require two to three days.\n\n【23】*   Generally the second or third day after the surgery, all the drainage and nephrostomy tubes are removed.\n\n【24】*   If the suture placed is a dissolving one, then it need not be removed however if staples are used to stitch the wound, then they need to be removed within 7 to 10 days.\n\n【25】*   Once the nephrostomy tube, catheter, and wound drainage have been removed and the person is able to eat and drink on their own, then they will be able to go home.\n\n【26】*   If all the stone treatments have not been removed and further surgery is required, one will be sent with nephrectomy tube still on.\n\n【27】**What Are the Risks Associated With Open Pyelolithotomy?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】*   There is always a risk of infection and blood loss associated with surgery. Sometimes, a blood transfusion is necessary to compensate for the blood loss during surgery.\n\n【29】*   In some cases, the ureter needs to be incised during the surgery if a stone fragment is lodged firmly within the ureter causing scarring.\n\n【30】*   These ureteral strictures are usually treated with minor surgery that opens up the narrowing.\n\n【31】*   If a larger number of stones need to be removed during surgery, sometimes not all of them are removed and can require another surgery for the removal.\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】Open pyelolithotomy is a stone-removing procedure from within the renal pelvis part of the kidney (the funnel-shaped area for urine collection within the kidney) or from the ureter. The surgery is usually done through a 10 to 15 centimeter incision in the side of the body (flank) between the ribs and the hip, to expose the location of the stone. Open stone surgery, such as pyelolithotomy is generally reserved for the complex location of stones that causes blockage. Ongoing symptoms such as recurrent infection and pain also prevent the removal of stones using less invasive treatments.\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【35】无关删除-1:<u>*   Pyelolithotomy  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pyelolithotomy\n*   Open pyelolithotomy in an ectopic kidney: A case report  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7750556/\n*   Pyelolithotomy  \n    https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/448503-overview</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "63f11caa-8baf-4adb-ade3-9d8b0cd920e8", "title": "Itolizumab", "text": "【0】**Overview**\n\n【1】Itolizumab is Biocon’s second massive advanced ‘lab-to-market’ anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody. Itolizumab embarked on its journey from India in the year 2013. The brand name of Itolizumab is ALZUMAb™. Itolizumab is a promising drug used to treat severe psoriasis. Itolizumab proposes a barely antagonistic dosage administration. Itolizumab has latterly received a stamp of approval from the Drug Controller General of India as an unapproved use of an approved drug that is appropriate for cytokine release syndrome in the scenario of COVID-19 infection.\n\n【2】Biocon joined forces with Equillium in 2017 and manufactured Itolizumab in New Zealand Australia chiefly for autoimmune disorders. Itolizumab received an FDA approval or a US Food and Drug Administration approval for the correction and management of lupus nephritis and acute graft-versus-host-disease, also referred to as aGVHD. Itolizumab is committed to reducing the timeline of treatment with vitalizing results.\n\n【3】In addition to this, Itolizumab can be positively suggested for the management of multiple autoimmune disorders. Itolizumab has been given a green signal conditional on an emergency administration to revert cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 who are suffering from moderate to severe respiratory distress syndrome. This is based on a significant study that established end results that revealed a drastic drop in the mortality rate amongst patients suffering from the coronavirus and are going through moderate to severe respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n【4】**Itolizumab for Doctors:**\n\n【5】Itolizumab originally came into existence as a treatment modality for several kinds of cancer. It was later developed for the management of moderate to severe kinds of chronic psoriasis. Itolizumab has lately been remodeled for COVID-19 treatment. Due to the distinctive properties and mechanism of action in the improvement of cytokine release syndrome or CRS, being an anti-CD6 humanized monoclonal antibody that conquers T-cell activation. It disturbs the regular synthesis and production of proinflammatory cytokines as well as additional molecules. The possible effectiveness of Itolizumab was primarily put forward in Cuba after being accepted and approved post a single-arm clinical trial.\n\n【6】Later, following an acquisition of regulatory grants in India, a phase 2, open-labeled, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in thirty COVID-19 patients. On the grounds of the aggregate conclusions and results of these trials, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization of India-CDSCO, sanctioned Itolizumab in July 2020. Strictly for an emergency use in the treatment and management of cytokines release syndrome or CRS, restricted only in patients with moderate to severe form of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). And for the patients with an infection due to coronavirus. No standard phase 3 trials were conducted before being approved for the public domain. Though Itolizumab has fortunately accomplished a successful randomized control trial or RCT.\n\n【7】What Is the Mechanism of Action of Itolizumab?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Itolizumab is an improved anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody or mAb that perfectly targets the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain 1, also referred to as SRCS-1 of CD6. The molecular weight of Itolizumab is 148 kilodaltons. It consists of two light chains and two heavy chains that are connected to each other with a disulfide bond. A murine monoclonal antibody called IOR-T1 is the parent antibody of Itolizumab. Murine mAb IOR-T1 has been exhibiting curative as well as restorative potency in rheumatoid arthritis as well as psoriasis. Itolizumab is immunogenic but to a very lesser degree. The main reason for this is that Itolizumab is an advanced monoclonal antibody that is much more effective and holds a stronger safety rundown parallel to the beneficial effects of IOR-T1.\n\n【9】The cluster of differentiation 6 or CD6 is a human protein and is encoded by the CD6 gene. The CD6 gene codes for a protein that is based on the T-lymphocyte’s outer membrane. This particular gene encodes for a few other immune cells too. The product of the gene is extremely vital for the constant activation of T cells which are an important part of the immune system. Itolizumab is a surface glycoprotein and is directed against CD6, which is found on immature B cells, mature T cells, and the B1a subset of B lymphocytes. In addition to this, CD6 is also found in specific areas of the brain. The chief function of CD6 is the proliferation of cells, their adhesion, survival, and differentiation. The extracellular matrix of CD6 constitutes three scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains. Being a co-stimulatory molecule, CD6 stimulates the activation as well as differentiation of T cells. T cells are responsible for promoting a response that is proinflammatory in nature. Itolizumab is able to downregulate the amalgamation of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to inhibiting CD6. In addition to this, the adhesion molecules as well are not able to be synthesized. All of this eventually results in a decline of interferon-γ or IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α or TNF-α, and interleukin-6 or IL6. At respective inflammatory sites, T-cell infiltration also decreases.\n\n【10】All of these anti-inflammatory effects are not accomplished by impeding the binding of ligands and T-cell depletion; instead, the changing effects occur due to the holding back of the novel receptor genesis, internalization, and blockade or downregulation of these receptors. Experiments have been conducted in vitro and have displayed Itolizumab to not be the cause of T-cell depletion but instead the cause for cessation of the proliferation of T cells. This happens in the existence of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecules, also referred to as ALCAM or CD 166. As well as an increased amount of interleukin-6, Itolizumab thus downregulates the implicated phosphorylation of intercellular proteins present in the activation pathways that are mediated by CD-6. By following this unique and distinctive mechanism of action, Itolizumab is successfully capable of inhibiting the cascade of downstream inflammation hence, avoiding a cytokine storm.\n\n【11】What Is the Principle That Itolizumab Works On?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Cytokine release syndrome or CRS-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS is a phenomenon that is exposed to those patients who are suffering from a dreadful COVID-19 infection. During such a severe case of COVID-19, the production and release of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α or TNF-α, interleukins, interferon γ or IFNγ, as well as several other cytokines mediators become highly unrestricted. This phenomenon is parallel to a drastic acute inflammatory response by the immune system, and it has a strong potential to destroy and malfunction numerous vital organs. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury are amongst the two most reported grievous complications in patients suffering from COVID-19 due to the above-mentioned phenomenon. Such patients have to be transferred to the intensive care units of the respective hospital setup, where the elevated levels of mediators and cytokines present in the plasma of COVID-19 patients are thoroughly examined. COVID-19 patients have been documented to possess 2.9 times soaring fold interleukin 6 or IL6 congregation as opposed to patients with diseases that do not have many complications.\n\n【13】The amendment of cytokine release syndrome is a crucial management approach in order to take the edge off life-threatening systemic as well as pulmonary complications in COVID-19 patients. This will, in turn, strongly diminish the abiding requirement of transferring and observing the patient under mechanical ventilation or intensive care facility. On the basis of this strategy of substantially bringing down the hyperinflammatory state of the pulmonary system in COVID-19 patients via harmonizing the cytokine release syndrome, multiple RCTs, or randomized controlled trials of interleukin 6 or IL6 inhibitors are studying their future perspectives in severely affected COVID-19 patients all around the world.\n\n【14】What Are the Pharmacodynamic Properties of Itolizumab?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Itolizumab is an isotope that links with the CD6 domain 1. The antigen of CD6 leukocyte differentiation is mainly seen in most of the peripheral blood CD3+ T cells. CD6 takes part in the activation of cells in peripheral blood T cells as a co-stimulatory molecule. It has been established in various preclinical studies of T cells that the antibody blocks MAPK or intracellular Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase as well as STAT-3 or Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3. A span of in vitro as well as in vivo studies in mice about the pharmacological properties of Itolizumab has exemplified the reaction with human CD6 as well as the therapeutic accuracy of Itolizumab in SCID-Hu or severe combined immunodeficiency disease-human xenograft model of psoriasis.\n\n【16】What Are the Pharmacokinetic Properties of Itolizumab?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The data about the pharmacokinetics of Itolizumab in patients suffering from psoriasis is purely based on the data from the phase 2 study. The parameters of Itolizumab regarding its pharmacokinetics were recorded after treatment of over eight weeks, followed by a treatment-free of four weeks. The dosage at which Itolizumab was administered ranges from 0.4 mg/kg to 1.6 mg/kg. It was administered via an intravenous route. ELISA or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure was done in order to check the levels of Itolizumab in samples of serum. A relationship that is dose-dependent and linear was observed for multiple pharmacokinetic criteria.\n\n【18】After the administration of the first dose of Itolizumab, the Cmax of the average maximum concentration of the drug as well as the area beneath the concentration-time curve or AUC 0-1 determiner procured after the initial and last infusion escalated as per the dose. The first dose was 0.4 mg/kg, 08. mg/kg given once weekly, or once in two weeks, or even once in four weeks. The final dose was 1.6 mg/kg and was administered once in two weeks or even once in four weeks. The increase in concentration-time curve in addition to the serum trough concentration along with increasing the frequency with the dosage of Itolizumab administration points out the obvious concentration after every frequent administration. On the other hand, with less frequency of administering the drug, there was a marginal increase in the volume distribution and clearance. The medial t½ or half-life of Itolizumab after the final dosage possessed a range from 11.72 to 18.51 days across all the combinations of various dosage-frequencies.\n\n【19】What Are the Clinical Trials Done for the Treatment of COVID-19 With Itolizumab?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】A significant phase 2, open-labeled, multi-centric, two-arm, randomized clinical trial was executed on thirty patients in India. Mentioned below are the clinical manifestations and characteristics of the thirty patients as a whole, who were part of this pivotal trial with Itolizumab.\n\n【21】*   All the individuals were adults who were above 18 years of age.\n\n【22】*   Gender of both male and female, participated in the trials.\n\n【23】*   All the participants had a confirmed diagnosis of virological severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus 2 infections or SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【24】*   The virological diagnosis was done with RT-PCR or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay.\n\n【25】*   All the participants had been hospitalized because of clinical deterioration and worsening effects of COVID-19 infection.\n\n【26】*   The mean oxygen saturation level of the patients in ambient air was less than or equal to 94 %.\n\n【27】*   The ratio between the arterial oxygen partial pressure or PaO2 and fractional inspired oxygen or FiO2 defined the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome among the suffering patients.\n\n【28】*   The average PaO2/FiO2 was less than 200. In other words, the arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen had a deterioration of more than 25 % as compared to the instantaneous preceding value.\n\n【29】*   If there was any hindrance in the results of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay, biomarker data was mandatory to allow patients to participate in the study.\n\n【30】*   A baseline serum ferritin level of more than or equal to 400 ng/mL and interleukin 6 levels of more than four times the ULN or upper limit or normal were the two options of biomarker data.\n\n【31】There were certain systemic conditions and diseases in patients that did not make them suitable to be included in the clinical trial of Itolizumab. Mentioned below are the medical reasons that excluded patients from participating in the clinical trials.\n\n【32】Patients with,\n\n【33】*   A history of severe anaphylactic reaction to monoclonal antibodies.\n\n【34】*   A long-standing history of hepatitis B and C.\n\n【35】*   A history of tuberculosis that has been treated but inadequately.\n\n【36】*   A platelet counts less than 50,000/mm cube.\n\n【37】*   An absolute neutrophil count or ANC less than 1000/mm cube.\n\n【38】*   An established lymphocyte count or ALC less than 500/mm cube.\n\n【39】*   Latent tuberculosis.\n\n【40】*   Patients suffering from an active infection of human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, tuberculosis or TB.\n\n【41】*   Patients who are actively intaking immunosuppressant medications or have consumed immunosuppressant medication in the last six months.\n\n【42】*   Patients who earlier participated in alternative clinical drug trials and had undergone anti-interleukin 6 therapy.\n\n【43】Keeping all the above conditions and criteria in mind, the dose of Itolizumab was approved and eventually administered as a loading dose of 1.6 mg/kg. The reason for choosing this particular dosage is because of its traditional usage in patients suffering from chronic plaque psoriasis through intravenous or IV infusion. This specific dose has been administered in various phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials and has no evidence of the date of dose-limiting toxicities. After 1 week, in a few patients, administration of 0.8 mg/kg as an additional dose, depending on the physician’s or the health care provider’s judgment, was given when necessary. In this study, permission for up to four weekly doses was granted.\n\n【44】Twenty patients were randomized to intake Itolizumab in addition to supportive care. On the other hand, ten patients were given supportive care solely in the control arm. This took place with a 2:1 randomization. The chief result was the juxtaposition of the mortality rate of one month between the two arms. The subordinate consequences were lymphocyte count, plasma levels of biomarkers, radiological response, C-reactive protein or CRP, PaO2/FiO2, time spell of hospitalization as well as suspension of respiratory symptoms.\n\n【45】The entirety of patients administered with Itolizumab recovered completely and were discharged. On the flip side, 30 % or three out of ten patients passed away from amongst the control arm. Adding to this, there was a drastic change on a positive note in factors that were crucial for the standard functioning of the lungs oxygen saturation or SpO2 and PaO2. There was no increase in the flow of oxygen in the Itolizumab arm.\n\n【46】Opposite the control arm, every patient who had received Itolizumab was detached from oxygen by the thirtieth day, and there was no requirement for ventilator support as well. There was a remarkable decline in the secondary key endpoints of the inflammatory clinical markers after the administration of Itolizumab. The inflammatory markers comprise interleukin 6, serum ferritin, tumor necrosis factor α, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase or LDH, as well as c-reactive protein. This result was directly proportional to the radiological and clinical correction of symptoms, including chest radiographs. Therefore, it was concluded that Itolizumab was exceptionally tolerated as a whole and was also established to be safe in addition to infusion reactions that can be brought down by a moderate and unrushed rate of infusion.\n\n【47】The above outcomes of this particular clinical trial are parallel to the results of a non-controlled, single-arm clinical trial of a Cuban study that included eighty patients suffering from COVID-19 and had been treated with Itolizumab. The study asserts the discharge of severely affected COVID-19 patients from the intensive care unit or ICU to be 79 % post fourteen days of continuous treatment. On the flip side, patients who were moderately sick presented with a substantial drop in the rate of progression of the disease.\n\n【48】Another study done in Sprague-Dawley rats with a single and repeated dose toxicity disclosed that Itolizumab was tolerated efficiently with NOAEL or no observed adverse effect level. The dosage for this study was set to 16 mg/kg/day.\n\n【49】Currently, preprint servers have two clinical studies on COVID-19 patients and treatment with Itolizumab. These studies are from the above mentioned trial done in Cuba. One of the two studies shows that post 48 hours of a single dose of Itolizumab administration, 24 moderate to severely sick older patients suffering from COVID-19 had a remarkable curtailment of the levels of serum interleukin 6. In the other study, it was concluded by the authors that Itolizumab medication and treatment in nineteen moderately suffering older patients with COVID-19 showed a notable narrowing of the risk of being admitted to intensive care units in addition to a tenfold reduced risk of a fatal outcome.\n\n【50】What Are the Safety and Monitoring Aspects of Itolizumab?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【51】There has not been a detailed investigation nor several trials and studies done regarding the safety and monitoring aspects of Itolizumab. Among the few trials conducted, two multicenter clinical trials are the main source of the collected data on the safety and monitoring of Itolizumab.\n\n【52】The trials were done on patients with chronic psoriasis. Another study imparts little data regarding the same that was done on patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. There has not been any documentation of adverse effects that were related to the treatment during the above trials. There has only been an observation of infusion-related adverse effects amongst approximately 12 % to 15 % of patients.\n\n【53】Nevertheless, it had also been noticed that the rate of such infusion related reactions drastically dwindled post subsequent infusions. Additionally, infusion related sensitivity or reactions is one of the most common adverse effects of Itolizumab with clinical features such as those mentioned below.\n\n【54】*   Urticaria.\n\n【55】*   Flushing.\n\n【56】*   Wheezing.\n\n【57】*   Headache.\n\n【58】*   Nausea.\n\n【59】*   Dizziness.\n\n【60】*   Rash.\n\n【61】*   Dyspnea.\n\n【62】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【63】*   Cough.\n\n【64】Other adverse effects were as follows,\n\n【65】*   Elevation in body temperature due to an infection.\n\n【66】*   Skin irritation or pruritis.\n\n【67】*   Formation of anti-drug antibodies.\n\n【68】*   A short-lived decline of mean lymphocyte count.\n\n【69】*   Infections of the upper respiratory tract.\n\n【70】Based on the above established adverse effects, it is not safe for patients to utilize Itolizumab who have a history of recurring infections or an active infection. Administration of Itolizumab is not safe even for the below-mentioned categories of individuals.\n\n【71】*   Children.\n\n【72】*   Lactating women.\n\n【73】*   Pregnant women.\n\n【74】*   Latent tuberculosis infection.\n\n【75】*   Patients with renal impairment.\n\n【76】*   Patients suffering from hepatitis.\n\n【77】The channel of action of Itolizumab in order to treat and manage cytokine release syndrome connected with COVID-19 is not the same as that of several other interleukin inhibitors or numerous other discerning approaches that are quite immunomodulatory. The reason for this is that the chief principle of Itolizumab is to discriminate and judiciously target the CD6-ALCAM pathways, or the CD6-activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecules.\n\n【78】The result of this selective targeting is a clearcut drop in the proliferation, activation as well as differentiation of T cells in the direction of effector T cells that are pathogenic in nature. In addition to this, there is a significant amount of reduction in the formation and release of proinflammatory cytokines that include tumor necrosis factor α, interferon γ, and interleukin 6.\n\n【79】Along the way, T-cell infiltration is also decreased. On the other hand, the Treg cells do not have any alteration in their regulatory function hence it is preserved. It is believed that this mechanism of action followed by Itolizumab may perhaps be a more suitable approach to immunomodulatory factors for tackling acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by cytokine release syndrome in severely affected COVID-19 patients.\n\n【80】Thus, the rationale for utilizing Itolizumab in this scenario of cytokine release syndrome induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients is the capability and potential of Itolizumab to halt the synthesis of cytokines that are highly proinflammatory in nature instead of merely inhibiting and diminishing the cytokines as performed by alternative agents.\n\n【81】**Itolizumab for Patients:**\n\n【82】What Is the Composition of Itolizumab?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【83】Itolizumab is a humanized recombinant anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody. Itolizumab injection comes with the trading name ALZUMAb™. It has been allowed for use by strictly registered dermatologists as well as medical practitioners or laboratories, and hospitals. The pharmaceutical form of Itolizumab injection is a colorless, transparent solution.\n\n【84】Mentioned below is the composition of each 5 ml vial of Itolizumab injection.\n\n【85】*   Itolizumab 25 mg, r-DNA origin.\n\n【86】*   Single-use vial.\n\n【87】*   Intravenous or IV infusion.\n\n【88】What Are the Preclinical Safety Data of Itolizumab?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【89】Any prolonged study on animals has not been organized in order to gauge the mutagenic potential, carcinogenic potential as well as effects of Itolizumab on fertility.\n\n【90】What Are the Therapeutic Indications of Itolizumab?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【91】It should be noted that, Itolizumab received approval for restricted emergency administration in order to manage patients suffering from COVID-19 along with moderate to severe levels of complications of ARDS, when hospitalizations with COVID-19 positive rates were surging at a distressing count. The main intention of Itolizumab is to save the lives of a particular subset of patients suffering from COVID-19. The candidates that are suitable for undergoing therapy and treatment with Itolizumab are the ones who are suffering from active chronic plaque psoriasis that is moderate and severe in nature.\n\n【92】What Are the Contraindications of Itolizumab?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【93】Itolizumab should not be used in conjunction with alternative approved medications for the treatment of plaque psoriasis or other biological agents in order to avoid the possibility and risk of developing an infection or elevating immunosuppression. Mentioned below are the contraindications of Itolizumab,\n\n【94】*   Patients who have a known history of severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction to the ingredients of Itolizumab.\n\n【95】*   Patients have a known hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to any murine proteins.\n\n【96】*   Patients suffering from any serious active infections, human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis and HIV.\n\n【97】*   Patients suffering from low absolute lymphocyte and neutrophil count.\n\n【98】What Are the Limitations of Use of Itolizumab?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【99】Patients should be screened using the Mantoux test as well as chest X-rays for any active or latent tuberculosis. The healthcare provider should be alert while administering Itolizumab in patients with hepatitis C and B infection. Patients who have received or are still receiving chronic steroid therapy. The efficacy, as well as safety of Itolizumab, has not been examined in the below-mentioned cases.\n\n【100】*   Pediatric patients.\n\n【101】*   Patients less than eighteen years of age.\n\n【102】*   Patients with renal insufficiency.\n\n【103】*   Patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【104】*   Pregnant patients.\n\n【105】*   Lactating patients.\n\n【106】Can Vaccinations Be Taken During Itolizumab Therapy?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【107】There is no evidence of retaliation to vaccination with Itolizumab. Depending on the mechanism of action of Itolizumab, it is believed that Itolizumab may hamper the effectiveness of live or attenuated vaccines. The gap between vaccination and starting the treatment with Itolizumab should be in line with the latest guidelines on vaccinations. Special precautions should be considered while vaccinating newborns who are born to patients being treated with Itolizumab because of the potential of Itolizumab to cross the placental barrier.\n\n【108】Can Itolizumab Be Used in Pregnancy?\n------------------------------------\n\n【109】Itolizumab, being a monoclonal antibody or IgG antibody, may pose the potential of crossing the placental barrier during pregnancy. There are no details or records if Itolizumab can definitely lead to any harm to the fetus in case administered to a pregnant patient. There are no established results of any reproductive infertility or reduction in reproductive capacity as well.\n\n【110】Can Itolizumab Be Used in Lactating Females?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【111】There is no data to confirm the presence or absence of Itolizumab in human milk. There is no proof of Itolizumab being absorbed after digestion systematically. Since there are many medications that do have high chances of being absorbed and excreted in human milk, as well as keeping in mind the adverse effects that may erupt in newborns, a decision to go ahead with Itolizumab therapy in lactating females needs to be made by the healthcare provider.\n\n【112】What Are Some Undesirable Effects of Itolizumab?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【113】The clinical trials of Itolizumab have not been conducted under hugely varying circumstances. Thus the adverse reactions or any undesirable effects of Itolizumab may not be predicted amongst a broader population of patients. Nevertheless, at least 1 % of patients treated with Itolizumab had experienced any of the below-mentioned undesirable effects of Itolizumab. It should also be noted that the most frequently reported adverse effect is an infusion related reaction to Itolizumab.\n\n【114】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【115】*   Vomiting.\n\n【116】*   Toothache.\n\n【117】*   Gastritis.\n\n【118】*   Peripheral swelling.\n\n【119】*   Chest pain.\n\n【120】*   Gastrointestinal inflammation.\n\n【121】*   Generalized pain.\n\n【122】*   Abscess.\n\n【123】*   Gastroenteritis.\n\n【124】*   Folliculitis.\n\n【125】*   Bacterial lymphadenitis bacteria.\n\n【126】*   Tuberculosis of lymph nodes.\n\n【127】*   Rhinitis.\n\n【128】*   Tooth abscess.\n\n【129】*   Oral herpes.\n\n【130】*   Pyrexia.\n\n【131】*   Urinary tract infection.\n\n【132】*   Dehydration.\n\n【133】*   Hypertriglyceridemia.\n\n【134】*   Hepatic steatosis.\n\n【135】*   Musculoskeletal pain.\n\n【136】*   Arthralgia.\n\n【137】*   Backache.\n\n【138】*   Pain in the limbs and extremities.\n\n【139】*   Headache.\n\n【140】*   Peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【141】*   Anxiety.\n\n【142】*   Adjustment disorder.\n\n【143】*   Dysuria.\n\n【144】*   Septic arthritis.\n\n【145】*   Exfoliative dermatitis.\n\n【146】*   Erythrodermic psoriasis.\n\n【147】*   Pruritus.\n\n【148】*   Upper respiratory tract infection.\n\n【149】*   Rhinorrhea skin.\n\n【150】*   Cough.\n\n【151】*   Oropharyngeal pain.\n\n【152】*   Keloid scar.\n\n【153】What Happens During an Overdose of Itolizumab?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【154】There has not been any evidence of dose-limiting toxicities in any of the clinical trials done with Itolizumab. There have not been any adverse effects in patients who had participated in clinical trials and received a dose of Itolizumab of up to 23.2 mg along with a cumulative dose of 50 mg in the initial week of therapy. In case of any overdose, management should be instituted based on the manifesting symptoms as soon as possible.\n\n【155】**Conclusion**\n\n【156】Itolizumab is a top-tier, anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody that was mainly manufactured for the treatment of several cancers. Later, Itolizumab was developed in India for the treatment and correction of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Itolizumab got its approval in 2013. Currently, it is being remodeled for COVID-19 infection. The potential use of Itolizumab in COVID-19 is based on its one-of-a-kind mechanism of action in reforming cytokine release syndrome or CRS that was initially proposed in Cuba with a green signal for a single-arm clinical trial along with an inflated use.\n\n【157】Eventually, a phase 2, open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in India. Based on the outcomes of the trials, the drug regulatory agency of India, recently gave a stamp of approval to Itolizumab strictly for ‘restricted emergency use’ during the management of cytokine release syndrome storm in patients suffering from moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome because of being infected with COVID-19. At this point, a reluctant approach is necessary while using Itolizumab for the treatment of COVID-19. The publication of the trial data from the Indian as well as the Cuban studies and trials may prove to give satisfactory answers to some of the crucial questions raised.\n\n【158】As of today, Itolizumab does provide healthcare providers with a treatment option to potentially save human life in a specific subset of COVID-19 patients. There definitely is an urgent call to refine and improve the healthcare provider’s understanding and knowledge of Itolizumab, its mechanisms of action as well as its side effects. Due to its limited use in the past, in addition to a lack of adequate trials, there may be more to Itolizumab than what meets the eye. It is mandatory and a crucial duty of all healthcare professionals who have made a decision to employ Itolizumab in the management and treatment of COVID-19 induced cytokine storms to report any adverse effects. This will aid in understanding the safety protocol and profile of Itolizumab.\n\n【159】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【160】无关删除-1:<u>*   Efficacy and safety of itolizumab, a novel anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0190962214010287\n*   Approval of Itolizumab for COVID-19: A Premature Decision or Need of The Hour?  \n    https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40259-020-00448-5\n*   Itolizumab  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4407739/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Hummus May Inspire One to Have Healthier Food Items:**\n\n【35】Hummus is a part of the Mediterranean diet, one of the best diets to adopt. It incorporates smaller segments of meat, more vegetables, great hummus, marine food, and healthy fats such as extra virgin olive oil and nuts. If someone is already consuming hummus, it may inspire him to change and adapt to this healthier diet.\n\n【36】**Conclusion:**\n\n【37】Hummus is packed with bountiful nutrients and is a must for everyone, irrespective of allergies, dietary patterns, or health issues.

Pain ranges from mild to severe and pain commonly persists for 15 to 30 minutes. More significant pain is caused b the exposed internal anal sphincter that frequently spasms. In prolonged conditions, tissues become hypertrophied leading to non-healing anal fissures.\n\n【2】There are several medical therapies including slaves, topical nitroglycerine, and fiber that aids in the spontaneous closure of disease. Surgical therapies include fissurectomy, advancement flaps, botulinum toxin injections, and lateral anal sphincterotomy. Surgical intervention is indicated for chronic fissures that fail to heal by medical therapy.\n\n【3】**What Are the Symptoms of Anal Fissure?**\n\n【4】Anal fissures cause sharp pain during bowel movement. This can last from 15 minutes to several hours. Other symptoms are:\n\n【5】*   Painful and visible crack on the skin surrounding the anus.\n\n【6】*   Lumps and skin tags on the surface near the anal fissure.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Can anal fissure cause itching and infected skin between anus and genital area?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Lateral Internal Sphincterotomy - Indications, Contraindications, Benefits, Procedure, and Complications</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    How can anal fissure be treated?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Bloody painful stools.\n    </u>\n\n【8】What Is Anal Sphincterotomy?\n----------------------------\n\n【9】Anal sphincterotomy is also called lateral internal sphincterotomy. It is a type of treatment used to treat individuals who suffer from anal fissures. Anal fissures tears and break the skin of the anal canal. Anal sphincterotomy is the last resort for anal fissures. This is used when the conditions fail to resolve by stool softeners, a high-fiber diet, or botox first. If the symptoms worsen anal sphincterotomy is offered.\n\n【10】What Are the Indications of Anal Sphincterotomy?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Anal sphincterotomy is indicated in individuals who fail at least six weeks of conservative medical management. In most cases, individuals go to medical management for at least one to three months. If this fails, surgery is the only option left. The individuals who are eligible candidates for surgery must have good fecal continence before the procedure so the risk of postoperative fecal incontinence is reduced.\n\n【12】What Are the Contraindications of Anal Sphincterotomy?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Individuals with poor anal incontinence are not appropriate candidates for this procedure. Atypical anal fissure location is fully evaluated before any surgical interventions, any complicated location candidates are not recommended for this surgery.\n\n【14】What Is Done Prior to the Procedure Anal Sphincterotomy?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Sphincterotomy is a minor surgery, individuals need to follow certain instructions that the healthcare provider provides. For administering GA (general anesthesia), restriction on food and drinking is done a night prior to the surgery. Blood thinners and other medications that may affect blood clotting need to be stopped for some days prior to the surgery. It is important to keep the healthcare provider informed about the current medications that are being taken.\n\n【16】Individuals would not be able to drive back home on their own so they need some help to accompany them. A detailed medical history, drugs, supplements, and medication taken are recorded.\n\n【17】What Is the Technique Used in Anal Sphincterotomy?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The individual undergoing the surgery is positioned as per the surgeon's preference. The individual is draped and prepped for the procedure. A Hill- Ferguson retractor or an anoscope is inserted and the canal is inspected for any gross pathology. The fissure or hemorrhoid present is excised and removed. An absorbable suture is then used on reapproximated anal mucosa. The procedure can either be continued by an open fashion or closed fashion technique.\n\n【19】1.  **Open Fashion:** Radial-oriented incision over the inter sphincteric groove is made through the anoderm, which exposes internal anal sphincter muscle fibers. A hemostat or similar instrument is used to elevate the external anal sphincter. Using electrocautery to the level of the dentate line this muscle is divided. Adequate hemostasis is used to prevent any postoperative bleeding complications. The site is left open to let it heal by second intention or closed by an absorbable suture.\n\n【20】2.  **Closed Fashion:** In this technique, 11- a blade scalpel is inserted in the anal canal is inserted into inter sphincteric plane. The blade is removed medially dividing the internal sphincter. The incision is left open for healing by secondary intention.\n\n【21】**How Is It to Recover With Anal Sphincterotomy?**\n\n【22】Recovering from this surgery normally takes about six weeks for the anus to fully heal, most individuals can resume their normal activities including work within one to two weeks after surgery. Pain from anal fissures before surgery disappears within a few days of having an anal sphincterotomy. It is normal to experience pain during bowel movements, which reduces to a great extent after the surgery. Things that can help aid in the recovery are:\n\n【23】*   Try to walk a little each day after the surgery.\n\n【24】*   Eat a high-fiber diet.\n\n【25】*   Get plenty of rest.\n\n【26】*   Drink plenty of fluids.\n\n【27】*   Shower bath, as usual, pat dry anal area after a shower.\n\n【28】*   If struggling with constipation the patient must ask the healthcare provider to give a mild laxative and stool softener.\n\n【29】*   Instructions as to when to drive again from the healthcare provider have to be followed.\n\n【30】*   Take prescribed pain medications.\n\n【31】*   Take a sitz bath (sitting around 10 cm of warm water daily and after bowel movements until the pain in the anal area subsides).\n\n【32】*   Try passing stools in a squatting position this will help in passing stools easily.\n\n【33】*   Instead of toilet paper using baby wipes is recommended to avoid further irritation to the anus.\n\n【34】*   Avoid the usage of fragranced soaps.\n\n【35】What Are the Complications Associated With Anal Sphincterotomy?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】The main complication associated with anal sphincterotomy is anal incontinence. Around 50 percent of individuals experience transient incontinence, this is the inability to control gas to loss of formed stool resulting in spiling. Anal incontinence resolves in major cases. The rate of major incontinence is an involuntary loss of feces is less than two percent. Experts suggest limiting sphincterotomy to the length of the fissure, which reduces the risk of incontinence. Sometimes other complications associated are an increased risk for non-healing fissures and recurrent fissures. Other minor complications are bleeding, infection, fistula development, pain and discomfort, trouble passing stools, clotting, reduced quality of life, and inability to control gas and bowel movements.\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】Anal fissures lead to poor quality of life due to inadequate and inappropriate treatment. Primary care is always necessary and the individual should be referred to a colorectal surgeon, because if the condition is left untreated it may lead to enormous morbidity. This condition is together well managed by an interprofessional team including a general surgeon, dietitian, gastroenterologist, and colorectal surgeon. Appropriate treatment is required for anal fissures in adults that would prevent fecal incontinence.\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>*   Lateral Internal Sphincterotomy: What to Expect at Home  \n    https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.lateral-internal-sphincterotomy-what-to-expect-at-home.ud1292\n*   Internal Anal Sphincterotomy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493213/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Bleeding may be more common in elderly people, particularly women over the age of 60.\n\n【27】Stop using heparin in case of :\n\n【28】*   Skin changes where the medicine was injected.\n\n【29】*   Fever, chills, runny nose, or watery eyes.\n\n【30】*   Easy bruising, unusual bleeding, purple or red spots under the skin.\n\n【31】*   Signs of a blood clot include sudden numbness or weakness, problems with vision or speech, swelling, or redness in an arm or leg.\n\n【32】What Are the Causes of Heparin Overdose?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【33】*   Heparin overdose is most commonly caused by a mistake in the medication dosage, either when a healthcare provider prescribes an incorrect dose or when the patient takes more than the prescribed amount.\n\n【34】*   Using the medication for longer than recommended or using it in combination with other blood-thinning medications can also cause an overdose.\n\n【35】*   In some cases, an overdose may occur due to an interaction between Heparin and another medication the patient is taking.\n\n【36】*   A rare cause of Heparin overdose is HIT (Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) which is an allergic-like reaction to Heparin that can lead to the formation of blood clots and a decrease in platelets.\n\n【37】*   In cases where the overdose is caused by HIT, the patient may experience symptoms such as fever, skin rash, and abdominal pain in addition to the symptoms of an overdose.\n\n【38】What Is the Treatment Plan for a Heparin Overdose?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】The treatment for a Heparin overdose will depend on the severity of the overdose and the individual's overall health. For mild overdose, the healthcare provider may simply stop the medication and monitor the patient for any complications.\n\n【40】In more severe cases, the healthcare provider may administer a medication called Protamine sulfate to counteract the effects of Heparin. Protamine sulfate, also known by its generic name, is a medication that belongs to the class of anti-heparin agents. It works by neutralizing the effects of Heparin in cases of overdose. The mechanism of action of Protamine sulfate is that it forms a stable salt with heparin, which neutralizes the anticoagulant activity of both drugs. It is mainly used to treat Heparin overdose, but it is less effective against low molecular weight heparin. The onset of action of Protamine sulfate is rapid and it neutralizes heparin within five minutes. However, it may cause a sudden drop in blood pressure and bradycardia when administered through an intravenous route. Other side effects include flushing, warmth sensation, breathing difficulties, nausea, vomiting, and feeling of tiredness. Anaphylaxis is also a reported side effect of the drug. It should be avoided with certain antibiotics, such as Cephalosporins and Penicillin.\n\n【41】In some cases, blood transfusions may be necessary to replace the blood loss caused by the overdose. This is especially important if the patient is experiencing severe bleeding or if their hemoglobin levels are low. If the overdose is caused by HIT, the patient will need to be treated with alternative anticoagulants. It is important to note that once bleeding has started, it is difficult to stop. If there is any doubt about the safety of continuing Heparin, it is best to discontinue it and let the bleeding stop on its own.\n\n【42】In addition to the specific treatment for the overdose, the healthcare provider may also provide supportive care for the patient. This may include administering oxygen, providing pain relief, and monitoring the patient's vital signs.\n\n【43】**Conclusion:**\n\n【44】In conclusion, Heparin is a widely used anticoagulant medication that prevents blood clots from forming in the body. It is used for a variety of indications such as treating and preventing venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, and peripheral arterial embolism. However, Heparin overdose can occur due to a mistake in the medication dosage, using the medication for longer than recommended, or using it in combination with other blood-thinning medications. The treatment for Heparin overdose includes administering Protamine sulfate to counteract the effects of the heparin, blood transfusions, and providing supportive care. It is important to use the medication as directed by the healthcare provider and to seek medical attention immediately if an overdose is suspected.\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>*   Inadvertent Overdose of Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin in an Elderly Patient with Deep Vein Thrombosis and Acute Kidney Injury  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5008429/\n*   Management of intentional overdose of low-molecular-weight heparin  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8900780/\n*   Heparin  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538247/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Because these lesions cannot heal independently, they might eventually cause escalating discomfort and functional limitations. Isolated cartilage lesions may develop into global or progressive chondrogenic (complete loss of cartilage) if left untreated. It is frequently associated with acute ligament or meniscus injuries (C-shaped cartilage that serves as a stress absorber between the shinbone and the thigh bone, injured by the sudden forceful twist of the knee), dislocations of patellar (a jumping muscle located at the thigh which extends your knee to promote kicking, running and jumping) and osteochondral injuries or may develop from chronic ligamentous instability or malalignment. These wounds frequently prevent an athlete from participating in sports and put them at risk of developing early joint degeneration.\n\n【2】What Is Cartilage Injury of the Knee?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【3】Cartilage is the flexible tissue that is engaged between the joints to promote smooth or gliding movements when the knee bends, eventually absorbing the shock while running, kicking, and jumping. Unfortunately, cartilage is more prone to injury and cannot heal spontaneously due to its lack of blood supply within the tissue. The knee joint is composed of three bones – the thigh bone (femur), the shin bone (tibia), and the kneecap (patella). Articular cartilage, a tough, white, Teflon-like substance that covers the ends of the bones, aids in the smooth mobility of bones during joint action. A direct hit to the knee, a twisting or pivoting injury, or the articular cartilage potentially causes damage. It is also known as chondral injury. Damage to the cartilage tissue results in knee pain brought on by joint friction, and the cartilage injury occasionally causes arthritis. Cartilage knee injury is common among athletes by accident, leading to tearing meniscus during sports such as tennis, hockey, football, or skiing.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Cartilage Injury of the Knee?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The major cause of cartilage injury in the knee is trauma while playing a sport that involves rotating or bowing the knee. It might harm cartilage and loosens it from underlying bone. Athletes who participate in sports requiring cutting, jumping, turning, quick retraction, and changing direction are more prone to cartilage injury. The sports which commonly engage in these activities are football, basketball, and handball. Other major causes are aging which can lead to osteoarthritis, which makes the person more prone to cartilage injury. Occasionally, cartilage lesions can happen independently and commonly co-occur with ligament and meniscus injuries.\n\n【6】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Cartilage Injury?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The cartilage injury is generally asymptomatic. However, the partially torn cartilage typically does not heal independently and frequently worsens over time. The most common symptoms are:\n\n【8】*   Predominant joint pain while sitting and lying down.\n\n【9】*   Joint stiffness while bending the knee or elbow.\n\n【10】*   Swelling on the affected site.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Do you think that my doctor's suggestion is right regarding my DVT and knee injury?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    It hurts to walk or bend the knee due to a greenish scab after a knee injury.

High-impact sports like football, basketball, soccer, and tennis are more prone to cause cartilage injuries due to sports accidents on the field or may be due to bad technique during a move. The most common cause of injuries while playing sports are:\n\n【18】*   Knee contact with a hard surface.\n\n【19】*   A rough landing or terrible fall after a jump.\n\n【20】*   Sudden twisting or bending.\n\n【21】*   Overextending or overstraining the knee while playing.\n\n【22】*   Overuse or repeated action of the specific area.\n\n【23】How to Diagnose Cartilage Injury?\n---------------------------------\n\n【24】Initially, the diagnosis of knee cartilage damage is based on physical examination, mainly with tenderness, stiffness, swelling, and movement difficulties. The investigations are X-ray and MRI.\n\n【25】*   X-rays are done to confirm the presence of arthritis and additionally check for the alignment of the knee joint and degenerative changes.\n\n【26】*   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is done to evaluate the damage to soft tissue like cartilage, tendons, and muscle.\n\n【27】What Are the Possible Treatment Options for Cartilage Injury?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】The course of treatment will depend on the severity of the injury. Cartilage lacks a source of blood flow, which would aid in the healing process; hence, it cannot repair itself after injury. Rarely some cartilage cells can repair independently; however, medical aids are required for a complete cure. Damage to the cartilage, when left untreated, can eventually cause arthritis and excruciating joint pain. The effective treatment options are.\n\n【29】*   **RICE:** Rest, ice, compression, and elevation are the four major factors that aid in the initial stage of treatment. Athletes are advised to have plenty of rest and halt sports practice. Ice pack compression and elevation decrease the swelling and inflammation at the affected site.\n\n【30】*   **Physical Therapy:** Exercise strengthens the muscles surrounding your joints, reducing discomfort and minimizing the risk of future injuries.\n\n【31】*   **Injections:** Using platelets extracted from the patient's blood or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) helps manage pain and promotes recovery.\n\n【32】*   **Surgery:** When non-operative treatment and regenerative injections don't respond, surgery is required to repair the severely injured cartilage. The types of surgery depend on the severity of the injury.\n\n【33】However, cartilage injury can be prevented by regular, high-impact activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and adhering to preventative programs for other sports injuries like ACL(Anterior Cruciate Ligament).\n\n【34】What Are the Types of Surgery for Cartilage Injuries?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】The surgery depends on the severity of the injury after evaluating the injury, medical history, and joint movement.\n\n【36】*   **Microfracture:** Tiny holes are made in the bone beneath the cartilage. These openings provide a blood supply, which aids the cartilage cells in healing.\n\n【37】*   **Osteochondral Transfer System (OATS):** The damaged portion of the cartilage is replaced with a healthy portion taken from the knee.\n\n【38】*   **Meniscus Repair:** Meniscus is the shock-absorbing cartilage between your shin and thigh. Severely injured meniscus are transplanted from a donor's healthy meniscus.\n\n【39】*   **Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI):** ACI is frequently suggested for young athletes. The cartilage of the patient is obtained and developed into a personalized implant.\n\n【40】**Conclusion:**\n\n【41】Recently, cartilage regeneration and several surgical procedures have been developed. To satisfy the demands of these novel procedures, rehabilitation standards are being created to improve the biology of articular cartilage repair and additionally repair cartilage tissue that can sustain the intense mechanical stresses when athletes twist or bend a knee spontaneously.\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>*   Articular Cartilage Injury in Athletes  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4297068/\n*   Knee Cartilage Injuries  \n    https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/patient-care/services-and-specialties/sports-medicine/conditions/knee/knee-cartilage-injuries</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

A family history of brainstem glioma can also contribute to the occurrence of this condition.\n\n【8】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Brainstem Glioma?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The various signs and symptoms associated with brainstem glioma are:\n\n【10】*   Weakness.\n\n【11】*   Diplopia (double vision).\n\n【12】*   Difficulty in swallowing.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Hemimegaloencephaly: Understanding the Rare Brain Disorder</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Autoimmune Encephalitis - Symptoms and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Unsteady gait.\n\n【14】*   Headache.\n\n【15】*   Dysarthria (difficulty speaking).\n\n【16】*   Nausea.\n\n【17】*   Drowsiness.\n\n【18】*   Behavioral changes in children.\n\n【19】*   Vomiting.\n\n【20】*   Deterioration of handwriting.\n\n【21】*   Seizures.\n\n【22】*   Changes in speaking pattern.\n    </u>\n\n【23】The important signs and symptoms that are noted in the clinical examination are disorders of the cranial nerves. Swelling of the region surrounding the eyes is also noted. A sensory loss of the sensations in the facial region is seen in some patients.\n\n【24】How Is Brainstem Glioma Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【25】The various diagnostic procedure for identifying the brainstem glioma are:\n\n【26】*   **Neurological Examination:** In the neurological examination, the doctor will check for balance, strength, hearing, vision, coordination, and functioning of different reflux. Any problems in the areas of the brain can be identified with a neurological examination.\n\n【27】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scan:** This is a very useful tool for diagnosing the tumors of the brain. In certain situations, a contrast dye is injected through the veins in the arms. These dyes help in visualizing the tumors. The different magnetic resonance imaging variations include magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【28】*   **Biopsy**: After identifying the rotation of glioma, a biopsy procedure might be performed before the commencement of the treatment. A needle might be used for this procedure for removing the tumor. In some cases, a part of the brain tumor is removed. For glioma, a stereotactic biopsy with the needle is recommended. This might be used in areas of the brain that are sensitive to operate. The neurosurgeon will drill a hole into the skull to access the tumor. This procedure is often guided by computed tomography or MRI. The collected biopsy is sent for analysis, and microscopic features are identified. The pathologists will also predict the growth rate of the glioma and observe the tumor's physical appearance.\n\n【29】*   **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan:** CT scan is less accurate than the MRI scan. So when the MRI scan results are not sufficient, only then a CT scan is recommended.\n\n【30】*   **Cerebrospinal Fluid Examination:** Cerebrospinal fluid is collected and sent for laboratory diagnosis to identify the pathological problems.\n\n【31】*   **Arteriography Examination:** Arteriography is a radiographic image obtained by a procedure called an arteriogram. In this procedure, the arteries are visualized with the help of dye or contrast material. In this way, any blockages in the arteries can be noted. It is a very useful diagnostic tool for identifying cancerous conditions.\n\n【32】What Are the Treatment Options for Brainstem Glioma?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】The different treatment options for brainstem glioma are:\n\n【34】*   **Chemotherapy:** A chemotherapy treatment using chemotherapeutic agents like Temozolomide can help in providing comfort for patients with brainstem glioma. In some patients, Carboplatin and Vincristine are also helpful. The problem with chemotherapy is relapse of the condition. The other medications that are used for brainstem glioma are Thalidomide and Bevacizumab.\n\n【35】*   **Focal Radiotherapy:** It is the most successful treatment option for brainstem glioma. Patients are known to show good stability in health after radiotherapy. Patients who are experiencing neurological symptoms can be treated with radiotherapy treatment. The doses for radiotherapy are conventional and might range from 54 to 60 Gy. Patients who are treated with radiotherapy show a great improvement in the survival rate.\n\n【36】*   **Surgery:** Surgery is always performed in association with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Removal of the small portion of the tumor can show a drastic change in the reduction of symptoms. The risks associated with surgical options are bleeding and infections.\n\n【37】*   **Targeted Drug Therapy:** The treatment of targeted drugs aims at the abnormalities that are present in the cancer cells. Targeted drug therapy obstructs the abnormality and causes cancer cells to die. The medications are given either through veins or oral routes. The drugs that are given through the veins help in the restriction of the formation of other new blood vessels. As a result, blood circulation to the tumor is lost, and the cancer cells are killed.\n\n【38】In addition to these methods, the patient is also advised for rehabilitation after the treatment. This will help in the development of control over motor skills, vision, thinking, and speech. The methods that are followed for rehabilitation are\n\n【39】*   **Speech Therapy****:** Speech pathologists will train the patients who are having difficulty in speaking.\n\n【40】*   **Occupational Therapy:** In occupational therapy, the patient is brought to a health condition where they can perform all the daily routine activities.\n\n【41】*   **Physical Therapy:** This will help in regaining the muscular strength and motor skills that are lost.\n\n【42】**Conclusion:**\n\n【43】The tumors are located in the parts of the brain that controls critical functions such as breathing, heart rate, and swallowing. So when left untreated, the tumor may begin impairing the critical functions. Hence taking appropriate treatment helps control the tumor growth and prolongs the survival of the patient.\n\n【44】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【45】* * *\n\n【46】#### **1.**删除换行**What is the survival rate for brain stem glioma?**\n\n【47】Adults survive for around 44- 74 months after being diagnosed, whereas children have a 5-year survival rate of 95%.\n\n【48】#### **2.**删除换行**Is brain stem glioma curable?**\n\n【49】Unfortunately, medication is rarely effective in curing this condition.

Skin ulcers often affect the legs. But they can also involve other areas, such as hands, feet, back, and hips. Once these ulcers become infected, they should be treated as they can spread throughout the body. Skin ulcers are frequently seen in older people. The symptoms, treatment, and recovery of skin ulcers depend on their specific causes. However, several treatments can help heal and prevent further complications from skin ulcers.\n\n【2】What Does a Skin Ulcer Look Like?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】In the early stages, the affected area is usually discolored. It may look red and feel warm. As the skin ulcer gets worse, it often creates a crater-like depression in the skin, which may weep clear fluid or blood. The other skin ulcer symptoms depend on the type and severity of the ulcers.\n\n【4】The other symptoms may include:\n\n【5】*   Swollen.\n\n【6】*   Red, pink, brown, gray, or black-colored.\n\n【7】*   Tender.\n\n【8】*   Itchy.\n\n【9】*   Painful.\n\n【10】*   Changes in skin texture.\n\n【11】*   A strong odor.\n\n【12】*   Yellow or green pus discharge due to an infection.\n\n【13】What Are the Causes of Skin Ulcers?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【14】A disruption in the blood flow mainly causes skin ulcers. The common causes of skin ulcers are as follows:\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【16】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【17】Calendula - the Wound Healer\n\n【18】Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): Causes, Prevention, Symptoms and Treatments\n\n【19】Dermatomyositis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【20】*   **Diabetes:** Diabetes causes high blood sugar that can lead to nerve damage, called peripheral neuropathy. In peripheral neuropathy, a person may lose the sense of touch in the feet and legs. Since pain or pressure is lost, the person may not feel injuries on their legs or feet. If left untreated, these injuries can turn into skin ulcers.\n\n【21】*   **Atherosclerosis:** Atherosclerosis occurs when the arteries get narrowed due to fat buildup. The narrowed arteries cannot properly circulate blood. If any part of the body does not get enough blood circulation, the skin tissue breaks down, forming a sore.\n\n【22】*   **Venous Insufficiency:** Venous insufficiency happens when the veins cannot deliver blood from the legs to the heart. This results in blood collection in the leg veins, leading to swelling. If the swelling is severe, it can excessively put pressure on the skin, causing ulcers.\n\n【23】*   **Constant Pressure:** Staying in one position for a long time puts the skin under constant pressure, squeezing the blood vessels. This leads to blockage of blood flow to skin tissue, due to which the skin dies and develops an ulcer.\n\n【24】What Are the Risk Factors for Skin Ulcers?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【25】People are more likely to get skin ulcers if they have certain risk factors, including:\n\n【26】*   **Pregnancy**: Hormonal changes and increased blood volume during pregnancy may cause leg vein problems.\n\n【27】*   **Cigarette Smoking:** Smoking hardens the arteries and disturbs proper blood flow.\n\n【28】*   **Limited Mobility:** Being bedridden, paralyzed, or using a wheelchair for a long time puts the skin under constant pressure.\n\n【29】*   **Aging:** Atherosclerosis and venous insufficiency are linked to increasing age which may cause ulcers.\n\n【30】*   **High Blood Cholesterol:** High cholesterol levels increase narrowing and oxidative stress in the arteries disrupting blood flow.\n\n【31】*   **Obesity and Overweight:** Obesity increases the risk for diabetes, atherosclerosis, and raised pressure in the leg veins.\n\n【32】*   **Blood clots:** People prone to blood clots are more likely to have blood flow problems.\n\n【33】What Are the Types of Skin Ulcers?\n----------------------------------\n\n【34】There are three common types of skin ulcers:\n\n【35】**Arterial or Ischemic Ulcers:** These ulcers occur when blocked arteries cause poor blood flow. They affect people with poor blood flow in their legs. These ulcers involve feet, especially heels, toes, the outer side of ankles, and near the nail bed. Pain may aggravate at night or when the legs are resting.\n\n【36】**Neurotrophic or Diabetic Ulcers:** Neuropathic ulcers or diabetic ulcers are caused by nerve damage and narrow arteries. Neuropathic ulcers occur in 15 % of people with diabetes. The ulcers commonly involve feet, especially on the pressure points of the foot, including heels, toes, and bottom of the feet. Because of nerve damage, these ulcers are not painful.\n\n【37】**Venous Stasis Ulcers:** Venous stasis ulcers are caused by poor blood flow and account for 80 % to 90 % of all leg ulcers. They are a common problem in people with leg swelling, varicose veins, or a history of blood clots in their legs. They affect the leg between the knee and ankle.\n\n【38】How Is Skin Ulcer Diagnosed?\n----------------------------\n\n【39】A doctor can generally diagnose skin ulcers by physical examination and taking a medical history. The doctor may also order a blood test. If the ulcer is infected, a blood panel shows how the body is fighting the infection. A blood test also helps determine underlying problems. In some cases, imaging tests like X-ray, CT scan, or MRI may be performed to look at the tissue and bone under the sore.\n\n【40】How Is Skin Ulcer Treated?\n--------------------------\n\n【41】Treatment for a skin ulcer usually depends on what is causing it and its severity. Mild superficial ulcers which do not show signs of infection (swelling, pain, drainage, or a foul odor) can be treated at home.\n\n【42】**1) At-Home Care**\n\n【43】Treating an ulcer at home involves the following steps:\n\n【44】*   Thoroughly clean the ulcer daily with soap and water. Mild ulcers can also be cleaned with sterile salt water, called saline.\n\n【45】*   Keep the ulcer covered and protected with a bandage.\n\n【46】*   Keep the legs elevated above the heart by propping them up on cushions or pillows to help blood flow out of the leg.\n\n【47】*   Take good care of other health problems, such as diabetes, hypertension, or atherosclerosis.\n\n【48】*   Wear compression socks to reduce leg swelling by helping blood flow back to the heart.\n\n【49】*   Avoid putting pressure on the ulcer, especially if the ulcer is on the foot.\n\n【50】For large or deep ulcers that are incredibly painful, or have any signs of infections, such as redness, pain, swelling, bad odor, or pus, visit a healthcare provider immediately. The treatment for moderate to severe ulcers includes:\n\n【51】**2) Dressing:** Dressings help clean and protect the ulcer. In addition, it also promotes healing and prevents infection. The type of dressing usually depends on the ulcer. Some types of dressings are available moist dressings, hydrocolloids, hydrogels, collagen wound dressings, and antimicrobial dressings.\n\n【52】**3) Antibiotics:** If the ulcer is infected, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics to prevent or treat an already infected ulcer.\n\n【53】**4) Pain medication:** Pain medication can be prescribed if the ulcer is painful.\n\n【54】**5) Surgery:** For deep ulcers that do not heal after a long time or if other treatments do not work, skin grafts may be needed. Skin grafts help close the wound and promote proper healing.\n\n【55】What Is the Outlook for People With Skin Ulcers?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】Skin ulcer recovery generally ranges from a few weeks to three months. However, severe ulcers can take up to two years to fade. Complete recovery of ulcers depends on its type, size, quality of wound care, overall health of the person, blood circulation, and pressure in the affected area. For ulcers that do not heal with time, see a doctor because they can develop gangrene because of insufficient blood flow in the area. In such cases, the doctor may have to remove the affected body part, such as the foot or leg (amputation).\n\n【57】How Is Skin Ulcer Prevented?\n----------------------------\n\n【58】A few practical steps can help reduce the risk of ulcers:\n\n【59】*   Protect the feet. Never walk barefoot, especially if having diabetes. A foot injury can increase the risk of ulcers. Wear shoes that cover the whole foot instead of sandals or flip-flops.\n\n【60】*   Quit smoking. Cigarettes can damage blood vessels, reduce blood flow, and delay wound healing.\n\n【61】*   Keep diabetes and blood pressure under control.\n\n【62】*   Exercise to increase blood flow.\n\n【63】*   Maintain a healthy weight.\n\n【64】*   Maintain a healthy diet to avoid nutritional deficiencies and assist in wound healing.\n\n【65】*   Keep the cholesterol and triglyceride levels under control by changing the diet.\n\n【66】*   If possible, try to change the position every two hours to avoid pressure on the skin.\n\n【67】**Conclusion**\n\n【68】Skin ulcers are open sores from insufficient blood flow due to underlying health conditions and constant pressure. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and severity of ulcers. Generally, skin ulcers resolve within a few weeks to three months. However, always keep the healthcare provider apprised of any changes occurring in the skin ulcer and follow the ulcer treatment and prevention plan to get the best possible outcome.\n\n【69】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【70】无关删除-1:<u>*   UNUSUAL CAUSES OF CUTANEOUS ULCERATION  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2991050/\n*   Venous leg ulcers: infection diagnosis and microbiological investigation guide for primary care  \n    https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/venous-leg-ulcers-diagnosis-and-microbiology-investigation\n*   Leg ulcers: An Indian perspective  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4228669/\n*   ABC of wound healing Uncommon causes of ulceration  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1397775/\n*   Skin Diseases  \n    https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/skin-diseases</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "fc16c37e-1a3a-4e5b-92cf-d56b18470dac", "title": "New Insights on Hair Research", "text": "【0】New Insights on Hair Research\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Hair is present on every part of the skin, protecting it from direct exposure to external factors. Hair morphology is different in each part of the human body, but the hairs on the scalp are considered to be the essential part of esthetics. The hairs are grown from the hair follicle at birth; they are small with age. These follicles grow and form a sebaceous gland that secretes sebum, natural oil that nourishes hair, and the hair on the scalp is called terminal hair, And when the follicle size decreases, the hairs start to shed, causing hair thinning.\n\n【2】What Is the Composition of Human Hair?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【3】The single hair strand is composed of a sulfur-rich protein structure, lipids, minerals, water, melanin, and vitamins; it is a dead structure without living cells. In a cross-sectional view, hair is divided into three parts: cuticle, cortex, and medulla. The cuticle is made of keratin and multiple layers of flat cells directed towards the shaft; the cuticle is made of a-layer, a b-layer made of protein, and f-layer made of fiber; this layer is water-resistant and provides texture and luster to hair.\n\n【4】The cuticle can be damaged due to external factors like climate change and chemical and heat appliances which can make hair porous and lose its functional properties. The cortex comprises keratin consisting of amino acid residue and melanin granules; this layer provides strength and elasticity to the hair and can be damaged due to oxidative chemical changes leading to easy breakage.\n\n【5】The medulla is a soft protein layer seen in thicker and white hair. The hair thickness is classified into three, fine with less than 60 microns, medium with 60-80microns, and thick with 80-150 microns. The shape of hair and the cortex determines the susceptibility to damage. The greater the diameter of the cortex, the greater the strength of the hair, and this factor increases the longevity of the hair.\n\n【6】What Are the Causes of Hair Damage?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【7】The damage to hair due to internal or external factors is called weathering. Modern research techniques help find the cause of the breakdown of hair at the nano-level. If it is due to the breakdown of chemical bonds or loss of elasticity or strength, the difference in single fiber leads to loss of shine and the changes that occur in the diameter of the hair.\n\n【8】As per the studies, the weathering can be natural or accelerated; natural weathering occurs due to physical damage to hair that happens while hair grooming, and accelerated weathering occurs due to excessive physical and chemical use on hair that leads to damage to cuticle and breakdown of hair protein, this can also lead to the breakdown of hair or split ends of hair.\n\n【9】The hair can be damaged due to excessive exposure to sunlight, the use of hair drying and grooming appliance, and harsh chemicals and metals used to straighten and curl hair; this can also lead to the breakdown of hair or split ends of hair.\n\n【10】The hair can be damaged due to excessive exposure to sunlight, use of hair drying and grooming appliances, and harsh chemicals and metals used to straighten and curl hair. In shampoo and other hair cosmetic products, this can break the cuticle layers and make hair look dull, frizzy, and thin.\n\n【11】What Is the New Research Found on Hair Regrowth?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The hair follicle is formed in the embryo with molecular signals called the hedgehog signal pathway, which is present in the body since birth and gradually shed off after birth. These signals are automatically shut down to prevent the crosslinking of messages.\n\n【13】Recent studies have shown that activation of the hedgehog signal pathway help in the growth of new hair follicles when keratinocytes and fibroblasts are activated; the study was carried out on mice and showed positive results, but the inappropriate activation of hedgehog can lead to the growth of tumors on the skin, but with the treatment of hedgehog inhibitor Vismodegib the growth of tumor was inhibited and new hair follicle was intact. However, the research still needs to go through several trials for effective results to show in humans.\n\n【14】Recent studies have found QR 678 scalp injection helpful in the regrowth of hair follicles; this treatment is considered an advanced non-surgical treatment better than stem cell treatment and plasma-rich protein treatment used for hair regrowth; 80% of hair regrowth was found in 90% of people who were injected in the duration of 6 months, this treatment is approved by Food Drug and Administration.\n\n【15】A scientist has found that in acute cases of hair loss, the immune cells attack the skin, which causes hair fall to stop; they use glucocorticoid to inhibit the immune reaction affecting the skin and leading to hair loss. In addition, the use of glucocorticoid helped activate regulatory T-cells, which produce TGF- beta 3, which is helpful in the growth of new hair follicle stem cells.\n\n【16】For effective hair growth, the hair cycling stages are essential to increase the hair growing phase and delay the hair losing or shedding phase; research is done to find a medicine that can help restore the hair and maintain the texture and volume, and hair density.\n\n【17】Therapy like topical Finasteride and Minoxidil have shown to be effective in a few people for hair growth; Finasteride prevents the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone which is the leading cause of hair loss by inhibiting 5 alpha reductase type 2 enzyme, while Minoxidil helps in increasing the hair growth phase and shortening the hair loss phase by producing enzyme 2-4-di-amino-6-piperidine pyrimidine-3-oxide, it also helps in enlarging the hair follicle size. However, this medicine is to be used regularly to maintain the results; the prolonged use of these drugs has many side effects; Finasteride has been shown to have sexual dysfunction in both men and women, and minoxidil is shown to have problems related to hypertension, headache, water retention.\n\n【18】**Conclusion**\n\n【19】Hair plays an essential role in esthetics as they affect the beauty of a person, they help in boosting the self-confidence of a person, and losing hair at an early age can be painful and affect self-esteem; the recent advancement in hair regrowth is promising but are still under trial, if this trial is successful then the problem of hair loss will be solved. Before opting for any treatment related to hair, it is advised to take the opinion of a healthcare provider with good experience and have shown effective results with no complications.\n\n【20】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【21】* * *\n\n【22】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the Latest Research Found on Hair Loss?**\n\n【23】In June 2022, the FDA approved the first treatment for hair loss in which the immune system may attack the hair follicles, known as alopecia areata. The drug, baricitinib, was already approved for treating another autoimmune disorder, such as rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【24】#### **2.**删除换行**Is Any New Technology Available for Hair Growth?**\n\n【25】A new signaling molecule called SCUBE3 that the researchers found has the potential to cure androgenetic alopecia, a prevalent type of hair loss seen in both men and women.\n\n【26】#### **3.**删除换行**How Can Hair Provide Insight Into Health?**\n\n【27】One's hair can provide a doctor to know whether one is stressed or has any nutritional deficiency, other health issues, and a thyroid problem.\n\n【28】#### **4.**删除换行**Are There Any Scientifically Possible Ways to Regrow Hair?**\n\n【29】As technology advances, one can actually regrow their hair back with minimally invasive, more heavy-duty treatment. For example, with follicular unit extraction FUE, surgeons can transplant hair follicles and implant them into the bald spots.\n\n【30】#### **5.**删除换行**What Would Be the Information That Can Be Learned From Hair?**\n\n【31】The area from where the hair originated can be determined by general,  \n\\- Shape.  \n\\- Size.   \n\\- Curliness.  \n\\- Length.  \n\\- Stiffness.  \nThe microscopic appearance contributes to determining the area of the body.

It happens due to the narrowing of the arteries carrying the blood to the kidneys. The other name for renovascular hypertension is renal artery stenosis. There are various causes and risk factors associated with renovascular hypertension. There are several treatment options. Surgical methods are known to be highly beneficial. The patient should be educated about their condition so that they can take care of their health in a better manner.\n\n【2】What Is the Epidemiology of Renovascular Hypertension?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Renovascular hypertension is known to be the second most common condition occurring in the United States of America. Older people are most commonly affected than younger people. In some patients, renovascular hypertension can occur at the age of 30, while in others, it can affect patients who are more than 50 years of age.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Renovascular Hypertension?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The main cause of renovascular hypertension is higher levels of cholesterol. The risk is increased when a fatty substance is known to thicken the inner lining of the arteries. This fatty substance is known as plaque, and this condition is referred to as atherosclerosis. The narrowing of the arteries results in reduced blood flow than normal. In response to this, the kidneys release hormones that lead to increased salt and water retention. As a result, blood pressure increases. A few conditions are known to cause renovascular hypertension. They are:\n\n【6】*   Acute arterial thrombosis or embolism.\n\n【7】*   Cholesterol embolic disease.\n\n【8】*   Renal arterial trauma.\n\n【9】*   Aortic dissection.\n\n【10】*   Arterial aneurysm.\n\n【11】*   Polyarteritis nodosa.\n\n【12】*   Arteriovenous malformation of the renal artery.\n\n【13】Does Renovascular Hypertension Affect Children?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【14】In children, renovascular hypertension can occur both in congenital and acquired forms. The acquired type of renovascular hypertension is known to be more common than the congenital type. The occurrence of this health condition might vary in different geographical regions. The acquired type of renovascular hypertension can show the following conditions. They are:\n\n【15】*   Moyamoya disease.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Endovascular Repair of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms - Procedure and Benefits</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Ask-Upmark Kidney - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Hypertension Crisis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Subisthmic coarctation.\n\n【17】*   Kawasaki disease.\n\n【18】*   Takayasu arteritis.\n\n【19】*   Vasculitis.\n\n【20】*   Renal artery thrombosis.\n\n【21】*   Vascular trauma.\n\n【22】*   Anastomotic stenosis.\n\n【23】*   Midaortic syndrome.\n\n【24】*   Tumors.\n    </u>\n\n【25】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Renovascular Hypertension?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】The condition of renovascular hypertension will show the following signs:\n\n【27】*   Rapid buildup of fluid in the lungs will result in pulmonary edema.\n\n【28】*   There will be narrowing of the arteries in the legs, eyes, and brain.\n\n【29】*   Improper functioning of the kidneys.\n\n【30】*   Increased blood pressure in younger patients.\n\n【31】*   Uncontrolled levels of blood pressure even after the intake of medications.\n\n【32】What Are the Complications of Renovascular Hypertension?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】The complication associated with renovascular hypertension are:\n\n【34】*   Chronic kidney disease.\n\n【35】*   Headache.\n\n【36】*   Poor blood supply to the legs.\n\n【37】*   Aortic aneurysm.\n\n【38】*   Heart failure.\n\n【39】*   Confusion.\n\n【40】*   Blurred vision.\n\n【41】*   Bleeding of the nose.\n\n【42】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【43】*   Heart attack.\n\n【44】*   Stroke.\n\n【45】What Are the Risk Factors of Renovascular Hypertension?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】The risk factors associated with renovascular hypertension are:\n\n【47】*   Smoking.\n\n【48】*   High blood pressure.\n\n【49】*   Increase in age.\n\n【50】*   Higher levels of cholesterol.\n\n【51】*   Diabetes.\n\n【52】*   Cocaine abuse.\n\n【53】*   Consumption of heavy alcohol.\n\n【54】What Are the Diagnostic Procedures for Renovascular Hypertension?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】In the initial stages, diagnosis is made using ultrasonography and magnetic resonance angiography. In some patients, procedures like radionuclide imaging are used. Confirmatory diagnosis is achieved by renal angiography. This procedure can also be used for therapeutic procedures. Renal angiography is a highly beneficial test. It would require a few other tests like radionuclide imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and ultrasonography to identify whether the patient is eligible for the renal angiography test.\n\n【56】Duplex doppler ultrasonography is also a useful diagnostic test that can identify the blood flow to the kidneys. It is a non-invasive procedure, and it is usually reliable. Stenosis in the renal arteries can be identified with this method. It is a technique sensitive procedure and would require qualified technicians to perform the test.\n\n【57】Radionuclide imaging is a diagnostic procedure that is done before and after the administration of drugs like Captopril. It is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor). It will help in treating the narrow affected artery.\n\n【58】Digital subtraction angiography is a diagnostic procedure in which the renal arteries are given a selective injection to make a confirmatory diagnosis.\n\n【59】What Are the Treatment Options for Renovascular Hypertension?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【60】The treatment requires certain lifestyle modifications and medications. The patient should be aware of the cholesterol levels as it can increase the risk of other conditions.\n\n【61】*   **Lifestyle Changes:** A healthy heart is a way to get cured of renovascular hypertension. A balanced and fat-free diet will be required for faster recovery. It is essential to exercise for a minimum of 30 minutes per day. If you are a smoker, then you should quit the habit of smoking. Alcohol must be completely avoided. It is necessary to reduce the sodium intake in your diet. The ideal level of sodium should be maintained at less than 1500 mg per day. It is necessary for you to check with your doctor regarding the potassium levels. Stress is an important contributor to weight gain. The levels of stress can be reduced by practicing yoga and meditation techniques.\n\n【62】*   **Medical Treatment:** The doctor will record a thorough history of the patient. After considering all the past medical history and other associated diseases, the patient will be prescribed medications to treat atherosclerosis, hypertension, and renal disorders. The treatment is always aimed at improving the condition of the kidney. If the kidney cannot be vascularized again, then the patient is recommended for a nephrectomy.\n\n【63】*   **Surgery:** Angioplasty is done for patients who are having fibromuscular dysplasia. It is a procedure with low risk, and so it can improve the control over blood pressure. Balloon angioplasty is the treatment that is suggested for obstructions in the renal artery. This is done with or without the placement of the stent. A stent placement will reduce the risk of reoccurrence of stenosis. In some patients, bypass surgery would be required. Saphenous vein bypass graphene is a procedure that is recommended for diseases in the renal artery.\n\n【64】What Are the Precautionary Measures?\n------------------------------------\n\n【65】*   If you have increased blood sugar levels or positive signs for diabetes, you should try to cure it first.\n\n【66】*   Try to keep a check on your cholesterol levels on a regular basis.\n\n【67】*   Quit smoking, alcohol, and drug usage.\n\n【68】How Is the Prognosis?\n---------------------\n\n【69】If the blood pressure is relatively higher, then the prognosis is very poor. Proper control of hypertension will help the patient to escape from complications and retain a long life.\n\n【70】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【71】无关删除-1:<u>*   “Current Approaches to Renovascular Hypertension”  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752469/\n*   Renovascular hypertension  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000204.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

However, sometimes dyspepsia is confused and misdiagnosed or remains underdiagnosed. Primary health care physicians require adequate knowledge to care for patients suffering from dyspepsia. The role of primary health care is essential, and they need to identify the alarming feature of dyspepsia. The test and treat strategy is the first step toward managing the condition. Dyspepsia affects up to 80 percent of the population at some time in life, and most patients have no severe underlying disease. However, patients who present with new dyspepsia at the age of more than 55 years and younger, unresponsive, and those who can receive empirical treatment require investigation to exclude serious disease. In addition, the ratio of men to women suffering from dyspepsia is more for women. This article aims to encounter the challenges primary care faces in diagnosing and referring to higher centers and focuses on the appropriate treatment for patients with dyspepsia.\n\n【2】What Is the Role of Primary Care?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】The Public Health Center looks over the prevention and control of locally endemic diseases. Primary Health Care came to be instituted following a joint World Health Organization-United Nations International Children's Fund International Conference at Alma-At on 12th September 1978.\n\n【4】Primary Health Care is essential health care accessible to all rural and urban areas and affordable to all people for their healthy development. The following are the roles of primary care:\n\n【5】*   Primary health care should be shared equally by all people.\n\n【6】*   Primary health services are independent of people's ability to pay. Therefore, all rich, poor, urban, and rural citizens must have access to health services.\n\n【7】*   An essential ingredient of primary health care is the involvement of families, individuals, and communities in promoting their health and welfare.\n\n【8】*   Primary health care uses scientifically sound technology that is acceptable to local needs.\n\n【9】*   Primary health care focuses on the prevention of diseases.\n\n【10】*   Illness should be treated under primary health care services, and rehabilitation should be carried out.\n\n【11】*   Primary health care focuses on exemplary treatment service.\n\n【12】*   Health services should not be curative but should instill health and a healthy lifestyle and emphasize prevention.\n\n【13】*   Primary healthcare provides medical care along with education about health.\n\n【14】*   The public health center provides a safe water supply and basic sanitation.\n\n【15】What Is Dyspepsia?\n------------------\n\n【16】Dyspepsia is a condition that is described by symptoms such as discomfort, bloating, and nausea, which are thought to originate from the upper gastrointestinal tract. However, it can occur due to various causes. In addition, it can happen in the absence of organic disease, known as functional dyspepsia, which is chronic. Soreness and motility-dysfunction-type subgroups are seen, but there is an overlap between these and irritable bowel syndrome. It is very similar to H. pylori infection, and thus dyspepsia is misdiagnosed. The exact cause of dyspepsia is poorly understood but probably covers the spectrum of mucosal, motility, and psychiatric disorders.\n\n【17】What Are the Causes of Dyspepsia?\n---------------------------------\n\n【18】There are many causes of dyspepsia, including some outside the digestive system. For example, heartburn and other reflux symptoms are separate entities and considered elsewhere.\n\n【19】The following are the main factors that cause dyspepsia:\n\n【20】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【21】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【22】I have stomach bloating and gastric problem after having specific foods.

Patients with H. pylori infection are referred to a gastroenterologist for adequate treatment. It is classified as a high-priority infectious disease that needs to be resolved soon; otherwise, patients may suffer from other complications.\n\n【66】Patient history is an important aspect of diagnosis, and it is essential to detect the alarming features of dyspepsia; that is why a basic investigation algorithm is followed to make the appropriate diagnosis, as shown below.\n\n【67】What Are Challenges Faced by Primary Care?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【68】As discussed above, dyspepsia and Helicobacter pylori infection are common digestion-related problems. Primary health care face problems in the diagnosis and treatment of dyspepsia. The symptoms often correlate poorly with the underlying diagnosis; a careful history is essential to detect the ‘alarm’ feature requiring urgent investigation and to detect atypical symptoms that may originate other than the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【69】*   A direct inquiry may elicit symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n【70】*   Peptic ulcer disease must be considered, while intra-abdominal malignancy is a prime concern in older people.\n\n【71】*   There is no diagnostic sign apart from abdominal pain on palpation.\n\n【72】*   The patient often appears anxious.\n\n【73】*   Primary healthcare can follow the investigation algorithm as mentioned above.\n\n【74】What Measures Can Be Taken to Overcome the Challenges in Diagnosing Dyspepsia?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【75】*   It is essential to detect ‘alarm’ signs of dyspepsia.\n\n【76】*   The history will provide a clue to the diagnosis.\n\n【77】*   A proper drug history should be taken, and depression or mental illness should be considered.\n\n【78】*   Pregnancy should be considered in young women before the radiological investigation is performed.\n\n【79】*   Alcohol misuse should be considered when nausea and vomiting are prominent in the morning.\n\n【80】*   All patients above 55 years should be checked for Helicobacter pylori infection, as they should undergo endoscopy to eliminate the mucosal disease.\n\n【81】*   While gallstones are diagnosed by ultrasound, they are not responsible for dyspeptic symptoms.\n\n【82】*   Up to 10 percent of patients benefit from Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy, which should be offered to the infected individual.\n\n【83】What Are the Treatment Options for Dyspepsia?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【84】The most crucial aspect is clarifying their condition to patients and clearing their doubts and fear. In addition, possible psychological and emotional issues should be asked about and considered, and the psychological influences on gut function should be explained. The following are the treatment options for dyspepsia:\n\n【85】**Changing Lifestyle** - Lifestyles and restrictive diets are of little benefit, but having smaller meals and restricting fat consumption may help.\n\n【86】**Helicobacter Pylori Eradication** - Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy benefits the patient and removes a significant risk factor for peptic ulcer and gastric cancer.\n\n【87】**Medication -**\n\n【88】1.  Over-the-counter drugs can be used, such as antacids, which are sometimes helpful.\n\n【89】2.  Prokinetic drugs such as Metoclopramide or Domperidone may be used when nausea and vomiting are noticed.\n\n【90】3.  H2 receptor antagonist drugs may be tried if night pain or heartburn is troublesome.\n\n【91】4.  Low-dose tricyclic agents, such as Amitriptyline, can be used.\n\n【92】Symptoms associated with an identifiable cause of stress should be resolved with appropriate counseling and intervention.\n\n【93】Some patients with major mental illnesses or emotional issues need behavioral therapy and proper counseling.\n\n【94】**Conclusion**\n\n【95】Proper diagnosis and treatment after diagnosing dyspepsia is a challenge for primary care. The critical step is to identify an alarming feature of dyspepsia. A careful history is essential to detect bad symptoms requiring urgent investigation. It is a therapeutic challenge for primary care to diagnose and treat patients with dyspepsia. Patients with dyspepsia should be interpreted appropriately and treated adequately.\n\n【96】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【97】无关删除-1:<u>*   NIH- Dyspepsia Challenge in Primary Care Gastroenterology  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34126614/\n*   NIH- The Fear of Gastric Cancer in Patients with Dyspepsia: Challenge in Specialist Care Gastroenterology  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34348279/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is most frequently used for breast reconstruction after breast removal. However, it is also utilized in some aesthetic operations to fix skin that accidents, congenital disabilities, or surgery have injured.\n\n【3】Who Are the Potential Candidates for Tissue Expansion?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Tissue expansion is generally recommended in the following cases\n\n【5】*   **Breast Reconstruction:** Surgery is frequently employed in patients with insufficient skin to accept permanent implantation to recreate a woman's natural appearance.\n\n【6】*   **Hair Replacement:** It can also be used to repair or replace scalp tissue in regions where hair development makes it challenging to use skin from other body parts to replace missing tissue.\n\n【7】*   **Reconstruction of Skin in Other Body Parts:** When reconstructing some parts of the face, neck, hands, arms, and legs, tissue expansion typically yields outstanding results.\n\n【8】The expansion could be more challenging in locations with thick skin, such as the neck, torso, or other body parts. Since good skin is the primary condition, enlargement is likely not an option if the area affected is significantly injured or scarred.\n\n【9】How to Choose a Surgeon?\n------------------------\n\n【10】*   Reconstructive surgery is typically carried out by a plastic surgeon.\n\n【11】*   Choose a licensed surgeon at all times.\n\n【12】*   Ascertain that the surgeon has at least six years of surgical experience and three years of plastic surgery expertise, and that they are a certified member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS).\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Osseodensification and Ridge Expansion: Uses, Advantages, and Techniques</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Cellular Adaptation and Its Types</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Morton's Neuroma - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   A trained plastic surgeon gives the patient results and guaranteed care.\n    </u>\n\n【14】What Are the Preoperative Preparations for Tissue Expansion?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】*   Before performing the surgery, a plastic surgeon will evaluate the patient.\n\n【16】*   Patients' overall health and medical history are checked thoroughly to rule out systemic illness and drug allergies.\n\n【17】*   Patients are advised to quit smoking for at least two months.\n\n【18】*   Before surgery, patients may be advised to stop blood thinning medications such as Aspirin, Clopidogrel, vitamin E, and Warfarin.\n\n【19】*   Patients are advised to take medications prescribed by the doctor.\n\n【20】*   Patients can discuss their expectations, risks, and complications associated with the surgery.\n\n【21】*   Surgeons may take preoperative photographs to examine the body part to be operated, type of skin, and improve the areas which require treatment.\n\n【22】*   Also, preoperative photographs help to evaluate the difference in the appearance of the breasts after the surgery.\n\n【23】*   Surgeons will discuss the procedure, type of anesthesia, potential risks, and the outcome of the results.\n\n【24】How Is the Surgical Procedure Done?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【25】**Anesthesia:**\n\n【26】*   This procedure is done under local anesthesia, depending on the size and area of the skin, and patients can go home on the same day.\n\n【27】*   The procedure takes one to two hours to complete.\n\n【28】*   In some cases, surgeons will choose general anesthesia over local anesthesia.\n\n【29】**Procedure:**\n\n【30】*   **First Surgical Procedure:** The surgeon makes a pocket under the skin, and surgeon will then put the silicone balloon expander there. The expander has a gas cylinder or self-sealing valve that lets the surgeon fill it slowly with saltwater or carbon dioxide.\n\n【31】*   **Expander Inflation in the Surgeon's Office:** The patients are required to visit the surgeon's office regularly after the wound has healed so that the expander can be inflated. The expander will get bigger, causing the skin to stretch. This technique may cause some discomfort in some people. The expander can be filled with carbon dioxide via a remote dosage controller or by sticking a needle into the self-sealing valve, which may be kept under the skin.\n\n【32】*   **Second Surgical Procedure:** The patient will undergo a second procedure to retrieve the expander and replace the new tissue once the skin has expanded enough to cover the injured area. The process is necessary to eliminate the expander and place the permanent implant during breast reconstruction. This procedure usually takes a few minutes to complete. More lengthy procedures and many expansion sequences may be necessary to finish more complicated surgeries to heal skin on the scalp or face.\n\n【33】What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Tissue Expansion?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Until recently, reconstructing injured tissue was only possible through skin folds and grafts. However, tissue expansion offers an additional method with several benefits.\n\n【35】**Advantages:**\n\n【36】*   An almost perfect match of color, texture, and hair-bearing characteristics is provided through expansion.\n\n【37】*   There is less chance that the skin will perish because it is still attached to the blood and nerve supply of the donor location.\n\n【38】*   Scars are frequently less noticeable because the skin does not need to be shifted from one place to another.\n\n【39】**Disadvantages:**\n\n【40】*   However, skin expansion has a significant negative because adding new skin takes a long time.\n\n【41】*   Tissue growth can take three to four months, depending on the region that needs to be rebuilt.\n\n【42】*   Throughout this period, the expander can produce an unpleasant bulge that, while desired for breast reconstruction, can be highly obvious for someone who needs their scalp or other body parts repaired.\n\n【43】*   Additionally, the treatment necessitates multiple surgical visits to inject saline water that expands the balloon.\n\n【44】*   Some people decide against using expanders because of their inconvenience and conspicuous appearance.\n\n【45】What Are the Possible Risks?\n----------------------------\n\n【46】Skin growth can result in some fantastic outcomes. However, there are dangers involved with the surgery and particular difficulties involved with this technique, just like with every operation. These include\n\n【47】**Risks:**\n\n【48】*   The silicone expander utilized in the treatment is most frequently worried by breaking or leaking inside the body.\n\n【49】*   While expanders are carefully positioned and exhaustively tested, leaks do occasionally occur.\n\n【50】*   In the unlikely event that the expander leaks, the saline solution, also known as salt water, that was used to fill it is silently absorbed by the body, and the expander is changed during a brief surgical operation.\n\n【51】*   A few patients might experience infection around the expander. Although this could happen at any time, it usually happens a few days after the expander is placed.\n\n【52】**Conclusion**\n\n【53】Tissue expansion typically produces better results than other techniques for regenerating or repairing injured skin. But remember that progress rather than perfection is the main objective. The method significantly improves the look and quality of life of most tissue expansion patients after surgery.\n\n【54】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>*   Tissue Expansion Surgery  \n    https://www.uofmhealth.org/conditions-treatments/surgery/plastic/tissue-expansion\n*   Tissue Expansion  \n    https://www.plasticsurgery.org/reconstructive-procedures/tissue-expansion\n*   Tissue expansion: Concepts, techniques and unfavourable results  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3901915/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

A diseased liver can cause many complications and affect a person’s health. Liver cysts are abnormal fluid-filled sacs in the liver.\n\n【2】What Is a Simple Liver Cyst?\n----------------------------\n\n【3】Simple liver cysts are fluid-filled sacs that appear in the liver. Generally, they cause no signs or symptoms and need no treatment. Most of them are benign (non-cancerous). When they become large, which may cause pain, discomfort, and trouble to the upper right side of the abdomen. Few liver cysts are caused by congenital or inherited disorders whose cause is unknown and may require treatment.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Liver Cysts?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【5】These cysts are uncommon and affect only five percent of the population. Most liver cysts are congenital and are present right from birth. The cause of this congenital inheritance is unknown. They may result due to malformation present at birth. Rarely, they are associated with serious underlying conditions such as:\n\n【6】*   Liver cancer.\n\n【7】*   Echinococcus infection (a parasite infection).\n\n【8】*   Polycystic liver disease (an inherited disorder).\n\n【9】Are Liver Cysts Usually Cancerous?\n----------------------------------\n\n【10】Rarely do these cysts become precancerous or cancerous, but most of the time, they do not cause any issues. About one to five percent of cysts are precancerous; among them, 30 % are cancerous; if the cyst is detected as cancerous, the healthcare provider gives surgical excision as the line of treatment.\n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms of Liver Cyst?\n------------------------------------\n\n【12】Either benign or cancerous cysts, most cases are asymptomatic; they do not show any symptoms, which makes them undiagnosed for years.\n\n【13】Until the cyst enlarges and causes a disturbance, people exhibit the following symptoms:\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【15】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-3:<u>Are vitamin A and D supplements safe to take with fatty liver?</u>\n\n【17】Please explain my AFP and serum tumor marker test results.\n\n【18】How to identify if a CT scan report is normal?\n\n【19】*   Pain in the upper right abdomen.\n\n【20】*   Abdominal pain and bloating.\n\n【21】*   Significant enlargement of the cyst, which can be felt outside the stomach.\n\n【22】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【23】*   Jaundice (turning of skin, mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes in yellow color), is caused due to blockage of the bile duct.\n\n【24】*   Fever.\n\n【25】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【26】*   Feeling short of breath.\n\n【27】*   Acute belly pain with fever due to ruptured cysts.\n\n【28】Who Gets Affected by Liver Cyst?\n--------------------------------\n\n【29】More females are born with cysts than males. More males develop liver cysts than females. They usually affect the 30 to 70 years of age group people, and in which only 10 to 15 % of people develop symptoms.\n\n【30】How Large Can a Liver Cyst Grow?\n--------------------------------\n\n【31】A liver cyst can be the size of a pinhead, and it can grow up to 4 inches across.\n\n【32】Are Liver Cysts Preventable?\n----------------------------\n\n【33】Almost all cysts are congenital, which means they are present right from birth, and the cause is not known. So prevention is harder, but early detection and following lifestyle modification can help.\n\n【34】How Is the Diagnosis Made for Liver Cyst?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【35】These liver cysts are accidentally found on radiological imaging while diagnosing other conditions with ultrasound or computed tomography and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).\n\n【36】*   **Ultrasound****:** It uses high-frequency sound waves to create real-time pictures and videos of internal organs and tissues. It can generally differentiate a simple cyst from a complicated one; a simple hepatic cyst will appear as unilocular fluid-filled spaces.\n\n【37】*   **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan****:** X-rays and computers to create three-dimensional images of are used soft tissues and bones.\n\n【38】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI****):** It is a painless diagnostic test using radiowaves, a large magnet, and a computer to produce clear images of body tissues.\n\n【39】If a healthcare provider spots a cyst during an imaging test, other diagnostic methods are used to rule out conditions like a precancerous or cancerous cyst.\n\n【40】*   **Physical Examination:** Physical examination is done by palpating the area that can reveal abdominal mass or hepatomegaly.\n\n【41】*   **Serodiagnostic Test****:** Used to identify specific antibodies in blood samples.\n\n【42】*   **Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound:** In this type of ultrasound, ultrasonic waves (high-frequency sound waves) are sent through body tissues, and their echoes are recorded and transferred into images.\n\n【43】*   **Medical History****:** A history of chronic liver disease, as well as details about family, medical and travel history, are taken.\n\n【44】**What Is the Treatment for Liver Cysts?**\n\n【45】Asymptomatic liver cysts do not require any treatment. Cysts larger than 4 cm across should be monitored, and removal of such large benign and simple cysts can be done.\n\n【46】Mostly polycystic liver disease, precancerous or cancerous liver cysts are responsible for a large benign cyst which has to follow certain procedures and surgical treatment like:\n\n【47】*   **Hepatic Resection****:** The presence of a cyst and its rupture may affect the part of the liver; in this procedure, the affected liver is removed.\n\n【48】*   **Cyst Fenestration**: Treats large cysts by removing the wall surrounding the cysts.\n\n【49】*   **Percutaneous Aspiration****:** Using imaging techniques like ultrasound and CT, needle insertion or catheters into liver cysts is done to drain the cystic fluid.\n\n【50】*   **Transarterial Embolization (TACE)**: A healthcare provider injects anticancer drugs into one of the arteries that supply blood to the liver, followed by injecting a substance to block the artery. This substance acts as a dam, keeping anticancer drugs swirling around the cysts instead of floating away. This treatment works the same way as we build a dam on the stream to stop the stream's flow.\n\n【51】*   **Liver Transplantation**: When the cysts or tumor does not respond to any medication or procedures, this is the option left. Liver transplantation is given.\n\n【52】*   **Surgery****:** To remove benign or cancerous cysts.\n\n【53】**What Is the Prognosis of Liver Cysts?**\n\n【54】A hepatic cyst (liver cyst) is large enough to compress the biliary tree and produce symptoms like intense pain, and there is also a possibility of rupture. This rupture of cysts may lead to many infections. A specific complication related to a certain cyst makes the prognosis poor. For example, hydatid cysts can potentially induce anaphylactic shock and sometimes be fatal.\n\n【55】Metastatic disease with hepatic cysts also has a poor prognosis. A mucinous cyst (a cyst that can have a malignant capacity) has a poor prognosis.\n\n【56】**Conclusion:**\n\n【57】Usually, simple liver cysts cause no signs or symptoms and need no treatment. If they cause pain in the abdomen and grow in size, they may lead to other complications and infections. It is difficult to distinguish between a potentially cancerous tumor and a harmless or benign one. Thus their early detection, diagnosis, and treatment are important. In rare cases, removal of the cyst is recommended. Scientists are also researching medications like Somatostatin to treat and manage liver cysts without surgery.\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>*   Liver Cysts  \n    https://liverfoundation.org/liver-diseases/complications-of-liver-disease/liver-cysts/\n*   Hepatic Cyst  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526052/\n*   Liver cysts: A cause of stomach pain?  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-problems/expert-answers/liver-cysts/faq-20058440</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

However, certain gene changes lead to the multiplication of cells, leading to cancer and other diseases. Certain tests can identify changes in genes. Symptoms and signs of certain diseases help in clinically diagnosing the disease. Scans of the affected organ can help in confirming the diagnosis. BRCA is a gene present in every female, and mutated genes in any family member can increase the risk of its presence in the offspring.\n\n【2】What Is BRCA?\n-------------\n\n【3】The term BRCA is derived from the first two letters of the words breast and cancer. These genes are present in every female. They help in preventing the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells by repairing the mutations.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of BRCA Genes?\n---------------------------------\n\n【5】BRCA genes are proteins producing genes that help in repairing damaged DNA. There are two types of BRCA genes.\n\n【6】*   BRCA gene 1.\n\n【7】*   BRCA gene 2.\n\n【8】They are also called tumor suppressor genes. All women have both the genes functioning normally. When these genes undergo mutations, the patient can develop cancer. Inheriting any of the genes can also increase the risk of developing ovarian or breast cancer.\n\n【9】What Are the Diagnostic Methods for BRCA Genes?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【10】**Molecular Genetic Testing -** It is a method in which the mutated BRCA genes are identified. Following are the results obtained through genetic testing.\n\n【11】*   **BRCA Gene Mutations Positive -** Harmful mutation is seen in the BRCA gene. In a positive case, there is a 50 % chance that the parent carrying the mutated gene passes it on to their children.\n\n【12】*   **BRCA Gene Mutations Negative -** No mutation is seen in the gene.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Early Stage Breast Cancer Ultrasound</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【14】Understanding the inheritance of the genes is important to understand the risk of developing future cancers.\n\n【15】Can Genetic Testing Be Done at Home?\n------------------------------------\n\n【16】Genetic testing can be done at home by using the direct-to-consumer genetic test. It can be used to predict the genetic traits and risk of diseases. The results obtained should be discussed with the physician.\n\n【17】Who Are at Risk to Carry Mutated BRCA Genes?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【18】*   Offsprings of the BRCA mutated carriers are likely to carry the genes.\n\n【19】*   Families whose close relatives are suffering from breast cancer can serve as carriers.\n\n【20】What Are the Other High-Risk Diseases Linked With BRCA Carriers?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】High risk diseases can occur in BRCA carriers most of which are cancers.Cells in certain regions of reproductive systems tend to multiply abnormally, causing cancer, such as-\n\n【22】*   Breast or ovarian cancer (cancer of the breast and ovaries: an egg-releasing organ in the female).\n\n【23】*   Fallopian tube cancer (cancer in the tube connecting the ovaries to the uterus).\n\n【24】*   Prostate cancer (cancer of the prostate gland, a male reproductive organ).\n\n【25】Other diseases which can occur in carriers of BRCA genes are the following -\n\n【26】*   Primary peritoneal cancer (cancer of the peritoneum: lining of the abdomen organs).\n\n【27】*   Pancreatic cancer( cancer present in the cells of the pancreas, a digestive organ).\n\n【28】*   Fanconi anemia ( a disease affecting the bone marrow, which is inherited from parents).\n\n【29】*   Cardiovascular diseases (diseases related to the heart).\n\n【30】*   Diseases which occur because of the early menopause after the surgical removal of ovaries, or after treatments for breast cancer.\n\n【31】BRCA genes are also known to show their effect on the heart's structure.\n\n【32】Who Are Tested for BRCA Genes?\n------------------------------\n\n【33】Following categories of individuals need to be tested for the BRCA genes:\n\n【34】*   Genetic sequencing can be done for the possible risk of having the harmful mutated gene in patients whose family members or relatives tested positive for the gene.\n\n【35】*   A Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is carried out for patients who show clinical symptoms regarding the affected organ to confirm the presence of a tumor, and gene testing is carried out.\n\n【36】*   Before getting the test done, the risk of having the harmful mutated variant of BRCA genes is assessed. This involves genetic counseling. The genetic counselor advises if genetic testing is necessary or not.\n\n【37】How to Reduce the Risk of Cancer in Mutated BRCA Carriers?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】The risk of cancer can be reduced or prevented to a major extent by carrying out the following procedures:\n\n【39】*   **Enhanced Screening -** Patients who tested positive for the BRCA variant gene must be screened for breast cancer by mammography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. In addition, transvaginal ultrasound can be carried out in patients with ovarian cancer. Ultrasound or MRI can also be done on the lower abdomen to detect pancreatic cancer.\n\n【40】*   **Risk-Reducing Surgery -** Surgeries can be performed in patients with high risk as per genetic testing. These include surgeries such as:\n\n【41】1.  **Prophylactic Bilateral Mastectomy -** Removal of both breasts to reduce the risk of cancer.\n\n【42】2.  **Prophylactic Salpingo-Oophorectomy -** Removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes.\n\n【43】Though the surgeries prevent the risk of cancer, they can pose complications, which\n\n【44】include infection, bleeding, anxiety and psychological disturbance due to change in\n\n【45】physical appearance. It is to be remembered that not all the tissue that can cause cancer\n\n【46】can be removed, and hence, the cancer can occur even after risk-reducing\n\n【47】surgery.\n\n【48】*   **Chemoprevention -** Using certain medications like Tamoxifen or Raloxifene to prevent the risk of cancer.\n\n【49】What Are the Treatment Options for Patients With Inherited BRCA Mutated Genes?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】Following treatment options can be opted to treat patients with inherited BRCA variant genes.\n\n【51】*   **Surgical Management -**Treatment of breast or ovarian cancer involves completely removing the involved organ to prevent the cancer from spreading and reoccurring.\n\n【52】*   **PARP (Poly ADP Ribose Polymerase) Inhibitors -** It is a protein involved in DNA repair, which stops the growth of cancer cells. There are four PARP inhibitors that help in treating cancers: Olaparib, Niraparib, Rucaparib, and Talazoparib.\n\n【53】**Conclusion:**\n\n【54】Though cancer is being fought and there is an increasing number of cancer survivors, cancer-initiating genes can be found in any individual. Diagnosing tests for detecting the presence of genes are carried out, and required treatment is provided. Certain surgeries can prevent the effect of BRCA-mutated genes under the guidance of experienced oncologists, geneticists, and dermatologists. It is necessary to get tested for mutated BRCA genes when there is a family history of cancers related to the breast or ovaries.\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>*   BRCA1- and BRCA2-Associated Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/\n*   Cardiovascular risk of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers: A review  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27451331/\n*   BRCA Gene Mutations: Cancer Risk and Genetic Testing  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This pandemic is a highly stressful event that may lead to significant psychological symptoms, especially in patients with cancer who are at greater risk of contracting viruses. These have generated many delays and disruptions in cancer care for people with breast cancer. Whether newly diagnosed, in active treatment, long-term survivorship, or living with metastatic breast cancer, they add extra anxiety and risk to an already challenging journey.\n\n【2】This article will tell about the frequency of stressors experienced concerning the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic and its relationship with psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and fear of cancer recurrence in patients with breast cancer.\n\n【3】What Is Breast Cancer?\n----------------------\n\n【4】Breast cancer is a lump or mass in the breast that appears different from the surrounding tissue.

If a woman has felt any lump in her breast or experience any soreness in or around her breast or discharge from her nipple, she should get her symptoms evaluated right away.\n\n【5】Is There Any Link Between COVID-19 and Breast Cancer?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Breast cancer has one main intention to spread. Often, the first stop is in the lymph nodes, and as it advances, metastases can occur in distant parts of the body like the bones, lungs, liver, and brain. There may be swollen lymph nodes, bone pain, shortness of breath, or yellow skin in those with a distant spread of the disease. Some breast cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies, can weaken the immune system and cause lung problems. These people have a higher risk of acquiring severe complications if they become infected with this virus. For most people, the immune system improves within a couple of months after performing these treatments. But recovery time of the immune system can vary and may depend on several factors. And if someone has received these treatments in the past, it is unclear whether they are at higher risk of acquiring severe complications from COVID-19. People with breast cancer with metastasis (spread) to the lungs can also get lung problems that may worsen if they contract COVID-19.\n\n【7】How Has COVID-19 Changed Breast Cancer Care?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【8】People diagnosed with breast cancer and people at high risk for breast cancer have found themselves in a uniquely challenging and sometimes frightening position since the Coronavirus crisis began.\n\n【9】*   Many of them wondered if it is safe to go to regular medical appointments or whether to postpone treatments or screening.\n\n【10】*   At the beginning of this pandemic, many hospitals and healthcare facilities delayed or canceled elective procedures, like screenings, surgeries, and other treatments that were not considered urgent.\n\n【11】*   This was a distressing situation, but the healthcare facility made these tough decisions to protect people from the risk of contracting COVID-19 and ensure that the healthcare providers had the necessary resources to treat people with severe cases of COVID-19.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    For breast cancer, should we do chemo first or surgery?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Coronavirus - Parenting In Quarantine</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Coronavirus: Strictly Avoid Self-Medication</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Therefore, people often took appointments with oncologists through the telemedicine platform rather than in person. And oncologists had postponed some appointments if they felt it was safer to do so.\n    </u>\n\n【13】What Are the Widespread Delays and Interruptions in Breast Cancer Care During COVID Waves?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The COVID-19 has caused delays in many aspects of breast cancer care, including routine clinical visits, surveillance imaging, regular mammograms, reconstruction, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, mastectomy, and chemotherapy in the first wave. Patients also delay or change their treatment plans due to concerns about contracting COVID-19. And due to these interruptions in their care, many people were worried about their cancer growing or recurring. In addition, financial problems affecting their ability to pay for maintenance and losing their health insurance are the other concerns of people with breast cancer.\n\n【15】*   The change or delay in the surgical treatment plans in the past year also ended in some people requiring more surgeries overall. For example, patients who had to get a lumpectomy and a breast reduction in one operation had them done in two separate operations. And some patients needed a second procedure because they could not get the surgery they wanted at the beginning of the pandemic.\n\n【16】*   Breast reconstruction, which is considered elective surgery, was also postponed to preserve hospital resources and protect patients.\n\n【17】What Are the Risks of COVID-19 on Patients With Breast Cancer?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The virus has widely spread to many countries globally. However, since the number of cases differs in different regions, the immediate risk of coming into contact with the virus depends on the location. In addition, the risk of infection will continue to change over time as cases increase and decrease in different localities. Many women were not getting their mammography done, not going to the gynecologist, and not having a regular physical examination due to this pandemic.\n\n【19】*   Most people with COVID-19 infection will have no symptoms or will have only mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and may recover without special treatment or hospitalization.\n\n【20】*   But for people with cancer, it may increase their risk of having severe complications if they get infected with COVID-19.\n\n【21】*   This higher risk for severe complications from COVID-19 for people currently diagnosed with cancer is because cancer stresses the body and specific treatments can cause people to become immunocompromised or have lung problems.\n\n【22】*   Some chemotherapy medicines and targeted therapies given during breast cancer treatment can also cause lung problems, putting people at risk for severe COVID-19 complications.\n\n【23】What Are the Facts of COVID-19 Vaccines on Patients With Breast Cancer?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】The first COVID-19 vaccines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020 for emergency use are the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine.They are considered to be safe to administer in immunocompromised patients because they do not contain live viruses, including people being treated for cancer. Experts have also suggested most people with cancer or a history of cancer get a COVID-19 vaccine. Still, it would be best to talk to their doctor about whether getting vaccinated is the right decision for their situation.\n\n【25】**The side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines include:**\n\n【26】*   Pain or soreness in the arm where you receive the injection.\n\n【27】*   Muscle or joint pain.\n\n【28】*   Tiredness.\n\n【29】*   Headache.\n\n【30】*   Fever.\n\n【31】*   Chills.\n\n【32】**Side Effects of COVID-19 Vaccine Associated With Breast Cancer:**\n\n【33】*   Research has shown that women may experience worse side effects than men from the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n【34】*   Some vaccinated people have experienced swollen lymph nodes, including the axillary lymph nodes on the side where they got injected, called axillary adenopathy.\n\n【35】*   If anyone has had breast cancer, particularly if the underarm lymph nodes are removed, they could experience lymphedema as a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n【36】*   To reduce the risk, people with a history of breast cancer can request to put the vaccine injection in the opposite arm of the body where the breast cancer was present.\n\n【37】*   And if they have breast cancer in both breasts, they can talk with their doctor to decide which arm they should choose for the injection.\n\n【38】*   This swelling of the axillary lymph nodes after vaccination can be harmless for patients with no history of breast cancer, but they can feel it like breast lumps and cause some women to worry that it could be a sign of breast cancer.\n\n【39】*   These swollen lymph nodes can be shown on a mammogram, even if they cannot feel them, and could give a false-positive result when a mammogram shows an abnormal area that looks like cancer, but it turns out to be expected.\n\n【40】*   A false-positive mammogram result can lead to undesirable stress and additional testing. Hence, experts suggest people wait for four to six weeks after all doses of the COVID vaccine before getting a mammogram.\n\n【41】What Is the Role of Telemedicine in Breast Cancer Care in This Pandemic?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】Attempts to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by Coronavirus, concentrate on limiting how much you communicate with people outside your household. However, one way the condition has changed life for many people with breast cancer is by offering telemedicine, a term for medical appointments conducted over the phone or video calls. Telemedicine affords a safe and consistent environment for routine monitoring and prescribing non-infusion therapies for low-risk patients with well-managed diseases. In addition, oncologists specifically feel more comfortable using telemedicine for early-stage and specific subsets of patients with breast cancer, indicating a less complex decision-making process. Teleoncology, like other telehealth services, has several applications across different industries. For example, telepathology involves remote analysis and diagnosis based on television microscopy and such. It also provides remote supervision, palliative care, and tele-education.\n\n【43】**Conclusion:**\n\n【44】Battling breast cancer can cause significant stress and anxiety for both men and women, especially during the Coronavirus outbreak. But people need to overcome this with courage and strength. On the other hand, cancer type and cancer treatments did not show any risk of mortality from COVID-19. But, if anyone is very concerned about how the specific breast cancer treatments may affect the ability to recover from COVID-19, they should talk to their doctor and decide on a treatment plan that gives both of them peace of mind. In the past few years, cancer care has undergone some positive changes, one of which is the rise in telemedicine.\n\n【45】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【46】* * *\n\n【47】#### **1.**删除换行**Is There a Connection Between the COVID-19 Vaccine and Breast Cancer?**\n\n【48】No studies suggest a correlation between the COVID-19 vaccine and breast cancer.

{"seq_id": "16da13f6-a3db-43ea-bf41-b7feb826b26b", "title": "Bourbon Virus and Acute Kidney Injury - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Bourbon Virus and Acute Kidney Injury - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**:\n\n【1】The Bourbon virus is thought to be transmitted from an infected tick’s bite. The virus was first discovered in 2014 and named after Bourbon County, Kansas, where it was first discovered. A small number of bourbon virus disease cases have been reported in the Midwest and South of the United States. It is unknown if the virus is found in other parts of the United States. Lone-star tick is the carrier of this virus. Bourbon virus testing is only available in specialized laboratories such as the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Therefore, tests are not widely available, and the incidence may need to be reported more.\n\n【2】What Is Bourbon Virus-Induced Acute Kidney Injury?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Acute kidney injury (AKI), or acute renal failure (ARF), is a sudden onset of kidney failure or injury that occurs within hours or days. Other organs, like the brain, heart, and lungs, can also be affected by AKI. Acute kidney injury caused by Bourbon virus found in the lone-star tick.\n\n【4】What Are the Reasons and Risk Factors That Cause Bourbon Virus-Induced Acute Kidney Injury?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】A tick bite from a tick carrying the Bourbon virus causes this acute kidney injury. The virus that causes this illness belongs to the thogotovirus family and is transmitted through the lone star tick’s bite (Amblyomma americanum). Therefore, risk factors for Bourbon virus disease include activities that increase the risk of tick bites. The lone star tick was initially local to the southeastern and Midwestern United States but has spread to the north and west. However, it is not known yet how the virus is spread to other areas through this tick or other insects.\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Bourbon Virus-Induced Acute Kidney Injury?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Little is known about Bourbon virus disease. However, based on the small number of cases reported to date, symptoms and signs include the following:\n\n【8】*   Fever.\n\n【9】*   Fatigue.\n\n【10】*   Pale pink rash.\n\n【11】*   Nausea.\n\n【12】*   Vomiting.\n\n【13】*   Headache.\n\n【14】*   Body aches.\n\n【15】*   Low white blood cell count.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I have fever, chills and diagnosed with UTI.

If the tick is still firmly attached to the body, trained practitioners should remove it carefully. In addition, if any of the following signs are noticed, medical help should be sought:\n\n【29】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【30】*   Fever.\n\n【31】*   Chills.\n\n【32】*   Blood in Urine.\n\n【33】*   Nausea.\n\n【34】How Is Bourbon Virus-Induced Acute Kidney Injury Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】To detect bourbon virus disease, the CDC uses polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology to detect the virus’s genetic material. People with suspected tick bites and subsequent fever are screened for the Bourbon virus disease. Signs of acute kidney injury may prompt the physician to run urine and blood tests to check for kidney injury. Imaging tests of kidneys like ultrasounds and magnetic resonance imaging may be done to check for any changes in the anatomy of the kidney.\n\n【36】How Is Bourbon Virus-Induced Acute Kidney Injury Treated?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Currently, there are no vaccines to prevent infection from this virus. Since bacteria do not cause the Bourbon virus-induced kidney disease, it does not respond to antibiotics. Although there are ways to relieve symptoms, no specific medications can eliminate the Bourbon virus. Medicines are prescribed to reduce pain and fever. A few measures that can be helpful with the recovery from kidney injury are:\n\n【38】*   Low protein diet.\n\n【39】*   Increased water intake.\n\n【40】*   Drugs that control blood pressure and regulate electrolytes in the blood may be given. Treatments to keep the body hydrated (for example, water pills to rid the body of excess water).\n\n【41】*   If AKI is severe and the kidneys have completely failed, dialysis may be required for a short period.\n\n【42】Dialysis is a treatment that cleans blood with a machine. Dialysis does what the kidneys have to do until they recover. So first, at home, help the kidneys recover by following a kidney-friendly diet. Then, the doctor may refer further to a licensed nutritionist.\n\n【43】How to Prevent Bourbon Virus-Induced Acute Kidney Injury?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】There is no cure or specialized treatment for the Bourbon virus, so the next best thing to be done is to prevent it. While ticks are active year-round, single-star ticks are most active between April and September. The measures listed below can be taken to prevent infection with the Bourbon virus illness:\n\n【45】*   Wearing full-length trousers covering the legs while walking in an area with thick growths or tall grasses. The trouser legs should be tucked into the socks to keep the ticks out.\n\n【46】*   Covering the arms with a long-sleeved shirt.\n\n【47】*   Wear light-colored clothing to increase the visibility of the ticks when attached.\n\n【48】*   Wear well-fitting shoes with socks.\n\n【49】*   Staying on trails and avoiding bushes and grassy areas is recommended.\n\n【50】*   Spraying insect repellent DEET (N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) all over the clothes. But read the safety information on the label first.\n\n【51】*   Checking for ticks as soon as one walks indoors. Ticks typically attach themselves to the neck, armpits, and groin. Hence people should carefully check these areas.\n\n【52】*   Remove ticks from the body with tweezers as soon as they are noticed.\n\n【53】*   It is not yet known if pets can get the Bourbon virus. However, if living in an area where ticks are present, precautionary measures should be adopted and practiced.\n\n【54】*   If the pet does exhibit strange symptoms, it should be taken to a veterinarian and treated.\n\n【55】How Is a Tick Removed Safely?\n-----------------------------\n\n【56】On discovering a tick on the skin, remove it as soon as possible. Several tick-removal devices are on the market, but simple fine-tipped tweezers are very effective.\n\n【57】*   Using clean, fine-tipped tweezers, grasp the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible.\n\n【58】*   Make sure to grasp the tick by the head and not press the abdomen. The pathogens reside in the tick’s abdominal cavity. The pressure at the abdomen can cause the organisms in the abdomen cavity to be injected into the host’s body.\n\n【59】*   Pull up with steady and even pressure. Do not twist or pull the tick. This can detach the head and the mouth and leave them embedded in the skin. In this case, remove the embedded parts with tweezers. If it cannot be easily plucked out with the help of tweezers, it is advised to leave it alone and seek immediate medical help.\n\n【60】*   Once the tick has been detached from the skin, wash the affected area and hands thoroughly with rubbing alcohol, soap, and water.\n\n【61】*   Do not crush the tick with your fingers. Discard live ticks by:\n\n【62】1.  Putting alcohol on it.\n\n【63】2.  Put in an airtight bag or container.\n\n【64】3.  Wrap tightly with packing tape.\n\n【65】4.  Flush it down the toilet.\n\n【66】**Conclusion**:\n\n【67】Bourbon virus is transmitted via the tick to humans. This virus belongs to the thogotovirus family and causes acute kidney injury. Due to the limited number of known cases, the prognosis and overall survival of the Bourbon virus disease have not been determined. At least two Bourbon patients have died, one in Kansas and one in Missouri, USA. As the prevalence of tick-borne diseases continues to rise across the United States, there is a growing concern about the potential for atypical manifestations, especially since early diagnosis and treatment can be curative and prevent further complications. Raising awareness is important.\n\n【68】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【69】无关删除-1:<u>*   Bourbon Virus in Field-Collected Ticks, Missouri, USA  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5708220/\n*   Bourbon Virus  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/bourbon-virus/index.html\n*   Tick-borne infections in the United States  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23958360/\n*   Tick-borne disease  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15999870/\n*   Novel Thogotovirus Associated with Febrile Illness and Death, United States, 2014  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4412252/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Different types of fevers can be caused by different pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, and can affect different parts of the body, such as the respiratory system, urinary system, and gastrointestinal system. When an infection is detected by the body, different chemicals are produced by the body's immune system, such as cytokines, which can cause inflammation and activate the body's fever response.\n\n【2】Fever is a natural defense mechanism that guides the body to fight off the infection by raising the body's temperature and making it a less hospitable environment for the invading pathogen.\n\n【3】The severity and duration of a fever can vary depending on the type of infection and the immune system response of the infected person. In some cases, fever may be a mild symptom that resolves on its own, while in other cases it may be a sign of a more serious infection that requires proper medical attention and treatment.\n\n【4】What Are the Different Types of Fever in Infections?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Fever is a symptom of many different types of infections. Some types of fever that may occur with various types of infections are as follows:\n\n【6】*   **Acute Fever:** Acute fever usually develops suddenly and can last for a short time. It is commonly associated with acute infections such as flu, colds, and ear infections. Acute fever can also be caused by non-infectious conditions such as autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders, and medication side effects.\n\n【7】*   **Chronic Fever:** Chronic fever lasts for a longer period, usually about two weeks or more, and is associated with certain chronic infections such as tuberculosis or HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus).\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Fever in Babies: When to Call the Doctor</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Acquired Lymphocytopenia - Causes, Symptoms, Risk Factors, Diagnosis and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Albuminuria - Symptoms, Complications, and Prevention</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【9】*   **Sustained Or Continuous Fever:** In this type of fever, the temperature remains above the normal range and it does not show any fluctuations, examples are fever in bacterial endocarditis, typhoid fever, and urinary tract infections (UTIs).\n\n【10】*   **Intermittent Fever:** Intermittent type of fever usually occurs in cycles, the temperature of the body associated with this type of fever keeps on rising and falling over a while. Examples of intermittent fever are fever associated with malaria, septicemia, and bacterial infections.\n\n【11】*   **Remittent Fever:** It is a similar type of fever to intermittent fever, but fluctuations in temperature occur more widely and do not return to normal levels. It is often seen in infectious diseases such as dengue fever, typhoid fever, and septicemia.\n\n【12】*   **Pel-Ebstein Fever:** This fever is associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma and is characterized by fever cycles that last for one to two weeks.\n\n【13】*   **Septic Fever:** This type of fever occurs in response to a severe infection and is characterized by a high temperature and the fever does not respond to any antipyretic medication.\n\n【14】*   **Postoperative Fever:** Postoperative fever is associated with surgery and surgical site and is often caused by an infection at the surgical site.\n\n【15】What Are Common Signs and Symptoms Associated With Fever Caused by Infection?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Fever itself is a symptom of infection, and it can be accompanied by a range of symptoms. Some common symptoms are:\n\n【17】*   **Elevated Body Temperature:** A fever is defined as a body temperature above the normal range, which is generally considered to be 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius) taken orally. A fever in infection may range from a mild elevation of temperature to a high fever of over 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius) or more.\n\n【18】*   **Chills:** Chills may occur as the body tries to generate heat to increase its temperature to fight off the infection.\n\n【19】*   **Headache:** Headaches are symptoms associated with fever in an infection, and can be caused by the release of inflammatory chemicals in the body.\n\n【20】*   **Body Aches And Muscle Pain:** Body aches and pains throughout the body are common symptoms of fever in an infection, and can be caused by inflammation and muscle tension.\n\n【21】*   **Fatigue:** Fatigue and weakness are common symptoms of fever in an infection, and can be caused by the body's immune response and metabolic changes.\n\n【22】*   **Sweating:** Sweating is a common symptom of fever in an infection, and can be caused by the body's attempt to cool down by releasing heat through the skin. It is performed by the glands present under the skin.\n\n【23】*   **Loss of Appetite**: A loss of appetite is a common symptom of fever in an infection, as the body is more focused to prioritize the energy towards the immune response rather than digestion.\n\n【24】If the fever persists for a longer time with symptoms like difficulty breathing, persistent high fever, chest pain, or confusion, it is better to visit a healthcare professional immediately.\n\n【25】How to Treat Fever in an Infection?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【26】The treatment of fever in an infection depends on the cause of the infection, the severity of the fever, the individual's health, and any underlying diseases. However, general measures that can help manage fever in infection are as follows:\n\n【27】*   **Stay Hydrated:** It is necessary to drink plenty of fluids such as water, fruit juice, or broth to prevent dehydration (a common complication of fever).\n\n【28】*   **Rest:** Trying to get adequate rest, as it can be a useful tool to conserve the body's energy and aid in healing.\n\n【29】*   **Manage Temperature:** Use of a cool compress, taking a cool bath or shower, or wearing light clothing can help to lower body temperature and relieve discomfort associated with the fever.\n\n【30】*   **Medications:** Over-the-counter (OTC) fever-reducing medications such as Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen help to lower body temperature and relieve symptoms such as headaches and body aches. It is important to follow the recommended dosage and consult a healthcare provider if there are any concerns or if the fever persists even after taking the medicines.\n\n【31】*   **Addressing the Underlying Infection:** Treating the underlying infection with antibiotics, antiviral medication, or other treatments may be necessary to resolve the fever. Visit the doctor for proper dosages and prescriptions.\n\n【32】**Conclusion:**\n\n【33】It is important to note that not all infections will cause a fever, and not all fevers are caused by infections. Other conditions can cause a fever, such as autoimmune disorders, certain medications, and even some types of cancer. If the fever lasts more than a few days or is accompanied by other symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention to determine the underlying cause.\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【35】无关删除-1:<u>*   Fever as an important resource for infectious diseases research  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869589/\n*   Fever  \n    https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/fever\n*   Fever  \n    https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/physically/fever/what-is-fever\n*   Fever  \n    https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/fever</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The antidiuretic hormone helps the kidney to control the water balance in the body and excretion of it through the urine. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is made by the hypothalamus and then released by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. SIADH is characterized by impaired water excretion resulting in hyponatremia (increase in salt content) with hypervolemia (increase in water content). It generally occurs secondary to other diseases in the body. SIADH can be hereditary, also called nephrogenic SIADH, caused due to mutation in vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors in the kidney.\n\n【2】What Is Anti Diuretic Hormone?\n------------------------------\n\n【3】Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is formed in the hypothalamus and released from the pituitary gland. It acts to maintain blood pressure, blood volume, and tissue water content in the body. It controls the amount of water and hence the concentration of urine excreted by the kidney. The release of antidiuretic hormone occurs when there is a decrease in blood volume or low blood pressure, which occurs during dehydration (not drinking enough water), or hemorrhage (loss of blood). This is detected by sensors called baroreceptors in the heart and large blood vessels. These stimulate the release of antidiuretic hormone. High levels of antidiuretic hormone prevent the excretion of water by the kidneys, for example, SIADH. Low levels of the antidiuretic hormone will cause the kidney to excrete excess water. Urine volume increases, leading to dehydration and a drop in blood pressure.\n\n【4】What Causes Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH)?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Conditions leading to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion are -\n\n【6】*   **Disturbances in the Central Nervous System -** Any abnormality in the central nervous system like stroke, infection, hemorrhage, psychosis, and mental illness can enhance ADH release from the pituitary gland leading to SIADH.\n\n【7】*   **Malignancies -** Small cell lung cancer is found to be the most common tumor-causing ADH production, and extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas, head neck cancers, and olfactory neuroblastoma can also cause an increase in the release of ADH hormone.\n\n【8】*   **Drugs -** The most common drugs associated with SIADH are Carbamazepine, Chlorpropamide, Oxcarbazepine, Cyclophosphamide, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n\n【9】*   **Surgery -** Hypersecretion of ADH hormone is often associated with surgical procedures and mediated by pain afferent.\n\n【10】*   **Pulmonary Disease -** Pulmonary diseases caused by viral, bacterial, and tuberculous infections, particularly pneumonia, can lead to SIADH by unknown mechanisms. A similar mechanism is also seen in patients with asthma, acute respiratory failure, and pneumothorax.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Paroxetine - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Drug Warnings, and Precautions</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Quetiapine Fumarate - Indications, Side effects, Dosage, and Administration</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Lung Cancer?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   **Hormone Deficiency -** Hypopituitarism and hypothyroidism can cause hyponatremia and SIADH.\n\n【12】*   **Hormone Administration -** The excess release of the antidiuretic hormone can be induced by exogenous hormone administration by increasing the activity of vasopressin receptors.\n\n【13】*   **Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection -** Hyponatremia is caused due to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, early symptomatic HIV infection, or it can be due to volume depletion secondary to adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【14】*   **Hereditary SIADH -** A mutation in the gene for the renal vasopressin receptor (V2) situated on the X chromosome causes hereditary SIADH.\n    </u>\n\n【15】What Are the Symptoms of Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH)?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】*   **Cerebral Oedema -** Decrease in sodium concentration in blood and extracellular fluid commonality causes the water to move inside the cells causing cerebral edema.\n\n【17】*   **Hyponatremia -** Sodium concentration below 125 to 130 milliequivalent per liter is called hyponatremia and can cause symptoms like malaise and nausea. Severe falls in sodium concentration can also cause headaches, lethargy, and seizures. If the sodium concentration falls below 115 to 120 milliequivalents per liter, it can lead to respiratory arrest and coma.\n\n【18】*   **Chronic Hyponatremia -** The patient remains asymptomatic despite a serum sodium concentration below 120 mmol per liter because of cerebral adaptation to low sodium concentration. Symptoms like nausea, vomiting, cognitive problems, fatigue, muscle cramps, confusion, gait disturbances, and dizziness can occur.\n\n【19】*   **Impaired Water Excretion -** The water excretion is affected due to excess release of antidiuretic hormone. This leads to the retention of fluid inside the body.\n\n【20】*   **Hypervolaemia -** It is a condition characterized by the retention of water inside the body.\n\n【21】Other symptoms include -\n\n【22】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【23】*   Problems in balance can result in falls.\n\n【24】*   Headache.\n\n【25】*   Mental changes like strange behavior, confusion, and memory problems.\n\n【26】*   Severe retention of water can lead to seizures or coma.\n\n【27】How Is Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】It is very necessary to diagnose hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency before confirming the patient with SIADH. Test for detection of SIADH -\n\n【29】*   Serum osmolality and serum sodium.\n\n【30】*   Urine sodium concentration and commonality.\n\n【31】*   Renal function test for blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.\n\n【32】*   Blood sugar random (BSR).\n\n【33】*   Liver function tests.\n\n【34】*   Fasting lipid profile.\n\n【35】*   Thyroid profile.\n\n【36】*   Serum cortisol.\n\n【37】*   Serum potassium, bicarbonate, and chloride.\n\n【38】How Is Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) Treated?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】*   **Sodium Levels -** Patients suffering from chronic SIADH Have a combination of ADH-induced water retention and secondary solute loss. The treatment involves the correction and maintenance of corrected sodium levels and underlying abnormalities such as hypothyroidism or pulmonary or CNS infection. For patients presenting with mild to moderate symptoms, the main goal of the treatment is the restriction of water intake to less than 800 milliliters per day.\n\n【40】*   **Hyponatremia -** In case of consistent low sodium levels, sodium chloride in the form of oral salt tablets or intravenous line solution can be given. Diuretics such as Furosemide can also be prescribed to decrease urine concentration and increase water excretion.\n\n【41】*   **Severe Symptoms -** In order to treat severe symptoms such as seizures, confusion, and delirium, initial management of the condition with hypertonic saline infusion for the first few hours should be done. A three percent hypertonic bolus of 100 milliliters of saline is administered in the first three to four hours, and sodium levels are checked within two to three hours so that further doses can be adjusted.\n\n【42】*   **Severe Persistent SIADH -** Vasopressin receptor antagonists such as Conivaptan or Tolvaptan can be given. These drugs prevent ADH-mediated water retention by antagonizing vasopressin receptors and V2 suppression to correct hyponatremia.\n\n【43】**Conclusion :**\n\n【44】Hyponatremia generally occurs secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. The diagnosis is made by confirming the presence of serum hyponatremia and natriuresis. Clinical symptoms depend upon the rate of development of hyponatremia. Symptoms include confusion, headache, vomiting, nausea, anorexia, convulsions, and coma. The treatment is decided based on the severity of the clinical symptoms.\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>*   Clinical Laboratory Evaluation of the Syndrome of Inappropriate Secretion of Antidiuretic Hormone  \n    https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/3/4/1175\n*   Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000314.htm\n*   Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507777/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "ece33ae9-131b-4adc-82f2-8d545d95d867", "title": "Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment", "text": "【0】Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】A pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is an unusual connection between the pulmonary artery and vein. The blood vessels are dilated and cause a right-to-left shunt between the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein. It is a congenital disorder. It is more common in females than males. It is a condition that does not depend on the underlying disease.\n\n【2】What Is Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【3】An arteriovenous fistula is an unusual connection between an artery and a vein. It can be congenital or acquired. A pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection between the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein, resulting in a right-to-left shunt between the pulmonary artery and vein. As a result, the blood entering the lungs does not receive enough oxygen.\n\n【4】**What Is the Significance of the Pulmonary Artery and Pulmonary Vein?**\n\n【5】The pulmonary artery carries oxygen-poor blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs for oxygenation. The pulmonary veins carry the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart. This forms pulmonary circulation.\n\n【6】What Are the Causes of Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】A pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is a congenital condition. It can occur as a complication of liver disease. It is common in individuals with Rendu-Osler-Weber disease, also called hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. A pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is common in this disease because abnormal blood vessels exist in many body parts. It can also occur due to the rupture of an arterial aneurysm into an adjacent vein, penetrating injuries, or inflammatory necrosis of adjacent vessels.\n\n【8】What Are the Effects of Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】An arteriovenous fistula decreases peripheral resistance, which causes the heart to increase cardiac output to regularize the blood flow to all the tissues. It is manifested by normal systolic blood pressure and decreased diastolic blood pressure, which results in wider pulse pressure. An arteriovenous fistula can increase the preload.\n\n【10】Arteriovenous shunts decrease the afterload of the heart. This is due to the blood bypassing the arterioles, which decreases total peripheral resistance. Arteriovenous shunts increase the rate and volume of the blood that returns to the heart. In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, there is a direct connection between the arterioles and venules at the mucocutaneous region and internal bodily organs without intervening capillary beds. It usually does not cause symptoms, but it may result in difficulty breathing. If the pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is left untreated, it may result in a paradoxical embolism in which the blood clot travels from the lungs to the arms, legs, or brain.\n\n【11】What Are the Types of Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】A pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is classified into simple and complex fistulas.\n\n【13】*   **Simple Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula** \\- Simple pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas are the common type. It presents as a well-defined peripheral nodule and can be rounded or multilobulated. It appears as a single aneurysmal sac in the histological section. It contains a single segmental artery as the feeding artery.\n\n【14】*   **Complex Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula-** It consists of multiple abnormal vessels and one or more lobulated venous sacs of variable size. It is supplied by more than one feeding artery that often arises from the adjacent segmental pulmonary artery branches. A complex fistula involves the lung segment or an entire lobe.\n\n【15】What Are the Symptoms Associated With Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Individuals with pulmonary arteriovenous fistula usually do not develop any symptoms.\n\n【17】The following are the symptoms if it develops:\n\n【18】*   Difficulty in breathing.\n\n【19】*   Difficulty in exercising.\n\n【20】*   Sputum with blood.\n\n【21】*   Nose bleeding.\n\n【22】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【23】*   Chest pain.\n\n【24】*   Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin).\n\n【25】*   Clubbing of fingers.\n\n【26】What Are the Complications of Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】The complications of pulmonary arteriovenous fistula include:\n\n【28】*   Bleeding in the lungs.\n\n【29】*   Paradoxical venous embolism results in stroke due to blood clots traveling from the arms and legs.\n\n【30】*   Infection in the brain or heart valve in individuals with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia\n\n【31】How Is Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】The diagnosis is based on examinations and tests. It includes the following clinical findings and tests:\n\n【33】*   Abscesses or infections in the heart valves.\n\n【34】*   Presence of abnormal vessels on the skin or mucus membranes.\n\n【35】*   The presence of abnormal sounds is called murmur when the stethoscope is placed over the abnormal blood vessel.\n\n【36】*   Increase in red blood cell count.\n\n【37】*   Low oxygen levels.\n\n【38】The tests done to diagnose the pulmonary arteriovenous fistula are:\n\n【39】*   Arterial blood gas test.\n\n【40】*   Complete blood count.\n\n【41】*   A chest X-ray is done to locate the fistula.\n\n【42】*   CT (computed tomography) scan of the chest is performed to examine the structure and condition of the fistula.\n\n【43】*   Echocardiogram with bubbles to assess the heart's function and identify the presence of a shunt.\n\n【44】*   Lung function tests.\n\n【45】*   Liver function tests.\n\n【46】*   Perfusion radionuclide lung scan to assess the breathing and circulation in all areas of the lungs.\n\n【47】*   A pulmonary arteriogram uses a contrast dye to examine the lungs' arteries and the fistula.\n\n【48】How Is Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula Treated?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【49】Treatment is not required for individuals who do not develop any symptoms. The main treatment option for a fistula is to block the fistula during an arteriogram. The procedure is called embolization. Embolization is a minimally invasive procedure performed to stop bleeding or block the blood flow to an abnormal area of tissue. Particles like tiny gelatin sponges or beads block the blood vessels. However, the fistula can recur if the embolization fails. Surgery may be required to remove the abnormal blood vessels and adjacent lung tissues. A liver transplant is performed if the pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is caused by liver disease.\n\n【50】**What to Expect With Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula?**\n\n【51】A pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is a genetic condition that cannot be prevented. The prognosis is not good in pulmonary arteriovenous fistula for patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia as those without it. Surgical removal of abnormal vessels in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia has a good prognosis.\n\n【52】**Conclusion**\n\n【53】A pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is a rare condition with an abnormal connection between the pulmonary artery and vein. It is a congenital respiratory disorder. It can be treated but cannot be prevented. Individuals with pulmonary arteriovenous fistula usually do not present any symptoms. Diagnosis and timely intervention help in the prevention of complications.\n\n【54】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【55】* * *\n\n【56】#### **1.**删除换行**What Arteries Connect to the Lungs?**\n\n【57】From the heart to the lungs, there is a flow of blood through the pulmonary arteries. These are the only arteries in the body that transport oxygen-depleted (deoxygenated) blood. The pulmonary valve is where the main pulmonary artery (pulmonary trunk) leaves the right ventricle.\n\n【58】#### **2.**删除换行**Do the Lungs Receive Blood From Both an Artery and a Vein?**\n\n【59】The right portion of the heart receives blood through veins. The blood travels through pulmonary arteries to the lungs, where it is oxygenated. The oxygen-rich blood flows to the left side of the heart via pulmonary veins.\n\n【60】#### **3.**删除换行**What Causes Blockage of the Artery in the Lungs?**\n\n【61】Blood clots typically originate in the legs before ascending to the right side of the heart and entering the lungs. This is known as DVT, which stands for deep vein thrombosis. A blood clot that prevents blood flow to a lung artery is known as a pulmonary embolism.\n\n【62】#### **4.**删除换行**What Is Unique About the Blood Supply to the Lung?**\n\n【63】The only organ with two circulations is the lung. The pulmonary circulation, the principal function of which is gas exchange, and the bronchial circulation, a systemic vascular supply that gives oxygenated blood to the walls of the conducting airways, pulmonary arteries, and veins.\n\n【64】#### **5.**删除换行**Why Are the Veins and Venules in the Lungs Unusual?**\n\n【65】The only exception of all the veins in the body that carry oxygen-rich blood is the pulmonary veins. All other veins carry blood that lacks oxygen. In a similar way, the only arteries that can carry blood that lacks oxygen are the pulmonary arteries. The remaining arteries carry oxygen-rich blood throughout.\n\n【66】#### **6.**删除换行**What Happens When a Blockage Occurs in the Pulmonary Artery?**\n\n【67】It becomes more difficult for blood to flow through the lungs when blood vessels become thickened, narrowed, blocked, or destroyed. Consequently, pulmonary hypertension, also known as pulmonary artery hypertension, develops.\n\n【68】#### **7.**删除换行**What Is the Purpose of an Arteriovenous Fistula?**\n\n【69】In patients with severe kidney disease, a surgical arteriovenous fistula may be created for dialysis use. The location of an arteriovenous fistula in the body determines its symptoms. Serious complications can result from a large arteriovenous fistula that is left untreated.\n\n【70】#### **8.**删除换行**How Does an Arteriovenous Fistula Develop?**\n\n【71】Arteriovenous fistulas can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired. Arteriovenous fistulas can be caused by piercing injuries to the skin. A gunshot or stab wound to an area of the body where an artery and vein are next to each other can cause an arteriovenous fistula.\n\n【72】#### **9.**删除换行**Is Arteriovenous Fistula Curable?**\n\n【73】Endovascular embolization is the most common method for treating and curing arteriovenous fistula. Open brain surgical procedures are seldom expected to treat arteriovenous fistula.\n\n【74】#### **10.**删除换行**Is Arteriovenous Fistula a High-Risk Procedure?**\n\n【75】Most of the time, AV fistula surgery is done outpatient and takes a few hours. It very well may be finished under general anesthesia or through a desensitizing of the arm.\n\n【76】#### **11.**删除换行**How Serious Are Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations?**\n\n【77】Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) arterial rupture, which can result in life-threatening hemoptysis or hemothorax, may be one of the local pulmonary complications. As a result, treatment and evaluation of even patients with small pulmonary AVMs should be referred.\n\n【78】#### **12.**删除换行**What Are the Four Pulmonary Veins?**\n\n【79】Typically, there are four pulmonary veins, two for each lung -  \n\\- Right Superior Vein: Drains the right upper and middle lobes.  \n\\- Right Inferior Vein: Drains the right lower lobe.  \n\\- Left Superior Vein: Drains the left upper lobe.  \n\\- Left Inferior Vein: Drains the left lower lobe.\n\n【80】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【81】无关删除-1:<u>*   Medilineplus- Pulmonary arteriovenous fistula  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001090.htm\n*   NIH- Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistula: Clinical and Histologic Spectrum of Four Cases  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5042895/\n*   NIH- Pulmonary arteriovenous fistula: presentation, diagnosis, and treatment  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10501873/\n*   AHA- Development of Pulmonary Arteriovenous Fistulae in Children After Cavopulmonary Shunt  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.CIR.92.9.309</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

While the summer squashes are primarily members of the gourd family, they are also the cousins of the winter squash group of veggies. These summer squashes, especially zucchinis, commonly arrive in various sizes, shapes, and colors. Almost all zucchinis are green and long, but some varieties come in green and white. People often mistake or refer to yellow squash as yellow zucchini, but technically the yellow squash is not zucchini but rather a similar yet different variety of summer squash. Zucchini, the yellow crookneck, and scallop squash are common and popular summer squash family varieties. Zucchini is also colloquially called marrow or vegetable marrow, or Italian marrow in some countries, while it also goes by the name of courgette in some. Zucchini veggie is easy to find in most markets and gourmet stores. This vegetable is a source of several essential micronutrients, such as vitamins C and B6. This versatile vegetable is technically a fruit as per botanical terminology. However, all the same, it is quite low in calories which makes a great yet healthy addition to a balanced diet form.\n\n【2】What Are the Nutrition Contents of Zucchini?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】One cup of raw, chopped zucchini, approximately 124 grams, would yield 21 calories, around 1.5 grams of protein, 3.9 grams of carbohydrates, and a negligible 0.4 grams of fat. According to the nutrition info enlisted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for 124 grams per raw cup of zucchini, it is mentioned as follows:\n\n【4】Total Calories: 21\n\n【5】*   Vitamin C: 22.2 milligrams.\n\n【6】*   Potassium: 324 milligrams.\n\n【7】*   Magnesium: 22.3 milligrams.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Risankizumab - Uses, Mechanism of Action, Precautions, and Side Effects</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Succinate-Coenzyme A Ligase Deficiency - Causes, Symptoms, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What causes uneven skintone and open pores?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Vitamin B6: 0.2 milligrams.\n\n【9】*   Folate: 29.8 micrograms.\n\n【10】*   Sodium: 9.9 milligrams.\n\n【11】*   Carbohydrates: 3.9 grams.\n\n【12】*   Fiber: 1.2 grams.\n\n【13】*   Sugars: 3.1 grams.\n\n【14】*   Fat: 0.4 grams.\n\n【15】*   Protein: 1.5 grams.\n\n【16】*   Vitamin K: 5.3 micrograms.\n    </u>\n\n【17】The estimated glycemic load of a single serving of a raw cup of zucchini is around two, making it an easy addition to a healthy diet as a low-glycemic food. Estimating glycemic load always considers the serving size when estimating a food's impact on blood sugar levels. Zucchini, thus, is suited to pre-diabetics and diabetics. Apart from being rich in vitamin C and vitamin B6, smaller amounts of vitamin A, folate, riboflavin, and thiamin are also yielded by this veggie. The minerals in zucchini include a minute or trace content of manganese, potassium, small amounts of magnesium, and phosphorus.\n\n【18】**Facts to Know:**\n\n【19】According to the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, oral allergy syndrome or OAS is caused by some cross-reacting allergens found in pollen birch, ragweed, or grass pollens and, of course commonly even in raw fruits, vegetables, or nuts. According to this college research, cooking zucchini would likely prevent symptoms of OAS owing to the antioxidant nature of the vegetable. Zucchini might also contain cucurbitacins, bitter compounds added to certain types of insecticides. However, if the cucurbitacins are produced at very mild or low concentrations, then the zucchini will not have any bitter flavor usually as such.\n\n【20】What Are the Systemic Health Benefits and Research?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】1.  According to nutrition experts, vitamin C in a one-cup raw serving of zucchini can contribute to nearly two percent of daily needs. Hence vitamin C is an excellent antioxidant that boosts immunity and prevents cellular damage, but it can also slow down the aging process in the body.\n\n【22】2.  Preliminary research demonstrates that intake of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables such as green leafy veggies, cruciferous veggies, and some of the summer squash veggies like zucchini can prevent the risk of certain cancers like colon, breast, lung, or esophageal cancers.\n\n【23】3.  Zucchini is known to reduce the PMS or premenstrual syndrome clinical symptoms because of the B6 vitamin in it, but more research is underway to prove the same. Similarly, it is also shown to reduce symptoms like morning sickness during early pregnancy, according to some preliminary studies.\n\n【24】How to Clean and Store Zucchini?\n--------------------------------\n\n【25】While purchasing zucchini, make sure its skin is firm to the touch along with a stem, while the squash should feel heavy for its size. Preserving zucchini whole and unwashed in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week is best. Before slicing, wash the veggie's skin thoroughly with a vegetable brush and run it through or wash it thoroughly in cold water.\n\n【26】How to Best Use Zucchini?\n-------------------------\n\n【27】The best way to use zucchini commonly is to add it shredded to other foods to increase the moisture content, nutrients, fiber, and volume of meals. For instance, adding zucchini to baked goods like muffins, sweets, savory bread, or cakes provides the requisite moisture to these items. Adding essential vitamins and minerals can counteract the effect of sugars in these foods. Shredded, sliced, or spiralized zucchini can be added to carbohydrate-based meals to enhance nutrient density or is best used in oatmeal or pasta dishes, casseroles, soups, eggs, and even smoothies. Though many people wonder if it is safe to consume raw zucchini with the skin, it would be surprising to know that on washing and cleaning the vegetable thoroughly, even the skin can be consumed. It maximizes the intake of antioxidant content from this edible veggie. Even the seeds of zucchini are edible as well. One can try dipping raw zucchini in a sauce or a dip for an added flavor. The standard way is to chop it up and add it to a salad. However, one can add this alongside any tasty vegetable while preparing a meal. The thin, soft, and moist flesh of this veggie is suited well to all forms of cooking, whether zucchini is steamed, grilled, roasted, baked, or even sauteed.\n\n【28】**Conclusion:**\n\n【29】Zucchini is an edible, low-calorie fruit or vegetable filled with vitamins C and B6. It can be a flavorful and antioxidant-rich addition to the meals. It has the potential to prevent oral allergy syndrome in some individuals. There are various ways to prepare zucchini, making it a versatile and nutritious ingredient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It also protects the eardrum from infections, trauma, and water. Some people produce soft wax, while others produce hard wax. This is genetically determined.\n\n【1】Normally, earwax occurs as fine flakes which fall off during jaw movements while chewing. But, it may accumulate in the ear due to various reasons. The existing cerumen will usually fall out of the ear naturally.\n\n【2】What Causes Excessive Earwax to Form?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【3】Excessive earwax can build up in the canal either because the person tends to produce hard wax or pushes the wax deeper into the canal using earbuds and other objects.\n\n【4】It can cause pain, hearing problems, itching, ringing sensations in the ear, heaviness, ear fullness, and ear discharge. Treatment options include the use of wax softening agents, instrumentation, and syringing.\n\n【5】Self-cleaning of the wax buildup should always be avoided as it may cause trauma to the eardrum. Always seek help from a professional ENT (ear, nose, and throat) doctor for wax cleaning.\n\n【6】The other factors that increase the risk of too much earwax may include:\n\n【7】*   Production of hard or dry earwax.\n\n【8】*   Narrow or hairy ear canals.\n\n【9】*   Older adults tend to have dry earwax.\n\n【10】*   Bony growths in the external part of the ear canal.\n\n【11】*   Frequent insertion of objects in the ear canal like cotton buds, earplugs, or hearing aids can cause blockage of ears by the earwax.\n\n【12】**Symptoms of Excess Earwax Buildup:**\n\n【13】1.  Pain: Wax is the most common cause of earache.\n\n【14】2.  Hearing Problem: Wax buildup can cause hearing problems due to mechanical obstruction. Deafness may also be precipitated when water enters the ear during a bath to swell the wax.\n\n【15】3.  Itching: Earwax impaction can cause ear irritation and itchiness.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Can I use earbuds to remove ear wax?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Do not Use Earbuds to Remove Wax!!</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Do I need to visit a doctor for ear block issue?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n4.

The earwax can be wet or dry based on the genetics.\n\n【28】**Wet Earwax:**\n\n【29】*   Wet earwax comes in a range of colors, including light yellow, orange-brown, and honey-colored. Wet earwax is sticky.\n\n【30】*   Wet earwax is usually seen in people of European and African descent.\n\n【31】*   People with wet earwax may need deodorant more than people with dry earwax because a chemical that makes a sweat smell is not present in dry earwax.\n\n【32】**Dry Earwax:**\n\n【33】*   Dry earwax is likely to be whitish or gray and flaky.\n\n【34】*   Darker colored earwax denotes an older earwax. It usually contains dust and has more exposure to the air.\n\n【35】*   If the earwax produces any discharge, whitish or greenish color, or blood in the earwax, consult with your healthcare provider.\n\n【36】*   Dry earwax is seen in people of Asian, East Asian, and Native American descent.\n\n【37】How To Diagnose Earwax Blockage?\n--------------------------------\n\n【38】A doctor can diagnose earwax blockage by listening to the patient's symptoms and then looking into the ear with an otoscope (ear scope).\n\n【39】What To Do If You Feel That You Have Excess Earwax?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】*   If you feel that you have excess earwax in your ears, never try to remove it on your own with a cotton bud or any other object. This can damage your eardrum or push the wax further into the internal ear.\n\n【41】*   If the earwax causes only mild symptoms, you can get over-the-counter ear drop from the pharmacy to help soften the earwax and make it fall out naturally.\n\n【42】*   The different types of ear drops available include drops containing sodium bicarbonate, almond oil, and olive oil.\n\n【43】*   However, some ear drops may not be suitable for everyone and can irritate the skin.\n\n【44】*   Ear Drops are contraindicated in a perforated eardrum (a hole or tear in the eardrum).\n\n【45】*   Talk to your pharmacist about the ear drops suitable for you, and do not forget to read the leaflet that comes with them.\n\n【46】When To Consult With A Doctor For Earwax Blockage?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Consult with your doctor for earwax blockage if you have symptoms like:\n\n【48】*   An ear pain.\n\n【49】*   Whitish or greenish discharge.\n\n【50】*   Black-colored earwax.\n\n【51】*   Blood in earwax.\n\n【52】*   A feeling of blockage or fullness in your ears.\n\n【53】*   Itching in your ear.\n\n【54】*   Pain when touching your ear.\n\n【55】*   Difficulty hearing.\n\n【56】*   Ringing in your ear (tinnitus).\n\n【57】*   Dizziness.\n\n【58】*   Unexplained cough.\n\n【59】**Treatment for Earwax Impaction:**\n\n【60】1.  **Wax Softening Agents:** Several wax-softening agents like mineral oil, baby oil, hydrogen peroxide solution and wax drops containing paradichlorobenzene, benzocaine, and turpentine oil are available, which soften the wax.\n\n【61】2.  **Instrumentation:** Your healthcare professional can clean the blocked ears using special and sterilized instruments. Do not try cleaning by yourselves as it can cause an injury to your eardrums.\n\n【62】3.  **Syringing:** In this procedure, the health care provider will flush your ear canal with warm saline or water. This is a quick and painless procedure where an electric pump pushes water or warm saline into the ear and wash the earwax out.\n\n【63】4.  **Microsuction:** A quick and painless procedure where a small device is used to suck the earwax out of the ear\n\n【64】5.  An aural toilet is a thin instrument with a small hoop inserted from one end to clean the ear and scrape out the earwax.\n\n【65】**Earcare Tips:**\n\n【66】1.  Do not put earbuds or bobby pins into your ears. This will push the earwax deeper and can even traumatize your eardrum.\n\n【67】2.  Do not pour hot oil into the ear canal as it can damage your eardrum.\n\n【68】3.  Do not use cold water to clean your ears, as it can cause vertigo.\n\n【69】4.  Using earphones for prolonged periods can push the wax deeper into the ear canal, making it difficult to remove.\n\n【70】How To Prevent Earwax?\n----------------------\n\n【71】You can prevent earwax blockage by avoiding cotton-tipped swabs (like Q-tips) and other objects that push the wax further into the ear canal.\n\n【72】What Are The Complication Of Earwax?\n------------------------------------\n\n【73】Problems can happen if earwax is not removed carefully and correctly. These include:\n\n【74】*   Perforated eardrum.\n\n【75】*   Middle-ear infection.\n\n【76】*   Outer ear infection (swimmer's ear).\n\n【77】*   Permanent hearing loss from acoustic trauma.\n\n【78】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【79】* * *\n\n【80】#### **1.**删除换行**What to Know About Earwax?**\n\n【81】Earwax gets blocked when it builds up in the ear and becomes too hard to get washed normally. Earwax is a natural or helpful part of body defense. It coats, protects, and cleans the ear canal by trapping dirt and slowing the action of bacteria growth.\n\n【82】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is the Main Cause of Ear Wax Development?**\n\n【83】   \nThe earwax in the ear is made from the skin glands of the outer ear canal. The tiny hair and wax in the passages trap material and dust that damages the inner parts of the ear, like the eardrum. In some people, a small amount of earwax makes a smooth opening to the way.\n\n【84】#### **3.**删除换行**Should the Wax in the Ear Be Cleaned?**\n\n【85】Cleaning the ear wax is unnecessary as it is self cleansable. No such maintenance is required. Doctors suggest that anything should not be inserted into the ears as it can push the earwax inside.\n\n【86】#### **4.**删除换行**How to Clean Wax From the Ears?**\n\n【87】The ear wax can be softened by using warm mineral oil. It can also be mixed with hydrogen peroxide in an equal amount at room temperature. Two drops of this fluid are warmed to the body temperature and applied in the ear twice a day for at least five days.\n\n【88】#### **5.**删除换行**What Colour of Ear Wax Should Be?**\n\n【89】Earwax is usually amber-orange to light brown, sticky, and wet. In some people, it is lighter in color and closer to yellow or off-white. The earwax darkens with age. Adults tend to have harder and darker ear wax.\n\n【90】#### **6.**删除换行**How Often Should Ears Be Cleaned?**\n\n【91】The ear should be cleaned after every two to four weeks. The safest way to remove the ear wax is to visit the doctor for earwax removal. The doctor uses special instruments like forceps, cerumen spoons, or suction devices to clear or empty the blockage. Some clinics also offer professional irrigation for ear wax removal.\n\n【92】#### **7.**删除换行**What Helps in Dissolving Earwax Fast?**\n\n【93】The earwax can be loosened or softened with warm mineral oil. Hydrogen peroxide can also be used and mixed in equal amounts. Two drops of fluid are warmed to body temperature two times a day for up to five days.\n\n【94】#### **8.**删除换行**What Happens if a Person Does not Clean Their Ear for Years?**\n\n【95】Excessive earwax can build up and harden, which leads to blockage in the ear and causes improper hearing. If impacted ear wax is left untreated in the canal for a longer period of time can lead to permanent hearing loss. However, ear wax is self-cleansing.\n\n【96】#### **9.**删除换行**Why Does Ear Cleaning Feels So Good?**\n\n【97】Ears are filled with nerve endings, and stimulation via cotton buds can trigger some kind of visceral pleasure. It feels hygienic to a person. Some people feel pleasure when the earbud tickles around the ear.\n\n【98】#### **10.**删除换行**How to Clean Earbuds in Shower?**\n\n【99】The ears can be cleaned in the shower using soap and warm water. After the hair washing, the outer ear can be wiped using a washcloth. The ear should also be cleaned from behind.\n\n【100】#### **11.**删除换行**Is It Bad to Wash Ears in Shower?**\n\n【101】When the water gets trapped inside the ear canal, the person is at higher risk of developing an ear infection. This infection is also known as the swimmer’s ear or otitis externa. Warm water can be used to wash ears while taking a shower.\n\n【102】#### **12.**删除换行**Can Earwax Lead To Memory Loss?**\n\n【103】Earwax cannot lead to memory loss. It can sometimes cause excessive ear wax accumulation, leading to improper hearing loss. Itching, dizziness, and ringing in the ear can occur in the ear, which is common.\n\n【104】#### **13.**删除换行**Is It Okay to Spray Water On Ears?**\n\n【105】If the ears are sprayed with water, the person may experience nausea and dizziness. If any side effects occur, the irrigation should be stopped. Possible severe side effects are perforation, middle ear damage, and otitis externa (refers to infection of the outer ear canal caused by bacteria).\n\n【106】#### **14.**删除换行**Does A Person Gets More Ear Wax as He Ages?**\n\n【107】As the person ages, the gland inside the ear leads to earwax formation called cerumen. It becomes harder and drier. It appears to be darker in color with age.\n\n【108】#### **15.**删除换行**What Problems Are Caused by Ear Wax?**\n\n【109】Earwax has both antibacterial and lubricating properties. Untreated wax buildup can cause hearing loss, pain in the ear, dizziness, ringing in the ear, and other problems.

This virus is a deadly one shattering the lives of many. Though no permanent cure for COVID is available right now, COVID vaccines are the biggest relief to break the chain and eradicate the virus from the planet. It is our responsibility to stay careful during this pandemic situation. If you are an older adult or suffering from any other illness, you should be more careful than others. Since COVID-19 produces some respiratory symptoms, it is suspected to be associated with other respiratory illnesses such as tuberculosis. The most challenging part is the diagnosis, as they share similar symptoms.\n\n【2】What Is Tuberculosis?\n---------------------\n\n【3】Tuberculosis is a bacterial disease. It is known to affect the respiratory system. The transmission of this disease occurs through the exposure of respiratory droplets expelled by the patient during coughing, sneezing, and sharing of food plates and glasses with others. Kissing can also lead to the transmission of tuberculosis from an infected person to another person due to the exchange of saliva. In most cases, the patients do not experience any symptoms. When the symptoms begin to appear, they might present with the symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, fever, and extreme cold. Patients who are having multiple symptoms might require an antibiotic treatment that prolongs for a long duration. There are four stages of tuberculosis, and the time taken for all four stages to occur would be only one month. Only patients who have an active infection are considered to be contagious. Not all patients with tuberculosis can spread the infection to others. However, considering the pandemic situation, completely avoiding a person who is having respiratory symptoms is the right choice.\n\n【4】What Are the Risk Factors?\n--------------------------\n\n【5】There is no evidence to show that patients suffering from tuberculosis will have a high mortality rate with COVID-19. But, if the patient is suffering from both tuberculosis and COVID-19, then the patients are known to respond poorly to the treatments. If the patients who are already having tuberculosis stop the medication for its treatment, then the year prognosis rate for COVID-19 will gradually decrease. Risk factors for COVID-19 are obstructive pulmonary lung disease, diabetes, and old age.\n\n【6】What Are the Similarities Between Tuberculosis and COVID-19?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Both tuberculosis and COVID-19 share similar routes of transmission. In tuberculosis, the bacteria that is suspended in the air remains in the form of droplet nuclei for several hours. In COVID-19, transmission occurs mainly through the respiratory droplets expelled by the affected patient.\n\n【8】What Is the Influence of COVID-19 on Tuberculosis?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】According to the reports of the World Health Organization, the mortality rates in tuberculosis patients are expected to increase by 13%. In the studies that were carried out in 2020, study results show that approximately 1.4 million people died from tuberculosis. Since the value is relatively high, additional care and concern should be provided by the medical team to the tuberculosis patients.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【12】Dexamethasone - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Drug Warnings, and Precautions\n\n【13】Dr.Harsha D S\n\n【14】Dr.Kaushal Bhavsar\n\n【15】What Are the Prevention Measures?\n---------------------------------\n\n【16】A proper healthcare implementation measure should be followed in all the countries in order to restrict the transmission of tuberculosis and COVID-19. It should happen both in social settings and hospitals. The protection measures should involve personal protection, environmental protection, and also efforts at the administrative levels such as public laws to minimize the virus’ spread. Hospital management experts should formulate better plans to prevent the spread of infections. The general things to be followed are:\n\n【17】*   Use ideal hand-washing techniques. It is good to wash your hands with soap and water.\n\n【18】*   Maintain a particular distance from others. Social functions and gatherings should be completely avoided.\n\n【19】*   If kids are present in the house, teach them proper hygiene measures. Tell them to stay away from the infected people and the elderly.\n\n【20】*   Wear mouth masks and gloves for safety measures. It is necessary to change these masks and gloves after usage.\n\n【21】*   Proper isolation techniques should be followed according to the government norms.\n\n【22】*   Social distancing is a universal healthy measure.\n\n【23】*   If a hand-washing protocol is difficult to be followed in the hospital setup, then hand sanitizers can be used as an alternative method.\n\n【24】*   Hospital is the place with the highest risk of infection. If there is any necessity to visit a doctor regarding tuberculosis or any other conditions, you can try virtual consultations on any online platform like icliniq.\n\n【25】*   Do not forget to get your vaccination doses for COVID. Get vaccinated completely for COVID with the available COVID vaccine at your place immediately.\n\n【26】What Are the Diagnostic Methods?\n--------------------------------\n\n【27】The diagnostic methods for COVID-19 are different from those diagnostic methods that are followed for tuberculosis. But, if any respiratory symptoms are noticed in the patient, then he must be tested for both COVID-19 and tuberculosis. To identify tuberculosis, a chest X-ray and sputum examination are carried out. If the test results for the chest X-ray are positive, then the sputum culture is performed. The diagnostic tests for COVID-19 include nucleic acid amplification tests (such as the polymerase chain reaction and rapid antigen-based tests). It is necessary for a few patients to get tested for both tuberculosis and COVID-19. The indications for both the diagnostic tests are:\n\n【28】*   Presence of clinical features of both conditions.\n\n【29】*   Exposure to both tuberculosis and COVID-19.\n\n【30】*   Presence of risk factors for both conditions.\n\n【31】What Are the Treatment Options for Tuberculosis?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Treatment options would be the same for all tuberculosis patients until and unless they are influenced by a coronavirus. Multifactorial management therapy would be required for patients who are suffering. It is the responsibility of medical care to provide ventilation facilities for tuberculosis and COVID patients.\n\n【33】Vaccination Protocol\n--------------------\n\n【34】The vaccination for tuberculosis, BCG - bacillus Calmette-Guerin, is definitely not going to be the solution for COVID-19. COVID vaccinations such as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Covaxin, Covishield, Sputnik, etc. developed in such a short span, are surely the solution to save humankind from the deadly virus. It is our responsibility to stay safe. Negligence is the main cause of excessive spread rates. Self-isolation in tuberculosis patients can restrict the spread of infection.

This disease can affect the respiratory system as well as other tissues like the brain, kidney, spine, or stomach. But the most commonly seen type of tuberculosis is the one affecting the lungs. Tuberculosis is commonly known as TB. All people who get infected with TB might not be symptomatic, but if someone has symptoms then they must consult the doctor and get the appropriate treatment. When a person is infected with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and does not have symptoms, they are called inactive tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis infection (also called latent TB). It may be sometimes mistaken that the infection has subsided, but in fact, it is in the dormant state, which means it is inactive or sleeping inside the body. But when someone is infected and has the symptoms, and can spread the disease from one person to another, then they have active tuberculosis or tuberculosis disease (TB disease).\n\n【2】There are three stages of tuberculosis, and they are:\n\n【3】*   Primary infection.\n\n【4】*   Latent tuberculosis infection.\n\n【5】*   Active tuberculosis disease.\n\n【6】What Causes Tuberculosis?\n-------------------------\n\n【7】Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection. They are caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They can spread through the air, and the most commonly affected site is the lungs. But it can also infect other parts of the body. Even though it is an infectious disease, it does not spread easily from one person to another. One must be in contact with an infected person for a long time to get infected with tuberculosis.\n\n【8】What Are the Symptoms of Tuberculosis?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【9】People in the latent phase of tuberculosis will not exhibit any symptoms, but when tested, they will come out positive. The symptoms seen in active tuberculosis patients are as discussed below:\n\n【10】*   Cough that lasts for more than two weeks.\n\n【11】*   Pain in the chest.\n\n【12】*   Cough with expectoration of either blood or sputum.\n\n【13】*   Fatigue or weakness.\n\n【14】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    After tuberculosis treatment, would the TB vaccine be appropriate?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Genitourinary Tuberculosis- Causes, Symptoms, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Tuberculosis and COVID -19</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Fever with chills.\n\n【16】*   Weight loss.\n\n【17】*   Night sweats.\n    </u>\n\n【18】How Is Tuberculosis Diagnosed?\n------------------------------\n\n【19】For diagnosing the tuberculosis, there are some tests that are currently done and they are:\n\n【20】*   **Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)-** In this test, a doctor will inject something called purified protein derivative (PPD) beneath the skin of the forearm. Then two to three days after the injection, one must get back to the healthcare provider who will inspect the site of injection for any changes developed.\n\n【21】*   **Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA)-** This test is done by collecting the blood from the patient and sending them to laboratories for further investigation.\n\n【22】Other tests done to see if the lungs are infected with active tuberculosis include:\n\n【23】*   Sputum and lung fluid examination.\n\n【24】*   Chest X-ray.\n\n【25】*   Computed tomography (CT) scans.\n\n【26】How Is Tuberculosis Treated?\n----------------------------\n\n【27】Tuberculosis infection is treated with the following drugs:\n\n【28】*   Isoniazid.\n\n【29】*   Rifampin.\n\n【30】*   Ethambutol.\n\n【31】*   Pyrazinamide.\n\n【32】*   Rifapentine.\n\n【33】The healthcare provider will prescribe these medicines, which should be taken as prescribed by them. All these medicines need to be taken for treating tuberculosis, or else all the bacteria will not be killed. These medicines can even be prescribed up to a period of nine months. Some of the tuberculosis strains may be resistant to these medications. So the healthcare provider might use a combination of drugs to treat in such cases. It is also important to complete the course duration as prescribed by the doctors to avoid recurrence of the infection.\n\n【34】What Are the Side Effects or Complications of Tuberculosis Treatment?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】Some people have side effects from the drugs used to treat TB that may include:\n\n【36】*   Skin rashes.\n\n【37】*   Nausea.\n\n【38】*   Stomach upset.\n\n【39】*   Itchiness.\n\n【40】*   Yellow skin or eyes (jaundice).\n\n【41】*   Dark urine.\n\n【42】Consult with the doctor when one notices such side effects of the medication, as some of them might mean that there is liver damage.\n\n【43】How to Know if One Should Get Tested for Tuberculosis?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】One can get tested for tuberculosis if:\n\n【45】*   There are chances for developing tuberculosis when a person is working in the field of healthcare facilities where tey come in contact with different patient who may or may not be TB positive.\n\n【46】*   Person working in microbiology laboratories as they are exposed to the samples.\n\n【47】*   A person gets in contact with a person having the tuberculosis.\n\n【48】*   The individual in question possesses diminished immunity due to the presence of underlying health conditions or as a result of undergoing immunosuppressive treatments.\n\n【49】*   When someone has symptoms similar to tuberculosis.\n\n【50】*   When the person is from an area where there is prevalence of diseases, like Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Russia.\n\n【51】*   The doctor recommends undergoing tuberculosis testing.\n\n【52】Others who are at risk for tuberculosis include:\n\n【53】*   Infants and young children with an immature immune system.\n\n【54】*   People with comorbidities like kidney disease, diabetes, or other chronic illness.\n\n【55】*   Someone who had organ transplants.\n\n【56】*   People being treated with chemotherapy for cancer or other types of treatments for immune system disorders.\n\n【57】**How Is Tuberculosis Prevented?**\n\n【58】Tuberculosis is widely spread in the world, and an estimated one quarter of the world’s population is prone to this infection. The immune system plays a major role in the spread of this infection. Also they depend on various other factors. There are treatments and vaccines available, which can be made use of, so that the infection can be prevented to a certain extent in regions where they are most prevalent. This way, both the individual and the community can be protected from getting this infection. WHO has developed certain guidelines to be followed in areas where they are more susceptible to spread faster like the healthcare facilities, congregate settings, and tuberculosis affected households. Tools such as the Prevent TB platform supports the national health systems to strengthen their strategic information. Apart from that, WHO also promotes preventive action by early screening of the condition and treatment for active cases, by considering the comorbidities and providing access to healthcare facilities for all.\n\n【59】Is There a Vaccine to Prevent Tuberculosis?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【60】Some countries use the vaccine called Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) for preventing tuberculosis. These vaccines are given to children in countries where there is high prevalence of tuberculosis to prevent serious forms of TB and other complications from it. But this vaccine may make them eligible for the skin test for tuberculosis when done later in life.\n\n【61】**Conclusion**\n\n【62】Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can spread from person to person. This infection is seen mainly in the developing countries of the world. The infection can affect any tissue of the body but is mainly seen affecting the lungs. A person with tuberculosis may or may not show the symptoms but still be tested positive for tuberculosis, which will depend on the stage of infection they are in. When someone suffers from a prolonged cough, it is better to get tested for tuberculosis after consulting with a doctor.\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>*   for a future without tuberculosis  \n    https://www.tbalert.org/about-tb/what-is-tb/prevention/\n*   TB Prevention  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/basics/tbprevention.htm\n*   Preventing TB  \n    https://www.who.int/activities/preventing-tb</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Every one out of five couples is suffering from infertility. Around 48 million couples globally are suffering from infertility. Sometimes conditions like subfertility are also responsible for pregnancy-related complications. Different treatment modalities like assisted reproductive procedures are used in modern medicine to overcome such pregnancy complications. In-vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most popular method among all fertilization methods. But recently, scientists have pointed out several abnormalities like low birth and low growth patterns among babies born with the help of IVF procedures.\n\n【2】What Is Subfertility?\n---------------------\n\n【3】Subfertility is a condition characterized by being unable to get pregnant even after having unprotected intercourse for more than one year. Subfertility is not similar to infertility. In subfertility, the fertility rate is reduced, but in infertility, fertility is compromised. Subfertility is divided into two types:\n\n【4】1.  **Primary Subfertility:** Primary subfertility is a condition in which the woman cannot conceive for the first time or is seen in men who have never made any woman pregnant.\n\n【5】2.  **Secondary Subfertility:** This is seen in women who were pregnant before but unable to convince in the present situation or men who made women pregnant before could not do so in their present condition.\n\n【6】Most cases of subfertility are related to diseases of the female reproductive system and male genital tract abnormalities. Around 5 percent of these cases can not be treated by any means and are considered cases of infertility. But in certain conditions, the tubal patency and the semen analysis are normal in spite of the presence of fertility-related complications. These conditions are known as unexplained subfertility. Around 30 to 40 percent of cases of subfertility belong to this category.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】Resistant Ovary Syndrome - Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention\n\n【10】How to Prevent Infertility in Males?\n\n【11】Can IVF/ICSI cycle be done with AMH value 1.1 ng/ml?\n\n【12】The risk factors associated with subfertility are:\n\n【13】1.  **External Factors:** Several external factors like smoking, and chronic alcoholism, is associated with subfertility. Also, excessive stress, obesity, excessive exercise, and consumption of fewer calorie is related to subfertility.\n\n【14】2.  **Loss of Egg:** Loss of the egg is one of the biggest problems associated with subfertility. Increased egg and sudden stoppage of the menstrual cycle before the age of 40 is responsible for this.\n\n【15】3.  **Hormonal Factors:** Excessive secretion of androgen (male sex hormone) in the female body is responsible for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Such conditions are associated with female infertility. Also, less secretion of sex hormones like testosterone is responsible for defective sperm formation.\n\n【16】4.  **Infectious Condition:** Infections conditions like gonorrhea and chlamydia is responsible for lesions in the genital tract and adhesions of female reproductive structures. As a result, sperm formation is disrupted, and implantation of the fertilized egg is disrupted.\n\n【17】5.  **Endometritis:** In this condition, ovary-like tissue is present outside the ovary, like the pleura, pericardium, and fallopian tube. This causes hormonal imbalance and excessive secretion of inflammatory mediators. These factors disrupt the implantation process.\n\n【18】6.  **Structural Abnormality:** Structural abnormalities of the male genital tract, like varicoceles, are responsible for defective sperm formation or alteration in semen volume. Female problems like septate uterus, dented uterus, and one-sided uterus are associated with implantation problems.\n\n【19】What Is the Role of IVF?\n------------------------\n\n【20】The treatment for subfertility can be divided into two parts. The cause of subfertility can be treated by lifestyle modifications, surgical interventions, pharmacological interventions, and by hormonal therapy. For fertility, purposes assisted reproductive procedures are followed. These include:\n\n【21】1.  **Intrauterine Insemination (IUI):** in this procedure, the sperm is prepared outside, and the prepared sperm is placed inside the ovary.\n\n【22】2.  **In Vitro Fertilization (IVF):** This is the most popular method. In this method also, the sperm is prepared outside. After that, the egg is taken out of the ovary. The fertilization is done outside the ovary in an artificial medium. The embryo is grown in an artificial medium and transferred to the ovary at a particular time.\n\n【23】3.  **Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection:** In this procedure, a single sperm is injected into the center of the egg through a microscope-like needle.\n\n【24】What Is Low Birth Weight and Its Relation With IVF?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Low birthweight of the infant is associated with babies born with a weight less than 2500 grams. It is independent of gestational age. This condition depends upon factors like socioeconomic and mothers' systemic conditions. Recently its association with IVF has been documented by researchers.\n\n【26】1.  **Maternal Age:** The mother's age is one of the key factors associated with the low birth weight of the child. Women aged 36 years or more are associated with such conditions. Unfavorable conditions for fetal are associated with this. Increased maternal age is associated with poor placental perfusion, and impaired transplacental flux of nutrients may be responsible for such conditions.\n\n【27】2.  **Habits:** Deleterious habits like smoking and alcoholism are associated with subfertility. The continuation of such habits during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight. Specifically, maternal smoking during pregnancy is the most prevalent risk factor. The tobacco toxins cross the placental barrier and reach the fetus's blood. Nicotine, carbon monoxide, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from smoke are responsible for intrauterine growth restriction. Also, damage to the placental cell membranes is caused by these toxins.\n\n【28】3.  **Ovarian Stimulation:** Ovarian stimuli are given in IVF and other addictive reproductive procedures. Different substances like plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and human menopausal gonadotropins have direct toxic effects on embryos. These are also responsible for poor implantation environments and diminished endometrial receptivity. As a result, the risk of low birth weight among newborns increases.\n\n【29】4.  **Effects of Embryo Culture Media:** After fertilization, the human embryo grows in the artificial culture media until transferred to the womb. The culture media contain various substances like protein, fat, amino acids, EDTA, antibodies, and many more. These substances are responsible for the methylation of H19 or insulin-like growth factor - 2 (IGF -2). As these factors are essential for development and growth, disruption in their functioning may cause low birth weight.\n\n【30】5.  **Physical Factors:** Physical factors associated with subfertility can affect the child's growth. PCOS, endometriosis, and poor semen count are the parental factors that are associated with low birth weight. Though the exact mechanism is unknown, it can be assumed that hormones and chemotactic events play a crucial role.\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】Subfertility is a setback in the path of parenthood. This battle can be won with the help of modern medical procedures and processes like IVF. But children born with the help of assisted reproductive procedures are often shown low developmental patterns. Low birth weight is also associated with developmental delays, poor neurological development, poor eyesight, and mental retardation. Proper care before and after the baby's birth and medical supervision is essential to fight these problems.\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>*   Low and very low birth weight in infants conceived with use of assisted reproductive technology  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11882728/\n*   Low birth weight: Is it related to assisted reproductive technology or underlying infertility?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3577935/\n*   Embryo culture media for human IVF: which possibilities exist?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939101/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The lifestyle of people in this competitive world exposes them to many mechanical problems like low back pain and neck pain. There are various reasons for neck pain. Broadly it can be divided into spinal causes and non-spinal causes. This article discusses the spinal causes of neck pain.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Neck Pain?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】Neck pain is thought to result from poor posture, faulty ergonomics, or muscle fatigue. The various spinal causes of neck pain include:\n\n【4】1.  Degenerative disc disease.\n\n【5】2.  Facet arthritis and facet joint syndrome.\n\n【6】3.  Herniated cervical disc.\n\n【7】4.  Spinal fractures.\n\n【8】5.  Spinal deformity.\n\n【9】6.  Spinal stenosis.\n\n【10】7.  Spinal infection.\n\n【11】Some of the spinal causes are discussed below in detail.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-3:<u>How to Manage Neck Pain Through Homeopathy?</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-3:<u>I have lower back pain. What does my MRI indicate?</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-3:<u>What is the issue with my upper back?</u>\n\n【17】How Does Facet Arthritis and Facet Joint Syndrome Cause Neck Pain?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The cervical spine has seven vertebrae. Each vertebra is connected to one another with the joints known as facet joints. There are two facet joints between two vertebrae - right and left.\n\n【19】Facet joint syndrome is an arthritis-like condition that can cause significant neck pain. It is caused by degenerative changes to the joints. The disease process is the same as “knee osteoarthritis.” There is damage to the joint's cartilage, leading to reduced smoothness during movements. As a result, the joint becomes inflamed and irritated, leading to pain. It is seen equally in both men and women and is usually seen between 40 to 70 years of age.\n\n【20】**Symptoms:**\n\n【21】*   Pain is often diffuse and dull at the back of the skull or shoulders.\n\n【22】*   Movements such as bending backward or twisting sideways will increase the pain.\n\n【23】*   Periods of inactivity may worsen the pain.\n\n【24】*   Changing positions may ease the pain.\n\n【25】*   In rare cases, it may mimic disc herniation, and pain may travel down the arm.\n\n【26】**Diagnosis:**\n\n【27】The doctor will take a proper medical history with a detailed examination of the cervical spine. X-ray, CT (computed tomography) scan or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and diagnostic facet joint injection is usually suggested for proper diagnosis and management.\n\n【28】**Treatment:**\n\n【29】Facet joint arthritis cannot be reversed. Exercise, lifestyle changes, and careful management of the neck can contribute to a better quality of life. Self-care using proper posture and keeping the spine in alignment. Patients need to make adjustments in their daily standing, sitting, and sleeping habits.\n\n【30】*   **Physical Therapy** - The physical therapist will guide with neck exercises. Regular compliance will help alleviate neck pain.\n\n【31】*   **Medications** - Facet joint injection: This injection is both diagnostic and therapeutic. This injection is given in the operation theater under C-arm guidance (a kind of X-ray machine). It is given while the patient is awake and under local anesthesia. It is a daycare procedure, and the patient can walk home within a few hours. A mixture of local anesthesia and steroid is given in and around the joint. Pain is assessed before and after the injection. If there is more than 75 percent of relief in pain, then the diagnosis is confirmed. Also, this may be therapeutic with good and prolonged relief to the patient. It needs to be remembered that injection may help reduce pain but does not change the underlying degeneration of the spine.\n\n【32】How Does Degenerative Disc Disease Cause Neck Pain?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】It is also known as cervical spondylosis. It refers to normal age-related changes in the cervical spine. It is mostly seen after the fifth decade of life. Fortunately, only five percent of people are symptomatic.\n\n【34】The disc is a gel-like substance present between two vertebrae. It has a covering around it known as annulus fibrosus. After the third decade of life, the blood supply to the disc starts reducing. Also, there is a decrease in the hydration of the disc. As a result, there is an alteration in the structural and load-bearing properties of the disc. Gradually as age and this process progress, there is a decrease in the height of disc space, which leads to herniation of the disc outside its normal space. Loss of disc height also contributes to the degeneration of facet joints and other structures in the cervical spine, contributing to neck pain.\n\n【35】Degenerative changes can be present at all levels of the cervical spine, but the most common is at the C5-6 level, followed by C6-7 and C4-5. This degeneration may present as simple neck pain or associated occipital headache, posterior neck or shoulder, or radicular pain in the arm.\n\n【36】**The Risk Factors Include:**\n\n【37】*   Genetic predisposition.\n\n【38】*   High-risk occupations, such as heavy manual labor, farming, dentistry, and pilot.\n\n【39】*   Nicotine abuse.\n\n【40】*   A prior neck injury.\n\n【41】*   Long-term participation in contact sports.\n\n【42】*   Prior cervical spine surgery.\n\n【43】*   Other associated diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis.\n\n【44】**Treatment:**\n\n【45】Mostly, the symptoms are transient in nature, and 70 to 80 percent of patients respond to conservative management with pain medications, anti-inflammatory drugs, and physiotherapy. Patients not responding to conservative management may require other invasive forms of treatment.\n\n【46】How Does Herniated Cervical Disc Cause Neck Pain?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】It is commonly known as a “bulging disc” or “ruptured disc.” It is a common cause of neck pain or arm pain. The herniated disc can compress the nerve (arising from the spinal cord), which is known as radiculopathy. It can also compress the spinal cord, which is known as myelopathy.\n\n【48】**Symptoms:**\n\n【49】Symptoms include:\n\n【50】*   Loss of sensation.\n\n【51】*   Weakness in upper or lower limbs.\n\n【52】*   Difficulty in the function of upper and lower limbs.\n\n【53】*   Bladder and bowel incontinence.\n\n【54】**Treatment:**\n\n【55】Most patients respond to conservative management, which includes medications and physiotherapy. In cases of intractable pain not responding to conservative management or if there is a motor weakness, then surgery is essential. Neck pain due to spinal causes can be treated with various surgical options, such as anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (a surgical procedure involving the removal of the damaged disc), laminectomy (a surgical procedure that involves removing a part of the vertebra called the lamina), and cervical disc replacement.\n\n【56】What Lifestyle Changes Can Help Reduce Neck Pain?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【57】There are various lifestyle changes that a person can inculcate in his lifestyle to decrease the chances of developing neck pain.\n\n【58】*   **Maintain Proper Posture** - This is an essential measure in this era. Most people work on computers and have desk jobs. So, posture plays a very important role. Keep the monitor at eye level. Sit with the back supported with a backrest. Do not slouch for a longer time. Change posture every 40 to 45 minutes.\n\n【59】*   **Exercise Daily** - This will help people to keep their back and neck muscles in strength. WHO (World Health Organization) recommends at least 45 minutes of walking at a stretch daily is essential to keep the human body functioning in a good shape.\n\n【60】**Conclusion:**\n\n【61】Neck pain is one of the common types of body pain, but sometimes the cause can be serious conditions that may require surgical treatments. Degenerative disc disease, facet joint syndrome, and herniated cervical disc together constitute most of the causes of neck pain. Other causes are rare. The specific treatments offered vary based on the patient’s anatomy, symptoms, and medical history.\n\n【62】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>*   Neck pain: global epidemiology, trends and risk factors  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8725362/\n*   Cervical Spondylosis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551557/\n*   Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6206372/#:~:text=phenomenon%20(white%20arrow)-,Facet%20joint%20degenerative%20osteoarthritis%20is%20the%20most%20frequent%20form%20of,of%20cartilage%20and%20bony%20overgrowth\n*   Cervical Disc Herniation  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31536225/#:~:text=Cervical%20disc%20herniation%20is%20the,contained%20within%20the%20spinal%20canal</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Oil, also called sebum, prevents skin from drying out, and dead skin cells plug the pores, which leads to the formation of lesions, commonly known as pimples. Commonly, the outbreaks occur on the face, chest, back, and shoulders. It is an inflammatory disorder of the skin that has sebaceous or oil glands that connect to the hair follicle and hair. In healthy skin, the sebaceous glands form sebum that pours on the skin surface through the pore, which opens in the follicle. When the body sheds skin cells, the keratinocytes rise to the top surface of the skin. In the case of acne sebum, the hair and keratinocytes stick together inside the pore, which prevents the keratinocytes from shedding. It prevents the sebum from reaching the surface of the skin. This mixture of cells and oil permits the bacteria on the skin to grow in the plugged follicles and result in swelling, heat, redness, and pain. As the wall of the plugged follicle breaks down, it lets in the bacteria, sebum, and skin cells into nearby skin, causing pimples.\n\n【2】What Is Occupational Acne?\n--------------------------\n\n【3】Occupational and environmental acne is a skin condition associated with industrial exposure. It is probably one of the common causes of work-related skin disease. The different forms of occupational acne are oil acne, coal-tar acne, and chloracne. Oil acne and coal-tar acne are less common but still pose some problems in certain industries. Chloracne is the most significant problem. Various industrial or environmental compounds cause acne, including polyhalogenated hydrocarbons, coal tar and products, petrol, and other physical, chemical, and environmental agents. People working in the field of chemistry, machine, and electrical industry are at high risk of developing it.\n\n【4】The most common type of occupational acne in the clinic is comedones, which appear as papules, pustules, and cystic lesions. Topical or oral retinoic acids and oral antibiotics can be used in treatment. Taking preventive measures, improvement in working conditions, and educating the workers could eliminate occupational acne as a problem. Occupational acne is generally seen in workers exposed to insoluble cutting oils in the machine tool trades or in mechanics exposed to grease and lubricating oils. These workers developed folliculitis, sometimes called oil boils or acne, with multiple comedones and pustules on the arms and other covered areas of the body as a result of prolonged contact with oil. The lesions do not develop from bacteria present in oils.\n\n【5】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【7】Acneiform Eruptions - Causes, Types, and Treatment\n\n【8】Professional Diseases - Types, Symptoms, and Prevention\n\n【9】Skin Diseases and Cosmetology: Causes, Effects, Diagnosis, and Precautions\n\n【10】What Are the Causes of Occupational Acne?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【11】**1\\. Oil Folliculitis -** Occupational acne generally occurs in workers exposed to tool trades, insoluble cutting oils in the machine, or in mechanics exposed to grease, and lubricating oils. These workers developed folliculitis, also called oil boils or acne, with multiple comedones and pustules on arms and other covered areas of the body as a result of prolonged contact with oil.\n\n【12】**2\\. Chloracne -** Chloracne is refractory acne caused by certain halogenated aromatic compounds and can be accompanied by systemic toxicity. This acne represents sensitive indicators of biological response to these chemicals. Chloracne occurs in herbicide production workers and involves almost every follicular orifice on the face and neck with comedones, papules, and cyst-like lesions.\n\n【13】**3\\. Granuloma -** Granulomas present a chronic and focal inflammatory reaction. The granulomas are produced by beryllium and are allergic. Non-allergic granulomas are more common and represent the skin’s response to inoculated or implanted foreign materials like plant spines, wooden splinters, and silica.\n\n【14】How Is Occupational Acne Treated?\n---------------------------------\n\n【15】Treatment and prevention of occupational acne involve avoiding contact with greases and oils and the practice of ordinary hygienic measures. Chloracne is more severe and persistent than oil acne. With the introduction of plastics and the substitution of chlorinated hydrocarbons with synthetic resins, the occurrence of chloracne has decreased. Chloracne appears as multiple, closed comedones and pale yellow cysts. The lesions become more numerous as the severity of the disease increases. Later, inflammatory lesions appear along with larger cysts and abscesses. Scarring similar to chloracne is seen in cystic acne. Other manifestations include peripheral neuritis, hepatotoxicity, possible immune suppression, and carcinogenicity. Treatment of chloracne generally needs the use of oral antibiotics, acne surgery, and dermabrasion. The healthcare providers conclude that the treatment of chloracne is generally unsatisfactory, so prevention of exposure is necessary.\n\n【16】Coal tar workers are advised to avoid hazardous doses of exposure, receive training on how to keep their outwear clean, wear protective work clothes, frequently changing of work outfits, and use cleansers at workplaces; the workplace should be equipped with shower facilities and ventilation systems and undergoing regular health check-ups.\n\n【17】Oil acne can be treated with the favorable effects of systemic Tetracycline (antibiotic) for three months. Isotretinoin can also be prescribed for the treatment of oil acne and has favorable results. Avoiding contact with the causative factor is also one of the prevention methods. Moreover, additional protective measures are required, such as changing clothes and showering on a daily basis. With improved engineering control and more importance on personal hygiene, a decline in the prevalence of oil acne can be seen.\n\n【18】The control includes education and training about the hazards of the chemicals, occupational and personal hygiene, and methods to reduce exposure. Personal hygiene, including proper skin-washing techniques, reduces the risk of occupational acne. Workplaces should provide changing rooms and shower facilities, and workers should be encouraged to wear fresh outfits daily. Education and training are also necessary. Workers should also ensure that products used at work are properly labeled and that they know how to work safely with the products. Personal protective equipment, goggles, facemasks, gloves, aprons, etc. should be worn as required by the task and the products being used. Make sure that they are properly selected, as not all protective clothing provides protection against all chemical compounds. With growing technology online prescription acne services have emerged as a convenient and reliable option for individuals seeking effective treatment.\n\n【19】**Conclusion:**\n\n【20】Occupational acne is a severe health problem. It should be prevented by reducing or eliminating occupational exposure to the causative agents. Workplaces should evaluate the hazards that their workers and should make improvements in working conditions, take preventive measures, and educate the workers. Where possible, workplaces should substitute hazardous acne-causing products with non-hazardous products. The use of well-designed spray equipment may reduce the overspray of harmful chemicals. Installing barriers to prevent contact with the products also reduces exposure.\n\n【21】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【22】无关删除-1:<u>*   Occupational acne  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2956707/\n*   Abstract  \n    https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference\\_id/1479959</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

A particular chemical compound called ketone is produced when the body breaks down fat for energy. It is a severe case of metabolic acidosis, in which the body fluid contains excessive amounts of acid. AKA is more frequent among long-term alcoholics than binge drinkers. Onset usually occurs a few days after a drop in appetite. Symptoms are typically the basis for diagnosis. Blood sugar levels are frequently normal or very slightly elevated. Other high anion gap metabolic acidosis causes, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, which may also manifest similarly.\n\n【2】What Causes Alcoholic Ketoacidosis?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】Alcoholic ketoacidosis is brought on by a complex physiology that develops due to chronic, high alcohol consumption, frequently in conjunction with malnutrition. Chronic alcohol consumption can reduce the amount of glycogen in the liver, and ethanol metabolism further reduces gluconeogenesis. This may result in a decrease in glucose availability, hypoglycemia, and an increased reliance on fatty acid and ketone metabolism. An additional stressor like vomiting event dehydration can increase the levels of counterregulatory hormones like glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone, which may further boost the release of free fatty acids and the synthesis of ketone bodies. The ethanol metabolism can also raise blood levels of lactic acid, which may also cause metabolic acidosis.\n\n【4】What Are the Signs and Symptoms Associated With Alcoholic Ketoacidosis?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Frequently observed symptoms are:\n\n【6】*   Nausea.\n\n【7】*   Vomiting.\n\n【8】*   Abdominal discomfort.\n\n【9】*   Tachypnea.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    My diabetic husband smells of alcohol.

Poor oral administration intake lasts for one to three days during this time. Low glycogen levels and a lack of oral meal intake are the first steps in the pathophysiology of alcoholic ketoacidosis, which causes the metabolism to switch from carbohydrates to fats and lipids. Reduced oral consumption results in lower insulin levels and higher amounts of hormones that regulate metabolism, including cortisol, glucagon, and epinephrine. Hormone-sensitive lipase is able to function more actively due to the absence of insulin. As ethanol is converted into acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, increasing the NADH/NAD+ ratio, these effects are further amplified. Lipid metabolism is subsequently boosted by the increasing NADH/NAD+ ratio.\n\n【15】How Is Alcoholic Acidosis Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------\n\n【16】Symptoms are typically used to make a diagnosis. Laboratory findings also help confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【17】**Laboratory Findings Are:**\n\n【18】**1\\. Complete Blood Count -** In a dehydrated patient, the WBC (white blood cells), hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels may be raised. In patients with chronic alcohol use disorder, a higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is frequently observed.\n\n【19】**2\\. Metabolic Panel -** The fundamental metabolic panel will probably be off. Potassium levels can range from normal to low because dehydration and a reduction in oral intake typically cause the serum potassium level to drop. With the presence of metabolic acidosis, bicarbonate or HCO3 levels would likely fall. If the patient is dehydrated, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) ratio to creatinine may increase. Glucose levels are often raised but seldom exceed 250 milligrams per deciliter. The chances of the first glucose levels falling within the normal range are higher.\n\n【20】**3\\. Betahydoxy Butyrate -** There will be a considerable increase in beta-hydroxybutyrate serum (B-OH). Beta-hydroxybutyrate levels will be elevated to a much greater extent than lactate levels. A different source of acidosis should be considered if the lactate is more than four millimoles per liter. Often, there are no or very low serum alcohol levels.\n\n【21】**4\\. Arterial Blood Gas -** Most likely the blood gas analysis will show a low or normal pH. With a lower hydroxy bicarbonate level, metabolic acidosis will be present. If the patient is capable, the patient will mount a respiratory alkalosis. Given that severe vomiting can result in metabolic alkalosis, the existence of a mixed condition may also be present.\n\n【22】**5\\. Urinalysis -** A urine analysis may reveal an elevated specific gravity due to the patient's typical dehydration. If the patient has consumed enough liquids recently for antidiuretic hormone (ADH) inhibition to still be in effect, and if the patient has been capable of withstanding oral fluids for the past 24 hours without consuming any significant solid food, the specific gravity of the urine may be within the normal range.\n\n【23】**6\\. Nitroprusside Test -** By detecting acetoacetate, the nitroprusside test can be used to prove ketonuria. As the urine nitroprusside test may greatly underestimate the presence of beta-hydroxybutyrate, which is the main ketoacid found in alcoholic ketoacidosis, it is possible that it will test faintly positive despite the presence of severe ketosis.\n\n【24】**Other Tests:**\n\n【25】A dehydrated patient with a persistent alcohol use disorder and alcoholic ketoacidosis may exhibit atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, while the EKG (electrocardiogram) is likely to show sinus tachycardia. Typically, the initial chest X-ray is negative.\n\n【26】What Is the Treatment Plan For Managing Alcoholic Acidosis?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】A clinical diagnosis of alcoholic ketoacidosis should be made. Patients require fluid resuscitation, careful electrolyte monitoring, and treatment to avoid alcohol withdrawal.\n\n【28】*   On the first visit, the patient's blood sugar level should be checked.\n\n【29】*   Administration of isotonic fluid resuscitation is the next critical step in the therapy of alcoholic ketoacidosis. Standard saline with dextrose is the fluid of choice.\n\n【30】*   To break the cycle of ketogenesis and release more insulin, dextrose is necessary. To boost glycogen reserves and lowering levels of hormones that regulate metabolism.\n\n【31】*   Thiamine must be administered before any glucose treatment to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy precipitation.\n\n【32】*   Until potassium levels return to normal, dextrose-containing fluids might be withheld in cases of severe hypokalemia.\n\n【33】*   Hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia are two further disorders of the electrolytes that can coexist with alcohol consumption and inadequate oral nutrition.\n\n【34】*   Magnesium and phosphate levels should be checked and replenished if serum levels are found to be low.\n\n【35】*   Based on the possibility of seizures brought on by approaching alcohol withdrawal, intravenous benzodiazepines may be given.\n\n【36】*   Antiemetics such as Metoclopramide or Ondansetron may also be used to prevent nausea and vomiting.\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】Alcohol use disorder patients frequently experience alcoholic ketoacidosis. Patients who report tachycardia (a fast regular, or irregular heartbeat), tachypnea (unusually rapid breathing), dehydration, agitation, and stomach pain have this clinical diagnosis. The management of patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis is explained, along with the evaluation and therapy of the illness, in this activity. Alcoholic ketoacidosis is brought on by a complicated physiology brought on by extended and severe alcohol consumption, typically in conjunction with inadequate nutrition. The frequency of alcohol abuse in a community and prevalence are correlated. With treatment, outcomes are mostly positive. However, 10 percent of patients may experience cardiac arrest. Although the actual prevalence is unknown, it is suggested that alcoholic ketoacidosis is a substantial cause of death among those with chronic alcoholism. Due to the difficulties in making a diagnosis and the presence of numerous illnesses at presentation, it is difficult to estimate the prevalence and outcomes of the disease.\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>*   Metabolic Acidosis in a Patient With Isopropyl Alcohol Intoxication: A Case Report  \n    https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L15-5053\n*   Alcoholic Ketoacidosis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430922/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The lymph nodes are small glands that filter the lymph and circulate through the lymphatic system. Lymph nodes play a major role in the body's defense. Lymph nodes help the body fight against infection, germs, and other foreign substances. Swollen lymph nodes in the neck are enlarged and are known as lymphadenopathy. Swollen lymph nodes occur due to an infection from bacteria, viruses, malignancy, and autoimmune disorders. Due to an infection, the lymph nodes in the neck are swollen, tender, soft, and painful. The shape of swollen lymph nodes can be pear or bean-shaped. Swollen lymph nodes act as filters and help the body eliminate germs, bacteria, and viruses. Lymph fluid is clear and slightly yellowish, made up of white blood cells, proteins, and fat. Swollen lymph nodes can occur on one or both sides of the neck, and they can also occur in the armpit, axillary area, and groin. Infectious diseases like the common cold, throat, or ear infections cause swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Some swollen lymph nodes in the neck get treated without treatment, whereas some need medical attention.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Swollen Lymph Nodes in the Neck?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The causes of swollen neck lymph nodes include;\n\n【4】*   The most common infectious causes of swollen neck lymph nodes are viral infections, bacterial infections, and immune disorders. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications and illnesses. Viral infections include the common cold, ear infections, influenza, measles, rubella, mumps, an infected tooth, Strep throat (bacterial throat infection), tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsil), sinus infection, and mononucleosis. Some life-threatening infectious diseases cause swollen neck lymph nodes, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, cellulitis (skin infection), infected wound, bacterial infections like syphilis, cat scratch fever, and toxoplasmosis (a parasitic infection).\n\n【5】*   Other Non-infectious Diseases include fatigue syndrome (a disorder that leads to fatigue for at least six months) and lymphatic obstruction (tissue swelling due to fluid accumulation).\n\n【6】*   Autoimmune disorders include juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (joint pain in children), Sjogren syndrome (dry eyes and dry mouth), and systemic lupus erythematosus (when the immune system attacks its tissues).\n\n【7】*   Malignant diseases (cancer) include Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, (blood oral, and larynx cancer).\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    After oral sex, I developed rash and lymph node swelling.

The risk factors are as follows:\n\n【11】*   **Infections:** Swollen lymph nodes in the neck are a sign of an infection in the body, such as flu, cold, and throat infections.\n\n【12】*   **Cancer:** Some types of cancer such as leukemia can cause swollen lymph nodes in the neck.\n\n【13】*   **Autoimmune Disorders:** Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis can cause swollen lymph nodes in the neck.\n\n【14】*   **Stress:** Chronic stress can weaken the immune system and make it more susceptible to infections.\n\n【15】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of the Swollen Lymph Node in the Neck?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】*   The symptoms depend upon the severity of the disease. Symptoms include bleeding gums, pain, swelling, runny nose, fever, sore throat, cough, ache, fatigue, cold, ear and joint pain, rash, loss of appetite, and lymph nodes that are warm, red, and tender.\n\n【17】*   Some serious conditions can lead to life-threatening conditions, including high fever, difficulty swallowing and breathing, vomiting, and blood in sputum.\n\n【18】How Can Swollen Lymph Nodes in the Neck Be Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The following test diagnoses the swollen lymph nodes.\n\n【20】*   **Physical Examination -** The healthcare provider will diagnose the cause of swollen neck lymph nodes through physical examination, symptoms, and by medical history from the patient.\n\n【21】*   **Blood Test -** The doctor can prescribe a blood test to look for bacterial and viral infections like syphilis, HIV, and tuberculosis.\n\n【22】*   The doctor can prescribe Imaging tests like ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging scans to look closely at lymph nodes and the surrounding body structures.\n\n【23】*   **Lymph Node Biopsy -** The doctor will numb the area and make a small cut to remove a section of lymph node tissue to send a sample to the laboratory for examination under a microscope.\n\n【24】*   **Fine Needle Aspiration -** The doctor may perform the test by using a small needle to remove some cells for lymph node diagnosis, infection, and swelling.\n\n【25】How Can Swollen Lymph Nodes in the Neck Be Managed?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Swollen neck lymph nodes usually disappear once the infection clears. Treatment for pain and neck swelling depends upon the specific cause and condition. Healthcare providers may use the following treatment to treat the swollen neck lymph nodes.\n\n【27】*   The doctor prescribes antibiotics if bacterial infections cause swollen neck lymph nodes.\n\n【28】*   The physician can prescribe supportive care such as resting and pain relievers if the cause of swollen neck lymph nodes is viral infections.\n\n【29】*   Cancer treatment like lymphoma may involve chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, bone marrow transplant, and medications like antibiotics.\n\n【30】How Can Swollen Neck Lymph Nodes Be Prevented?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【31】The only way to prevent the swollen lymph nodes in the neck is to eliminate the cause of infection. The preventive measures include.\n\n【32】*   Washing hands regularly with soap and water.\n\n【33】*   Maintenance of dental hygiene to keep the teeth and gums healthy.\n\n【34】*   Stay away from people who are sick.\n\n【35】*   Avoid sharing food, beverages, and towels with anyone with an infection, such as a cold or flu.\n\n【36】*   Avoid touching eyes, nose, face, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\n【37】What Are the Complications of Swollen Lymph Nodes in the Neck?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Untreated and undiagnosed swollen neck lymph nodes can lead to serious complications, including the formation of tooth abscesses, the spread of cancer, infection to blood, scarlet fever (bacterial infection), and rheumatic fever (inflammatory disease).\n\n【39】**Conclusion:**\n\n【40】Swollen neck lymph nodes are usually an infection symptom and tend to resolve independently within several weeks. Healthcare providers like doctors, nurses, physician assistants, and pharmacists can educate people about swollen neck lymph nodes. Most cases of infection are non-specific, and the healthcare provider can advise the patient to monitor and check for abnormal growth in the lymph node sites in the neck. The people must adopt preventive measures. The healthcare team can work together to achieve better outcomes.\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>*   Swollen lymph nodes  \n    https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/symptoms/swollen-lymph-nodes\n*   Swollen lymph nodes and other symptoms of lymphoma  \n    https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/swollen-lymph-nodes-and-other-symptoms-of-lymphoma.h00-159464790.html\n*   Swollen lymph nodes  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003097.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Hence, the knee may be immediately impacted if the feet lose balance. Also, when the knees begin to perform poorly, their effects may rise to the hip, and an unbalanced hip may influence the lower back. Walking properly and picking the right footwear are essential to prevent the foot from impacting other body parts. There is a strong likelihood that all of these problems might be connected if they have flat feet or overpronate along with back, hip, or knee discomfort. So, the best strategy to stop the discomfort and manage the disease is to cure the underlying cause.\n\n【2】What Is the Connection Between the Hip With Knee and Foot?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】*   If the hip joint is not working properly, one could get discomfort in the hip, down the front of the leg, and in the knee. Referred pain, also known as radiated pain, can occasionally be the only indication of a hip issue. However, it is a very regular occurrence.\n\n【4】*   The hip joint has a unique structure unlike any other joint in the body in terms of its depth, the durability of the muscles and ligaments surrounding it, and how it performs while bearing weight.\n\n【5】*   The hip joint may move freely since it is a synovial joint(allows all types of movement).\n\n【6】*   The femoral head (the \"ball\") and the acetabulum (the \"socket\") form this ball-and-socket joint.\n\n【7】*   Although genetic and cultural variations exist in the depth and form of each individual's hip joint, the ball is mostly confined within the cup or socket.\n\n【8】*   The hip will only be able to provide a solid foundation for the spine and the rest of the body to rest on if it is level and stable.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Knee Cartilage Injury - Causes, Diagnosis, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Knee Support for Older People</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Ankle Impingement Syndrome - Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【10】How To Manage Hip Pain?\n-----------------------\n\n【11】*   Pain in the feet, ankles, and knees is very typical. In addition to the soft tissues like the muscles, tendons, and ligaments, joints can cause pain.\n\n【12】*   The discomfort may have started suddenly following a sprain, strain, or overuse injury or gradually crept up on oneself.\n\n【13】*   As we age or as a result of a prior accident, the hip, knee, foot, and ankle joints may develop osteoarthritis, which can occasionally cause pain and stiffness.\n\n【14】*   Back discomfort can occasionally be accompanied by pain in the leg(s) or sensations of tingling and numbness.\n\n【15】*   Hip, knee, or foot/ankle pain often has a straightforward explanation and may be controlled at home using self-management techniques.\n\n【16】*   Osteoarthritis is one of the most chronic disorders; however, even this ailment may be effectively self-managed with the correct exercises and assistance.\n\n【17】*   Here is more information about hip, knee, foot, and ankle issues, suggestions for what to do, and guidance.\n\n【18】**1\\. Ankle Pronation:**\n\n【19】*   Running or walking causes the foot to pronate, a natural and typical foot action. Simply put, it is the ankle and arch rolling or tilting inward as the foot hits the ground after each movement, absorbing some impact.\n\n【20】*   Selecting supportive or motion-control shoes, commonly referred to as overpronation shoes, is one kind of treatment and the use of insoles.\n\n【21】**2\\. Hip Inward Angulation:**\n\n【22】*   The head of the femur slides outward when the knee shifts inward or smacks, making the joint less stable.\n\n【23】*   A short leg, also known as leg length deficit (LLD), develops when the pelvis slips to one side, further disrupting the lower kinetic chain.\n\n【24】How Weak Hips Impact the Knees?\n-------------------------------\n\n【25】*   When the gluteus medius muscle (muscles of the buttocks) weakens, the thigh might turn and pull inwards unnaturally.\n\n【26】*   The phrase \"collapsing kinetic chain\" describes this. In addition, the knee joint and kneecap may experience excessive stress and strain due to the thigh's improper posture (patella).\n\n【27】*   An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a tissue band at the knee joint connecting the thigh bone to the shin bone. Injury to this frequently has an indirect etiology that involves a collapsing kinetic chain.\n\n【28】*   This can occur when the knee buckles when sprinting or jumping (perhaps due to weak glutes), rupturing the ACL.\n\n【29】How to Relieve Hip, Knee, Foot, and Ankle Pain?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【30】An overuse injury, such as a new sprain or strain, may often be treated at home and should start to get better within a few days. Other hips, knee, foot, and ankle issues, including chronic pain, may typically be managed at home utilizing the suggestions and exercises listed below. This guidance is intended to lessen the symptoms and speed up recovery.\n\n【31】1.  Anti-inflammatory pain relievers like paracetamol can help manage the discomfort and continue functioning normally.\n\n【32】2.  Heat packs, a wheat bag, or a hot water bottle can be placed on the sore spot. Always wrap the hot water bottle in a towel to prevent burns. If it is comfortable, one can leave the heat pack on; just remember to check the skin frequently.\n\n【33】3.  Adjust daily activity for a bit. Often, merely limiting or temporarily ceasing the inappropriate activity can significantly reduce the discomfort. This exercise should be reintroduced gradually and increased over time.\n\n【34】4.  The recovery can be aided by exercise. Exercise builds muscles, improves joint nourishment, and produces endorphins, the body's natural painkillers. However, it is crucial to strike the correct balance between exercise and rest; if one does too much, the pain may flare up, the muscles weaken, and the joints tighten.\n\n【35】5.  Weight loss is crucial for those with hip, knee, and foot/ankle issues. Since these joints carry weight, being overweight can aggravate several problems. Calculate the body mass index to determine whether decreasing weight will benefit oneself.\n\n【36】6.  Footwear is crucial for foot and ankle issues since it can also influence knee and hip issues. In addition, age, edema, weight gain, and arthritic changes can affect foot size. Healthy footwear that fits comfortably and provides support helps maintain the feet' health and may assist in lessening discomfort.\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】The hip muscles may need to be strengthened with workouts and treatment if people suffer knee discomfort. Knee discomfort may indicate that people are in danger of suffering a knee or other limb injury in the future. However, they might rapidly and safely return to their normal activity level by strengthening the hips, relieving pressure on the knee, and working closely with the physical therapist. Before beginning any fitness program, be sure it is appropriate for everyone by seeing their doctor or physical therapist.\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>*   Effects of Knee Osteoarthritis on Hip and Ankle Gait Mechanics  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31019809/\n*   Ankle, knee, and hip joint contribution to body support during gait  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27821945/\n*   Hip Pain in Adults  \n    https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2021/0115/p81-s1.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The mechanism of this condition is the building up of surfactants in the lungs. This leads to the blockage of air sacs or alveoli.\n\n【2】What Is a Surfactant?\n---------------------\n\n【3】A surfactant is a naturally occurring substance that decreases the surface tension in the lungs and helps us in breathing.\n\n【4】There are three types of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; they are congenital, acquired, and secondary. This condition can lead to mild to moderate types of breathing issues. If treatment is not done, it can even lead to death.\n\n【5】What Are the Signs and Symptoms?\n--------------------------------\n\n【6】This condition can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. When a patient develops symptoms, the following can be experienced by the patient:\n\n【7】*   Breathing difficulty - It is the most commonly reported symptom.\n\n【8】*   Coughing - This can sometimes be associated with blood or mucus.\n\n【9】*   The face can be discolored and have a bluish color.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Lysinuric Protein Intolerance - A Rare Metabolic Disorder</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Silicosis - Causes, Types, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Lipoid Pneumonia - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Loss of weight\n\n【11】*   Tiredness\n\n【12】*   Fever which can be of low-grade\n    </u>\n\n【13】The above-mentioned symptoms can progress to severe symptoms, which can lead to impairment of the lung and respiratory failure also if left untreated. Hence, it is important to report to a physician when you suspect or experience any symptom in you.\n\n【14】What Are the Causes of Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】As mentioned above, surfactants play a major role. Surfactant is the substance that coats the lungs. Anything in excess can also lead to abnormality. An increase in the levels of surfactants can lead to the development of PAP. An increase in the levels of surfactants can cause blocking of the lungs. Hence, the transportation of oxygen from the lungs to blood is affected. Thus, the symptoms of difficulty in breathing happen, but the exact cause has not been established yet.\n\n【16】Are There Any Risk Factors for Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The prevalence of this disease, according to the PAP foundation, is 0.7 people per million. Hence, it is justified as a rare disease. The majority of cases have been reported to occur in the later stages of life. Most likely, it is known to affect people who are between the age of 30 and 50. Males are known to be more affected than females.\n\n【18】The known risk factors or associations of the disease are as follows:\n\n【19】1.  Any immune response of the body that is known to stop or affect the breakdown of surfactants in the body.\n\n【20】2.  Various types of cancers.\n\n【21】3.  Any lung infection, including pneumonia.\n\n【22】4.  Getting exposed to toxic particles can happen either professionally or in general. Some of the known risky toxic particles include silica or aluminum dust.\n\n【23】How Can Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis Be Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】When you visit your physician, you will be asked questions about your signs and symptoms, your personal and medical history. Following that, if your doctor suspects this infection in you, you will be asked to undergo the following tests for confirmatory diagnosis.\n\n【25】*   Chest X-ray - This is used for checking the presence of any white patches in the lungs.\n\n【26】*   Complete Blood Tests - This will help in checking for the presence of any antibodies in the blood which could be related to PAP.\n\n【27】*   Along With a Chest X-Ray - a CT scan can be done to check for the presence of white spots in the lungs.\n\n【28】*   Pulmonary Function Tests - This will help the physician to understand the functioning of your lungs and their capacity.\n\n【29】*   A Bronchoscopy Can Be Done With a Saline Wash - This will help in obtaining a fluid sample from the patients’ lungs.\n\n【30】*   Finally, a lung biopsy may be performed to check for the disease.\n\n【31】How Can Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis Be Treated?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】The treatment depends on the severity of the condition along with various other factors like patient factors, etc.\n\n【33】In mild cases, it is self-limiting and does not require treatment as such. In the case of certain mild symptoms, it might require oxygen therapy. In case of severe symptoms, washing the surfactant will be done by the physician using a saline solution. It can be done only in a small part of the lung or the entire lung, depending on the affected site. When the whole lung needs to be washed, it is called whole lung lavage. In this procedure, the lung is cleansed one by one. When one lung is completely being filled with saline solution and drained, the other lung is touched as it has to be kept ventilated.\n\n【34】The treatment or saline wash can be enough just once or may require multiple times. It depends from person to person. Apart from this, your doctor may prescribe you a blood-stimulating medication. It is a new treatment modality and has shown good results. If nothing works, your doctor may suggest a lung transplant.\n\n【35】How Does It Feel Living With Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】A patient who has severe PAP requires treatment for sure. About 20% of patients suffering from PAP have a death rate within 5 years of diagnosis. The known causes of death are either respiratory failure or lack of oxygen in the blood.\n\n【37】For the rest of the people, PAP can be managed with treatment. The patient can have a relatively normal life after the diagnosis of PAP and getting treatment. But still, the patient may experience some mild range of difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath. Also, patients may develop permanent scarring in the lungs, and thus, the lung capacity may be reduced. But the occurrence of this condition is rare. All those who get PAP have an increased risk of developing pneumonia, which is a lung infection.\n\n【38】### Conclusion\n\n【39】Pulmonary Alveolar proteinosis is a medical condition that affects the lungs and can be fatal if left untreated. Hence, it is important to consult a physician as early as possible to improve the prognosis. Online medical platforms have made consulting your physician or a specialist easy by connecting you both digitally.

As a result, normal skin texture is lost and shows a shiny appearance. Morphea can affect the skin, subcutaneous fat, deep fascia, underlying muscle, and bone. It is observed that females are affected more than males. Morphea is estimated with a high incidence rate among children.\n\n【2】What Is Morphea?\n----------------\n\n【3】Morphea is a rare fibrous skin disorder affecting females and children. Morphea is characterized by increased collagen deposition leading to inflammation, thickening, and skin hardening. The exact cause of morphea is unknown. However, localized genetic factors and other external triggers could contribute to morphea. Characteristic features of morphea include bruise patches, thick skin, hyperpigmentation, shiny skin, and blood vessels; morphea is subdivided into various subtypes based on its anatomical distribution, morphology, and depth of tissue involvement.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Morphea?\n------------------------------\n\n【5】According to Zulien et al. classification, morphea is classified into the following types:\n\n【6】*   Circumscribed morphea.\n\n【7】*   Linear morphea.\n\n【8】*   Generalized morphea.\n\n【9】*   Pansclerotic morphea.\n\n【10】*   Mixed morphea.\n\n【11】Mentioned below are the types of morphea,\n\n【12】**Circumscribed Morphea**\\- Circumscribed morphea is present in one or more than one sites of the body. Symptoms are asymptomatic, and oval-shaped patches are present.\n\n【13】Variants of circumscribed morphea include,\n\n【14】**Guttate Morphea**\\- Dew drop-like patches, such as atrophoderma of pasini and pierini.\n\n【15】**Linear Morphea**\\- Linear morphea is commonly seen in children. Features are widely seen in limbs, the trunk, and the craniofacial region. Mild forms are usually unilateral; in severe cases, parts are bilateral and spread widely. Linear morphea includes linear atrophoderma of the moulin, craniofacial morphea, en coup de sabre, Parry Romberg, or progressive hemifacial atrophy.\n\n【16】**Generalized Morphea**\\- Features of this type of morphea are present in three or more body sites. Plaques are present in a disseminated pattern.\n\n【17】**Pansclerotic Morphea-** Pansclerotic morphea is usually progressive with circumferential sclerosis. It affects most parts of the body. Pansclerotic morphea is common in children and is associated with eosinophilic fasciitis in adults.\n\n【18】**Mixed Morphea** \\- This is the combination of an individual's linear and limited morphea.\n\n【19】What Are the Clinical Features of Morphea?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Clinical features of morphea are present with inflammation, sclerosis, hyperpigmentation, atrophy, and deep-tissue involvement. In the phase of inflammation, bruise-like patches are present. The skin is thick and shiny. Over some time, usually months or years, hyperpigmentation is seen. Dermal atrophy causes the blood vessels to be visible and profound atrophy affects the muscle, fat, and bone. Deep tissue involvement is observed in the severe form of morphea.\n\n【21】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【22】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【23】Eosinophilic Fasciitis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【24】Hereditary Spherocytosis: Abnormally Morphed RBCs\n\n【25】Erbium Yag Laser Skin Resurfacing - Indication, Contraindications, Advantages, and Complications\n\n【26】Mentioned below are the clinical features of morphea,\n\n【27】*   Pink, bruise patches.\n\n【28】*   Thick and fibrous skin.\n\n【29】*   Shiny skin.\n\n【30】*   The color is ivory white.\n\n【31】*   A purple border surrounds the inflammation.\n\n【32】*   Hyperpigmentation and the visible blood vessels.\n\n【33】*   Deep tissue involvement:\n\n【34】*   In fascia: Puckered skin with orange peel appearance.\n\n【35】*   In bone: Pain, bone tissue loss, and contractures.\n\n【36】What Are the Symptoms of Morphea?\n---------------------------------\n\n【37】Mild forms of morphea are usually asymptomatic. Symptoms arise with deep tissue involvement. In the severe form of morphea, various systemic symptoms are fatigue, lethargy, arthritis, arthralgia, muscle pain, heartburn, eye irritation, blurred vision, episcleritis, and keratitis.\n\n【38】Mentioned below are the signs and symptoms of morphea,\n\n【39】*   Itching.\n\n【40】*   Pain.\n\n【41】*   Permanent hair loss.\n\n【42】*   Tingling, pain, and mild weakness (superficial nerve sclerosis).\n\n【43】*   Joint pain.\n\n【44】*   Contractures (limited joint movement).\n\n【45】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【46】*   Difficulty in chewing.\n\n【47】*   Jaw pain.\n\n【48】*   Headaches, nerve palsy, and seizures in skull and brain involvement.\n\n【49】What Are the Causes of Morphea?\n-------------------------------\n\n【50】The exact cause of morphea is not known. However, it is found that certain genetic factors and autoimmune diseases can cause morphea. Severe forms of morphea are familial cases. Morphea seems to occur after external factors.\n\n【51】The external triggers of morphea are,\n\n【52】*   Repeated friction which also includes minor friction along the waistband and inguinal area.\n\n【53】*   Injection site.\n\n【54】*   Vaccination site.\n\n【55】*   Bite of an insect.\n\n【56】*   Surgery.\n\n【57】*   Radiotherapy.\n\n【58】*   Trauma.\n\n【59】*   Deep wound.\n\n【60】How to Diagnose Morphea?\n------------------------\n\n【61】Morphea is diagnosed with personal history and clinical examination. The extent of the disease is determined by biopsy, blood tests, and imaging. Histopathological findings include atrophy in the epidermis, thick collagen, loss of sweat glands, hair follicles loss, loss of subcutaneous fat, and infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells. A blood test is also done. Magnetic resonance imaging or MRI is done in generalized morphea.\n\n【62】Diagnostic features of morphea include,\n\n【63】*   Proper history.\n\n【64】*   Physical examination.\n\n【65】*   Skin biopsy.\n\n【66】*   Histopathological features:\n\n【67】*   Atrophy in the epidermis.\n\n【68】*   Thyalinised collagen.\n\n【69】*   Loss of sweat glands.\n\n【70】*   Loss of hair follicles and fat.\n\n【71】*   Inflammatory cell infiltration: Lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration.\n\n【72】*   Hematological findings:\n\n【73】*   Increased eosinophil count.\n\n【74】*   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or ESR.\n\n【75】*   High C-reactive protein or CRP.\n\n【76】*   Thyroid function tests are abnormal.\n\n【77】*   Rheumatoid factor.\n\n【78】*   Magnetic resonance imaging or MRI.\n\n【79】What Is the Treatment of Morphea?\n---------------------------------\n\n【80】Treatment is done to reduce the progression of morphea. Various treatment modes are involved: topical therapy, systemic therapy, phototherapy, physiotherapy, and surgery in severe cases of morphea. Treatment photographs can monitor treatment effects, LoSCAT, localized scleroderma cutaneous assessment tool, and infrared thermography.\n\n【81】Various modes of treatment for the treatment of morphea are given below.\n\n【82】**Topical Therapy:** Topical steroids, ointment, or cream for relieving itching sensation, such as tacrolimus and calcipotriol imiquimod cream.\n\n【83】**Phototherapy**: To reduce inflammation. phototherapy includes,\n\n【84】*   Ultraviolet A or UVA.\n\n【85】*   Psoralen and ultraviolet A therapy or PUVA.\n\n【86】*   Narrowband ultraviolet B.\n\n【87】**Systemic Treatment**:\n\n【88】*   Systemic corticosteroids.\n\n【89】*   Methotrexate.\n\n【90】*   Mycophenolate mofetil.\n\n【91】*   Abatacept.\n\n【92】*   Ciclosporin.\n\n【93】**Physiotherapy** to improve joint movements.\n\n【94】**Surgery** to improve atrophy with fat transfer.\n\n【95】**Conclusion**\n\n【96】Morphea, known as localized scleroderma, is a rare skin and subcutaneous disorder. Morphea is most commonly reported in children and women. The benign form of morphea is a self-limiting disorder. However, relapse and extracutaneous complications will increase the risk of morbidity. Long-term treatment is advised to reduce the disease's symptoms and progression. Mycophenolate mofetil and Abatacept give patients promising effects, thereby reducing the risk of morbidity.\n\n【97】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【98】无关删除-1:<u>*   Morphoea  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/morphoea\n*   Risk Factors for Morphoea Disease Severity: A Retrospective Review of 114 Paediatric Patients  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3989454/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These diseases are characterized by the formation of cysts in the renal tissues. Acquired cystic kidney disease develops as a result of end-stage renal disease or kidney failure. It is generally seen in people on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.\n\n【2】The disease is characterized by the development of numerous cystic fluid-filled sacs that do not have a hereditary history. Cysts can be mostly bilateral. When the cyst ruptures, some amount of blood is lost in the urine, causing hematuria. It can affect both children and adults with kidney failure and on dialysis. Kidney failure causes the development of cysts in the kidneys, and the risk of developing cysts increases with the number of years a person is on dialysis. Sometimes the cysts are harmless and require no treatment, whereas in some cases, there may be associated fever and pain.\n\n【3】What Are the Causes of Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】*   The pathology behind cystic development is currently unknown. According to some theories, tubular epithelial hyperplasia from the accumulation of growth factors like the epidermal growth factor can play a role. The acquired cystic kidney disease is characterized by hyperplastic renal cysts. The formation of these cysts is considered to be a source of dialysis-associated renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【5】*   End-stage renal disease resulting in kidney failure, which triggers the development of cysts, can be caused by several triggers, such as diabetes, lupus, heart problems, and urinary tract infections.\n\n【6】*   The chances of acquired cystic kidney disease increase with the length of time the person is on dialysis. However, dialysis does not cause the condition. The disease progression is seen as a consequence of unnaturally increasing the function of the kidneys.\n\n【7】*   Acquired cystic kidney disease can occur in conjunction with any of the following -\n\n【8】1.

But, in some cases, the cysts are associated with pain, fever, and complications that require treatment. The symptoms include -\n\n【14】*   **Hematuria** \\- Loss of blood in the urine due to the rupture of cysts.\n\n【15】*   **Uremia -** Increase the level of urea in the blood due to kidney impairment.\n\n【16】*   **Flank Pain -** Pain in the side of the body is generally associated with the development of cysts.\n\n【17】*   **Fever -** The rupture of the cyst can cause the patient to feel pain and develop a fever.\n\n【18】*   **Reduced Appetite -** Reduced appetite can be due to renal insufficiency.\n\n【19】*   **Anemia -** A decrease in the number of red blood cells can cause anemia.\n\n【20】*   **Weight Loss -** Weight loss occurs due to reduced appetite.\n\n【21】What Are the Complications Associated With Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】1.  **Hemorrhage Into the Cyst -** The cyst develops in the renal cortex and is present bilaterally. When the cyst bursts, it leads to loss of blood which then appears in the urine.\n\n【23】2.  **Development of Renal Carcinoma -** The risk of developing renal carcinoma increases with the length of time a person experiences end-stage renal disease and is on dialysis. The frequency of occurrence is about 7% of the total cases.\n\n【24】How Is Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】*   **Blood Tests -** To assess normal kidney function.\n\n【26】*   **Urine Tests -** To detect the presence of blood or protein in the urine.\n\n【27】*   **Kidney Ultrasound -** Ultrasound is a safe and non-invasive form of imaging that can provide structural images of the organ. Ultrasonic examination of the kidneys reveals the size of the kidneys as normal or smaller in comparison. For the condition to be classified as acquired cystic kidney disease, the least number of kidney cysts should be five. They generally appear 0.5 cm in diameter. On examination of the renal tissues, the cysts are most commonly found in the renal cortex. The renal cortex is the outer section of the kidney consisting of cortical tissues that contain nephrons. Nephrons are the filtering units of the Kidneys.\n\n【28】*   **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan -** A CT scan provides more details than an ultrasound. It helps in differentiating the presence of renal tumors or cysts.\n\n【29】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) -** Like CT scans, MRIs help to identify cysts and tumors.\n\n【30】How Is Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease Treated?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【31】1.  **To Treat Infections -** The development of cysts can cause infection in the body. Antibiotic therapy is prescribed in order to treat the infection.\n\n【32】2.  **To Treat Large Cysts -** Large cysts can be treated without the need for surgery. The physician uses a long needle to reach a certain area and drain the cyst of its liquid. If a kidney cyst ruptures and causes bleeding in the body, surgery needs to be carried out to stop the flow.\n\n【33】3.  **To Treat Cancerous Growth -** Surgery needs to be done in order to remove the cancerous growth developing in the kidneys. Acquired cystic kidney disease has more chances of developing into renal cancer the longer a patient is undergoing dialysis.\n\n【34】4.  **Kidney Transplant -** Renal transplant is the best method to avoid dialysis. The chances of the development of cysts in the kidneys increase with the length of time the patient is on dialysis. In order to avoid dialysis, a kidney transplant needs to be done. The treatment does not involve the removal of the original kidneys but placing the donated kidney in a lower position than normal. However, the cysts that had developed managed to shrink and disappear after a successful transplant procedure.\n\n【35】**Conclusion :**\n\n【36】Acquired cystic kidney disease develops in the later stages of chronic kidney disease and is commonly associated with the initiation of dialysis treatment to filter the blood. Unlike polycystic kidney disease, where the patient feels uncomfortable due to slowly increasing kidneys, an individual with acquired cystic kidney disease is unaware of the cyst developing inside them. A successful kidney transplant procedure performs the functions of a normal kidney. The transplanted kidney is placed in a new position, and the original kidneys remain inside the body. The cyst in the kidneys tends to shrink and disappear after a successful kidney transplant.\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>*   Acquired cystic kidney disease: occurrence, prevalence, and renal cancers  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2374506/\n*   Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease  \n    https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/acquired-cystic-kidney-disease</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Bile is a yellowish-green fluid that gives the gallbladder the same color. The gallbladder (a gland attached to the liver) stores bilirubin. The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile secreted by the liver. It provides a reservoir for bitterness. Bile is carried from the liver by the bile duct. The liver plays a crucial role in the production and metabolism of bilirubin. The liver secretes one to two liters of bile per day. Bilirubin exists in two forms - unconjugated and conjugated forms. Bile lacks enzymes and contains bile acids formed by cholesterol, phospholipids, and bilirubin. This article explains the types, functions, and metabolism of bilirubin, along with the clinical significance of bilirubin levels in our bodies.\n\n【2】What Is Bilirubin?\n------------------\n\n【3】The liver secretes bile. Bile consists of two pigments - bilirubin and biliverdin. Bile also consists of water and solids. Normal bilirubin (total bilirubin) content in the plasma is 0.5 to 1.5 milligrams per deciliter. Bile secretion is a continuous process, and its production decreases under fasting conditions. However, it starts increasing after meals and continues for three hours. The properties of bile are:\n\n【4】*   **Volume** - 800 to 1200 milliliters/day.\n\n【5】*   **Reaction** - Alkaline.\n\n【6】*   **Specific Gravity** - 1.010 to 1.011.\n\n【7】*   **pH (Potential of Hydrogen)** - 8 to 8.6.\n\n【8】*   **Color** - Golden, yellow, or green.\n\n【9】What Are the Types of Bilirubin?\n--------------------------------\n\n【10】The following are the two types of bilirubin:\n\n【11】*   **Unconjugated Bilirubin** - The bilirubin which is not soluble in water and bound to the albumin protein is called unconjugated bilirubin. It does not pass-through urine. Almost all bilirubin in the blood is unconjugated. Around 250 mg to 300 milligrams of unconjugated bilirubin is produced from the catabolism of heme (a component of hemoglobin in the blood) daily.\n\n【12】*   **Conjugated Bilirubin** - The bilirubin soluble in water is called conjugated bilirubin. Colonic bacteria metabolize conjugated bilirubin, and it is excreted in the bile.\n\n【13】What Is the Composition of Bile?\n--------------------------------\n\n【14】Bile contains 97.6 percent water and 2.4 percent solids. Solids include organic and inorganic substances. The composition of bile is explained below:\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【16】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-3:<u>My baby's bilirubin levels are above 21.

Bile helps in the digestion of fats by a process called emulsification. Emulsification is the process by which the bigger fat molecules are broken down into smaller fat molecules. These smaller fat molecules are made from milky fluids called emulsions. The emulsification of fat takes place in the small intestine by the actions of bile salts. More giant fat molecules are insoluble in water. Hence, the gastrointestinal tract cannot digest the fat directly. Bile salts play a vital role in the digestion of fats. The undigested bigger fat molecules usually pass through the intestine, which is then eliminated in feces.\n\n【23】**Absorptive Functions** - Bile helps absorb digested fat from the intestine into the blood. The form of micelles (a complex of fats formed by the combination of bile salts and fats) can be absorbed easily.\n\n【24】**Laxative Functions** - Laxative is an agent that helps in defecation (excretion in the form of feces). Bile salts act as laxatives by stimulating the peristaltic movement of the intestine.\n\n【25】**Antiseptic Action** - Bile inhibits the growth of certain bacteria in the intestine by its natural detergent action.\n\n【26】**Lubrication Function** - Bile (mucin in bile) acts as a lubricant for food in the intestine during digestion.\n\n【27】**Maintenance of the pH in Gastrointestinal Tract** \\- As bile is highly basic, it neutralizes the acid which enters the intestine from the stomach. Bile helps maintain an optimum pH for digestion in the stomach.\n\n【28】**Prevention of Gallstones Formation** - Bile salt is present in bile to prevent the formation of gallstones by keeping the cholesterol and lecithin in solution. In the absence of bile salt, cholesterol precipitates along with less than uniform gallstone.\n\n【29】**Excretory Functions** \\- Bile pigments are the primary excretory product of bile. Some substances excreted in bile are metals (copper and iron), some bacteria (typhoid bacteria), toxins, and cholesterol.\n\n【30】How Is Bilirubin Produced?\n--------------------------\n\n【31】Bilirubin is formed when hemoglobin is broken down from destroyed red blood cells in the reticuloendothelial system. The following are the stages in the formation of bilirubin:\n\n【32】*   Following the degradation of red blood cells. Hemoglobin is liberated.\n\n【33】*   Hemoglobin is divided into two components heme and globin (proteins responsible for binding oxygen).\n\n【34】*   Heme is divided into two components iron and bile pigment (biliverdin).\n\n【35】*   First-formed pigment biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin.\n\n【36】*   Bilirubin is released into the blood.\n\n【37】*   In blood, the bilirubin is circulated (unconjugated bilirubin).\n\n【38】*   The liver cell takes up the unconjugated bilirubin (free bilirubin) within a few hours after entering circulation.\n\n【39】*   The liver attaches to acid to form indirect bilirubin (conjugated bilirubin).\n\n【40】How Is Bilirubin Metabolized?\n-----------------------------\n\n【41】The metabolism of bilirubin takes place in three steps:\n\n【42】**Production of Bilirubin**\n\n【43】*   The process of hemolysis produces bilirubin.\n\n【44】*   Hemolysis is the process of metabolism of red blood cells.\n\n【45】*   The metabolism of hemoglobin produces bilirubin. Hemoglobin is broken down into the components - heme and globin.\n\n【46】*   Globin is further broken down into amino acids and recycled.\n\n【47】*   Heme is broken down into two components, iron, and biliverdin.\n\n【48】**Transportation of Bilirubin**\n\n【49】*   Bile is produced by the liver and stored by the gallbladder.\n\n【50】*   Bile is carried from the liver by the bile duct, called ductus choledochus.\n\n【51】*   It is formed by the union of the cystic duct from the common hepatic duct and the gallbladder.\n\n【52】*   The cystic duct is formed by the union of the right and left hepatic ducts from the corresponding liver lobes.\n\n【53】*   The bile duct passes downward and is joined by the pancreatic duct, creating the short hepatopancreatic chimney.\n\n【54】*   There are muscles that surround the bile duct before joining the pancreatic duct, and they remain closed in the absence of food in the intestine.\n\n【55】*   This forces the ball into the gall bladder via the cystic duct for storage.\n\n【56】**Excretion of Bilirubin**\n\n【57】The stages of excretion of bilirubin are:\n\n【58】*   Bile pigments are the excretory products in the bile.\n\n【59】*   Bilirubin and biliverdin are the two pigments present in bile.\n\n【60】*   Bilirubin contributes majorly to the bile pigment.\n\n【61】*   About 50 percent of the indirect bilirubin (conjugated bilirubin) is converted into urobilinogen in the intestine by intestinal bacteria (colonic bacteria).\n\n【62】*   First, the conjugated bilirubin is de-conjugated into the free or unconjugated bilirubin.\n\n【63】*   Unconjugated bilirubin is reduced into urobilinogen.\n\n【64】*   The remaining 50 percent of the indirect bilirubin is absorbed into the blood from the intestine and enters the liver through the portal vein.\n\n【65】*   From the liver, it is re-excreted in bile.\n\n【66】*   Almost all urobilinogen reaches the liver from the intestine through blood circulation. Later, it is re-excreted through bile. In contrast, urobilinogen is excreted through urine and feces as stercobilinogen.\n\n【67】*   The kidney excretes about five percent of unconjugated bilirubin in the form of urobilinogen.\n\n【68】**Conclusion**\n\n【69】The liver plays a central role in the metabolism of bilirubin. The liver secretes bile. Bile plays a crucial role in the digestion and absorption of fats. Bile salt is present in bile to prevent the formation of gall stones. In addition, bile inhibits the growth of certain bacteria. Jaundice, liver inflammation (hepatitis), liver cirrhosis, and gallstones can be caused due to abnormal levels of bilirubin. Bile is excreted through the kidney in the form of urobilinogen and stercobilinogen.

Depending upon the involvement of skin, burns can be first-degree, second-degree third degree; the first degree of burn is superficial and involves only the outer layer of skin; they can be mild with reddening of the skin; this can be caused due to allergic reaction to some chemical or trauma due to touching heated object, or any friction. The second degree of burn may affect the superficial and middle layer of skin, causing redness, swelling, and formation of blisters; there will be exposure of the intermediate layer due to the burn, it is also called partial thickness burn, and the third-degree burn may involve full-thickness burn, it may affect the subcutaneous tissue and result in necrosis of skin, the skin may appear black and charred.\n\n【4】What Are the Stages of Burn Healing?\n------------------------------------\n\n【5】The stages of burn healing start with primary healing which progresses to form secondary healing that includes closure of the wound, depending upon the severity of the burn the immediate recovery may take time, the superficial burn may heal in 2 to 3 days of time, the second degree may take a little more time but the primary healing is done in 2 to 3 days and secondary recovery in 15-20 days and later formation of scar, for deep burns initial phase starts from day 1 to 3 there is the formation of edema, fluid resuscitation helps in preventing from loss of electrolyte, and promotes wound healing and prevent secondary complication, in the second phase it is crucial to take care of own which will help from dressing drainage of edema and create a moist environment for bone healing application of topical antibiotics and dressing will prevent from external factors, in the third phase temporary wound is covered and if required skin grafts are done for partial thickness and total thickness burn, surgical removing of burned skin followed by grafting help in improving the appearance of burned area, in the fourth phase reconstruction, rehabilitation , recovery helps to perform the daily activities better, that will benefit patient too regain confidence by doing small activities which were not possible post trauma.\n\n【6】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【7】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>Burning pain in my legs worsens on sitting.

The autograft is collected from patients own skin usually taken from the tie for back muscle as they are the thickest and are better accepted crafting is generally done after the healing is completed to avoid the chances of rejection.\n\n【15】In burns associated with the neck region, it becomes challenging for one to swallow food. In addition, exposure to the trachea can lead to inhalation of foreign bodies as tracheostomy is done, and rehabilitation is vital to avoid complications that can cause infection of the lungs.\n\n【16】Splitting helps in multiple functions post-burn treatment as it immobilizes the organ that has been grafted, facilitating correct position and preventing contraction of joint; splinting is usually indicated when the burns involved at tendon or joints,\n\n【17】Exercise helps to maintain the active and passive range of motion during burn rehabilitation; various activities like stretching, manual therapy, physical therapy, therapeutic exercise, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, hydrotherapy, and aerobic and resistance training help in the restoration of function and achieving a normal range of motion for one to do an activity of daily livings and ambulate on their own.\n\n【18】Occupational therapy helps to encourage one to perform their activities without any assistance; this can boost the confidence of one that they have become independent and self-sufficient, and they have recovered from injury mentally and physically as they achieve small goals of daily activities.\n\n【19】The impact of a burn can be traumatizing for one physically and mentally, and it may take years to deal with the effects and recover one can suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety depression as activities of daily living life has changed from routine and are dependent on someone, and the appearance of burn may aggravate the pain psychologically. This impairment can impact one negatively and their ability to cope with this situation; psychiatric treatment helps in rehabilitation postburn to find help to deal with the situation.\n\n【20】**Conclusion**\n\n【21】The primary goal of burn rehabilitation is to make one reach a position before the trauma by restoring the daily activities independently, with a normal range of motion, taking self-care, with good strength in muscles and joints, and having the ability to ambulate on own will.\n\n【22】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【23】无关删除-1:<u>*   Burn Rehabilitation: An Overview  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003999307016073\n*   Burn rehabilitation: an overview  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18036978\n*   Rehabilitation of the burn patient  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3038404</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

An esophagoscope consists of a thin tube with a light and a lens attached to it to view the esophagus. It is a reliable diagnostic and therapeutic tool with many applications.\n\n【2】What Is Esophagoscopy?\n----------------------\n\n【3】The examination of the esophagus using an endoscope is called an esophagoscopy. An esophagoscope consists of a thin tube with a light and a lens attached to it to view the esophagus. The esophagus is a long, muscular tube that helps transport food and liquid from the oral cavity to the stomach. It also contains a tool for removing tissue from the esophagus for a biopsy or other examination.\n\n【4】Is Esophagoscopy the Same as Endoscopy?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【5】Endoscopy is the procedure used to view internal organs and cavities. It might require an incision to insert the endoscope and other tools needed for the procedure.\n\n【6】Esophagoscopy is also a type of endoscopy, but it differs because an esophagoscopy does not require incisions. Instead, in an esophagoscopy, the endoscope is inserted through the mouth into the food pipe (esophagus) to view the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. The procedure can be done with a physical examination and ultrasound imaging.\n\n【7】What Are the Types of Esophagoscopy?\n------------------------------------\n\n【8】The different types of esophagoscopy include:\n\n【9】1.  **Rigid Esophagoscopy** - This procedure involves the insertion of a stiff, rigid tube into the esophagus through the mouth. The tube has an eyepiece, lenses, and light that enable visualization of the esophagus and other internal structures in the upper GI tract. This type is used in minor surgeries and widely for diagnostic purposes.\n\n【10】2.  **Flexible esophagoscopy** - In this type, a thin, flexible tube is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus. Thin electrical cables are in the tube, providing light to see the structures. These cables are connected to the monitor to see the captured images.\n\n【11】3.  **Transnasal esophagoscopy** - This is the least intrusive type and does not require any anesthesia. The endoscope is inserted through the nostril, into the nasal cavity, down back, and into the esophagus, which is mainly used for diagnostic purposes.\n\n【12】**Why Is an Endoscopy Done?**\n-----------------------------\n\n【13】An esophagoscope can be used as part of the physical examination if the patient presents with complaints of nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, feeling a lump in the throat while swallowing, persistent heartburn despite medication and lifestyle modifications, laryngopharyngeal reflux (stomach acid moving through the esophagus into the throat), etc. It diagnoses conditions affecting the throat, esophagus, stomach, and intestine. Doing esophagoscopy alone is usually rare; it is generally done along with a more extensive endoscopy to visualize the esophagus, the stomach, and the upper parts of the intestine. It is used to:\n\n【14】*   Investigate the causes of the abnormal throat, stomach, or intestinal symptoms.\n\n【15】*   Take a biopsy to diagnose conditions like a malignant tumor or other conditions like dysphagia or GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease).\n\n【16】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Plummer-Vinson Syndrome - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I sometimes feel difficulty in swallowing solid food.

It is absolutely contraindicated in the following cases:\n\n【23】*   Hemodynamic instability, a condition in which there is an abnormal instability in blood pressure, which can cause an insufficient blood supply to the organs.\n\n【24】*   Failure to obtain consent for the procedure.\n\n【25】*   High chances of perforation.\n\n【26】Relative contraindications include:\n\n【27】*   Anticoagulation in the appropriate setting (like esophageal dilation).\n\n【28】*   Surgery of the head and neck.\n\n【29】*   The pharyngeal diverticulum, also called Zenker's diverticulum, is a pharyngeal pouch that forms when the throat's lower part meets the esophagus's upper part.\n\n【30】*   Patients with a history of procedural intolerance.\n\n【31】How Is an Endoscopy Done?\n-------------------------\n\n【32】The procedure can last from half an hour to three hours, depending on the type of procedure done. It is usually an outpatient procedure, enabling the patient to be discharged on the same day. The steps include:\n\n【33】1.  Anesthesia is given to reduce discomfort during the procedure. Depending on the procedure, it can be an IV or a topical anesthetic.\n\n【34】2.  The endoscope is inserted gently through the nose or mouth, slowly into the throat.\n\n【35】3.  The doctor observes through the eyepiece or the monitor displaying the captured images. Sometimes, a small amount of air is injected into the esophagus to open it for better visualization.\n\n【36】4.  Tools such as forceps or a hollow suction tube are used to remove the abnormal tissues or mass or to suck out any blockages in the esophagus.\n\n【37】5.  Performs any necessary procedures to treat esophageal conditions.\n\n【38】6.  After the procedure is completed, the endoscope is removed gently. The patient is observed for any post-procedure complications and allowed to recover from the anesthesia.\n\n【39】What Are the Risks Associated With an Esophagoscopy?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】An esophagoscopy is considered relatively safe, with minimal risks. Most complications observed are temporary and heal quickly. Possible risks are:\n\n【41】*   Soreness in the throat, pain, or discomfort in the throat.\n\n【42】*   Hoarseness in voice.\n\n【43】*   Mild difficulty swallowing for a few days.\n\n【44】*   Irritation, injury, and perforation (tearing) of the tissues in the esophagus.\n\n【45】*   Air trapped under the skin (subcutaneous surgical emphysema).\n\n【46】*   Internal bleeding or hemorrhage.\n\n【47】*   Infection.\n\n【48】*   Fever.\n\n【49】*   Allergic reactions to the anesthesia used.\n\n【50】*   Adverse reactions to medications.\n\n【51】*   Aspiration.\n\n【52】*   Oversedation.\n\n【53】*   Airway obstruction.\n\n【54】How Is the Recovery After the Procedure?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【55】The patient would probably be tired after the procedure, especially if anesthesia were given. However, the effects of the anesthesia would fade within a day. The patient would be discharged after a few hours of observation post-procedure. A bystander is advised to accompany the patient, as the patient can be too weak to drive home alone. The discomfort of the procedure would fade gradually. Seek medical intervention in case of:\n\n【56】*   Pain and discomfort worsen over time.\n\n【57】*   Blood is present in vomit or stools.\n\n【58】*   Difficulty breathing.\n\n【59】*   Chest pain.\n\n【60】*   Fever.\n\n【61】**Conclusion:**\n\n【62】Esophagoscopy is a reliable diagnostic and therapeutic tool with many applications. It is one of the safest and most effective diagnostic tools for upper GI tract conditions.\n\n【63】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>*   esophagoscopy  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/esophagoscopy\n*   Transnasal Esophagoscopy (TNE)  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/transnasal-esophagoscopy\n*   Review of rigid esophagoscopy in a Tertiary Hospital in Ghana  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8363956/\n*   Complications of esophagoscopy in an academic training program  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20304267/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Breastfed babies have fewer ear infections and diarrhea than non-breastfed newborns. As a result, they see the physician less frequently for common childhood diseases, have fewer allergies, are less likely to develop obesity and diabetes, have a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and have better IQs than formula-fed babies. The manner or position in which the breastfeeding and latch of the infant onto the breast are crucial to effective breastfeeding. There are various techniques of breastfeeding along with their alternatives.\n\n【2】What Are the Recommendations for Infant Feeding Techniques?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The Infant feeding techniques that are recommended include:\n\n【4】1.  Breastfeeding should begin within half an hour of normal birth and no later than four hours post- cesarean surgery.\n\n【5】2.  Exclusive breastfeeding for up to six months should be done.\n\n【6】3.  The beginning of supplemental feeding at six months should be started.\n\n【7】4.  Breastfeeding should be done for at least the second year after birth.\n\n【8】What Are the Common Techniques for Breastfeeding?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】*   **Cradle Hold Technique:** This position is commonly employed once the baby has been breastfed for a few weeks and is more secure in the nursing grip. The baby is lying across the mother's front at breast level, stomach toward the chest. The baby's head will rest in the crook of the elbow, on the same side from which the mother will nurse. If there is a need to assist the infant latch on properly, use the opposite hand to grasp the breast.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Breast Engorgement - Causes, Signs, Prevention, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Methods to Increase Breast Milk Production</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Frenectomy - Types, Techniques, Complications and Heal</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   **Cross-Cradle Posture:** This position is frequently the most beneficial to mothers immediately following birth and until they gain confidence in properly latching their infant. Many parents find it unpleasant at first, but after they realize how it helps them to use both hands more efficiently, they get more comfortable with it. The mother will support her baby with the arm opposite the side she will be feeding on, while she will support the breast with the hand opposite the side she will be feeding on. This position benefits the mother of a newborn or premature infant.\n\n【11】*   **The Football Pose:** The baby will be lying on the side, beneath the mother's arm, with the mother's hand supporting the back of the baby's neck. The baby's bottom should brush up against whatever is against the mother. Make sure to bend the baby's legs at the hip so that it does not press its feet against whatever the mother is leaning against, as this can affect how he latches. This position is ideal for women who have had a cesarean delivery or have huge breasts.\n\n【12】*   **Side-Lying:** Place the infant on their side with a cushion behind their back for support. The mother should also lie on the side with the baby facing her. For support, place a cushion behind the mother's back or between her legs. The nose of the infant should be parallel to the mother's breast.\n\n【13】*   **Semi-Reclining:** The mother leans back, and the infant is usually prone, lying against her chest. There are alternative postures that can accommodate both the mother and child.\n    </u>\n\n【14】What Are the Signs of a Good Latch?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【15】Signs of a good latch in an infant include:\n\n【16】1.  When the lower lip is pushed down, the tongue is visible.\n\n【17】2.  Instead of a quick chin movement, there is a circular movement of the jaw.\n\n【18】3.  The cheeks are rounded.\n\n【19】4.  There are no clicking or slapping noises.\n\n【20】5.  Swallowing can be heard.\n\n【21】6.  Chin is resting on the mother's breast.\n\n【22】7.  When the infant is born, the nipple is not flattened or misshaped.\n\n【23】8.  The infant will show indicators of satiety or satisfaction at the end of the meal.\n\n【24】9.  The infant appears calm, has open hands, or falls asleep.\n\n【25】Breastfeeding should never be painful. A good latch will assist in reducing pain. Other issues, including cracked and painful nipples, might arise if the infant does not latch on properly. However, breastfeeding can be a lovely, pain-free bonding experience between the mother and the child once the infant has a healthy latch. Lactation consultants are available at many hospitals if there is a need for further support.\n\n【26】What Is the Normal Progression of Breastfeeding?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】During the initial several hours and days after giving birth, the mother and child learn to nurse together. A newborn infant should not be separated from its mother unless the separation is for medical grounds, and the newborn should be in skin-to-skin contact with the mother until the first month of life. The normal progression of breastfeeding goes through two early stages:\n\n【28】*   **The Initial Stage:** During the initial stage, the infant latches to the breast during self-attached nursing. Then, it self-attaches to the breast without help employing the crawling-stepping reaction.\n\n【29】*   **The Second Stage:** The mother and infant are in collaborative nursing during the second stage. They collaborate to obtain the latch and feed if the newborn is placed skin-to-skin without separation until self-attachment is achieved.\n\n【30】What Are the Advantages of Breastfeeding to the Infant?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】*   Breast milk is high in essential fatty acids, lactose, long-chain fatty acids, phospholipids, and polyunsaturated fats (LCP).\n\n【32】*   It also provides amylase, lipoprotein lipase, and lactoperoxidase. These enzymes improve digestion and also serve as prebiotics and protection against germs.\n\n【33】*   LCPs enhance brain development and lessen the possibility of dyslexia and hyperactivity. Biochemically, breast milk outperforms artificial milk. It is mostly whey protein (80 %) and is high in lactoferrin and lactoglobulin.\n\n【34】What Are the Advantages of Breastfeeding to the Mother?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】Breastfeeding is also advantageous to the mother in the following ways:\n\n【36】*   First, it lowers the risk of breast, uterine, and ovarian cancer.\n\n【37】*   Second, it aids in child spacing and postpartum hemorrhage reduction.\n\n【38】*   Third, it increases postpartum weight reduction and uterine involution.\n\n【39】*   Each year, the chance of breast ptosis and shape alteration grows. Nursing does not show an increase in these symptoms during pregnancy effects. Expectant moms should be comforted that nursing does not appear harmful to their breasts.\n\n【40】*   Any misconception that nursing will impact the mother's breasts must be thoroughly refuted.\n\n【41】**Conclusions**\n\n【42】The manner or position in which the breastfeeding and latch of the infant onto the breast are crucial to effective breastfeeding. There are various techniques of breastfeeding along with their alternatives. The infant must expand his mouth wide enough to accept both the nipple and portion of the areola (the black region surrounding the nipple) into his mouth for proper latch-on. The baby's mouth corners should be at a wide angle, and his top and lower lips should be outside his mouth. Breastfeeding is physiologically, economically, and practically advantageous. The American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) has developed recommendations for practitioners to spend time supporting breastfeeding in their practice adequately. Health professionals are responsible for preparing moms for nursing and promoting and protecting breastfeeding habits in society.\n\n【43】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>*   Breastfeeding  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23904066/\n*   Maternal, Infant Characteristics, Breastfeeding Techniques, and Initiation: Structural Equation Modeling Approaches  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4643938/\n*   The Effects of Different Breastfeeding Training Techniques Given for Primiparous Mothers Before Discharge on the Incidence of Cracked Nipples  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28472588/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This bacteria spreads through contaminated food, intestinal colonization (in infants), wound infection, and rarely through inhalation.\n\n【2】Wound botulism is caused by open wound exposure to bacterial spores (present in the environment) or by injecting drugs, especially Black Tar Heroin. It can also occur through traumatic injury involving contamination of soil. The spores of these bacteria, in the absence of oxygen, germinate and release botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) that can block nerve functions and lead to respiratory and muscular paralysis.\n\n【3】Treatment involves antitoxin therapy, surgical wound debridement, and antibiotics. Although it is a rare infection, death occurs in nearly 7 percent of the infected individuals.\n\n【4】What Causes Wound Botulism?\n---------------------------\n\n【5】*   Although the infection is caused by toxin-producing bacteria, not all individuals who get exposed to the spores of these bacteria get infected. The disease was formerly related to traumatic injury and rarely to surgery, but nowadays affects mainly intravenous drug users (IVDU).\n\n【6】*   There are many opportunities to become contaminated with C. botulinum in the production and distribution process for Black Tar Heroin (BTH). The spores of Clostridium survive substances and temperatures that kill other bacteria.\n\n【7】*   The drug is “cut” with contaminated substances like wood pulp or dirt (both of which contain spores) by the drug dealers to sell more of it at a lesser expense to themselves. Spurs have also been found in drug Paraphernalia.\n\n【8】*   The BTH can be injected subcutaneously (known as skin popping) or intramuscularly, both of which require less accuracy than an IV (intravenous) injection. These methods also make the drug viable for a longer time than compared to venous access.\n\n【9】*   The subcutaneous route creates an ideal breeding ground for the spores to germinate and produce neurotoxins. The sharing of contaminated needles is also common among a selected group of drug users and will contribute to wound botulism.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Bioterrorism - A Great Threat to Our Future</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Fascial Traction Technique in Closure of an Open Abdomen</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Tissue Pathology - An Overview</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   In a few patients, the bacteria will form an abscess at the site of the injection of BTH, it will provide the necessary anaerobic environment for the spores to germinate and the organism to thrive.\n\n【11】*   The neurotoxins spread rapidly and systematically through the lymphatic and vascular systems causing symptoms like weakness, dysphagia, gait disturbance, and dyspnea.\n    </u>\n\n【12】What Are BoNTs?\n---------------\n\n【13】*   The neurotoxins produced by C. botulinum are known as BoNTs (botulinum neurotoxins). There are seven forms of botulinum toxins- Types A - G; of these, only four types (type A, B, E, and F) are known to affect humans, and the other three types (type C, D, and G) affect birds, fish, and other animals.\n\n【14】*   Neurotoxins produced by C. botulinum are some of the most poisonous biological substances known; they interfere with neural transmission by blocking the release of acetylcholine (the principal neurotransmitter), causing muscle paralysis.\n\n【15】*   The affected nerves do not degenerate, but blockage of neurotransmitter release is irreversible. The function can be recovered by the sporting of new nerve terminals and the formation of new synaptic contacts; this usually takes time. The effects caused by type A BoNT are known to last for three months.\n\n【16】What Are the Symptoms of Wound Botulism?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【17】Botulism is an infection that should be diagnosed based on symptoms alone because the symptoms start appearing within 12 hours to 36 hours (within a minimum and maximum range of four hours to eight days) after exposure, but the results typically take around four days (from the point of blood sample acquisition till the results). This delay will be lethal if the treatment is postponed till the completion of investigations. The symptoms that aid in diagnosis and treatment are-\n\n【18】*   Bilateral weakness.\n\n【19】*   Paralysis.\n\n【20】*   Reduced muscle tone without fever.\n\n【21】The above three are the classical medical triad of botulism. Botulism is a neuromuscular infection where the neurotoxin inhibits acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter) release and binds irreversibly to the presynaptic terminal (the distal end of a nerve that is specialized for the release of neurotransmitters). Other neurological symptoms are-\n\n【22】*   Mouth dryness.\n\n【23】*   Blurry vision.\n\n【24】*   Double vision.\n\n【25】*   Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing).\n\n【26】*   Dysarthria (motor speech disorder).\n\n【27】*   Dysphonia (abnormal voice).\n\n【28】*   Flaccid paralysis involving the respiratory muscles leads to neuromuscular respiratory failure.\n\n【29】Patients with botulism do not demonstrate any sensory deficit; their mental status remains clear, provided they are adequately oxygenated.\n\n【30】How Is Wound Botulism Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【31】Toxin assays are a standard part of diagnostic testing for wound botulism; these tests have a sensitivity of 33 to 44 percent and require a lab and adequate testing capabilities. When compared to the neuromuscular transmission studies that offer 100 percent sensitivity, the traditional toxin assays are time-consuming and less accurate.\n\n【32】Nevertheless, neither of the studies is suitable for acute diagnosis due to delays in obtaining results. Efforts to find a rapid diagnostic tool have shown some promise in creating a sensitive and specific test in the form of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- based assays, immunoenzymatic assays, and bead-based suspension arrays.\n\n【33】What Is the Treatment for Wound Botulism?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【34】*   Respiratory impairment and its associated complications caused by wound botulism are life-threatening; affected individuals are hospitalized, immediately given antitoxin, and are supervised closely.\n\n【35】*   A popular antitoxin for botulism is Equine (it is a botulism antitoxin bivalent). It is a refined and concentrated preparation of horse globulins modified by enzymatic digestion and contains phenol 0.4 percent as a preservative.\n\n【36】*   This is used in the treatment of type A and type B botulism. The best results with the antitoxin are seen when given earlier in the disease in very large doses.\n\n【37】*   Another antitoxin of choice is the heptavalent botulinum antitoxin. It is known to prevent all seven botulinum toxin types.\n\n【38】*   The antitoxins will not reverse already established neurological deficits; they will, however, prevent the progression of the disease. Recovery is lengthy and involves the regeneration of new neuromuscular connections.\n\n【39】*   In cases of respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation, and supportive care are given as adjuvant therapy.\n\n【40】*   Antibiotic therapy with Penicillin and Metronidazole can be prescribed to treat secondary infection; antibiotics like Clindamycin and Aminoglycoside should be avoided as these can worsen muscle weakness.\n\n【41】*   Adjuvant therapy also includes surgical debridement of the wound with irrigation to remove the source of the toxin.\n\n【42】**Conclusion:**\n\n【43】Wound botulism is a life-threatening disease with rapid progression. Swift evaluation, clinical diagnosis, and initial treatment play an important role in preventing severe complications, including the death of the patient. Emergency physicians should have a high clinical suspicion and should be able to recognize the early signs and symptoms of the disease.\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>*   Wound Botulism in Injection Drug Users  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2792833/\n*   Botulism  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/botulism/\n*   Botulism  \n    https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/botulism</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The lungs are one of the most important parts of the respiratory system, which takes oxygen inside and removes carbon dioxide. Though several factors or diseases may affect lung function, like genetic diseases, environmental factors, and infections, smoking remains one of the most common and dangerous causes. Over time, smoking decreases lung capacity and makes lungs more susceptible to infections. The structure and function of the lungs are altered, making it more difficult to breathe and increasing the risk of numerous medical conditions. Smoking is considered the undoubtful cause of lung cancer in many patients. As per the survey, smoking causes 80 % of people affected with lung cancer.\n\n【2】What Are the Changes in Smokers Lungs?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【3】The physical appearance of the lungs is changed due to the effects of smoking. The change in the color, size, presence, or absence of inflammation is observed. In addition, muscle loss in the diaphragm is observed. The color of the affected lungs may vary from pink to gray or black. The discoloration is due to black-pigmented tar (particulate matter that is produced when burning tobacco) when puffing a cigarette. The affected lungs become hyperinflated (larger in size). There are patches of inflammation in the affected lungs. Smoking not only causes physical changes but also causes changes in the function of the lung. The duration that is taken to cause changes differs individually.\n\n【4】What Are the Symptoms of Smokers Lungs?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【5】There are several symptoms that interfere with normal breathing. Symptoms include-\n\n【6】*   **Increased Mucus Production:** Smoking stimulates the lungs to produce more mucus secretion. It causes damage to the epithelial cells lining the airways. Hence, due to damage to epithelial cells, the inflammatory cells build up, resulting in goblet cell formation and leading to increased mucus secretion. The quantity and consistency of mucus vary from person to person. But in a smoker's lungs, moderate to large amounts of thick mucus are produced.\n\n【7】*   **Coughing:** One of the commonest symptoms of smokers is frequently coughing and an increased risk of developing a chronic cough. This is because smoking causes damage to the cilia. Cilia are small hair-like projections in the airways that help to clear or filter the dirt or irritants out of the lungs. Due to smoking, the cilia are completely damaged or partially paralyzed and allow irritants to get into the airways. Without cilia, the toxins and chemicals in the cigarette and other infectious organisms can easily reach the lungs and cause smoking-related illnesses. Therefore, the chronic cough caused due to the absence of cilia is called smokers cough.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What can cause sudden forced exhalation?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Does nicotex chewing gum help in quitting smoking?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    My red blood cell level is high.Please advise.</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【9】*   **Clogged Airways:** Inflammation of the airways may result in respiratory illnesses. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) occurs as a result of chronic inflammation of the bronchi.\n\n【10】*   **Emphysema:** Smoking also causes emphysema. During breathing activity, the air sacs called alveoli in the lungs are stretched when the air is inhaled and exhaled. As a result of smoking, these air sacs lose their elasticity and deflate, making it harder for the body to breathe air in and out of the lungs. Therefore, the capacity of the air sacs reduces lung capacity or the amount of air that a person is able to inhale. The reduced oxygen intake puts added strain on the heart resulting in cardiovascular diseases and heart attacks.\n\n【11】*   **Wheezing and Chest Tightness:** In smoking people, the chemicals in cigarettes may irritate and damage the tissues of the lungs, which leads to inflammation. Lung inflammation leads to the narrowing of air passages which causes wheezing and chest tightness.\n\n【12】*   **Shortness of Breath:** All these changes, including destroyed cilia, damage to epithelial cells that line airways, and increased mucus production, makes breathing difficult. Even mild physical exertion may cause breathlessness.\n\n【13】Why Does Smoking Affect the Lungs?\n----------------------------------\n\n【14】There are more than 7,000 chemicals present in cigarette smoke, and these include -\n\n【15】*   Nicotine.\n\n【16】*   Acetaldehyde.\n\n【17】*   Ammonia.\n\n【18】*   Carbon monoxide.\n\n【19】These chemicals are potential carcinogens that can irritate the lungs and may cause cancer in humans. The risk of developing cancer is 25 times greater in men and 25.7 times greater in women. According to survey reports, nine out of ten causes of lung cancer death are due to smoking. In other ways, these chemicals can cause scarring or inflammation and damage to cells and blood vessels.\n\n【20】What Are Smoking-Related Lung Diseases and the Changes Involved in the Lungs?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】There are many chances of lung disease that are caused once a person starts to smoke regularly. Some of the common lung diseases due to smoking are:\n\n【22】*   **Chronic Bronchitis -** The inflammatory immune cells infiltrate the subepithelium, epithelium, and glandular tissue in bronchitis, including the macrophages, neutrophils, CD8 positive (CD8+) and CD4 positive (CD4+) T lymphocytes, and B cells that are part of adaptive inflammatory immune responses. Due to the continuous intake of tobacco, the inflammation consisting of enlargement of mucous glands and remodeling of walls of bronchi results in dysregulation of the tissue healing process. In addition, the elastase from the polymorphonuclear neutrophils stimulates the secretion of mucus by epithelial goblet cells.\n\n【23】*   **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease -** Smoking is also a trigger for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) flare-ups. This is because it damages the air sacs, airways, and the lining of the lungs. In addition, long-term exposure to lung irritants like secondhand smoking also triggers chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n【24】Long-term inflammation causes remodeling of the airway structure and subsequent restriction in respiratory airflow. The airflow restriction is irreversible even after removing the risk factors. Following are the noticeable changes in the affected lungs:\n\n【25】*   Damage to the structure of the air duct wall.\n\n【26】*   Damage to the septum of the alveolar wall.\n\n【27】*   Interstitial fibrosis (lung disease that causes scarring or fibrosis of the lungs).\n\n【28】*   Aggravates the progression of lung lesions.\n\n【29】*   **Smoking Stimulates Reactive Oxygen Species** **(ROS)** **\\-** It leads to an imbalance in oxidation and antioxidant systems, resulting in cell dysfunction and inducing cell apoptosis.\n\n【30】What Are the Benefits of Quitting Smoking?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Quitting smoking minimizes the damage to the lungs and allows the body to heal gradually. The lung and cilia begin to function normally between a month or year after quitting smoking. Other impaired functions like shortness of breath and chronic coughing also get reduced after quitting.\n\n【32】**Conclusion:**\n\n【33】Cigarette smoking is the primary cause of several lung diseases. There are a number of cessation strategies available that vary from using medication to gaining strength from support groups and therapy. Self-awareness, counseling, and behavioral approaches aid in coping with the challenges of smoking cessation. Following lifestyle strategies or modifications like exercise routines and healthy habits like drinking more water and eating nutritious food can help to replace the habit of smoking.\n\n【34】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【35】* * *\n\n【36】#### **1.**删除换行**How Are Smokers' Lungs Described?**\n\n【37】Smokers’ lungs are more inflamed than healthy lungs, and the inflammation causes the airway to narrow and produce a wheezing sound while breathing.

Tures is a non-surgical and non-invasive cosmetic treatment for aesthetic and therapeutic purposes. The device emits wavelengths filtered to a specific wavelength for use; the wavelength is 400-600nm. This treatment can be used on dry, oily, and sensitive skin.\n\n【2】How Does Intense Pulsed Light Therapy Act?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Intense pulse light therapy uses light of varying wavelengths that can be altered with the duration of light while treating; the wavelength should be continuously changed from low to high intensity with the duration of time in order to prevent burning due to overheating. The gap between the two wavelength intensities allows the surrounding tissue to cool down. The high wavelength acts on deeper tissue like cysts and glands, while the low wavelength acts on superficial tissues; intermittent wavelength will allow time for cooling. If the first wavelength used is 250 nm, then the second wavelength used is 25nm, giving duration for deeper tissues to cool. The procedure may require at least five to six sittings depending upon the need; some side effects are seen post-procedure showing redness and blistering for a few hours, so to prevent the after-effects ice pack should be applied for cooling.\n\n【4】The light is effective against the removal of hair by using monochromatic coherent laser light. This penetrates through the skin to the hair follicle, which is usually presented near the higher level of melanin pigment concentration; the light destroys the hair follicle papilla preventing further hair growth; this intense light only acts on the active hair follicle; the light is not effective ob inactive hair follicles. The treatment may require eight to ten sittings of the procedure with a gap of three to four weeks for better and more effective results.\n\n【5】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【7】Stasis Dermatitis - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention\n\n【8】Tanning of Skin - Causes, and Treatment\n\n【9】Laser Treatment for Pimples and Pimple Scars\n\n【10】What Are the Uses of Intense Pulsed Light Therapy?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Intense pulsed light therapy has multiple uses for treating aging skin, hair removal, vascular lesion, and dry eyes, and it is helpful in the treatment of removing acne as the light is absorbed by the sebaceous gland that produces sebum, a natural oil produced by the skin to destroy bacteria and inflammatory cells present in the skin causing lesions.\n\n【12】It helps to remove the pigmentation on the skin like stretch marks, age spots, inflammatory hyperpigmentation due to burn or post-inflammation marks, freckles, blemishes, scar marks, acne spots, and melasma by decreasing the production of melanin pigment that is responsible for pigmentation of the skin.\n\n【13】It is also helpful in removing hair from hands, legs, underarms, chest, bikini area, and unwanted hair on the face. The light passed on the hair follicle, causing hair loss and preventing further growth of hair. Intense pulse light therapy is also helpful in rejuvenating the color and texture of the skin and removing dead cells present in the skin. It is also helpful in repairing the damage done due to over-exposure to the sun, also called photoaging, by increasing the production of collagen, procollagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid, which are helpful in new growth, repairing, and remodeling of cells that will improve skin texture and skin tone also delay the process of aging.\n\n【14】It can be used in blood vessel lesions that cause discoloration of the skin; the intense light helps by destroying the pigment without harming the superficial layer of the skin. Vascular lesions like a birthmark, spider vein, port-wine stain, or broken vein can be treated.\n\n【15】It is also used in the treatment of dry eyes; the light is passed around the eyes to the meibomian gland, the gland that lubricates the eyes by producing oil and tears. The intense light breaks down the blockage or any build-up of debris on the gland and also reduces inflammation caused due to bacterial growth.\n\n【16】What Is the Disadvantage of Intense Pulsed Light Therapy?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】This light can harm darker skin if not taken care of in adjusting the wavelength of light; the higher wavelength of light can absorb melanin pigment without epidermal cooling, which can cause burning of the skin. One who is planning for the treatment should avoid exposure to the sun, as tanned skin is more prone to burning from this intense artificial light. Tanned skin can absorb more intense pulse light and can cause burning of the skin. If one is undergoing therapy, they should avoid tanning products.\n\n【18】This procedure is contraindicated in pregnant, breastfeeding mothers, people who have skin conditions like psoriasis, eczema, or dermatitis, who have a history of skin cancer, also using tanning products and retinoid products can cause damage to the skin, also not indicated in those who have severe scars, and who are sensitive to light.\n\n【19】After the procedure, it may show some side effects like redness, swelling, bleeding, and blisters; the skin may become scaly and show pigmentation spots, and in some, there may be pain. In addition, the treatment may be expensive, time-consuming, and require multiple sittings; one has to offer patience for the effective result to be visible.\n\n【20】What Precautions Should Be Taken Pre and Post-procedure?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Avoid direct exposure to the sun before and after treatment, as it may cause skin burning. Apply sunscreen with a sun protection factor above 30 when at home to prevent ultraviolet radiation. Avoid makeup for some days as it may irritate the skin. Always moisturize skin with less harsh moisturizer and stay hydrated to maintain the body's cooling.\n\n【22】This procedure does not give permanent results, so avoid overdoing it. It can be harmful; consult with the health care provider and consider any other alternative treatment if it is unsuitable for anyone. There are many alternative treatments like chemical peeling. Laser resurfacing, micro derma roller, microdermabrasion to remove hair, and skin waxing are also good alternatives for removing hair.\n\n【23】**Conclusion**\n\n【24】Intense pulse light therapy is a good option for removing the pigmentation on the skin and removing hair and for repairing skin from sun exposure; it is an effective treatment with multiple benefits and some drawbacks. A certified healthcare provider should always take therapy to prevent mishaps.\n\n【25】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【26】* * *\n\n【27】#### **1.**删除换行**What Does Intense Pulsed Light Therapy Do?**\n\n【28】By producing high-intensity light pulses that are absorbed by melanin or hemoglobin, IPL therapy has been utilized to treat various skin disorders, leading to the slow fading and eventual disappearance of pigmented lesions or blood vessels.\n\n【29】#### **2.**删除换行**Does IPL Have Side Effects?**\n\n【30】IPL therapy, like any cosmetic procedure, carries the risk of transitory side effects, including redness, swelling, itching, and moderate pain.

It is the result of the sudden discontinuation of the drugs the mother abused during her pregnancy. However, the drug supply stops when the baby is born, and the child goes through withdrawal symptoms until the drugs are in the system. The newborns receive addictive drugs and substances through the placenta. Babies feel withdrawal symptoms for a few weeks after birth. There are various treatment plans present for the well-being of the child.\n\n【2】What Is Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【3】The placenta is an organ that provides nutrients and oxygen to a growing child from the mother's body in the uterus.

It is found with bromine, iodine, fluorine, and chlorine, and its most natural form is present as thallic and thallic compounds. Thallium is used in making switches, electronic devices, and in some medical procedures. It was also used in making rat and ant poison sometimes back. However, thallium can cause severe chronic toxicity in the body as it can get readily absorbed through skin and inhalation.\n\n【2】What Are the Uses of Thallium Metal?\n------------------------------------\n\n【3】Uses of thallium metal include:\n\n【4】*   Thallium in detecting gamma radiations.\n\n【5】*   It is used in the manufacturing of optical lasers and other equipment.\n\n【6】*   Thallium is used for glass manufacturing.\n\n【7】*   Thallium poison is still used for killing rats and ants.\n\n【8】*   Mercury lamps and radioisotopes are also made up of thallium.\n\n【9】*   Thallium acts as a catalyst in various organic reactions.\n\n【10】*   It is also used in photoelectric cells in electronic industries.\n\n【11】**How Is Thallium Distributed in the Environment?**\n\n【12】Thallium is present in the environment in various forms, but its concentration is deficient. But due to human activities like industrial processes, smelting or burning of coal, the concentration of thallium in the environment has increased, and the traces can be seen in the following forms:\n\n【13】*   Sediments and soil.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Antidotes and Their Mode of Action</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Arsenic Poisoning - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Prevention, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Trichotillomania - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Food chain and plants.\n\n【15】*   Terrestrial and aquatic animals.\n\n【16】*   Thallium in peasant water resources.\n    </u>\n\n【17】How Can We Get Thallium Exposure?\n---------------------------------\n\n【18】Thallium poisoning can occur through skin absorption or direct inhalation; even a small amount of thallium exposure can cause death. Although a lethal or safe dose for humans is considered to be 50 to 20 mg/kg, prolonged exposure can cause severe chronic poisoning and severe toxic effects. Sources of exposure include:\n\n【19】*   Shellfish and fish that we eat can be contaminated with thallium toxicants.\n\n【20】*   Substance abusers of cocaine or heroin can get thallium poisoning, and people who use some herbal products.\n\n【21】*   Rat poison contains thallium; therefore, accidental or intentional (suicidal) ingestion can cause thallium poisoning.\n\n【22】*   Workers in fuel-smelting plants and people cleaning ducts for maintenance can ingest thallium particles and get exposed.\n\n【23】*   People living near garbage dumps and hazardous waste sites can be exposed to thallium through contaminated air and soil.\n\n【24】*   Cigarette smoking.\n\n【25】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Thallium Poisoning?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】*   During the initial hours of acute thallium exposure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain occur, and stool with blood can sometimes be seen.\n\n【27】*   The person may also have symptoms like hallucinations, anxiety, confusion, psychosis, and delirium.\n\n【28】*   Depression, aggression, changes in personality, and agitated behavior can also be seen.\n\n【29】*   Color vision (Diplopia) defects also occur, and the image is sometimes reduced.\n\n【30】*   Respiratory disorders like pleuritic chest pain and shortening of breath are also seen.\n\n【31】*   Hair loss, disturbed vision, lack of appetite, depression, headache, and tiredness is seen in patients with chronic toxicity.\n\n【32】How Is the Examination for Thallium Poisoning in the Body Done?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】*   **Abdominal Examination -** Initial assessment shows hyperactive bowel, tenderness\n\n【34】*   **Neurological Examination -** The symptoms usually develop within two to four days of exposure. The examination includes assessing the neurological system (visual field defects and cranial nerves). Neuropathy is also observed in the periphery with paraesthesia and tenderness on the foot and legs. In addition, facial nerve palsy, drooping eyelids, loss of eyebrows, keratitis, and loss of eyebrows can be seen.\n\n【35】*   **Dermatological Examination -** These symptoms develop over two to three weeks of thallium exposure causing skin rashes and hair loss due to hair follicle atrophy affecting eyebrows, scalp, and eyelashes. After a few months of thallium poisoning, white lines (Mees’ lines) on the nails can also be seen, which is common in arsenic poisoning. Other symptoms include dark pigmentation on the scalp, stomatitis, redness of the tongue tip, palmar erythema, glossitis, eczematous lesion, and hair discoloration.\n\n【36】What Are the Diagnostic Approaches for Investigating Thallium Toxicity?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】*   **Assay For Urine -** Thallium concentration is a helpful and accurate method to check thallium poisoning in the body. Urine appears green in color.\n\n【38】*   Blood chemistry is also investigated for anemia and renal functioning.\n\n【39】*   Heavy metal ingestion can be seen through abdominal X-rays showing opacity.\n\n【40】*   ECG (electrocardiogram) is also done to check for cardiac arrhythmia.\n\n【41】*   An electrophysiology test can check abnormalities in the nerves of the feet.\n\n【42】What Is the Differential Diagnosis for Thallium Toxicity?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】*   Mercury and arsenic toxicity.\n\n【44】*   Organophosphate poisoning.\n\n【45】*   Thiamine deficiency.\n\n【46】*   Diabetic polyneuritis.\n\n【47】*   Vasculitis.\n\n【48】*   Isoniazid poisoning.\n\n【49】What Are the Ways to Treat Thallium Poisoning?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【50】Several ways can help treat thallium poisoning, including:\n\n【51】*   Initial stabilization is done by accessing the cardiovascular system, airway passage, and breathing.\n\n【52】*   Contaminated clothes are also removed to eliminate the source of exposure.\n\n【53】*   Exposure within 30 minutes can be treated with gastric decontamination with the help of Prussian blue and activated charcoal treatment.\n\n【54】*   Prussian blue treatment must be continued for up to 24 hours until urine thallium concentration returns to average values.\n\n【55】*   Haemodialysis and hemoperfusion can also help treat thallium poisoning, which is helpful in case of delayed diagnosis of the exposure.\n\n【56】*   Skin exposure or contact must be washed immediately with water and soap.\n\n【57】*   Urine and blood test should be done a week thrice to monitor thallium concentration in the body with regular follow-ups.\n\n【58】*   A person showing significant symptoms of thallium poisoning must be admitted to the hospital as soon as possible.\n\n【59】**What Is the Prognosis for Thallium Poisoning?**\n\n【60】*   A person may have impaired visual ability and neurological disorders.\n\n【61】*   Psychosis, depression, and dementia may occur due to severe toxicity.\n\n【62】*   Fetal abnormalities can also occur due to exposure during pregnancy.\n\n【63】*   Long-term peripheral neuropathy and other neurological disorders can be seen if treatment is not provided on time during exposure incidents.\n\n【64】**Conclusion**\n\n【65】Thallium poisoning or exposure is more prevalent in developing countries due to a lack of safe work practices, and people still use rat poisons containing thallium. The primary human life threats are contaminated food, soil, occupational exposures, and a toxic environment. Thallium is a highly poisonous substance that causes degenerative changes in the body and adverse health conditions, but neurological disorders are more severe with thallium poisoning. Therefore, preventive measures must be taken to minimize the effect and everyday exposure to thallium substances.\n\n【66】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【67】* * *\n\n【68】#### **1.**删除换行**Will Thallium Poisoning Be Identified in a Blood Test?**\n\n【69】Since thallium has a biological half-life of approximately two to four days, blood thallium levels indicate recent exposure. A blood level of more than 100 g/L is considered toxic, and a blood level of more than 300 g/L indicates serious ingestion.\n\n【70】#### **2.**删除换行**Which Poison Makes Hair Fall Out?**\n\n【71】Anagen effluvium is the sudden hair loss during the growth phase caused by an injury that slows the hair follicle's mitotic or metabolic activity. Chemotherapy-induced alopecia is essentially the same as this type of hair loss.\n\n【72】#### **3.**删除换行**Where Can People Typically Find Thallium?**\n\n【73】Thallium is tracked down in a few minerals. Pyrites, which are used to make sulfuric acid, are one of these. Pyrites yield some thallium, but most come from copper, zinc, and lead refining as a byproduct. Manganese nodules on the ocean floor also contain thallium.\n\n【74】#### **4.**删除换行**Does Thallium Influence the Kidneys?**\n\n【75】The liver, kidneys, and male reproductive system can all be affected by thallium compounds, as can the respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. Ingestion of thallium in humans has also been linked to temporary hair loss.\n\n【76】#### **5.**删除换行**Is Thallium Able to Cause Hair Loss?**\n\n【77】The well-known, tasteless, colorless, and odorless heavy metal thallium is toxic to animals and humans. Thallium may harm the nervous system and cause hair loss in a short amount of time.\n\n【78】#### **6.**删除换行**What Does Thallium Do to the Cerebrum?**\n\n【79】Brain MRI studies revealed acute-stage brain lesions in a severely intoxicated patient, indicating that thallium intoxication may cause encephalopathy. Neuropsychological tests also showed memory problems.\n\n【80】#### **7.**删除换行**How Long Does Thallium Stay in the Body?**\n\n【81】Thallium is a stable element that does not naturally undergo radioactive decay. It tends to be tracked down in urine for up to two months. Approximately half of the thallium that enters various body parts vanished in three days.\n\n【82】#### **8.**删除换行**What Is the Symbol of Thallium?**\n\n【83】The chemical element thallium has the atomic number 81 and the symbol Tl. The thallium symbol is derived from the Latin word thallium.\n\n【84】#### **9.**删除换行**How Is Thallium Taken Out of the Body?**\n\n【85】Treatment for thallium poisoning is not outlined in detail. The goal of the treatment should be to get rid of the poison quickly. Most thallium leaves the body in the form of urine and, to a lesser extent, feces. Within one hour of exposure, it can be detected in urine. After exposure, it can be detected in urine for up to two months. Increasing amounts are found in feces after 24 hours.\n\n【86】#### **10.**删除换行**What Are the Properties of Thallium?**\n\n【87】Thallium metal is hard, bulky, and rigid. The earth's crust contains it in trace amounts. Thallium, a tasteless and odorless poison that is difficult to detect, has been used by murderers.\n\n【88】#### **11.**删除换行**Does Thallium Increment Pulse Rate?**\n\n【89】Thallium is a dye that lets a gamma camera see how blood moves through the body. Gamma radiation can be detected by a medical imaging device called a gamma camera. It will increase the heart rate.\n\n【90】#### **12.**删除换行**For What Reason Is the Thallium Test Done?**\n\n【91】An imaging test called the thallium stress test tells the doctor how well the blood flows to the heart. It measures the blood flow while resting and after an activity. The thallium stress test is also known as a cardiac SPECT, a treadmill test, a nuclear stress test, or a stress perfusion test.\n\n【92】#### **13.**删除换行**What Is Known as Thallium Stress Test?**\n\n【93】The doctor can learn how well the blood flows to the heart through an imaging test called the thallium stress test. It measures the flow of blood during rest and exercise. A cardiac SPECT, a treadmill test, a nuclear stress test, and a stress perfusion test are all variations of the thallium stress test.\n\n【94】#### **14.**删除换行**What Is Thallium ECG?**\n\n【95】A thallium scan uses a radioactive tracer to measure how much blood reaches the heart's various regions. Nuclear medicine scans are the more widespread types of tests.

{"seq_id": "8fb59523-3c38-4d8f-b20f-fd0a7ea9b202", "title": "Diethylstilbestrol-Related Abnormalities", "text": "【0】Diethylstilbestrol-Related Abnormalities\n**Introduction**\n\n【1】Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a man-made form of the female hormone estrogen. It is the most potent estrogenic compound that is more powerful than natural estrogen. DES is known to be an endocrine-disrupting chemical. It interferes with the endocrine system to cause birth defects, cancer, and other developmental abnormalities.\n\n【2】What Is DES Used For?\n---------------------\n\n【3】Between 1940 and 1971, it was prescribed to pregnant women to prevent premature labor, miscarriage, postpartum breast engorgement, menstrual disorder, and pregnancy-related complications. It is also used in the common food supply with pellets implanted in poultry, beef, and swine to promote their growth. The use of DES declined after 1950 as many studies showed it was ineffective in preventing pregnancy-related complications. Even then it was used to stop lactation, treat menopause symptoms in women, and for emergency contraception.\n\n【4】In 1971, many studies showed the association between prenatal DES exposure and clear cell adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer of the vagina and the cervix)in women. After the prescription of the drug to pregnant women was banned by the government. But till 1978, the drug was prescribed to pregnant women in Europe.\n\n【5】Who May Be Exposed to DES?\n--------------------------\n\n【6】It is believed around 5 to 10 million people have been exposed to DES during pregnancy:\n\n【7】*   **DES mothers -** DES exposure happens in women who took DES while pregnant.\n\n【8】*   **DES daughters -** If a woman's mother took DES during their pregnancy. Then the fetus gets exposed to DES while growing in the uterus.\n\n【9】*   **DES sons -** If a man whose mother took DES during their pregnancy. Then the fetus gets exposed to DES while growing in the uterus.\n\n【10】DES exposure happens to children in the uterus when their mothers take DES. But, the brothers or sisters from pregnancies during which the mother did not take the DES were not exposed.\n\n【11】What Are the Health Issues That Affect the People Exposed to DES in the Uterus?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】People who are exposed to DES in the uterus have many health-related problems that include:\n\n【13】*   **Clear Cell Adenocarcinoma -** Daughters of women who took DES, have more risk of developing clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina or cervix than women who were not exposed to DES in the womb. However, this is a rare type of cancer; approximately 1 in 1,000 DES daughters get this type of cancer.\n\n【14】*   **Breast Cancer -** After age 40, DES daughters may have approximately twice the risk of breast cancer as women who are not exposed to DES of the same age and with breast cancer women who are not exposed to DES of the same age and with.\n\n【15】*   **Pancreatic Cancer -** A recent study found that DES daughters had more risk of pancreatic cancer than women in the general population.\n\n【16】*   **Cervical Precancer -** Researches show that DES daughters were twice more likely to have high-grade changes in the cell of the cervix than females not exposed to DES in the uterus.\n\n【17】*   **Testicle and Prostate Cancer -** Males exposed to DES in the uterus have been at risk of testicles and prostate cancers. There is no evidence for the reason why DES exposure increases the risk of prostate cancer and testicular cancer.\n\n【18】*   **Cardiovascular Diseases -** People exposed to DES have an increased risk of hypertension, coronary artery disease, high cholesterol, and heart attack but not stroke. DES daughters have stronger associations between prenatal DES exposure and heart attack and coronary artery disease than DES sons.\n\n【19】*   **Autoimmune Condition -** People exposed to DES in the uterus may have problems with the immune system. But many researchers show that DES daughters do not have a high risk of autoimmune diseases.\n\n【20】*   **Pancreatic Disorder -** Research found an increased risk of pancreatic disorders and inflammation of the pancreas in both DES sons and DES daughters compared with unexposed females and males.\n\n【21】*   **Depression -** One study found a 40 % higher risk of depression in DES daughters have increased risk of depression than in unexposed women has been found by some studies. But the risk of depression is not seen in DES-exposed men.\n\n【22】*   **Early Menopause -** DES daughters have more risk of early menopause than unexposed women. Around three percent of DES-exposed women have experienced early menopause.\n\n【23】*   **Psychosexual Characteristics -** Prenatal exposure to DES may influence certain sexual and psychological characteristics of adult women and men.\n\n【24】What Health Problems Can Affect Women Who Took DES During Pregnancy?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Women who were exposed to DES while pregnant are DES mothers. DES exposure has a high risk of developing certain diseases, such as breast cancer. DES mother requires special healthcare that should include\n\n【26】*   Monthly breast self-examination.\n\n【27】*   Annual mammography (breast x-ray).\n\n【28】*   Annual gynecological check-up.\n\n【29】What Should Women Who Used DES During Pregnancy Do?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】If a woman has taken DES while pregnant, if possible, she should try to find out the dosage, how it was used, and when it was used. She should also inform her children who were exposed during pregnancy. DES-exposed mothers should follow a regular breast cancer detection check-up, as the doctor recommends If any new breast lumps or breast changes should be immediately informed to a doctor. They should also have regular pelvic examinations and medical check-ups.\n\n【31】What Should a DES Daughter Do?\n------------------------------\n\n【32】Women exposed to DES before birth should be aware of the health effects of DES and inform their health care. These individuals have been advised to have a medical examination annually to check for adverse health effects of DES, which may include clear cell adenocarcinoma and abnormal cervical cells. The medical examination may include a pelvic examination, that checks for any abnormalities in the vulva, vagina, ovaries, uterus, cervix, and rectum. A PAP test will also collect cells from the vagina and the cervix. If any abnormalities are detected then a colposcopy (examination of the cervix with magnification) will be recommended. A routine breast cancer screening is also recommended for women who are over 45 years.\n\n【33】What Should a DES Exposed Son Do?\n---------------------------------\n\n【34】DES should be examined periodically even though the risk of testicular cancer development among DES sons is not clear. Many males have unusually small or undescended testicles, cysts on the testicles, and lowered sperm count. Testicular cancer is often diagnosed in young men, with less than nine percent over age 55. A DES-exposed male should examine their testicles for lumps every month.\n\n【35】**Conclusion -**\n\n【36】Diethylbestrol (DES) is a synthetic hormone that prevents premature labor, abortion, and other pregnancy-related complications during early periods. It is banned later on due to its adverse effects like cancer, heart problems, etc. But women who took DES and their children exposed to DES in the uterus had many health-related issues. So they are recommended to have regular medical check-ups to avoid complications.\n\n【37】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【38】* * *\n\n【39】#### **1.**删除换行**Does Diethylstillbestrol Cause Cancer?**\n\n【40】   \nDiethylstilbestrol (DES) passes through the placenta in pregnant women and affects the fetus. It has been associated with the development of cancer in the lower genital regions of daughters born to women who have been administered DES during pregnancy. \n\n【41】#### **2.**删除换行**How Is the Fetus Affected by Diethylstilbestrol?**\n\n【42】   \nMales exposed to the drug in utero are likelier to have testicular abnormalities such as undescended testicles or epididymal cysts. Additionally, some evidence supports an increase in the chances of testicular inflammation or infection. Female children are reported to have a higher risk for cervical and vaginal cancers. \n\n【43】#### **3.**删除换行**Is Diethylstilbestrol Banned?**\n\n【44】   \nBetween 1940 and 1971, DES was recommended to expectant mothers to help avoid miscarriage, early labor, and related pregnancy problems. However, it was withdrawn in the US in  1971 due to its potential to cause cancer and other complications.\n\n【45】#### **4.**删除换行**Does DES Adversely Affect Granddaughters?**\n\n【46】   \nStudies indicate that the granddaughters of DES-exposed women may be at increased risk for infertility, a consequence known to harm prenatally exposed women.

The method in which it is grown and processed after harvesting makes it different from regular green tea. Matcha originated from China and Japan, where it is believed to be the drink of warriors. It has been regarded as an energy drink, and it has been consumed for centuries. It has traveled to the United States of America and then the rest of the world, being marketed as the next healthiest drink in the world. From simple matcha tea to desserts and smoothies, matcha is added to almost everything to make it healthier. It has created quite a rage among celebrities and social media platforms.\n\n【2】How is Matcha Prepared?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】Matcha tea leaves grow on the shrub Camellia sinensis. Matcha tea plants are grown in the shade and not exposed completely to sunlight. As a result, they produce a higher amount of phytochemicals (compounds present in the plants that impart flavor, aroma, and color to the tea) and amino acids compared to other tea plants grown in the sun. Green tea is produced from fresh leaves that are not dried but steamed to maintain their green color. Drying them will lead to oxidation resulting in the black color of tea leaves. Green tea leaves are steamed for a short period and then dried. They retain some amounts of chlorophyll (green pigment present in plants) and L-theanine (an amino acid present in tea leaves), increasing their nutritional benefits. After steaming and drying, the tea is then processed to make it into a fine powder. Unlike regular green tea, matcha tea is prepared by whisking the matcha tea powder into hot water and creating a foam.\n\n【4】**What Are the Different Ways in Which Matcha Is Consumed?**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Matcha is a powdered form of green tea with high amounts of antioxidants. It may be prepared as a simple tea or added to desserts and herbal medicines. Matcha is used in beverages, smoothies, breakfast bowls, desserts, pancakes, waffles, and dips and infused into pasta sauce. In short, it is used to add flavor to everything.\n\n【6】What Are the Constituents of Matcha Powder?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Matcha green tea has abundant amounts of antioxidants, mainly due to the presence of polyphenols in them. Polyphenols are naturally occurring substances that have properties similar to vitamin C and vitamin E. Green tea also contains considerable amounts of catechins in it. Catechins are highly rich in antioxidants. They act against free radicals in the body and also help in the detoxification process. Matcha green tea also contains caffeine which is proven to have anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n【8】What Are the Potential Health Benefits of Matcha?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The following are the benefits of matcha tea -\n\n【10】*   **Increased Immunity** - Matcha tea is rich in vitamin C. Vitamin C increases immunity and helps build a strong immune defense of the body.\n\n【11】*   **Rich In Antioxidants** - Antioxidants are compounds that reduce the effects of free radicals on cells. They stabilize the harmful effects of free radicals and protect the cells from damage. Long-term exposure to free radicals can lead to chronic systemic diseases and even cancer.\n\n【12】*   **Anti-Inflammatory Properties** - Matcha is proven to reduce inflammation in the body due to its antioxidant effect.\n\n【13】*   **Detoxification of the Body** - Matcha tea is proven to flush out toxins from the body. It also aids the detoxification process of the liver.\n\n【14】*   **Improving Brain Function** - Some studies state that consuming matcha tea regularly increases memory and concentration. It is also said that the ancient Japanese warriors drank matcha tea before the battles to increase alertness and calmness of the mind.\n\n【15】*   **Anti-Cancer Properties** - The presence of catechins in matcha tea make them a potential anti-cancer drink. Catechins are strong antioxidants that can help prevent cancer by reducing the action of free radicals in the body.\n\n【16】*   **Improves Heart Health** \\- Matcha green tea is proven to lower the bad cholesterol levels in the body, known as the LDL cholesterol. This property of matcha green tea can protect against the development of heart diseases.\n\n【17】*   **Aids In Weight Management** - Matcha green tea helps increase the metabolism rate. Thus, it aids in weight loss and maintaining weight loss.\n\n【18】What Is the Best Time to Consume Matcha to Reap Maximum Benefits?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Matcha tea must be consumed early in the morning on an empty stomach to gain its maximum benefits. At most, two to three cups (150ml) of matcha tea are recommended daily.\n\n【20】Is Matcha a Magical Product?\n----------------------------\n\n【21】There is nothing such as a magical product that will help prevent diseases or maintain good health for a long time. Good health and being disease-free combines various factors such as a good nutritious diet devoid of junk and processed food, a regular exercise routine, a good mental state, a stress\\-free life, and healthy habits. When people practice all these habits and supplement their diet with matcha tea, they can reap the benefits of this magical product.\n\n【22】What Are the Possible Side Effects of Matcha?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Matcha green tea has considerable amounts of caffeine. The adverse effects of caffeine are well-known. Excess intake of caffeine results in a lack of concentration, irritability, and physical and mental fatigue. It is like an addictive drug. Caffeine initially gives a feeling of refreshment, but the more it is consumed, the more an individual is dependent on it. Therefore, more and more caffeine is required each time. Too much matcha tea can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.\n\n【24】**Conclusion**:\n\n【25】Matcha is very similar to green tea. It only differs in the processing method, making matcha tea more healthy and nutritious. It is undoubtedly a superfood. It has numerous benefits for the body. It is a healthy drink. When consumed in moderation, one can reap its benefits.\n\n【26】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【27】无关删除-1:<u>*   Health Benefits and Chemical Composition of Matcha Green Tea: A Review  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7796401/\n*   The health benefits of matcha tea  \n    https://www.piedmont.org/living-better/the-health-benefits-of-matcha-tea</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

At the time, it was believed that people with keratoconus, a condition where the cornea, a transparent, dome-shaped front surface of the eyes, gradually thins and bulges outward into a cone shape, were the only ones who experienced this illness.\n\n【3】The presence of posterior synechiae, pigment dispersion, ectropion uvea (when the iris pigmented epithelium migrates to the iris' anterior surface), anterior subcapsular lens opacities, and secondary glaucoma syndrome (through the uveoscleral outflow or the trabecular meshwork, the aqueous humor continuously drains out). Secondary glaucoma is characterized by obstruction in either of these, which can raise eye pressure and harm the optic nerve. These were additional symptoms that were not necessary for the diagnosis.\n\n【4】What Is the Cause Behind Urrets-Zavalia Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The full mechanism of Urrets-Zavalia syndrome is unknown and most likely involves multiple factors. Ischemic damage to the iris and a sharp increase in intraocular pressure are the two most frequently accepted hypotheses. Triggers may include iris anomalies, which may be more prevalent in keratoconus, powerful Mydriatic injections, and putting the iris into touch with the peripheral cornea to cause peripheral anterior synechiae. Increased intraocular pressure during or after surgery, the use of Mydriatic drugs or Atropine, the presence of keratoconus, viscoelastic material remaining in the eye, and an inflammatory reaction in the anterior chamber following surgery are all potential risk factors for Urrets-Zavalia syndrome.\n\n【6】*   **Increase in Intraocular Pressure**: Assumptions are made that increased intraocular pressure blocks the iris arteries. A keratoconus eye's poor stiffness may allow for the sclera's blockage of arteries near the iris's root. It was discovered that a substantial risk factor for the development of Urrets-Zavalia syndrome was an increase in intraocular pressure within 24 hours following penetrating keratoplasty.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Pterygium (Surfer’s Eye) - Causes, Prevention and Treatment Options</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【8】Urrets-Zavalia syndrome is undeniably the result of an abrupt increase in intraocular pressure that causes permanent mydriasis (when the eye's black center is larger than usual), iris ischemia, and secondary pupillary sphincter atrophy. Another possibility is that topical treatments cause the iris to become affected. It was reported as a complication of toxic anterior segment syndrome, where there are fixed and dilated pupils.\n\n【9】*   **Iris Atrophy and Ischemia**: Ischemic atrophy (shrinkage or withering away of a bodily tissue) of the sphincter muscle caused by iris strangulation (constriction of iris vessels) and pupil dilation is the primary explanation for the onset of Urrets-Zavalia syndrome. An immediate postoperative rise in intraocular pressure, compression of the iris vasculature against the host cornea's incision edge during surgery, and viscoelastic material left in the anterior chamber angle are all potential causes of iris ischemia.\n\n【10】After penetrating keratoplasty, patients who had a fixed dilated pupil exhibited delayed and segmental iris vascular filling. Additionally, the vessels are convoluted, and the iris vessels eventually leak. These angiographic results support the presence of significant iris ischemia. The use of the trephine or scissors during surgery can also result in the same.\n\n【11】How to Prevent Urrets-Zavalia Syndrome?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【12】It is challenging to prevent Urrets-Zavalia syndrome because the condition's exact cause is unknown.\n\n【13】*   **Preoperative**\\- It was discovered that intravenous Mannitol administered prior to surgery reduced the rate of fixed dilated pupils. Mannitol can prevent iris strangulation by reducing vitreous volume. It has been demonstrated that YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) laser iridotomy carried out the day before penetrating keratoplasty can stop Urrets-Zavalia syndrome.\n\n【14】*   **Intraoperative**\\- In order to avoid the occurrence of Urrets-Zavalia syndrome, several precautions must be taken during surgery. First, it is important to maintain a deep anterior chamber throughout. Second, great care should be taken to prevent iris trauma during surgery. Third, the surgeon must take into account doing peripheral iridotomy, which can lessen the danger of pupillary block and iris strangulation. Similar to other ocular procedures, it is advised to carefully remove any viscoelastic substance and to only leave a small quantity of air in the anterior chamber when it is necessary to do so.\n\n【15】*   **Postoperative**\\- All patients having penetrating keratoplasty, especially those with keratoconus, require close intraocular pressure control during the first 24 hours postoperatively. Use of Mydriatics should be avoided.\n\n【16】What Is the Management for Urrets-Zavalia Syndrome?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】*   **Therapy**: Dapiprazole and Guanethidine drops, which are sympatholytic drugs (a medication that blocks the effects of postganglionic nerve activity in effector organs that are sympathetically innervated), have been suggested in some accounts in the literature as a way to deal with the hypertony of the iris' sympathetic nervous system and to trigger miosis or contraction of the pupils once Urrets-Zavalia Syndrome has occurred. A study showed that Pilocarpine and Guanethidine effectively cured iris sympathetic spasm and caused miosis, although many other studies showed little benefit from either of them. Acetylcholine and Pilocarpine have not shown any effectiveness in preventing Urrets-Zavalia syndrome.\n\n【18】*   **General Treatment Therapy**: In Urrets-Zavalia syndrome, partial spontaneous recovery is feasible.\n\n【19】*   **Surgical Intervention**: A cyclodialysis spatula should be used to break the contact between the iris and host cornea when the cause of a fixed dilated pupil is an anterior chamber that is shallow in order to prevent the iris-cornea touch from occurring again. As soon as this contact is broken, the pupil will begin to constrict. Immediate anterior chamber washing is advised if Urrets-Zavalia syndrome develops as a result of high intraocular pressure due to viscoelastic residue or blood remaining in the anterior chamber.\n\n【20】For symptomatic persistent mydriasis, several restorative surgical procedures are offered. These include iris sutures, corneal tattooing, and an intraocular lens with a black diaphragm. In order to alleviate visual problems and enhance cosmetic appearance, a femtosecond-assisted keratopigmentation procedure was developed.\n\n【21】**Conclusion:**\n\n【22】Patients having keratoplasty with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in the immediate postoperative phase and with residue left in the anterior chamber are at higher risk of Urrets-Zavalia syndrome.\n\n【23】However, the incidence of Urrets-Zavalia syndrome may be reduced by using Mannitol intravenously, controlling intraocular pressure in the initial postoperative period, and avoiding significant gas or air injection into the anterior chamber. Iridectomy may be necessary for some circumstances, such as when there is substantial air or gas in the anterior chamber, high vitreous pressure, shallow anterior chambers, or any combination of these.\n\n【24】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【25】无关删除-1:<u>*   Urrets-Zavalia Syndrome Following Cataract Surgery  \n    https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/513959?utm\\_source=researcher\\_app&utm\\_medium=referral&utm\\_campaign=RESR\\_MRKT\\_Researcher\\_inbound\n*   Urrets-Zavalia Syndrome  \n    https://eyewiki.aao.org/Urrets-Zavalia\\_Syndrome\n*   Urrets-Zavalia syndrome (fixed and dilated pupil following penetrating keratoplasty for keratoconus) and its variants  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24560126/\n*   Update and review of Urrets-Zavalia syndrome  \n    https://www.scielo.br/j/abo/a/6844KRtBvVd8Cw6kNJZJgcc/?lang=en\n*   Urrets-Zavalia syndrome (fixed and dilated pupil following penetrating keratoplasty for keratoconus) and its variants  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039625713002762\n*   Urrets-Zavalia syndrome following trabeculectomy  \n    https://bjo.bmj.com/content/84/3/337.3\n*   Urrets-Zavalia syndrome in different methods of keratoplasty  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5028676/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Generally, the aplastic crisis is a manageable clinical condition and exists only for a shorter duration. However, it becomes a medical emergency for patients with existing hemolytic disorders like sickle cell anemia. Severe aplastic crises are seen in children associated with parvovirus B19 infection.\n\n【2】Do Aplastic Crisis and Aplastic Anemia Mean the Same?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】No, aplastic crisis and aplastic anemia are two separate medical conditions whose nomenclatures are often confused in clinical usage. This is because they both show similar clinical manifestations, such as decreased number of red blood cells and lowered hemoglobin levels.\n\n【4】*   Aplasia refers to a defective formation, complete absence, and developmental cessation in the production of any particular tissue.\n\n【5】*   Aplastic anemia is characterized by pancytopenia (total decrease in all the cellular components of blood), where there is a reduction not only in red blood cells but also in white blood cells and platelets due to hypocellular (reduced cells) bone marrow. Heredity causes, infection, immune disorders, exposure to chemicals, and radiation are some of the causes of aplastic anemia.\n\n【6】*   Aplastic crisis refers to the failure of bone marrow to produce red blood cells, which commonly arises as a complication of hemolytic disorders or viral infections.\n\n【7】What Is Aplastic Crisis and What Are Its Causes?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The aplastic crisis is a transient shutdown of red blood cell production by the bone marrow. Although the aplastic crisis is a temporary condition, it turns into a potentially life-threatening complication due to various forms of chronic hemolytic conditions and also due to exposure to certain viruses. The predominant causes for an aplastic crisis are as follows:\n\n【9】*   Sickle cell anemia.\n\n【10】*   Thalassemia.\n\n【11】*   Hereditary spherocytosis.\n\n【12】*   Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs).\n\n【13】*   Parvovirus B19 infection.\n\n【14】*   Other bacterial and viral infections (Streptococcus Pneumonia, salmonella, and Epstein-Barr virus).\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome and Fissured Tongue</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Dealing with Foreign Body Inside the Ears</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    E-waste and Its Toxicological Implications</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Erythrocyte enzyme deficiencies.\n\n【16】*   Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\n【17】*   Autoimmune hemolysis.\n\n【18】*   Inhaled oxygen therapy (excessive oxygen availability inhibits red blood cell production).\n    </u>\n\n【19】What Happens in an Aplastic Crisis?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【20】Normally, erythropoiesis (synthesis and production of red blood cells) occurs in the bone marrow. Red blood cells develop from the erythroid (red blood cell lineage) precursors that differentiate from the pluripotent stem cells. Aplastic crisis occurs in two phases which include the aplastic phase characterized by the cessation of erythrocyte (red blood cell) production in the bone marrow for a short duration, followed by the recovery phase, where the bone marrow starts producing red blood cells. The sequential events in aplastic crisis are as follows:\n\n【21】*   In the aplastic phase, the hematocrit levels and reticulocyte count decrease.\n\n【22】*   Erythroblasts in the bone marrow disappear.\n\n【23】*   Iron is not trapped in the abnormal red blood cells and remains unused, which accumulates in the serum.\n\n【24】*   As the production of new red cells declines, old (non-functioning) red blood cells and microspherocytosis (abnormal size and shape of RBCs) increase in peripheral blood circulation.\n\n【25】*   The red blood cells lose their structural stability, and the osmotic fragility of their membrane increases.\n\n【26】*   The presence of iron in the serum inhibits erythropoiesis in the bone marrow.\n\n【27】*   The recovery phase is initiated by the destruction of abnormal red blood cells in the spleen.\n\n【28】*   The appearance of reticulocytes in blood circulation indicates restoration of erythropoiesis in the bone marrow.\n\n【29】*   Because of the reduced red blood cell lifespan in sickle cell disease, there is a rapid drop in hemoglobin levels, and also, the bone marrow stops producing red blood cells.\n\n【30】*   In parvovirus B19 infection, the viruses destroy the precursors of red blood cells by bone marrow necrosis and halt their production, causing aplastic crisis and resulting in severe anemia.\n\n【31】What Are the Symptoms of Aplastic Crisis?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【32】Red blood cells play a vital role in energy production, as they contain hemoglobin which carries oxygen to the tissues. During aplastic crises, oxygen transport is greatly disrupted, resulting in fatigue and generalized tiredness. There is an abrupt fall in Hb (hemoglobin) levels, decreased reticulocyte number, and an increase in enzymes like LDH (lactate dehydrogenase). Although the duration of these episodes lasts for only a few days, patients experience severe anemic symptoms because of continuous hemolysis, even in the absence of red blood cells.\n\n【33】Aplastic crisis usually lasts for eight to ten days. Aplastic crisis does not become a serious health condition in normal people since normal red blood cells last in blood circulation for 90 to 120 days. But in people with defective red blood cells (sickle cell anemia), red blood cells last only for 7 to 20 days. Severe anemia and associated symptoms develop in such cases.\n\n【34】*   Fever with high temperature.\n\n【35】*   Cough.\n\n【36】*   Difficulty in breathing.\n\n【37】*   Fatigue and weakness.\n\n【38】*   Rapid heart rate (tachycardia).\n\n【39】*   Flu-like symptoms.\n\n【40】*   Low energy level and tiredness.\n\n【41】*   Irritability.\n\n【42】*   Pale skin (pale color of lips, nails, and fingertips).\n\n【43】*   Febrile illness (in parvovirus infection).\n\n【44】*   Bone pain.\n\n【45】*   Malaise.\n\n【46】*   Muscular cramps (vaso-occlusive pain).\n\n【47】*   In pregnancy, parvovirus infection is transferred to the fetus resulting in hydrops fetalis (severe hemolysis in neonates) or stillbirth.\n\n【48】How Is Aplastic Crisis Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【49】Aplastic crisis are detected by routine blood screening tests. However, the results would coincide with existing hemolytic disorders resulting in misdiagnosis. Hence additional parameters are to be assessed to confirm aplastic crisis. History of febrile illness to be suspected of parvovirus infection, particularly in pregnant mothers.\n\n【50】*   Decreased number of red blood cells.\n\n【51】*   Lower hemoglobin levels (less than 3 g/dL).\n\n【52】*   Reduced hematocrit values (mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and red cell distribution width).\n\n【53】*   Noticeable fall in the reticulocyte (precursors of red blood cells) count in peripheral blood suggestive of aplastic crisis.\n\n【54】*   Serum iron levels are increased due to hemolysis.\n\n【55】*   Elevated enzyme levels due to the destruction of red blood cells and abnormal bone activity.\n\n【56】What Are the Management Protocols for Aplastic Crisis?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【57】*   Blood transfusion is the immediate treatment of choice in a severe aplastic crisis.\n\n【58】*   Administration of red blood cell concentration, particularly in children.\n\n【59】*   Supportive care to prevent secondary infections.\n\n【60】*   Partial exchange transfusion is recommended for patients with cardiac insufficiency and congestive heart failure to prevent volume overload on cardiac functioning.\n\n【61】*   In the case of parvovirus infection, anti-B19 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies start circulating in the blood and remain detectable even after infection for several years. This provides immunity and protection from reinfection, particularly in children.\n\n【62】*   Bone marrow transplantation is advised in case of failure to recover from the aplastic crisis.\n\n【63】**Conclusion**\n\n【64】Aplastic crisis occurs when the body is not able to produce sufficient red blood cells to meet its normal physiological breakdown. Generally, aplastic crisis is a self-limiting clinical condition where recovery occurs spontaneously within a week. It becomes a serious health concern in some people who already have hemolytic dysfunction. Procedures like blood transfusion and symptomatic therapeutic interventions would be lifesaving in patients with associated blood disorders.\n\n【65】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【66】无关删除-1:<u>*   Aplastic anemia: the correct nomenclature matters  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060039/\n*   Sickle Cell Disease Aplastic Crisis  \n    https://www.ihtc.org/sickle-cell-aplastic-crisis\n*   Aplastic Crisis  \n    https://www.texaschildrens.org/health/aplastic-crisis\n*   Aplastic Crisis  \n    https://together.stjude.org/en-us/patient-education-resources/symptoms-side-effects/aplastic-crisis.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Progeria is rare and affects about one in every four to eight million live births. At birth, the child usually appears healthy and normal. Progeria causes children to age quickly, beginning within their first two years of life. The affected children usually live for about fifteen to twenty years.\n\n【2】What Are the Symptoms of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The affected child presents age-appropriate motor and intellectual development. However, the symptoms of this advancing disease are recognizable. Progeria can cause distinctive physical appearances in affected children, such as:\n\n【4】*   Growth retardation leads to less height and less weight of the child which may not be appropriate for the age of the child.\n\n【5】*   Loss of fat from underneath the skin causes the skin to appear thin, aged, and wrinkled.\n\n【6】*   The proportion of the head is much more than the rest of the face.\n\n【7】*   The size of the chin and jaw is smaller than usual due to underdevelopment.\n\n【8】*   Lean nose with a beak-like tip.\n\n【9】*   Alopecia causes hair loss over the head and body.\n\n【10】*   Due to the loss of eyelashes and eyebrows, the eyes and eyelids of children with progeria may appear more noticeable or prominent.\n\n【11】*   Prominent ears with short ear lobes.\n\n【12】Apart from physical attributes, health problems associated with progeria include:\n\n【13】*   Arteries may become blocked and cause heart failure or stroke due to calcification and hardening of the arterial walls.\n\n【14】*   Joint pain and stiffness resulting from delayed growth and development of the joints.\n\n【15】*   Stiffness in the joints, causing difficulty in movements.\n\n【16】*   Dental problems - delayed tooth eruption, loss of primary teeth, and abnormally shaped teeth.\n\n【17】*   Dislocation of the hips.\n\n【18】*   As the condition progresses, loss of hearing is experienced.\n\n【19】*   Impact the growth of nails on both fingers and toes, leading to changes in their color, texture, and shape.\n\n【20】*   When sleeping, the child may not completely close their eyes (nocturnal lagophthalmos).\n\n【21】What Causes Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Lamin A (LMNA) gene normally makes a protein that helps hold a cell's nucleus together. A genetic mutation to the LMNA gene creates an abnormal protein called progerin. Progerin makes cells unstable and causes the aging process. Progeria is an autosomal dominant disorder where the presence of a single gene itself can cause the disease condition. However, this gene mutation is not inherited from family members and usually happens randomly. No risk factors are known to be responsible for the genetic mutation to occur.\n\n【23】How Is Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Although Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, the doctor may suspect the disease condition based on the characteristic physical appearance of the child. A thorough physical examination, as well as genetic testing, confirms the disease condition.\n\n【25】**1\\. Physical Examination:**\n\n【26】*   Short stature.\n*   The child does not gain weight appropriate for their age.\n*   Disproportionate head with the rest of the face.\n*   Lean nose.\n*   Loss of hair.\n*   Fingernails and toenails that appear dystrophic (abnormal in shape, color, texture, and size).\n*   Short shoulder bone (clavicle).\n*   The child does not respond well to sound, indicating hearing loss.\n\n【27】**2\\. X-ray Examination:**\n\n【28】*   Resorption of shoulder bones on the distal aspect is seen.\n*   Resortption of finger tips (distal phalanges).\n*   Oral X-ray reveals delayed tooth eruption.\n\n【29】**3\\. Genetic Testing:**\n\n【30】*   Mutations to the LMNA gene revealed on genetic testing may confirm Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.\n\n【31】How to Treat Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】After confirming a diagnosis of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, it is recommended to regularly monitor the child for heart and blood vessel diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases or stroke.\n\n【33】The main objective of treatment for progeria is to manage its symptoms, prevent complications, and provide comfort to the child since there is no permanent cure available for this condition. Some of the measures are as follows:\n\n【34】**1\\. Medication:**\n\n【35】*   Lonafarnib is the medication that helps children live a little longer as the medication acts on the mutated gene and slows down the progression of aging caused by the gene. The drug may have certain side effects of nausea and vomiting, which usually improves with time. Lonafarnib drug was also shown to improve the life expectancy of most of the individuals who received treatment.\n\n【36】*   Aspirin or other blood thinner medications, when prescribed in low doses, were shown to blood improve blood flow and prevent heart failure and strokes.\n\n【37】*   Growth hormones to improve the physical growth and development of the child may be prescribed.\n\n【38】*   Medications to manage and improve pain, blood pressure, and heart health conditions may also be prescribed based on the severity of the condition, and it varies with each individual.\n\n【39】**2\\. Therapy:** Pain and stiffness in the joints can be improved with physical therapy under trained professionals who are aware of a progeria disease condition. Occupational therapy aims to help the child with daily activities, which will help improve their quality of life.\n\n【40】**3\\. Diet:** A healthy, well-balanced diet rich in nutrition is advised for children with progeria to help with weight gain. Small multiple meals instead of three large meals a day can help ensure the same.\n\n【41】**4\\. Oral Health Care:** Regular dental visits can help early management of dental issues that a child with progeria may experience.\n\n【42】**5\\. Eye Care:** Children with progeria often have difficulty closing their eyes completely during sleep, which can increase the risk of eye dryness. Using lubricating eye drops can help alleviate the discomfort, and regular ophthalmology follow-up is advised to prevent damage to the eye.\n\n【43】6\\. In some cases, hearing aids or other listening devices may be necessary to address low-frequency hearing loss, even if it does not impact daily activities.\n\n【44】What Are the Recent Advancements in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome Management?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】Several studies are being conducted to find a cure for progeria. They are trying different methods like gene therapy and RNA therapeutics to correct genetic mutation and reduce harmful proteins in the body. Scientists are also making small-molecule drugs that target these proteins. Recently, there have been some promising developments, such as a gene therapy that improved the health of mice and increased their lifespan and RNA-based drugs that reduced progerin production and improved survival in mice.\n\n【46】**Conclusion**\n\n【47】Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a rare condition. However, this genetic disorder affects individuals worldwide, causing them to experience the physical symptoms of aging at an early age. At present, there is no cure for it. However, scientists are making progress in improving how it is treated and managed. This gives individuals with progeria hope for a better future with a better quality of life. It is important to educate people in order to raise awareness and promote effective strategies to treat and manage the syndrome and provide support to those affected by this disease.\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【49】无关删除-1:<u>*   Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/hutchinson-gilford-progeria/\n*   Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1121/\n*   FDA Approves First Treatment for Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Some Progeroid Laminopathies  \n    https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-hutchinson-gilford-progeria-syndrome-and-some-progeroid-laminopathies</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The fallopian tubes are an essential part of the female reproductive system.\n\n【2】What Is Tubal Ligation?\n-----------------------\n\n【3】Tubal ligation is a surgical procedure performed in women, which involves getting the fallopian tubes blocked or cut. This procedure is also known as ‘female sterilization’ and prevents pregnancy.\n\n【4】For Whom Is Tubal Ligation Advised?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【5】Tubal ligation is generally performed for women who:\n\n【6】*   Have had multiple pregnancies and do not desire any children.\n\n【7】*   Do not want children; in order to avoid pregnancy and to engage frequently in sexual activity.\n\n【8】*   Are in a stable relationship where both partners do not want children.\n\n【9】*   Have a genetic disorder and fear their children might be diagnosed with the same. This also applies, if the male partner has a genetic disorder.\n\n【10】*   Cannot risk getting pregnant as it may affect their health negatively.\n\n【11】How Is Tubal Ligation Performed?\n--------------------------------\n\n【12】Tubal ligation is a surgical procedure performed under either general or local anesthesia. It is carried out in a hospital or surgical clinic. Patients are usually discharged the same day.\n\n【13】**Procedure:**\n\n【14】The abdomen is inflated with either carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide gas through a needle insertion or an incision made through the belly button. Next, a laparoscope is inserted into the abdomen, and other special instruments are inserted through the abdominal wall to either destroy some parts of the fallopian tubes or clip them. The gas is then removed, and the patient may go home a few hours after the procedure. Patients may experience abdominal bloating and pain, tiredness, and occasional dizziness or fainting spells as immediate side effects of the procedure that will soon wear away.\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【16】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【17】In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)\n\n【18】My wife is 30 days pregnant.

It does not offer any form of protection against sexually transmitted infections. Therefore, using adequate protection like condoms or other STI prevention devices is a must even after tubal ligation; unless one is in a committed, monogamous relationship and both partners have tested negative for any STI.\n\n【28】Can the Tubal Ligation Procedure Be Reversed?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Tubal ligation is an effective permanent birth control option. Nevertheless, depending on the original ligation type and procedure, it may be possible to reverse a tubal ligation. However, it is complicated and does not guarantee a pregnancy. Reports on women getting pregnant after reattachment of tubes have ranged from 50 % - 80 % success rates. This means that the chances of getting pregnant after a tubal ligation are slim.\n\n【30】What Are the Side Effects of Tubal Ligation?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Side effects may include:\n\n【32】*   Symptoms arising after the procedure (that will wear off in time) such as abdominal pain, cramps, bloating, tiredness or fatigue, shoulder pain.\n\n【33】*   Risks or complications from the procedure include:\n\n【34】    *   Improper wound healing.\n\n【35】    *   Bleeding from the site.\n\n【36】    *   Bowel and bladder damage.\n\n【37】    *   Pelvic pain and raised temperature of about 100.4 F, among others.\n\n【38】    *   Improper closure that might increase the chances of pregnancy.\n\n【39】    *   Ectopic pregnancy (implantation of fertilized egg outside the uterus)\n\n【40】What Is Post Tubal Ligation Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【41】Some women may experience a series of characteristic symptoms following tubal ligation, referred to as post tubal ligation syndrome. On average, around 37 % of women face the possibility of developing the syndrome, of which younger women form the more significant part.\n\n【42】The symptoms associated with post tubal ligation syndrome include:\n\n【43】*   Pain during intercourse.\n\n【44】*   Menstruation troubles.\n\n【45】*   Absence of menstruation.\n\n【46】*   **Premenstrual Syndrome:** Signs and symptoms displayed by women in the week leading up to their periods. This includes breast tenderness, mood swings, irritability, and a general sense of fatigue.\n\n【47】*   Weight gain.\n\n【48】*   Depression and anxiety.\n\n【49】*   **Hemorrhage of the Uterus:** Abnormal bleeding from the uterus that lasts a long time.\n\n【50】*   Pelvic pain.\n\n【51】*   Increased frequency of headaches.\n\n【52】*   An ache in the lower back.\n\n【53】Can Pregnancy Occur Even After Tubal Ligation?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【54】While tubal ligation is a highly effective procedure, there is a 1 in 200 possibility of getting pregnant, especially in younger women. Women below the age of 28 show the most significant risk of getting pregnant even after tubal ligation, while women over 35 may be at a lower risk of getting pregnant. However, this comes with a complication of an ectopic pregnancy (the fertilized egg is implanted outside the uterus - usually in a fallopian tube). This type of pregnancy is dangerous and requires medical attention. It is also not possible or advisable to attempt carrying such a pregnancy to full-term.\n\n【55】What To Do if Pregnancy Is Desired After Tubal Ligation?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】Pregnancy after tubal ligation may be facilitated in the following ways:\n\n【57】*   **Tubal Reversal Surgery:** A tubal ligation reversal procedure can be performed after tubal ligation if the woman changes her mind and wishes to get pregnant. However, this depends on how the tubal ligation procedure was performed. It is also a complicated procedure and may not be effective.\n\n【58】*   **In Vitro Fertilization (IVF):** The woman is stimulated with medications for the growth of multiple eggs, which are then taken from her ovaries, fertilized with sperm from the male partner outside in a laboratory, and then transferred back to her uterus. This may result in the implantation of one embryo in the uterus and subsequently bring about pregnancy.\n\n【59】Is Tubal Ligation Expensive?\n----------------------------\n\n【60】*   Tubal ligation is an expensive procedure in most countries.\n\n【61】*   When compared to tubal implants, tubal ligation surgery is undoubtedly more expensive.\n\n【62】*   Tubal ligation is also a costlier option than vasectomy (male birth control surgery that blocks the sperm from reaching the semen ejaculated by the penis).\n\n【63】What Are Some Alternatives to Tubal Ligation?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【64】*   **Use of Condoms:** This is the simplest, most economical, and most feasible solution. Additionally, condoms have a dual role. They can prevent pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【65】*   **Vasectomy:** Male sterilization procedure that is more affordable, has fewer side effects, and cannot result in ectopic pregnancy for the female partner. Even if the procedure does fail and pregnancy occurs in the woman, the chances of ectopic pregnancy are negotiable, unlike tubal ligation.\n\n【66】*   **Birth Control Implant:** This device is implanted in the arm, and it releases hormones such as progestin to prevent pregnancy.\n\n【67】*   **Oral Contraceptive Pills.**\n\n【68】*   **Intrauterine Devices (IUDs):** A long-term, reversible option for birth control, where a coil-like device is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy.\n\n【69】**Conclusion:**\n\n【70】Tubal ligation is an intelligent choice for those who are sure that they do not want any children or those who cannot undergo pregnancy for medical and other reasons. It can be challenging work trying to make a decision, but with enough information and support from physicians and partners, it is possible to make informed decisions and choose what suits one’s physical and personal needs best.\n\n【71】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【72】* * *\n\n【73】#### **1.**删除换行**Can Periods Occur After Tubal Ligation?**\n\n【74】Tubal ligation does not in any way affect a woman’s menstrual cycle.

It is a significant public health issue for the elderly and is predicted to worsen as people live longer.\n\n【2】One in two Indian women over 50 and one in five Indian males over 65 are in danger of developing osteoporosis, making India one of the top nations impacted by the disease. Since osteoporosis is frequently a silent disease, it may manifest as a terrifying complication like a hip fracture, related to increased morbidity and four times the death rate in the senior population.\n\n【3】Throughout a person's lifetime, the tissue of the bone is constantly being remodeled. Bone remodeling occurs continuously as a result of the constant coupling of bone resorption and creation at different rates. The kinetics of bone resorption in several metabolic bone illnesses can be gained from research on bone resorption markers.\n\n【4】Despite low bone mineral density (BMD), the degeneration of bone microarchitecture brought on by aging and pathological conditions such as osteoporosis causes a rise in the risk of fracture. BTMs (bone turnover marker or bone resorption marker) complement BMD in evaluating fracture risk since they can measure these microarchitectural changes impacting bone quality. For the treatment of osteoporosis, numerous trustworthy, quick, and affordable automated tests of BTMs with high sensitivity are available.\n\n【5】What Physiological Basis Exists for the Bone Resorption Marker?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】As a metabolically active structure, the bone changes continuously over the course of a person's lifetime. The fundamental multicellular unit of bone, known as the \"bone remodeling unit\" is the first multicellular unit that begins sequential development after reaching peak bone mass. BTMs are a variety of macromolecules that are released into the bloodstream during bone growth and resorption. Bone resorption occurs in roughly ten days under ideal physiological conditions, and bone creation takes about three months. Every year, remodeling may replace up to 20 % of the skeleton.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】Physiotherapy and Osteoporosis\n\n【10】I have two positive ANA markers, and I am experiencing various symptoms. What to do?\n\n【11】Bone Markers in Osteoporosis - Types and Function\n\n【12】What Are Bone Markers, and What Are the Types?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Chemicals created during the remodeling of bone can be identified in the blood and urine and serve as a marker.\n\n【14】In the metabolic phase in which they are formed, the BTMs are divided into two types as follows:\n\n【15】1.  Markers for bone formation.\n2.  Markers of bone resorption.\n\n【16】To assess fracture risk and track treatment in clinical settings, the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine have suggested using serum CTX-1 (sCTX) and serum P1NP, respectively, as reference markers of bone resorption and formation.\n\n【17】What Are the Markers of Bone Formation?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【18】During various stages of bone growth, active osteoblasts produce markers of bone formation, which are thought to reflect various facets of osteoblast function and bone formation. Serum or plasma is used to measure all bone-formation markers.\n\n【19】Bone formation indicators can be divided into:\n\n【20】1.  By-products of collagen synthesis include type 1 collagen propeptides (C-terminal: P1CP, N-terminal: P1NP)\n2.  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an osteoblast enzyme (total and bone-specific)\n3.  Osteocalcin is a protein in a matrix (OC).\n\n【21】What Are the Markers of Bone Resorption?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【22】By-products of osteoclast activity generated during bone resorption are among the indicators that are formed during the bone resorption process of bone remodeling.\n\n【23】Following are the several types of bone resorption markers:\n\n【24】**Collagen Breakdown Products:**\n\n【25】*   Teopeptides of type 1 cola (C-terminal: CTX-1 and CTX-matrix. Metalloproteinases \\[MMP\\], N-terminal: NTX-1).\n*   Hydroxyproline.\n*   Crosslinks between Pyridium (pyridinoline \\[PYD\\], deoxypyridinoline \\[DPD\\]).\n\n【26】**Non-Collagenous Proteins:**\n\n【27】*   Bone sialyl protein.\n\n【28】**Osteoclast-Forming Enzymes:**\n\n【29】*   Acid phosphatase that can withstand tartrates.\n*   A cathepsin K.\n\n【30】**Indicators of Osteoclast Activity:**\n\n【31】*   Ligand for the nuclear factor kappa-B receptor (RANKL).\n*   Osteoprotegerin (OPG) (OPG).\n*   Dickkopf-associated protein 1.\n*   Sclerostin.\n\n【32】How Are Bone Markers Used to Determine Fracture Risk?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】In postmenopausal women, increased BTMs may predict osteoporotic fracture risk independently of BMD. In addition to poor BMD, increasing bone resorption causes the bone microarchitecture to deteriorate, increasing the fracture risk. BTMs can measure this microarchitectural change that affects bone quality, making them a helpful complement to BMD, which can only measure bone mass for determining fracture risk. As newly generated bone may be a less mineralized and post-translational modification, such as decreasing beta crosslinks and beta isomerization of type 1 collagen, may be reduced, increased BTMs are a sign of loss in the structural integrity of bone.\n\n【34】What Function Does a Bone Marker Have In Monitoring the Treatment of Osteoporosis?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】BTMs aid in improving therapy by providing pharmacodynamic data on an individual's treatment response to osteoporosis medication and information on ongoing bone remodeling. They are most helpful in assessing a patient's adherence to medication in chronic, asymptomatic conditions like osteoporosis, when medication adherence can be a big problem.\n\n【36】Monitoring treatment compliance and adherence is a highly practical application of BTMs, particularly for bone resorption inhibitors. Oral medication adherence is notoriously poor and is one of the most significant challenges to reducing the risk of fractures in the elderly. This is especially true for oral bisphosphonates, which must be taken according to a strict dosing regimen.\n\n【37】The emergence of weekly and monthly oral formulations has slightly better adherence or persistence. Thus, BTMs could be useful in identifying a less-than-expected suppression of bone turnover with a given treatment, which could indicate either persistence failure (i.e. the patient has discontinued treatment) or a patient who has not been fully compliant with the drug dosing regimen. As a result, BTMs could be used to monitor biological efficacy or adherence to treatment. However, this would imply that BTMs be calculated before the start of treatment and during subsequent follow-up.\n\n【38】What Are the Barriers to the Bone Resorption Marker?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】*   Variability in pre and post-analysis.\n\n【40】*   Inadequate understanding of the sources of variability in each BTM.\n\n【41】*   Assays for BTMs are not standardized.\n\n【42】*   BTM ethnic variations and the absence of ethnicity-based recommended limits for each population.\n\n【43】*   Data on the response of various BTMs to different osteoporosis treatments and comparisons between them are unavailable.\n\n【44】**Conclusion:**\n\n【45】BTMs are powerful components for osteoporosis management that are gaining attraction in clinical practice around the world. The most useful feature of BTMs is estimating the risk of fracture based on bone remodeling rates and monitoring adherence and treatment response. BTMs have been identified as an independent contributor to fracture risk in extensive epidemiologic studies. Understanding biological variations and the availability of trusted, rapid, cost-effective, and standardized BTMs immunoassay may aid in better use of BTMS in monitoring osteoporosis.\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>*   Osteoporosis Markers  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32644732/#:~:text=BTMs%20are%20classified%20as%20either,of%20bone%20resorption%20such%20as\n*   Bone turnover markers: Emerging tool in the management of osteoporosis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5105571/\n*   Biochemical Markers in Osteoporosis: Usefulness in Clinical Practice  \n    https://www.reumatologiaclinica.org/en-biochemical-markers-in-osteoporosis-usefulness-articulo-S2173574311000232\n*   Bone turnover markers  \n    https://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2013/may/bone-turnover-markers</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Without eyes, the quality of life will be highly affected. The eye comprises a number of layers like the conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, anterior chamber, posterior chamber, pupil, lens, iris, vitreous humor, retina, and optic nerve. Each layer is responsible for our vision, and each of them is highly prone to infections and trauma. One of the conditions to be discussed in this article is angioid streaks.\n\n【2】Angioid streaks were first reported in 1889 and are also called Knapp streaks. It is a rare condition caused by trauma or systemic conditions. Angioid streaks present as irregular, radiating lines (looks like blood vessels) from deeper retinal layers and running towards the optic nerve. It is a bilateral condition. This is believed to be caused by a break in the Bruch membrane (a layer between the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid capillaries) of the eye. This membrane is a mediator between the blood flow from the choroid and retinal pigment epithelium. The color of the streaks could be red, orange, gray, or brown and is often mistaken for blood vessels on examination.\n\n【3】What Are the Causes of Angioid Streaks?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【4】**Medical Conditions:**\n\n【5】*   **Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum:** Is an inherited connective tissue disorder, and its occurrence is rare. It accumulates calcium and mineral deposits on the elastic fibers of the eye. Due to this, minor breaks occur in the Bruch membrane causing angioid streaks. 85 % of people affected with pseudoxanthoma elasticum will develop ocular conditions, and this combination of conditions is called Gronblad Strandberg syndrome.\n\n【6】*   **Paget Disease:** A condition of bone deformity.\n\n【7】*   Ehlers danlos syndrome is a collagen disorder resulting in several eye conditions and angioid streaks being one.\n\n【8】*   **Acromegaly:** Pituitary gland disorder where an excess of growth hormone will be produced.\n\n【9】*   Diabetes mellitus.\n\n【10】*   **Myopia:** Is a condition of the eye where the individual can see near objects clearly, but objects farther away look blurry.

Some of the conditions causing angioid streaks are,\n\n【17】*   Hemoglobin H.\n\n【18】*   Sickle cell thalassemia.\n\n【19】*   Spherocytosis (the red blood cells are round-shaped instead of disc-shaped and are more fragile than normal red blood cells).\n\n【20】*   Sickle cell hemoglobin (hemoglobin will be constricted to a sickle or crescent shape).\n\n【21】How Do Angioid Streaks Occur?\n-----------------------------\n\n【22】The pathophysiology of angioid streaks is still controversial. There are many theories as to why the Bruch membrane breaks.\n\n【23】*   The nature of angioid streaks suggests the intrinsic and extrinsic pull of the elastic eye muscles around the optic nerve site is the cause.\n\n【24】*   Due to some systemic conditions’ action of calcium, mineral accumulation, and the Bruch membrane's elastic fibers degeneration, the Bruch membrane is affected by opacities and breaks.\n\n【25】What Are the Symptoms of Angioid Streaks?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【26】Angioid streaks are generally asymptomatic. Only when the streaks extend into the macula (back part of the retinal layer), there are few symptoms like,\n\n【27】*   Vision impairment (when it involves the fovea of the eye).\n\n【28】*   Choroidal neovascularization (new blood vessels are formed from the choroid layer due to the break-in Bruch membrane).\n\n【29】*   Subretinal hemorrhage.\n\n【30】What Are the Possible Complications of Angioid Streaks?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】*   Subretinal hemorrhage.\n\n【32】*   Retinal detachment.\n\n【33】*   Atrophy of fovea.\n\n【34】*   Choroidal neovascularization.\n\n【35】How to Diagnose Angioid Streaks?\n--------------------------------\n\n【36】Angioid streaks are generally asymptomatic and cannot be confirmed with a visual examination.\n\n【37】**Clinical Evaluation:**\n\n【38】A thorough examination of the eye is done by carrying out tests to know,\n\n【39】*   Visual acuity.\n\n【40】*   Intraocular pressure.\n\n【41】*   Ocular motility.\n\n【42】All the layers of the eye are studied if there is a presence of an angioid streak following features are diagnosed.\n\n【43】*   Irregular lines originating from the optic disc.\n\n【44】*   Jagged lines form a ring-like structure around the optic disc.\n\n【45】*   The lines taper towards the retina.\n\n【46】*   Margins of the lines are serrated.\n\n【47】*   The location of the streaks is subretinal (beneath or deeper retinal layer).\n\n【48】*   Streaks are bilaterally present.\n\n【49】**Fundoscopy Examination:**\n\n【50】Also called ophthalmoscopy which is used by ophthalmologists to study the back of the eye.\n\n【51】*   Peau D'Orange appearance of fundus is a classic feature of angioid streaks and appears like orange skin.

It can be caused by many conditions like overeating, anorexia nervosa (a disorder where the person is underweight and does not eat enough for fear of gaining weight), infections, trauma, etc. It is usually found by taking abdominal X-rays and CT (computerized tomography) scans of the abdomen. It presents symptoms like stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, and an enlarged stomach. The patient can pass gas but has constipation for 4 to 5 days. The treatment depends on the underlying cause, and the management is done accordingly.\n\n【2】What Is Acute Gastric Dilatation?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】Acute gastric dilatation is a rare and fatal condition if not treated early. Due to the abnormal widening of the stomach with the presence of gastric gas, there is compression of the gastric wall. It causes reduced or no blood supply to the stomach, though the stomach has a rich blood supply. When no blood is supplied, the tissues in the gastric wall (stomach wall) die. It becomes like an obstruction (block), and the digestion is affected, and there is no proper bowel emptying.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Acute Gastric Dilatation?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The exact reasons for acute gastric dilation are unclear. However, some theories suggest gastric dilation due to compression of the third part of the duodenum in the middle of the vertebra, aorta, and superior mesenteric artery.\n\n【6】*   **Ischemia:** The stomach has a rich blood supply, but when the intragastric pressure (pressure inside the stomach) is beyond the portal venous pressure (blood vessels that carry blood supply from the gut and its neighboring structures to the liver), the blood supply is compromised. It results in reduced or no blood supply (ischemia), leading to the death of the tissues lining the stomach.\n\n【7】*   **High Intragastric Pressure:** Gastric perforation or holes in the stomach also occurs when the intragastric pressure goes above 120 mmHg (millimeters of mercury) - 150 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The normal gastric pressure is 9-14 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The symbol of mercury, a chemical, is Hg.\n\n【8】However, a few conditions mentioned below also cause gastric dilation.\n\n【9】*   **Overeating:** Overeating is when a person overeats beyond feeling full.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Neonicotinoid Poisoning - Clinical Symptoms and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Gastroduodenal Disease - Causes, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Complications</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Management of Gastric Outlet Obstruction in Elderly</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   **Binge Eating**: A person eats a large quantity of food and does not feel like stopping eating.\n\n【11】*   **Bulimia Nervosa:** Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder where the person consumes large amounts of food and follows certain steps not to gain weight.\n\n【12】*   **Infections:** Helicobacter pylori is a bacteria that causes infections and a few conditions like peptic ulcer (inflammation in the lining of the stomach, small intestine, and esophagus), gastritis (sores in the stomach lining), and cancer in the stomach (abnormal tissue growth in the gut).\n\n【13】*   **Trauma:** Road traffic accidents cause multiple traumas, and the stomach is sometimes compressed due to injury. The compressed stomach has no blood supply leading to the death of tissues lining the stomach.\n\n【14】*   **Spine Injury:** In patients with spinal cord injury, the autonomic nerve innervation of the gastrointestinal tract is deranged. It causes many complications in the gastrointestinal tract leading to intragastric pressure. The autonomic nervous system provides nerve supply to internal organs and blood vessels. It manages certain functions like blood pressure and breathing rate. It functions automatically.\n\n【15】*   **Post-Operative Complications:** Gastric perforations occur in specific post-operative procedures like feeding jejunostomy. Feeding jejunostomy is a surgical procedure where a feeding tube is inserted into the proximal part of the jejunum (a part of the small intestine) through the abdominal skin from the exterior to administer medications.\n\n【16】*   **Adhesive Ileus:** Adhesive ileus results from a series of surgical procedures in the abdomen. Adhesions are scar tissues formed due to repeated surgical procedures and result in tissues and organs sticking together. It leads to obstructions (blockage) in the bowels.\n    </u>\n\n【17】What Are the Symptoms of Acute Gastric Dilatation?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】*   Pain in the stomach.\n\n【19】*   Vomiting.\n\n【20】*   Nausea.\n\n【21】*   Constipation.\n\n【22】*   Abnormal swelling of the belly region.\n\n【23】*   Chest pain.\n\n【24】*   Respiratory distress (shortness of breath).\n\n【25】What Are the Tests to Find Acute Gastric Dilatation?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】*   **Physical Examination:** The doctor feels the abdomen for swelling and checks if the patient feels pain while touching the belly.\n\n【27】*   **X-Rays of the Abdomen:** X-ray is electromagnetic radiation that can penetrate the structures in the body and capture images. The captured images appear in black-and-white areas.\n\n【28】*   **Computerized Tomography (CT) Scan of the Abdomen:** Computerized tomography scan uses high-frequency radio waves to capture organ images in a computer. It captures the targeted organs or structures in detail. The dilation or widening in the stomach is viewed.\n\n【29】*   **Complete Blood Count:** Complete blood count is done to screen blood parameters like red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, hemoglobin, and neutrophils. Any changes in the normal ranges of these parameters reveal infection or disease.\n\n【30】How Is Acute Gastric Dilatation Treated?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【31】1.  **Nasogastric Decompression**: Nasogastric tube is a thin tube inserted into the nose to reach the stomach and pass through the esophagus. The pressure in the stomach is released due to blockage in the intestine. Nasogastric decompression is also performed in motor vehicle accidents to remove stomach pressure and prevent complications.\n2.  **Fluid Resuscitation:** Fluid replacement therapy is followed to replace lost body fluids like blood. The fluids can be administered orally or injected through veins. Fluids usually consist of ringer lactate solution and saline solution. Blood transfusion is also carried out in cases of severe bleeding.\n3.  **Surgical Intervention:**\n\n【32】*   *   **Partial Gastrectomy:** A part of the stomach is removed surgically.\n    *   **Total Gastrectomy:** The whole stomach is surgically removed.\n    *   **Sleeve Gastrectomy:** The left side of the stomach is removed surgically.\n    *   **Esophagojejunostomy**: A surgical procedure that creates an artificial connection between the esophagus and intestine.\n    *   **Feeding Jejunostomy:** A surgical procedure that involves placing a feeding tube in the skin of the abdomen into the proximal part of the jejunum to administer medication or nutrition if the patient cannot take it orally.\n    *   **Total Gastrectomy With Cervical Esophagostomy:** Surgical removal of the whole stomach and placement of a feeding tube in the front of the neck. A nasogastric tube placement guides it. The nasogastric tube is removed later, and the lewis feeding tube is placed in position.\n\n【33】What Are the Complications of Acute Gastric Dilatation?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】*   **Gastric Hemorrhage:** Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tracts, including the mouth, stomach, and rectum.\n\n【35】*   **Gastric Perforation:** Perforations or holes in the stomach lining.\n\n【36】*   **Gastric Infarction**: Death of tissues lining the stomach occurs due to reduced blood supply.\n\n【37】*   **Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance:** There is an imbalance in the electrolyte in the body fluids due to fluid loss. Electrolytes like sodium, calcium, potassium, chlorides, and phosphate are lost while vomiting or due to excess sweating. They manage the fluid balance in the body, maintain the blood pH, and play a role in blood clotting and forming new tissues.\n\n【38】*   **Damage to Other Abdominal Organs:** The blood supply to the stomach is compromised in acute gastric dilatation cases. It, in turn, affects the blood supply to other abdominal organs like the liver. It further damages these organs.\n\n【39】*   **Pulmonary Aspiration**: Accidental inhalation of a substance like vomit, liquids, or saliva into the lungs or airways.\n\n【40】*   **Respiratory Failure:** It occurs when the blood has reduced oxygen and contains more carbon dioxide. It fails to exchange gasses (oxygen and carbon dioxide) while breathing.\n\n【41】*   **Emphysematous Gastritis:** It is a rare disease that causes inflammation in the stomach walls, and gas-forming organisms form gas in the stomach wall.\n\n【42】*   **Paralytic Ileus**: When the muscles in the intestine are paralyzed (not in a condition to perform their function), paralytic ileus occurs. The muscles that play a role in transporting food inside the intestine do not function properly due to problems in the functioning of the nerves or muscles.\n\n【43】What Is the Prognosis of Acute Gastric Dilatation?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】The prognosis is moderate if the condition is treated early. The prognosis is poor if the condition is treated late and causes the patient's death.\n\n【45】**Conclusion:**\n\n【46】Acute gastric dilatation is a rare and fatal condition if not treated early. It shows symptoms like abdominal pain, enlarged stomach, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. The condition generally occurs in people who overeat and have disorders like bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa (people who do not eat at all due to fear of gaining weight), road traffic accidents, trauma, or post-surgical complications. The condition is highly fatal (causing death) if a preventive procedure like nasogastric decompression is not carried out if acute gastric dilatation is ruled. Surgical procedures involving removing a part or full stomach are choices of treatments. Though the condition is confirmed using imaging techniques, starting the treatment will prevent complications and keep the patient safe and alive.\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>*   Acute Gastric Dilatation in a Patient With Spinal Injury and Multiple Myeloma  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3093701/\n*   Acute Gastric Dilation Following Trauma: A Case Report  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6955027/\n*   Acute gastric dilatation  \n    https://wikem.org/wiki/Acute\\_gastric\\_dilatation\n*   Acute gastric dilation and ischemia secondary to small bowel obstruction  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2190544/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The sacrum and coccyx vertebrae are fused. The thoracolumbar area is the region between the rigid thoracic vertebrae and the flexible lumbar vertebrae. This area is highly susceptible to fractures, and a burst fracture disrupts the vertebral body endplate and posterior vertebral body cortex, involving the anterior and middle column of the spine. Burst fractures are severe fractures that apply great force on the spinal cord, which may even crush the vertebrae, pushing the bony fragments into the spinal canal, and may be associated with nerve involvement leading to partial or complete paralysis.\n\n【2】What Are Thoracolumbar Burst Fractures?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【3】Thoracolumbar burst fractures are fractures at the junction of the thoracic and lumbar spine, which are severe and may be associated with neurological involvement. If the fracture involves only the front of the spine, it becomes wedge shape and is called a compression fracture, and if the vertebrae are crushed in all directions, it is called a burst fracture. The neurological involvement depends on the amount of force during the injury and the extent of damage to the spinal canal. Most fractures occur in the T9 (thoracic vertebra) to L2 (lumbar vertebra) area and the lumbar spine.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Thoracolumbar Burst Fractures?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Different types of columnar fractures are grouped based on column involvement and mechanism of injury. According to Denis's classification, thoracolumbar injuries are classified as follows:\n\n【6】*   **Compression Injuries:** Fracture of the anterior column of the spinal cord, with the intact middle column, associated with involvement of superior or inferior endplates or both.\n\n【7】*   **Burst Injuries:** Fracture of the anterior and middle column, the posterior column may or may not be involved, associated with involvement of superior or inferior endplates, or both.\n\n【8】*   **Flexion-Distraction Injuries:** It is also called seat-belt type fractures; these are fractures involving all three columns of the spinal cord; with flexion and distraction mechanism\n\n【9】*   **Fracture-Dislocation Injuries:** These involve all three columns of the spinal cord; the mechanism is variable, like shear, compression, tension, and rotation\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Supracondylar Fractures of the Femur - An Overview</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Triplane Fractures - Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Stress Fractures- Causes, Symptoms, Prevention, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【11】What Are the Causes of Thoracolumbar Burst Fractures?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】*   Thoracolumbar fractures are seen mainly in individuals below 35 years of age. It is primarily caused due to vehicle accidents, falls from great heights, or occupational injuries. The fulcrum of increased motion at the thoracolumbar junction makes it more susceptible to injuries and fractures.\n\n【13】*   A previous history of spinal cord injury, osteoporosis, and tumors.\n\n【14】*   Conus-medullaris syndrome and spinal stenosis are some other causes that may make the individual vulnerable to thoracolumbar fractures.\n\n【15】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Thoracolumbar Burst Fractures?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Signs and symptoms include:\n\n【17】*   Skin abrasions, bleeding, bruises, and damage to the soft tissues.\n\n【18】*   Severe swelling and pain in the back, which radiates to the legs.\n\n【19】*   Inability to move the legs or walk.\n\n【20】*   Tingling or burning sensation along the affected area.\n\n【21】*   In some cases, there may be numbness or complete loss of sensation.\n\n【22】*   Inability to empty the bowel or bladder properly.\n\n【23】How Are Thoracolumbar Burst Fractures Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Thoracolumbar fractures need immediate care and management by an orthopedic specialist or a neurosurgeon. A complete history of the patient is taken, followed by a physical examination to check the injuries, bruises, and swelling; surrounding structures like the chest, stomach, and legs are also examined to determine the strength, range of motion, and coordination of arms and legs. Testing of muscle tone and nerves to confirm neurological involvement. Palpation shows localized tenderness and fluid collection. Radiological diagnosis includes:\n\n【25】*   **X-ray:** Both anterior-posterior and lateral views to determine the damage caused to the vertebral column and the involvement of the other bones. Spinal dislocation, kyphosis, scoliosis, or the overall alignment of the spinal cord, can be assessed. Bony spurs, bone erosions, and disc space narrowing can also be noted by the X-rays.\n\n【26】*   **Computed Tomography (CT Scan):** A combination of X-rays and computer technology produces a detailed image of the bones, surrounding muscles, and organs.\n\n【27】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** It is a procedure that uses large magnets and radio frequencies to produce a detailed view and gives an accurate picture of the structures damaged during the injury. It shows the presence of spinal cord compression or enlargement, associated edema, and hematoma.\n\n【28】*   **CT Myelography:** It is a procedure in which a contrast material is injected to evaluate the spinal cord, spinal lining, and nerve roots. This is advised in patients who cannot go for MRI scan.\n\n【29】How Are Thoracolumbar Burst Fractures Managed?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【30】Immediate hospitalization is necessary for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of thoracolumbar fractures.\n\n【31】*   Non-operative or conservative treatment is indicated for mechanically stable injuries without neurological involvement. It includes postural reduction by bed rest for 8 to 12 weeks, followed by slight assisted mobilization use of a thoracolumbar corset, and rehabilitation. In the case of compression fractures, physical therapy, and braces are considered to be the most effective method of management. Thoracic lumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) is recommended; it is a customized brace worn over an undershirt, which prevents further compression and provides symptomatic relief. It is advised for around two to three months and monitored once every two weeks, followed by physical therapy. External stabilization may not be required if there is no further subluxation.\n\n【32】*   Complex fractures that cannot be treated conservatively or compression fractures and burst fractures with impaired mechanical strength and neurological involvement require surgical intervention. It includes decompression surgery, which removes the bone or the fragments that compress the spinal cord and the nerve roots, which provides relief from the pressure. Spinal fusion surgery is recommended in some cases, which involves the removal of loose bony fragments and fusion of the remaining vertebrae, and immobilization through screws and implants. Rehabilitation therapy is carried out after four to six weeks.\n\n【33】What Are the Complications of Thoracolumbar Burst Fractures?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】**Complications of thoracolumbar fractures include**\n\n【35】*   Pressure sores and blood clots in the pelvic region and legs due to long periods of immobility or bed rest.\n\n【36】*   Long periods of inactivity of leg muscles can lead to deep vein thrombosis, which may progress to pulmonary embolism.\n\n【37】*   Bowel or bladder dysfunction.\n\n【38】**Complications of the surgery include**\n\n【39】*   Bleeding and infection at the surgical site.\n\n【40】*   Non-union or failure of the surgery.\n\n【41】*   Progressive forward rounding of the back (kyphosis) or failure in the spinal fusion (pseudoarthrosis).\n\n【42】*   Iatrogenic neurological injury caused due to over-manipulation during surgery.\n\n【43】**Conclusion**\n\n【44】Thoracolumbar burst fractures are fractures of the thoracic-lumbar region and may or may not be associated with neurological involvement. It is caused mainly due to vehicle accidents or falls from heights and is associated with severe pain, swelling, and loss of movement.

While it helped fight many disorders, the overuse of the medication caused an array of unwanted side effects. Steroid rosacea is one such complication of the excessive and unmonitored use of topical steroids. Fluorinated steroids, if applied continuously on the face, can cause a skin condition indistinguishable from rosacea called steroid-induced rosacea or ‘iatrosacea.’ It is characterized by centrofacial, periocular (around the eyes), and perioral (around the mouth) papules and pustules. If it is left unchecked, it can cause skin atrophy (wasting) and telangiectasia (widening of blood vessels).\n\n【2】What Is Steroid Rosacea?\n------------------------\n\n【3】Topical corticosteroid-induced rosacea-like dermatitis, or TCIRD, is a disease that occurs due to the prolonged and improper use of topical corticosteroids, or it can be a result of a rebound phenomenon that occurs when the use of topical corticosteroids is discontinued.\n\n【4】It typically occurs in the middle of the face. It is believed to be a variant of perioral or periorificial dermatitis. It should not be mistaken for steroid acne, which is caused by oral corticosteroids.\n\n【5】The main clinical manifestations include papules, pustules with a reddened area, and swollen skin.

The application of topical steroids for several weeks can result in redness in areas such as the eyelids, mid-forehead, cheeks, or chin. Clinically they appear as follows:\n\n【13】*   Small papules (bumps) or pustules. (pustules are pus-filled bumps).\n\n【14】*   The area may become itchy, scaly, or hot.\n\n【15】*   Telangiectasia can develop. It is the widening or enlargement of blood vessels, which are usually harmless but can be a symptom of other diseases.\n\n【16】*   Skin becomes highly sensitive.\n\n【17】*   The condition can flare up or worsen when the offending topical steroid is discontinued. This phenomenon is called rebound flare.\n\n【18】*   The primary lesions or eruptions are small discolorations on the skin (papules) or vesicles. When these bumps clear off, the area becomes red. If the topical steroid is still continued, the reddened area becomes inflamed and swollen (edematous). In some cases, the vesicles can be pustules or even nodules along with telangiectasia.\n\n【19】What Causes Steroid Rosacea?\n----------------------------\n\n【20】As the name suggests, steroid rosacea is caused by topical corticosteroids. It is not entirely understood why steroids cause this condition. A few proposed theories include:\n\n【21】*   The proliferation of microorganisms in the skin.\n\n【22】*   The proliferation of organisms such as Demodex or hair follicle mites.\n\n【23】*   Immune response to cytokine release.\n\n【24】*   Formation of new blood vessels or rebound vasodilation.\n\n【25】*   Steroid rosacea is less likely to occur when mild steroids are used; the incidence increases with the usage of strong steroids.\n\n【26】*   It is also less prevalent when steroids are applied less frequently.\n\n【27】*   Steroids inhibit the natural vasodilators. This can lead to vasoconstriction and the build-up of many metabolites, such as nitric oxide. Once the steroid is discontinued, the vasoconstrictive effect is ceased, and the blood vessels dilate more than the original diameter because of the accumulation of nitric oxide. This leads to erythema (redness), pruritus, and a burning sensation of the steroid rosacea.\n\n【28】How Does the Disease Progress?\n------------------------------\n\n【29】Steroids were introduced in 1951. At first, it was revolutionary. But with the introduction of new medicine came a new dermal condition. It has been given different names throughout the years, the latest being TCIRD (topical corticosteroid-induced rosacea-like dermatitis) since it describes the cause and appearance of the lesion.\n\n【30】A patient who has been prescribed a topical steroid for a certain condition responds well to the medication initially. But on continued and improper use of the topical steroid, they begin to develop rashes, which recur even when the drug is stopped. This condition of the development of rashes even when the medicine is discontinued is called the rebound phenomenon. The patients consult experts when the initial treating effect of the steroid is no longer found.\n\n【31】This condition often occurs when the patient seeks methods for flawless skin. Often the unmonitored use of over-the-counter products or self-treating of certain disorders causes this problem. Betamethasone valerate is the most common culprit in many of these cases, owing to the easy access and cost-effectiveness of the steroid.\n\n【32】**What Are the Other Complications of Topical Steroids on Facial Skin?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】*   In addition to steroid rosacea, topical steroid application on the face can have other adverse effects. Periorificial dermatitis is a less severe form of steroid-induced rash, which is characterized by small bumps around the lips, nose, and eyelids.\n\n【34】*   Steroid rosacea can also be confused with tinea faciei and tinea incognito.\n\n【35】*   Certain fungal infections can be masked by the use of topical steroids.\n\n【36】How to Manage Steroid Rosacea?\n------------------------------\n\n【37】*   Steroid rosacea mostly responds well to treatment. Associated telangiectasia may persist for some more time.\n\n【38】*   Management of the condition can be challenging in some cases as the skin barrier on the face may be compromised and intolerant to topical therapy. Discontinuation of the steroid is the ultimate solution, but it is not easy, as flare-ups can occur. In mild cases, tapering of the steroid or replacement with a less potent steroid is suggested along with the use of emollients and followed by the complete stoppage of the steroid. In severe cases, oral antibiotics may be necessary for the treatment plan.\n\n【39】**The Management Includes:**\n\n【40】*   Discontinuation of the topical steroids. The medication is withdrawn slowly to prevent or minimize flare-ups. The withdrawal is made by reducing the frequency of use of the steroid or replacing it with a less potent steroid.\n\n【41】*   Non-oily moisturizers are to be used.\n\n【42】*   Oral tetracyclines such as Doxycycline are prescribed. After the discontinuation of the steroid, drugs like Tetracycline, macrolides or non-steroidal topical formulations are used. The complete clearing of the lesions can take up to several months after the treatment has started.\n\n【43】*   Short-term use of topical Pimecrolimus cream is found helpful.\n\n【44】*   The persisting telangiectasia can be treated with laser therapy.\n\n【45】**Conclusion:**\n\n【46】Steroid rosacea or topical corticosteroid-induced rosacea-like dermatitis (TCIRD) is a skin condition that occurs due to the excessive and prolonged use of topical steroids. This condition is characterized by bumps, pustules, or vesicles on the mid-face, mid-forehead, chin, or cheeks. The discontinuation of the steroid can also cause flare-ups. The management of the condition requires slowly tapering the steroid and eventually ceasing the administration; in severe cases, oral antibiotics may be necessary.\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>*   Dermnet - Steroid rosacea  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/steroid-rosacea\n*   NIH - Steroid induced rosacea  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3088930/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is brought on by the infant's lungs not producing adequate surfactant. Around week 26 of pregnancy, the lungs produce a liquid called surfactant. The lungs produce more surfactant as the fetus develops. Most RDS cases affect infants who are delivered before 37 to 39 weeks. The likelihood of RDS after birth increases with infant prematurity. Full-term newborns rarely have the issue (after 39 weeks).\n\n【2】How Is Respiratory Distress Syndrome Caused?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Small air sacs in the lungs are protected from collapsing by a layer of surfactant. The air sacs must remain open for oxygen from the lungs to enter the blood and for carbon dioxide to be released into the lungs. Because their lungs are still developing, newborns with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) produce less surfactant than healthy infants. The infant's organs might not get enough oxygen as a result. If a full-term newborn has genetic defects that affect how their bodies manufacture surfactant, they may have RDS. RDS can affect other neonates, but preterm newborns are more likely to develop it.\n\n【4】What Are the Risk Factors of Respiratory Distress Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The respiratory distress syndrome risk factors include\n\n【6】*   A brother or sister who had RDS.\n\n【7】*   Diabetes in the mother.\n\n【8】*   Cesarean delivery or induction of labor before the baby is full-term.\n\n【9】*   Problems with the delivery that reduces blood flow to the baby.\n\n【10】*   Multiple pregnancies (twins or more).\n\n【11】*   Rapid labor.\n\n【12】*   Infection.\n\n【13】*   Prenatal ultrasonographic findings include oligohydramnios (decreased amniotic fluid for the gestational age) or structural lung abnormalities.\n\n【14】*   A newborn infant who is unwell at the time of delivery.\n\n【15】*   Hypothermia (abnormally low temperature).\n\n【16】What Are the Sign and Symptoms of RDS?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【17】The various signs and symptoms of respiratory distress syndrome are\n\n【18】*   **Tachypnea -** Respiratory rate greater than 60 breaths per minute.\n\n【19】*   **Cyanosis -** Bluish skin and mucous membrane discoloration, like around the mouth, inside the lips, and in fingernails.\n\n【20】*   **Grunting -** Every time the person exhales, a grunting (ugh) noise may be heard. The body uses this grunting to keep the air in the lungs to keep them open.\n\n【21】*   **Nasal Flaring -** Flaring (widening) of nostrils while breathing.\n\n【22】*   **Retraction -** With each breath, the chest seems to sink in beneath the breastbone, just below the neck, or both.\n\n【23】*   **Wheezing -** A tight, whistling, or melodic sound made with each breath, indicating a narrower (tighter) airway.\n\n【24】*   **Body Position -** While seated, a person may inadvertently lean forward to aid in taking deeper breaths.

Anemia.\n\n【105】11.  Polycythemia (increased red blood cells).\n\n【106】How Is Respiratory Distress Syndrome Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【107】Respiratory distress is common in preterm infants. To differentiate it from other breathing disorders, specific investigations are necessary.\n\n【108】*   **Chest X-Ray or Lung Imaging Test -** This shows a ‘ground glass’ appearance, a typical disease feature. It develops six to twelve hours after birth.\n\n【109】*   **Blood-Gas Analysis -** Shows low oxygen and excess acid in body fluids.\n\n【110】*   **Blood Test -** To rule out infection as a cause of breathing problems.\n\n【111】*   **Heart Test -** To check for a possible congenital heart defect.\n\n【112】How Is Respiratory Distress Treated?\n------------------------------------\n\n【113】Some common treatments for respiratory distress are\n\n【114】**Oxygen -** Babies with RDS need extra oxygen. Some ways to deliver oxygen are\n\n【115】1.  **Nasal Cannula -** A small tube with prongs is placed in the nostrils of the baby.\n\n【116】2.  **Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) -** Used to gently push oxygen into the lungs to maintain the air sacs in the open state.\n\n【117】**Ventilator -** Only the most severe RDS cases make use of this. A ventilator is a device that provides life support by doing the baby’s breathing for them. The device is attached to a breathing tube that enters the baby's windpipe through the mouth or nose. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is more prone to develop in infants who need ventilation. They might also experience health issues like lung or airway damage due to the breathing tube or ventilator.\n\n【118】**Surfactant -** To replenish what is missing, surfactant might be administered to the baby's lungs. This is injected directly into the windpipe through the breathing tube.\n\n【119】**Intravenous (IV) Catheter Treatments -** A very small tube (catheter) is inserted into one or more of the umbilical cord's blood vessels. The infant receives feeding, IV fluids, and medications in this manner. Blood samples are also drawn using this method.\n\n【120】**Medication -** Antibiotics are occasionally administered when an infection is detected. To help reduce pain during therapy, relaxing medications may be administered.\n\n【121】What Are the Consequences of Untreated RDS?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【122】Depending on how severe RDS is, they could also acquire one or more of the following medical conditions:\n\n【123】*   **Bleeding in the Brain -** Resulting in intellectual disabilities, cerebral palsy, and cognitive (higher brain functions involved in learning) delay.\n\n【124】*   **Lung Complications -** Pneumothorax (air leaking from the lungs into the chest cavity) or pulmonary hemorrhage (bleeding in the lungs).\n\n【125】*   **Vision -** Developmental problems (retinopathy of prematurity) and blindness.\n\n【126】*   **Infection -** Resulting in sepsis (a severe condition brought on by the body's excessive immunological reaction to a bacterial infection).\n\n【127】**Prognosis (Outlook) Of the Disease**\n\n【128】After birth, the condition frequently deteriorates for the first two to four days before gradually improving. With severe respiratory distress syndrome, some infants will pass away. This typically happens between days two and seven.\n\n【129】Long-term complications may develop due to the following:\n\n【130】*   Too much oxygen.\n\n【131】*   High pressure delivered to the lungs.\n\n【132】*   More severe disease or immaturity. RDS can be associated with inflammation that causes lung or brain damage.\n\n【133】*   Periods when the brain or other organs did not get enough oxygen.\n\n【134】How to Prevent Respiratory Distress in Newborns?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【135】Some precautions to avoid RDS are\n\n【136】*   **Preventing Premature Birth -** Neonatal RDS can be avoided by taking precautions to prevent early birth. Premature birth can be prevented with proper prenatal care and regular checks beginning as soon as a woman learns she is pregnant.\n\n【137】*   **Delivery Time -** The right delivery timing can help reduce the incidence of RDS. There may be a need for an induced delivery or cesarean. Before giving birth, a lab test can be performed to determine whether the baby's lungs are prepared. Unless medically required, induced or cesarean deliveries should be postponed until the infant is at least 39 weeks old or until testing reveals that its lungs are fully developed.\n\n【138】*   **Corticosteroid Therapy -** Corticosteroid medications can accelerate lung development before a baby is born. They are frequently administered to pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks who appear to be due any day. Further investigation is required if corticosteroids may also be advantageous for infants younger than 24 or older than 34 weeks. Sometimes, it could be possible to delay the start of labor and delivery until the steroid medication has had time to take effect. This therapy might lessen the severity of RDS. It also lowers the risk of additional prematurity-related problems. It will not eliminate the risks, though.\n\n【139】**Conclusion**\n\n【140】The best course of action will be guided by quickly improving newborns' ability to spot respiratory distress and knowing the physiologic abnormalities linked to several causes. Although preventing the occurrence is preferable, early diagnosis and treatment of the prevalent neonatal respiratory disorders will reduce short- and long-term problems and the associated infant mortality.\n\n【141】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【142】无关删除-1:<u>*   Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Newborn  \n    https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/conditions/respiratory-distress-syndrome-newborn\n*   Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001563.htm\n*   Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS)  \n    https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/respiratory-distress-syndrome</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

In stage 1 pressure ulcer, the ulcer is a red, blue, or purple tint and feels warm to the touch, burning, and itchy. If a stage 1 pressure ulcer is not treated correctly on time, it may develop into a stage 2 pressure ulcer. At this stage, the pressure ulcer breaks the superficial skin layers resembling an open blister, causing pain and discoloration.\n\n【2】Pressure ulcers are common in patients with limited mobility or underlying medical problems. Untreated stage 2 pressure ulcers can worsen, causing severe medical problems or may be fatal. Proper medical care can help elders to recover. Stage 2 pressure ulcers may indicate nursing care abuse or neglect.\n\n【3】What Are the Symptoms of Stage 2 Pressure Ulcers?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Stage 2 pressure ulcers are open, shallow, broken wounds with a red base. Intact or incompletely ruptured blisters may also be present with clear fluid or pus seeping from the affected area, and the skin to it adjacent may be discolored. It may involve both the dermis and epidermis of the skin.\n\n【5】Stage 2 bedsores are common in ankles and heels, back of the head, hip, shoulder blades, and tailbone. However, it can develop in any part of the body under constant pressure. Still, areas near bones are at a higher risk.\n\n【6】There is more significant pain in stage 2 bedsores than in stage 1 bedsores. The pain decreases as the sore worsens but becomes harder to treat, leading to fatal complications.\n\n【7】What Are the Causes of Stage 2 Pressure Ulcers?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Pressure ulcers can occur mainly due to three different forces:\n\n【9】*   **Prolonged Pressurev -** When a person applies constant pressure against the bony surface for a long time, it can result in a pressure ulcer. When this pressure goes beyond the tissue capillary pressure, the surrounding tissues deprive oxygen, leading to tissue necrosis.\n\n【10】*   **Shearv -** Shear happens when the deep fascia slides over the skeletal muscle, which can compress the blood vessels leading to ischemia and tissue necrosis.\n\n【11】*   **Frictionv -** Friction is the opposite of shear force. Friction causes microscopic and macroscopic tissue trauma when the patient moves through the support surface.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Is it normal to have bulging veins in arms and legs with pain?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Vascular Ulcers - Types, Symptoms, Risk Factors, Treatment, and Prevention</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Common Penile Disorders - Causes, Diagnosis, Prevention, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【13】Further, moisture from incontinence, wetness, or exudate increases the friction between the surface and the skin. It weakens the epithelial bonds making the skin more liable to pressure, shear, and friction damage.\n\n【14】Stage 1 pressure ulcers do not cause skin breaks, but disposing of the same area to any forces after an ulcer is formed can tear the skin, developing stage 2 pressure ulcers.\n\n【15】Who Is at Risk for Stage 2 Pressure Ulcers?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Patients with limited mobility, immobility, and bedridden patients. Elders with medical conditions like circulatory diseases and diabetes, atherosclerosis, spinal cord injury, neuropathy, infections. Patients who lack control over urination and defecation moisten the adjacent skin and damage the skin. Additionally, adult diapers trap waste, thus damaging skin if they are not changed frequently. Malnourishment causes anemia that can decrease a person's health and weight, which results in bedsores.\n\n【17】How Is a Stage 2 Pressure Ulcer Treated?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【18】Dressing over the ulcer keeps the ulcer dry and decreases the risk of infection.\n\n【19】Different dressings available in the market are:\n\n【20】*   Topical antimicrobials including Bacitracin, Bactroban, Cadexomer iodine, nanocrystalline silver, polysporin powder, silver sulfadiazine cream, silver impregnated hydrofiber, silver gel, sodium hypochlorite.\n\n【21】*   Alginates dressing.\n\n【22】*   Barrier dressings.\n\n【23】*   Activated charcoal dressings.\n\n【24】*   Collagen dressing.\n\n【25】*   Composite products.\n\n【26】*   Compression wraps.\n\n【27】*   Hydrophilic polyurethane foams.\n\n【28】*   Cotton, rayon, or polyester gauze packs.\n\n【29】*   Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) combined with pectin hydrocolloids.\n\n【30】*   Carboxymethylcellulose hydrofiber.\n\n【31】*   Hydrogels.\n\n【32】*   Sodium chloride impregnated dressings.\n\n【33】*   Petrolatum impregnated dressings.\n\n【34】*   Polyurethane or synthetic polymer sheets transparent films.\n\n【35】Aggressive irrigation with saline solution is done to clean the open wound. The damaged and dead tissues are debrided from the ulcer to promote healing. Nutritious Vitamin A and C, protein, zinc, and iron-rich diets should be given. Enough water intakes also play an essential role in healing. Reducing pressure on the ulcer area will prevent it from worsening and allow the skin to repair. Negative pressure wound therapy uses sub-atmospheric pressure to stimulate wound contraction, remove discharges, reduce swelling and increase blood flow.\n\n【36】How to Prevent Stage 2 Pressure Ulcers?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【37】Stage 2 pressure ulcers can be prevented when stage 1 pressure ulcers are treated early. Treatment includes removing pressure from the ulcer and keeping it clean and dry. Consult a physician if the ulcer does not fade in two to three days.\n\n【38】*   The patient should be repositioned every two hours.\n\n【39】*   Maintain the skin clean and dry.\n\n【40】*   Do not massage the bony prominences.\n\n【41】*   Use positioning devices to avoid continued pressure over the bony prominences.\n\n【42】*   Keep the bed head as low as possible to decrease the risk of shearing.\n\n【43】*   Keep bedspreads dry and without fold.\n\n【44】*   Use a pillow between legs when lying on the sides.\n\n【45】*   Do not directly position the trochanter.\n\n【46】What Is the Prognosis of a Stage 2 Pressure Ulcer?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Stage 2 pressure ulcers have a relatively good prognosis when treated on time. They usually heal in three days to three weeks when appropriately treated.\n\n【48】What Are the Complications From Stage 2 Pressure Ulcers?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】Stage 2 pressure ulcers, when left untreated, can advance into deeper skin tissues, resulting in stage 3 and 4 ulcers which are harder to treat and may be fatal. Infection in pressure ulcers can spread to the blood and bones, resulting in sepsis and osteomyelitis. When deeper tissues are involved, it may cause permanent tissue damage that may never heal completely even with treatment. Pressure ulcers increase the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs), amputations, and autonomic dysreflexia.\n\n【50】**Conclusion:**\n\n【51】Stage 2 pressure ulcers are open wounds on the epidermis of the skin. Proper care given when the stage 1 pressure ulcer is diagnosed can prevent progressing to stage 2 pressure ulcers. Frontline caregivers play an essential role in screening, assessing, and managing pressure ulcers. Healing and prevention of pressure ulcers in critically ill patients are crucial. Early referral and treatment improve the outcome of the risk of pressure ulcers.\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【53】无关删除-1:<u>*   Stage 2 sores  \n    https://www.nursinghomeabuse.org/nursing-home-abuse-injuries/bedsores/stage-2/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The human body comprises thousands of cells that divide rapidly and help in the growth of the body. Cancer occurs due to the uncontrolled division of the cells. If the cells remain confined to the organ, they are considered benign. On the contrary, if the cells spread to the other organs, they are said to be malignant or cancerous. There are genes present in the body that stimulate and inhibit the growth of cells. When the genes that prevent cell growth fail to function, or are defective, the growth of the cells increases resulting in tumors or cancer. It is because there is no one to stop the genes that allow cell growth. However, there are treatment options available to kill the defective cells or slow down their growth, brachytherapy being one of them. It is a procedure in which a special material is placed into the body to destroy the cells and slow down their growth.\n\n【2】Is Brachytherapy Similar to External Radiation Therapy?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The other name for brachytherapy is internal radiation therapy. It is completely different from external radiation therapy. In brachytherapy, the surgeon places radioactive material in the body to kill the cancer cells. Therefore, the radiation is received by only the organ or the area affected by cancer. Whereas in external radiation therapy, a machine is used to deliver the radiation to the tumor or cancer. As the radiation passes through the skin, there is a chance that the other healthy organs also receive it and get damaged. The side effects of brachytherapy are less compared to external radiation therapy.\n\n【4】What Are the Different Types of Brachytherapy?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Brachytherapy implants are classified according to the time up to which they remain in the body. The different types of brachytherapy implants have been described in the table below:\n\n【6】Why Is Brachytherapy Done?\n--------------------------\n\n【7】Brachytherapy aims to release radiation and kill the cells showing uncontrolled growth. It is used to treat cancer of the following organs:\n\n【8】*   Brain cancer.\n\n【9】*   Liver cancer (mainly bile duct cancer).\n\n【10】*   Breast cancer.\n\n【11】*   Cervical cancer.\n\n【12】*   Lung cancer.\n\n【13】*   Skin cancer.\n\n【14】*   Endometrial cancer.\n\n【15】*   Eye cancer.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Gynecological Cancers - a Multidisciplinary Approach</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Retinoblastoma - Causes, Complications, Prevention, Diagnosis, Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Pterygium (Surfer’s Eye) - Causes, Prevention and Treatment Options</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Head and neck cancers.\n\n【17】*   Pancreatic cancer.\n\n【18】*   Prostate cancer.\n\n【19】*   Vaginal cancer.\n\n【20】*   Rectal cancer.\n\n【21】*   Esophageal cancer.\n    </u>\n\n【22】What Are the Benefits of Brachytherapy?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【23】Brachytherapy is a commonly used procedure to treat cancer. The advantages of brachytherapy are listed below:\n\n【24】1.  It is one of the most effective treatments as the radiation is delivered directly to the organ affected by cancer.\n\n【25】2.  The healthy cells of the body are not damaged, so the side effects are minimal.\n\n【26】3.  The patient need not stay in the hospital for long, unlike other procedures.\n\n【27】4.  The time required to complete the procedure is short, lasting from a few minutes to five days.\n\n【28】5.  The patient need not visit the hospital repeatedly after the procedure.\n\n【29】6.  The recovery is completed in five to seven days so that the patient can return to his job quickly.\n\n【30】How Does the Patient Prepare for Brachytherapy?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Brachytherapy is a procedure used to treat cancer in the body's internal organs. The following things are done before brachytherapy:\n\n【32】*   The doctor explains the procedure as a whole. If the patient is willing to undergo the same, he must sign a consent form.\n\n【33】*   The patient should also inform the doctor about his medications or any allergies or disorders he suffers from. For example, the doctor might ask the patient to stop taking drugs like Aspirin and Ibuprofen before the procedure, as they can cause excessive bleeding.\n\n【34】*   A medication known as a laxative is usually given before the procedure to allow bowel movement.\n\n【35】*   The patient should not eat anything a few hours before the surgery.\n\n【36】*   The doctor might ask the patient to undergo the following imaging test before the procedure to get an idea about the exact location and spread of the cancer:\n\n【37】    1.  **Computerized Tomography (CT) Scans** - In this procedure, the patient is laid on his back on a table that slips into a tunnel-like cylindrical device where the X-rays are taken. It is one of the most commonly used diagnostic methods because it provides three-dimensional (3D) images of the organs affected by cancer.\n*   Before the commencement of the procedure, anesthesia will be administered to the patient so that he falls asleep and the procedure is carried out smoothly without any pain or inconvenience.\n\n【38】What Happens in Brachytherapy?\n------------------------------\n\n【39】The procedure depends upon the type of brachytherapy and cancer. A small tube, known as a catheter, might be inserted to place the radioactive material in the body. The material can also be placed with a device known as the applicator. The different techniques for placing brachytherapy include:\n\n【40】*   **Interstitial Brachytherapy** - In this procedure, a device or applicator containing the radioactive material is placed into the body tissues. This technique is mainly used for breast and prostate cancer. The devices that deliver the radiation to the body tissues are balloons, wires, and seeds that are small as a rice grain. The device is placed by hand or with the help of a computerized machine. It can remain in place for one to seven days if the patient is undergoing low-dose brachytherapy. On the contrary, The device remains in place for 15 to 20 minutes if the patient undergoes high-dose therapy.\n\n【41】*   **Intracavitary Brachytherapy** - As the name suggests, the applicator or the device that contains the radioactive material is placed into the body cavities. For example, the radioactive device can be placed in the vagina to treat cervical cancer or in the trachea (windpipe) to treat lung cancer. The device that delivers the radiation is like a tube that fits into the cavities of the body. It can be placed by hand, a computerized machine, or a catheter. The tube placed at the time of surgery, known as a catheter, can be filled with radioactive material each time. The radioactive device remains in the body for a few minutes, days, or permanently depending upon the type of brachytherapy and cancer.\n\n【42】*   **Episcleral Brachytherapy** - It is a procedure used to treat eye melanoma and retinoblastoma. Melanoma occurs in the eyes when the cells producing melanin pigments are damaged due to cancer. Retinoblastoma is also a type of eye cancer wherein the cells forming the retina are damaged. In episcleral brachytherapy, the radiation device is attached to the eye to treat eye cancer.\n\n【43】What Happens After Brachytherapy?\n---------------------------------\n\n【44】After the treatment, the patient is taken to the recovery room to allow the anesthesia to wear off. If the patient has undergone high-dose brachytherapy, the catheter or the applicator is removed, and the patient does not emit any radiation. However, the following things need to be kept in mind after the procedure:\n\n【45】1.  The doctor will prescribe painkillers after removing the catheter.\n\n【46】2.  If the patient has undergone permanent or low-dose brachytherapy, the applicator remains in place for a few days or permanently.\n\n【47】3.  The patient will be emitting radiation, so he needs to stay away from people, especially children and pregnant women.\n\n【48】4.  The doctor or the nurse will treat and provide all the care to the patient but from a distance because of the radiation device attached to the body.\n\n【49】5.  Friends and relatives will not be allowed to meet the patient because of the risk of radiation exposure.\n\n【50】6.  The patient is allowed to meet someone only for half an hour and from a distance.\n\n【51】7.  Consult the doctor before going to work or doing other activities.\n\n【52】8.  The patient must immediately report to the doctor if he experiences the following:\n\n【53】    *   Diarrhea.\n\n【54】    *   Urine leakage.\n\n【55】    *   Respiratory difficulties.\n\n【56】    *   Vomiting and loss of appetite.\n\n【57】    *   Stomach problems.\n\n【58】What Are the Complications of Brachytherapy?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【59】The complications depend upon the type of brachytherapy and cancer that has been treated. The complications of brachytherapy are listed below:\n\n【60】*   The patient might leak urine (urinary incontinence) before reaching the toilet if he has been treated for prostate cancer.\n\n【61】*   The presence of pain and burning sensation while urinating are commonly seen.\n\n【62】*   The radiation might damage the nerves and blood vessels of the pelvis and cause erectile dysfunction. The penis cannot remain erect as the blood supply has been blocked due to radiation.\n\n【63】*   Brachytherapy also causes stomach problems like diarrhea, pain, and gas in the stomach.\n\n【64】*   If brachytherapy has been used to treat cervical, vaginal, or prostate cancers, bowel movements get affected, and the patient might suffer from constipation.\n\n【65】*   The patient might experience hair loss if he has been treated for head and neck cancer.\n\n【66】*   The radiation might destroy the healthy cells of the mouth, causing ulcers and mouth sores.\n\n【67】*   The patient feels tired throughout the day and cannot eat anything due to stomach problems.\n\n【68】*   If brachytherapy has been done to treat lung cancer, shortness of breath is one of the most common complications.\n\n【69】**Conclusion**\n\n【70】Brachytherapy is used to treat cancer in multiple body organs. When the cells present in the body proliferate rapidly, cancer occurs. There are many options available to treat cancer, but brachytherapy has become a choice of the doctors and the patient. It is because the procedure is minimally invasive, the healing is quick, and the radiation emitted from the device only targets the defective cells, not the healthy ones. It has been commonly seen that people lose hope when they are diagnosed with cancer. Brachytherapy is a boon for such patients because it saves them from long hospital stays and strong drugs that cause side effects. The devices used for brachytherapy are designed in such a way that they deliver radiation only to the organ affected by cancer. Hence, the healthy tissues of the body are saved from getting damaged. Therefore, the patient must not lose hope and consult the doctor immediately if he is diagnosed with cancer. Brachytherapy is a simple procedure with great results and minimal side effects.\n\n【71】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【72】无关删除-1:<u>*   Brachytherapy to Treat Cancer  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/radiation-therapy/brachytherapy#types-of-brachytherapy\n*   Brachytherapy  \n    https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/brachy\n*   Getting Internal Radiation Therapy (Brachytherapy)  \n    https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/radiation/internal-radiation-therapy-brachytherapy.html\n*   Brachytherapy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562190/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

FHL is a unipennate muscle that attaches to the tendon obliquely, and the muscle fibers converge to attach to the tendon on one side. The primary function of flexor hallucis longus is flexion of the great toe joints. It also has additional functions such as foot inversion and plantar flexion. Extensor hallucis longus performs an antagonistic function to the flexor hallucis longus.\n\n【2】The majority of flexor hallucis longus originates from the distal two-thirds of the posterior surface of the fibula, and the remaining fibers arise from the interosseous membrane, posterior intermuscular septum, and fascia of the tibialis posterior muscle. They run down the fibular side of the leg and then cross over the posterior part of the ankle and reach the sole, where it inserts into the hallux (great toe). The flexor hallucis longus is a tibial nerve branch with a cutaneous supply from root S2. They receive their blood supply from the peroneal branch of the posterior tibial artery.\n\n【3】How Is the Flexor Hallucis Longus Injury Examined Clinically?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Clinical examination is the initial evaluation performed on posteromedial ankle pain for flexor hallucis longus injury. First, the knee flexion performs this at 90 degrees, relaxing the gastrocnemius. Then the knee is extended by plantar flexion of the great toe and ankle with the physician palpating behind the medial malleolus. This helps differentiate tendinitis from the cause of hallux rigidus. Some triggering factors of hallux rigidus are the thickening of the tendon slips through the fibro-osseous tunnel and the hypertrophy of flexor hallucis longus at the musculotendinous junction.\n\n【5】What Are the Possible Injuries Associated With Flexor Hallucis Longus?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】*   **Tendinopathy** - It is the degeneration of the collagen protein of the tendon.\n\n【7】*   **Tenosynovitis** - Swelling or infection of the peritendinous tissue.\n\n【8】*   **Complete or Partial Tendon Tear** - Partial tear refers to the tear of only the part of the tendon. A complete tear is sometimes associated with tendon retraction.\n\n【9】*   **Tendon Dislocation** - Complete or incomplete dislocation.\n\n【10】*   **Tendon Entrapment** \\- Tethering the flexor hallucis longus tendon under the flexor retinaculum.\n\n【11】What Imaging Techniques Are Used to Interpret Flexor Hallucis Longus Injury?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】**Radiography:**\n\n【13】*   Conventional radiography can show the soft tissue swelling of the ankle at its posteromedial aspect. In addition, fractures of the distal medial malleolus, calcaneus, and os trigonum are seen in flexor hallucis longus tendinopathy, partial or complete tears, dislocation, or entrapment. Though radiographs do not directly show the flexor hallucis longus injury, they can show the ancillary findings such as fractures and swelling, which helps detect the damage.\n\n【14】*   There might be a chance of false-positive results with soft tissue swelling, which can also occur with hematoma. Therefore, conventional radiography requires additional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI to confirm the injury.\n\n【15】**Computed Tomography (CT):**\n\n【16】*   The computed tomography scan can locate the presence, size, location, and anatomy of flexor hallucis longus and the presence of fluid in the synovial sheath. Usually, the tendon appears round or slightly oval with intermediate density. In about 20 percent of healthy individuals, fluid may be found in the tendon sheath.\n\n【17】*   Discontinuity or complete absence of the tendon indicates tendon tear with refraction. Thickening or attenuation is suggestive of tendinopathy or partial tear. Increased fluid in tendon sheath in CT scan highly indicates flexor hallucis longus entrapment.\n\n【18】*   Fractures associated with the tendon injury, os trigonum, and foreign bodies are clearly visible in the CT scan.\n\n【19】**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):**\n\n【20】*   MRI can visualize the intactness of the fibers, the size of the tendon, abnormal signal intensity in tendons, and the surrounding fluid collection. It can also visualize inflammation, contusion, bone marrow edema, and nondisplaced fractures. T2 weighted fat-saturated fast spin-echo and T1 weighted sequences of the ankle are used to evaluate the flexor hallucis longus tendon injury. In addition, it can identify tendinopathy due to direct irritation or anatomic variant. Direct irritation appears as cystic changes, irregular fraying, and nodular enlargement.\n\n【21】*   Partial tendon tears appear as fusiform tendon thickening and hyperintense on T2 weighted fat-saturated MRI.\n\n【22】*   A Complete tendon tear is shown as an area of fluid signal intensity between the torn ends. Soft tissue swelling and edema are also visible.\n\n【23】*   MRI easily identifies tendon dislocation as the tendon slips to the posterior intertubercular groove. Sometimes MRI cannot differentiate the abscess, tendon masses, or flexor hallucis longus injury. There might be a chance of a false-negative report as the intermittent dislocation is not visible.\n\n【24】**Ultrasonography:**\n\n【25】*   Ultrasonography is commonly used to evaluate Achilles tendon injury. However, the posterior medial location of flexor hallucis longus makes the imaging more challenging. Sometimes, the transverse and longitudinal views at the medial malleolus level visualize the tendon's size, location, and echogenicity.\n\n【26】*   The fluid collection appears as a low echogenic area surrounding the ankle joint or tendon. A thickened tendon in ultrasonography is suggestive of tendinopathy.\n\n【27】*   A Tendon tear is shown as the complete absence or retraction of the tendon and a fluid-filled space between the end of the tendon.\n\n【28】*   Tendon entrapment usually occurs in three possible sites: proximally within the fibro-osseous tunnel, inferiorly into the posterior aspect of the sustentaculum tali, and distally between the two sesamoids at the base of the phalanx of the great toe.\n\n【29】**Conclusion:**\n\n【30】The radiographs cannot visualize the tendons, so they are not an effective diagnostic tool in flexor hallucis longus injury. Ultrasound helps determine the intermediate dislocation of the flexor hallucis longus tendon, which is not evident in magnetic resonance imaging. Fracture of the sustentaculum tali results in the trapping of flexor hallucis longus, which requires reconstructive surgery. In addition, MRI can visualize the partial tendon tear effectively, whereas a CT scan can show the complete tears with the ends of the torn retracted.\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>*   Flexor hallucis longus tendon injury in dancers and nondancers  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9677077/\n*   Subcutaneous rupture of the flexor hallucis longus tendon: a case report  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22153296/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

F-75 and F-100 are classic examples of therapeutic formula milk now used by the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), Action Against Hunger, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Concern Worldwide, Valid International, and among other organizations that use them on a broader scale to counteract severe malnutrition among vulnerable populations\n\n【6】However, these brands, F-75 and F-100 use only in therapeutic feeding programs, should ideally be restricted solely to the treatment of malnutrition or malnourished children. They should not be misused in otherwise healthy infants in a hospital or clinical setting. Their use and dosage must also be monitored by registered healthcare providers and pediatricians in that setting. Nutritionists also do not recommend therapeutic milk that may be unsuitable for long-term feeding, especially in well-nourished children who receive the necessary and essential nutrients from their mother's milk and dietary sources.\n\n【7】What Is the Rationale Behind Its Use?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【8】Severely malnourished children or infants do not have the potential to tolerate even normal amounts of protein, sodium, or higher amounts of fat. In fact, the infant mortality rate is high according to case records that show a possibility of infant death when provided with excessive protein or sodium intake. Newborn children also require glucose as an essential requirement, so they must be given a diet that is fundamentally low in protein and sodium and higher in carbohydrates. F-75 therapeutic powder is designed specifically for mixing with milk to meet the child's needs without overwhelming the body's systems, especially in the initial stages of treatment for child malnutrition. The use of F-75 can not only prevent malnutrition-related deaths but can also be eventually substituted with F-100, which provides adequate nutritional content, approximately 75 kilocalorie and 0.9 gram protein per 100 milliliters, in order to rebuild wasted tissues in the infant.\n\n【9】As soon as the child is stabilized, the pediatrician or healthcare provider who has given F-75 will suggest the intake of F-100, which is used as a 'catch-up' formula. F-100 contains even more calories and enough protein to meet the infant's needs at this stage, with nearly 100 kilocalorie energy and approximately 2.9 gram protein per 100 milliliters being deemed most suitable. F-100 recipes also have the added advantage of not requiring any cooking (as they do not contain cereal flour). F-100 contains essential minerals such as potassium and magnesium that help rectify electrolyte imbalances in the child. Most mineral mixes are included in both F-75 and F-100 to correct electrolyte irregularities. The mineral mix is ideally prepared in the hospital pharmacy, but commercial products such as Combined Mineral Vitamin Mix (CMV) are also available, which are crucial in combination with therapeutic milk to provide the child with necessary minerals.\n\n【10】Vitamins are also essential ingredients that may improve therapeutic efficacy in milk and can be added to the feed. Usually, most children are given multivitamin drops soon after birth. These preparations typically do not contain iron because formula feeds do not include iron. Similarly, multivitamin preparations for infants should also exclude iron.\n\n【11】How Are Therapeutic Feeds Prepared in Clinical Settings?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】F75 and F100 are also commercially available in prepackaged form and already contain all the required essential nutrients. In a hospital setting, these milks are prepared by adding one large packet of prepackaged F75 or F100 to approximately 2 liters of water, depending on the number of children being treated. If fewer children are being treated, smaller volumes can be used. The F-100 bag usually contains the appropriate quantity of dry extract that needs to be diluted in 2 liters of boiled water, resulting in nearly 2.4 liters of high-energy milk.\n\n【13】What Is the Impact of Therapeutic Feeds on Public Welfare and Research?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】In 1994, Action Against Hunger (ACF) pioneered the use of F-100 milk formula in the treatment of children with severe and acute malnutrition symptoms. In 1997, French medical researchers through the company Nutriset succeeded in designing and supplying a nutrient-dense therapeutic formula for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition, which gained further popularity in the market. For the last two decades, this formula has been successfully used in therapeutic feeding centers to help hospitalized children overcome their nutrition-based deficiencies and systemic health issues.\n\n【15】The Scientific Committee of Action Against Hunger’s, which pioneered the F-100 therapeutic milk formula, widely recommends it, and most major humanitarian aid organizations use it to treat children suffering from acute malnutrition. The positive impact of these therapeutic milks on societal welfare is evident as they have successfully reduced the global mortality rate caused by malnourishment in children (especially those severely malnourished). Research also shows that the mortality rate for children under the age of five has been reduced from 25 percent to five percent after the introduction of therapeutic milks for commercial hospital use.\n\n【16】**Conclusion:**\n\n【17】Thus, Formula 75 and Formula 100 are specially designed therapeutic milk products used to treat infants suffering from moderate to severe malnutrition. These therapeutic formula products must, therefore, be used in re-nutrition centers and pediatric settings only under medical supervision.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "5c7fa15e-a6cd-4ea7-91f1-d0335152dbfa", "title": "Link Between Psoriatic Arthritis and PCOS", "text": "【0】Link Between Psoriatic Arthritis and PCOS\nWhat Is the Link Between PCOS and Psoriatic Arthritis (PA)?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【1】Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder in women and is identified by anovulation (absence of egg release during ovulation). Psoriatic arthritis (PA) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory condition characterized by arthritis (inflammation of the joints). Individuals with PA typically also get affected by psoriasis. However, PA without psoriasis is not uncommon.\n\n【2】Women with PCOS and PA have similar comorbidities like metabolic syndrome (caused due to insulin resistance), dyslipidemia (imbalance in lipid metabolism), hyperandrogenism (excess male hormones), obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Because of these similarities and evidential reasoning, it is thought that females with psoriasis and PA in their reproductive period are at a higher risk for PCOS.\n\n【3】The common pathway that links PCOS and PA is unclear, but factors like genetics, inflammation, and their association with other diseases are thought to influence their combined occurrence.\n\n【4】What Is the Role of Genetics in PCOS and PA?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【5】PCOS is an extremely heterogenetic complex condition; gene mutations (alterations) are responsible for steroid hormone biosynthesis or androgen synthesis, or insulin and leptin metabolism can lead to PCOS.\n\n【6】Psoriasis is also a multifactorial disease influenced by several genes. So far, thirteen main chromosomal loci (PSORS1-13) have been identified as related to psoriasis. Also, psoriasis is identified as a polygenetic inherited disease due to gene polymorphism in the immune system and keratinocyte biology.\n\n【7】The genetic link between PCOS and PT is a gene called RARB. This gene encodes a protein called thyroid-steroid hormone receptor - a receptor for retinoic acid, the active form of vitamin A. It is important for cell differentiation and growth. Apart from encoding for the receptor, the RARB gene also promotes the genes - StAR, CYP17A1, and HSD3B2 - involved in androgen production.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【9】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-3:<u>Can PCOS cause irregular periods?</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-3:<u>Will PCOS delay pregnancy?</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-3:<u>Having PCOS since I was young. Will I be able to conceive naturally?</u>\n\n【13】Female patients with psoriasis and PT have often been prescribed retinoid acid derivatives as part of the treatment. These derivatives trigger the RARB gene, which concomitantly triggers androgen production. Excess androgen production will lead to hyperandrogenism, one of the key pathogenesis factors for developing PCOS.\n\n【14】PCOS and PT can also be caused due to mutations in the insulin gene (INS) or insulin-receptor gene (INSR). They can also be caused due to genetic alteration in the insulin-mediated pathways. All of these mutations are capable of causing insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases, all of which are the precipitating factors for PCOS and PT.\n\n【15】How is Inflammation Related to PCOS and PA?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【16】PCOS is a proinflammatory condition that induces low-grade inflammation due to ovarian dysfunction and fibrosis. Women with PCOS have elevated levels of IL6 (interleukin 6). IL6 is a soluble mediator with a pleiotropic effect on inflammation, immune response, and hematopoiesis.\n\n【17】The main factor in the development of psoriasis and PA is the cooperation of T cells, keratinocytes, and dendritic cells in the lesion area on the skin. The T cells that are activated in the psoriatic plaques are divided into two groups:\n\n【18】1.  Th1 - These are responsible for the production of cytokines (proteins that control the growth and activity of other immune cells).\n\n【19】2.  Th2 - These are involved in the production of non-inflammatory cytokines.\n\n【20】The myeloid dendritic cells activate the T cells by releasing IL-23 and IL- 12. The activated T cells produce IL-7, IL-22, interferon (INF)- γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TNF, IL-23, and IL-17 are the key factors in developing psoriasis and PA.\n\n【21】A proinflammatory cytokine, known as TNF-ɑ, also plays a role in the inflammatory course of PCOS and PA. It is a multifunctional protein that affects lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and endothelial function, all of which can trigger PCOS and PA.\n\n【22】Are PCOS and PA Related to Any Other Medical Conditions?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】PCOS is an endocrine disorder, and PA is an immune-mediated skin condition. The clinical features of each condition are different, but their genetic background and chronic inflammatory process show a link between both conditions. Other conditions resembling these conditions are diabetes, cardiovascular conditions like myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis, and metabolic syndrome.\n\n【24】**1\\. Diabetes** - Women withPCOS are more likely to develop a wide spectrum of dysglycemic conditions like glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to women with a healthy body mass index. This is attributed to the common pathogenic pathways linking the two entities, such as insulin resistance. Both diabetes and PA share overlapping pathophysiology. The most common pathophysiologic mechanism relating to both is the genetic mechanism. In recent years, it has been evident that both conditions share overlapping genes (PTPN22, ST6GAL1, JAZF1) and susceptibility loci.\n\n【25】**2\\. Cardiovascular Conditions** \\- Women with PCOS are at a higher risk of cardiovascular conditions due to underlying pathophysiologies like lipid/glucose altered metabolism, hypertension, and systemic inflammatory conditions that are accessible by markers such as VES (vascular endothelial system), TNF-ɑ, cytokines, and C-reactive protein.\n\n【26】Patients with PA and psoriasis are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular conditions due to common inflammatory pathways, secretion of adipokines, insulin resistance, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, microparticles, and hypercoagulability.\n\n【27】**3\\. Metabolic Syndrome** - Women with PCOS are more predisposed to metabolic syndrome. This is because the abnormalities (like insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hyperandrogenism) that cause PCOS are also responsible for metabolic syndrome. The pathophysiology linking PA and psoriasis to metabolic syndrome are overlapping inflammatory pathways and genetic predisposition. The genes responsible for shared genetic susceptibility are PSORS2-4, CDKAL1, and ApoE4.\n\n【28】What Is the Treatment for PCOS and PA?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【29】Although both conditions share common etiologies, there is no common treatment. Both conditions get exacerbated with obesity, and reducing weight will have relief to a certain extent, but both of them should be addressed individually to prevent severe complications.\n\n【30】1.  Treatment for PCOS involves medication like Clomid (an estrogen receptor modulator), and gonadotropins, both stimulating ovulation. Apart from this, individuals with PCOS can also benefit from Metformin, which lowers insulin and testosterone levels.\n\n【31】2.  Treatment for PA and psoriasis include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, biologics (such as Remicade and Humira), and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (like Methotrexate and Sulfasalazine).\n\n【32】**Conclusion:**\n\n【33】PCOS is common in patients with PA and psoriasis, because of which there is a negative impact on the clinical course of the former condition. Genetic, inflammatory, and metabolic disorders contribute to this mechanism. Understanding the exact etiology of PCOS and its association with PA will help devise common treatment options, and better outcomes and studies are underway to understand it.\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【35】无关删除-1:<u>*   Risk of Psoriasis in Patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A National Population-Based Cohort Study  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7357083/\n*   Psoriasis and polycystic ovary syndrome: a new link in different phenotypes  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26115053/\n*   Polycystic Ovary Syndrome in Psoriasis Patients: A Case – Controlled Study  \n    http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.ajdv.20200904.03.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

They are predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of human beings and animals. Streptococcus gallolyticus was formerly known as Streptococcus Bovis. They are the main causative organism of septicemia and infective endocarditis in the elderly population and immunocompromised individuals. It has also been found to cause colorectal cancer (CRC) and liver disease.\n\n【2】Less common infections include:\n\n【3】*   Urinary tract infections.\n\n【4】*   Meningitis (inflammation of the membranes of the brain).\n\n【5】*   Neonatal sepsis (infection of an infant’s blood).\n\n【6】*   Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal wall cover).\n\n【7】*   Septic arthritis (joint infection).\n\n【8】*   Vertebral osteomyelitis (infection of the backbone).\n\n【9】Streptococcus Bovis mostly cause group D streptococcal infections. One of the unique characteristics of Streptococcus Bovis is its ability to grow in bile but not in 6.5 % sodium chloride.\n\n【10】What Is the Pathophysiology of Group D Streptococcus Infection?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Bacterial infections usually are not thought to be a direct cause of cancer. However, bacteria are found to be associated with cancer by two mechanisms: chronic inflammation and the production of cancer-causing substances. It has been found that bacteria cause cancer by producing toxic by-products of certain metabolism in the body.\n\n【12】Streptococcus Bovis enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract. In some cases, the urinary tract, liver, mouth, and throat can also be the source of infection. Streptococcus Bovis bacteremia is mostly associated with cancer or precancerous lesions of the colon. Bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. The bacteria have also been found in the stools of such patients.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【15】Stillbirth - Types, Causes, Diagnosis and Prevention\n\n【16】I have severe throat pain. Please help.\n\n【17】Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic Heart Disease\n\n【18】Streptococcus Bovis has also been associated with noncancerous as well as cancerous diseases of the colon. Relationships between bacteremia or endocarditis and chronic liver disease have also been reported. In a few rare cases, gastric cancer has also been associated with Streptococcus Bovis bacteremia. Recently WHO considered bacteria as possible cancer-causing agents.\n\n【19】What Is the Epidemiology of Group D Streptococcus Infection?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program does not list group D Streptococcus among the ten most common organisms causing bacteremia in the United States. According to the SCOPE program, streptococci was around six percent of all the blood culture tests in thirty U.S hospitals.\n\n【21】Streptococcus Bovis was around 2.4 % among the other streptococci bacteria. In 1997, a review of the international collaboration on endocarditis merged database (ICE-MD) found that Streptococcus Bovis was responsible for around 16.7 % of all streptococcal-caused infective endocarditis in the United States.\n\n【22】Internationally, SENTRY data shows that Streptococcus Bovis was found in 1.3 % and 1.6 % cases of streptococcal bacteremia in Canada and Latin America, respectively. In a German study, 177 cases of infective endocarditis were reported between 1983 and 1996, out of which twenty-two cases were caused by Streptococcus Bovis. Recent studies have found an association between infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus Bovis, mainly in France and neighboring countries of southern Europe.\n\n【23】What Causes Group D Streptococcus Infections?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Group D streptococci and other similar bacteria belong to the family streptococcaceae. Group D streptococci, at times, are also referred to as Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus equinus complex. Streptococcus Bovis has recently been named streptococcus gallolyticus. Streptococcus has further been classified into Streptococcus Bovis-I and Streptococcus Bovis-II. Streptococcus Bovis-I is commonly associated with endocarditis (inflammation of the inner lining of the heart valves and chambers) and cancerous or noncancerous injuries. Streptococcus Bovis-II is commonly associated with bacteremia of the liver and related structures.\n\n【25】What Are the Clinical Features of Group D Streptococcus Infections?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Streptococcus Bovis infection generally presents with bacteremia and fever.\n\n【27】The signs and symptoms of endocarditis caused by Streptococcus Bovis include:\n\n【28】**1\\. Presence Of Heart Murmurs -** The extra noise heard during a heartbeat. It is heard when the blood does not flow through the heart smoothly. These murmurs develop with time.\n\n【29】**2\\. Splinter Hemorrhages -** These are thin reddish-brown lines of blood under the nail.\n\n【30】**3\\. Conjunctival Petechiae -** Red or purple spots on the conjunctiva.\n\n【31】**4\\. Osler Nodules -** These are red-purple, tender nodules on the skin.\n\n【32】**5\\. Janeway lesions -** These are non-tender, bleeding nodules on the skin.\n\n【33】**6\\. Roth Spots -** These are reddish spots on the retina of the eye.\n\n【34】**7\\. Embolism -** Small dislodged particles blocking an artery.\n\n【35】**8\\. Anorexia -** is an eating disorder.\n\n【36】**9\\. Septic Infarction Or Vascular Occlusion -** It is the blockage of an artery.\n\n【37】**10\\. Kidney Failure -** Is caused by immune-complex glomerulonephritis.\n\n【38】**11\\. Cerebral Hemorrhage** is caused by a ruptured mycotic aneurysm (infection of the blood vessel wall).\n\n【39】12\\. Weight loss.\n\n【40】How Are Group D Streptococcal Infections Diagnosed?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】**Laboratory Tests Include:**\n\n【42】*   Complete blood count.\n\n【43】*   Blood cultures - A positive blood culture test usually comes during the first 24 to 48 hours.\n\n【44】*   Electrolyte evaluation.\n\n【45】*   Creatinine level.\n\n【46】*   Liver function tests.\n\n【47】**Radiology:**\n\n【48】*   Echocardiography.\n\n【49】*   Colonoscopy - This is done to find out the cancerous areas of the colon.\n\n【50】*   Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) - It is used to detect the presence of cancerous areas in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.\n\n【51】*   Liver ultrasound and CT scanning - It is done in case of liver disease.\n\n【52】**Other Tests Include:**\n\n【53】MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) testing - In case the organism is antibiotic resistant, an antimicrobial susceptibility test or MIC testing is required.\n\n【54】How Are Group D Streptococcal Infections Treated?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】*   Most Streptococcus Bovis are susceptible to Penicillin.\n\n【56】*   Intravenous administration of Penicillin is effective if given for four weeks.\n\n【57】*   For moderate antibiotic susceptibility, Penicillin and Gentamicin are administered for four weeks and two weeks, respectively.\n\n【58】*   Surgery is recommended in case of heart failure or complicated endocarditis.\n\n【59】*   Mycotic aneurysm clipping may be indicated after cerebral arteriography.\n\n【60】*   Colon or liver surgery can be done if required.\n\n【61】Medications are used to eliminate the infection, prevent complications, and reduce the mortality risk.\n\n【62】*   Penicillin G.\n\n【63】*   Ceftriaxone.\n\n【64】*   Vancomycin.\n\n【65】*   Gentamicin.\n\n【66】**Conclusion**\n\n【67】Streptococcus Bovis/gallolyticus are bacteria that belong to the group D streptococci. They are most commonly found in the intestines of healthy individuals. They are associated with liver disease, meningitis, endocarditis, and colorectal cancer. Streptococcus Bovis was renamed streptococcus gallolyticus in 2003. It is highly sensitive to Penicillin. As a precaution, patients with Streptococcus bovis infection with or without endocarditis should undergo a check for gastrointestinal cancer. Endocarditis caused by Streptococcus is a severe infection. It is highly fatal if left untreated. The increased mortality risk is related to the severity of the infection and the presence of other underlying diseases.\n\n【68】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【69】无关删除-1:<u>*   An Update on the Streptococcus bovis Group: Classification, Identification, and Disease Associations  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4922088/\n*   An Overview on Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus Complex Isolates: Identification to the Species/Subspecies Level and Antibiotic Resistance  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6386949/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

A heart transplant is a treatment modality that is not very common. A heart transplant is generally reserved for those patients who are not in a condition to improve their cardiovascular system through medications or alternative surgeries.\n\n【2】The donor’s heart is a healthy and functioning heart approved by the patient who is donating and the family members. To mark a heart as a donor heart, two or more healthcare professionals need to declare the donor brain-dead. Following this, the patient expected to receive a heart is put on a waiting list. At last, a team of healthcare professionals makes the final decision to replace the patient’s heart via a heart transplant. Then, another set of healthcare providers run a series of tests in order to assure that the patient receiving the donor’s heart is otherwise healthy enough to go through the long process of a heart transplant.\n\n【3】Who Are the Right Candidates for a Heart Transplant?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Heart transplants are given a green signal for those patients with cardiovascular diseases who have tried multiple medication therapies as well as other surgical interventions to correct the functioning of their heart, but the result has always been negative. Heart failure is generally caused due to congenital cardiovascular defects or cardiomyopathy in children. It should be noted that several other organ transplants may be done parallel to a heart transplant. This is referred to as a multiorgan transplant and is performed on specific individuals who are suffering from non-treatable conditions. Such invasive procedures are only conducted at select medical setups with a multidisciplinary approach.\n\n【5】Mentioned below are the individuals who are said to be suitable candidates for a heart transplant:\n\n【6】*   Weakness of all the heart muscles.\n\n【7】*   Cardiomyopathy.\n\n【8】*   Coronary artery disease.\n\n【9】*   Heart valve disorders.\n\n【10】*   Congenital heart defects.\n\n【11】*   Ventricular arrhythmias.\n\n【12】*   Failure of a previous heart transplant procedure.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Dr. Juan David Montoya</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    COVID-19 Vaccines in India</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Dr. Abdumanap Kalmakhanovich Baisalov</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Kidney failure leading to heart failure.\n\n【14】*   Heart failure due to liver failure.\n\n【15】*   Lung failure leading to heart failure.\n\n【16】*   Good ability to recover from a heart transplant.\n\n【17】*   Heart infections that are untreatable.\n\n【18】*   Cancer.\n\n【19】*   Willing to make lifestyle changes post heart transplant.\n\n【20】*   No history of smoking or any other tobacco use.\n\n【21】*   No record of drinking.\n\n【22】*   Willingness to quit smoking and drinking.\n    </u>\n\n【23】What Are the Risks of a Heart Transplant?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【24】Every procedure has risks. But performing surgery with great expertise always keeps the possibilities of dangers at bay.\n\n【25】Mentioned below are some of the dangers that may occur post or during a heart transplant surgery:\n\n【26】*   Rejection of the donor’s heart.\n\n【27】*   Excessive bleeding.\n\n【28】*   Generalized infection.\n\n【29】*   Blood clot.\n\n【30】*   No heart biopsy was done in the first year before a heart transplant.\n\n【31】*   Primary graft failure.\n\n【32】*   Cardiac allograft vasculopathy.\n\n【33】*   Heart attack.\n\n【34】*   Heart failure.\n\n【35】*   Open heart surgery.\n\n【36】*   Heart arrhythmias.\n\n【37】*   Sudden cardiac death.\n\n【38】*   Kidney damage.\n\n【39】*   Side effects of immunosuppressants.\n\n【40】*   Cancer.\n\n【41】*   Skin tumors.\n\n【42】*   Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.\n\n【43】*   Lip tumors.\n\n【44】*   Heart infection.\n\n【45】What Happens During a Heart Transplant?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【46】A heart transplant is also called a cardiac transplant. Patients who are generally at the end-stage of heart failure undergo a heart transplant. On the other hand, patients who have had a failed cardiovascular surgery may also be eligible for a heart transplant. A heart transplant is a highly invasive and surgical operation that is performed strictly under a scheduled medical setup. It is never done as an emergency procedure.\n\n【47】Mentioned below are the steps that are carried out during a common heart transplant procedure.\n\n【48】*   The functioning heart is taken out of the deceased organ donor.\n\n【49】*   The heart can be removed along with the lungs.\n\n【50】*   The deceased donors generally are those who have passed away due to brain death.\n\n【51】*   The patient suffering from cardiovascular malfunctioning has his or her heart removed via an orthotopic procedure.\n\n【52】*   There are cases where the patient's old heart is left inside the body in order to support the new donor heart. Such a kind of heart transplant is called a piggyback or heterotopic heart transplant procedure.\n\n【53】*   The patient then receives the donor heart, which is implanted into their cardiovascular system.\n\n【54】What Are the Expected Results After a Heart Transplant?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】The majority of the patients who receive a successful heart transplant live a good and high quality of life. Depending on the patient’s underlying condition as well as condition post the transplant, they may be given permission by their healthcare provider to resume most of their day-to-day tasks and activities. These also include sports and participation in specific instructed exercises. The appropriate physical activity that such patients are expected to perform should be discussed with the professional. Females should consult with their gynecologists as well as heart transplant specialists if being pregnant is a good choice post-heart transplant surgery. This is because certain medications prescribed post-heart transplant may not be suitable for pregnancy and may crop some complications for both the mother as well as the child. Survival rates of a heart transplant are based on numerous factors, and fortunately, the rate is continuously improving, according to worldwide statistics.\n\n【56】**Conclusion:**\n\n【57】A heart transplant is an invasive procedure that replaces a dying heart with a donor heart that is healthy and functioning. This procedure requires an interdisciplinary approach. Multiple tests are done before deciding to go with a heart transplant to make sure the candidate is the right fit. After the procedure is completed, diet adjustments are necessary after consulting a nutritions and a dietician so that the new heart functions as expected. Maintaining the right body mass index and regular exercise can aid in keeping severe complications away. Being physically active has proven to contribute to the control of blood pressure. Additionally, it reduces stress and strengthens the overall bones and muscles of the body. A heart transplant is a major procedure, but the chances of success are high with mandatory follow-up and cardiovascular health care strategies.\n\n【58】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【59】* * *\n\n【60】#### **1.**删除换行**How Long Can We Live After a Heart Transplant?**\n\n【61】A patient who has undergone a heart transplant may expect to live for another ten to twenty years.\n\n【62】#### **2.**删除换行**Is Heart Transplant a Serious Surgery?**\n\n【63】A heart transplant is a highly invasive and quite expensive as well as significant procedure that involves risks and complications.\n\n【64】#### **3.**删除换行**Does the Patient Remain Conscious While the Heart Is Being Transplanted?**\n\n【65】Yes, the patient remains conscious and on ventilator support for many organs during an ongoing heart transplant surgery.\n\n【66】#### **4.**删除换行**How Long Is the Procedure of a Heart Transplant?**\n\n【67】Depending on the severity and etiology of the disease, a heart transplant may last from four hours to eight hours.\n\n【68】#### **5.**删除换行**Are There Artificial Hearts?**\n\n【69】Yes, there are several artificial hearts, but none of them have received approval internationally except for one.\n\n【70】#### **6.**删除换行**Are Artificial Hearts Permanent?**\n\n【71】Artificial hearts are not permanent solutions and are a temporary solution before heart transplant surgery.\n\n【72】#### **7.**删除换行**What Are the Types of Heart Transplants?**\n\n【73】Orthotopic and heterotopic approaches to heart transplant are the two ways the health care provider and the team may go ahead with the procedure.\n\n【74】#### **8.**删除换行**What Is the Minimum Age for a Heart Transplant?**\n\n【75】As of today, a patient who was only six days old has become the youngest to receive a heart transplant.\n\n【76】#### **9.**删除换行**Can Children Require a Heart Transplant?**\n\n【77】Yes, children who suffer from end-stage cardiovascular disease require a heart transplant.\n\n【78】#### **10.**删除换行**How Old Can a Patient Be to Not Undergo Heart Transplant?**\n\n【79】As of today, the age beyond which a heart transplant is not suggested remains unclear and is dependent on the underlying condition of the patient.\n\n【80】#### **11.**删除换行**Is Age a Deciding Factor for a Heart Transplant?**\n\n【81】Age is not one of the crucial factors in determining the treatment option for a heart transplant.\n\n【82】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【83】无关删除-1:<u>*   Does the heart transplant have a future?  \n    https://academic.oup.com/ejcts/article/55/Supplement\\_1/i38/5491084\n*   The International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation Guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S105324981000358X\n*   Adult heart transplant: indications and outcomes  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4133547/\n*   Covariance Analysis of Heart Transplant Survival Data  \n    https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1977.10479903</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The experience of labor is distinct for each and every woman. Sometimes it only lasts a few hours. Other times, labor puts a mother's physical and emotional endurance to the test.\n\n【2】There are three stages of labor,\n\n【3】1.  **First Stage -** The cervix (neck of the womb) dilates by 10 cm during the first stage.\n\n【4】2.  **Second Stage -** The baby descends via the vagina and is born during the second stage.\n\n【5】3.  **Third Stage -** The placenta (afterbirth) is delivered during the third stage.\n\n【6】The placenta and its connected membranes are delivered toward the end of the third stage of labor. However, the doctor realizes right away that difficulties are still possible after placenta delivery from a practical standpoint. Due to this, many authorities have supported what is known as the \"fourth stage of labor,\" which starts with the placenta delivery and continues for an unspecified amount of time after. Although intervals as long as 4 hours have been proposed, the most common time is 1 hour.\n\n【7】Why Does the Third Stage of Labor Need to Be Managed?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The period from the time the baby is fully delivered until the placenta is fully delivered is referred to as the third stage of labor. The uterine contractility and the length of placental separation have an impact on the length of the third stage and associated problems. The third stage usually lasts less than 30 minutes in both multiparous and nulliparous women.\n\n【9】The third and fourth stages of labor are typically uneventful, but serious problems might arise during this time. The most frequent is postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Although maternal mortality rates have significantly decreased in developed nations, PPH continues to be a major factor in maternal death.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【12】Induction Chemotherapy Regimens For Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma\n\n【13】Fundal Placenta - Types, Position, and Complications\n\n【14】Why do I have chest tightness and heart palpitations followed by dizziness?\n\n【15】Substantial evidence supports the routine administration of uterotonic drugs to reduce postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) by 40%. In addition, these drugs enhance uterine contractions naturally during the third stage of labor.\n\n【16】What Are the Risks and Complications in the Third Stage of Labor?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】In the third stage of labor, complications are a possibility for every woman who gives birth.\n\n【18】These complications include,\n\n【19】*   **Uterine Inversion -** The birthing process can result in uterine inversion, which could be fatal. After the baby is delivered, the placenta typically separates from the uterus and leaves the vagina about 30 minutes later. During uterine inversion, the placenta is still connected and pulls the uterus inside.\n\n【20】*   **Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) -** PPH is the most typical third-stage labor complication. It has been amply demonstrated that active management of the third stage lowers the occurrence of this complication, which most likely has a good effect on maternal mortality and longer-term morbidities, including anemia.\n\n【21】*   **Retained Placenta -** When the placenta is not delivered within 30 minutes of the baby's delivery, it is said to have been retained. Since it can result in major illness or life-threatening blood loss, it is a serious issue.\n\n【22】*   **Conditions Manifested During First Stage of Labor (Placenta Accreta) -** When the placenta inserts itself too deeply into the uterine wall during pregnancy, a dangerous condition known as placenta accreta develops. After birthing, the placenta typically separates from the uterine wall. When a placenta accreta develops, some or all of the placenta is still connected. This may result in significant blood loss after delivery.\n\n【23】How Is the Third Stage of Labor Managed?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【24】The third stage of labor can be managed in one of two ways,\n\n【25】*   **Passive or Expectant or Physiological Management of the Third Stage of Labor -** The placenta is delivered spontaneously during the third stage of labor under expectant management. Doctors watch for symptoms of placental separation after the baby is delivered. When placental separation symptoms arise, the patient is instructed to press down, and the placenta is only naturally delivered through maternal effort. An oxytocic medication is only administered after the placenta has been delivered.\n\n【26】*   **Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor -** The third stage of labor is actively managed with prophylactic uterotonic therapy, early cord clamping, and carefully timed cord traction to deliver the placenta.\n\n【27】1.  **Prophylactic Uterotonic Therapy -** It is a straightforward and well-researched strategy to provide uterotonics during the third stage of labor, which can greatly reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.\n\n【28】2.  **Delivery of Placenta With Controlled Cord Traction -** After the woman's uterus has contracted after giving birth to her child and it is felt that the placenta has separated from the uterine wall, controlled cord traction (CCT) is used to pull on the umbilical cord while counter-pressure is applied to her uterus beneath her pubic bone until the placenta delivers.\n\n【29】3.  **Uterine Fundal Massage After Placental Expulsion -** Uterine fundal massage induces uterine contractions by promoting endogenous prostaglandin secretion after placental evacuation. This strategy was mentioned as optional for the active management of the third stage.\n\n【30】What Are the Various Uterotonic Agents Used in Active Management?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Various uterotonic agents used in active management of the third stage of labor are as follows,\n\n【32】**1\\. Oxytocin -** The drug of choice and the most widely used substance is Oxytocin. The amplitude and frequency of contractions are increased by Oxytocin, which only affects the smooth muscles of the uterus. After the baby's front shoulder has been delivered or the placenta has been expelled, Oxytocin may be administered. Typically, it is administered intramuscularly (IM) at a dose of 10 IU. Additionally, it can be administered intravenously (IV), which is frequently favored during cesarean operations (CS). Recently, a new Oxytocin pill is unveiled that can be successfully administered sublingually. Both modes of administration have the same effect on Oxytocin.\n\n【33】**2\\. Ergometrine (Methergine) -** Ergot alkaloids have a variety of physiological effects. They are non-selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-1 agonists with an affinity for dopamine and noradrenaline receptors. After being administered orally, ergot alkaloids are quickly and fully absorbed. After an intramuscular (IM) injection, both typically take effect within 1 minute to 5 minutes. Ergometrine leads to continuous contraction of the uterus. There is insufficient evidence about its use as a sole agent. It is administered as a dose of 0.2 mg IM. Patients with hypertension must refrain from using it.\n\n【34】**3\\. Syntometrine -** This has 0.5 mg of Ergometrine and 5 IU of Oxytocin. The uterine reaction starts sooner after IM injection than after Ergometrine alone, and the effect lasts many hours. Although a review revealed it to be more effective than Oxytocin, its use is limited due to the adverse effect profile (hypertension, nausea, and vomiting).\n\n【35】**4\\. Misoprostol -** This is a synthetic derivative of prostaglandin E1. It is a cheap medicine that may be easily kept. It is safe to use in patients with asthma and does not raise blood pressure. Flushing is the most common adverse effect of this drug. Misoprostol has been used as a preventative measure in numerous trials and has been demonstrated to reduce the quantity of blood loss. However, it is not as effective as Oxytocin. Misoprostol, which comes in three different dosage forms—rectally, sublingually, and orally—can be utilized as the first-line medication in nations with extremely low socioeconomic levels and a high prevalence of home deliveries.\n\n【36】**5\\. Tranexamic Acid (TA)-** It can travel via the placenta and reach a nursing child. It must be avoided in persons with renal insufficiency since it is eliminated through the urine. It can be administered parenterally, topically, or orally. It is often a medicine that is well tolerated. Rarely, it could result in hypotension, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.\n\n【37】What Are the Drawbacks of Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Adverse effects of uterotonic substances include,\n\n【39】*   Ergot alkaloids cause hypertension, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n【40】*   Placental retention risk.\n\n【41】Hazards to newborns from early cord clamping include,\n\n【42】*   Anemia due to a lack of iron.\n\n【43】*   Intraventricular bleeding.\n\n【44】*   Hypertension.\n\n【45】**Conclusion:**\n\n【46】Everyone involved enjoys the time right after the baby is delivered, but the mother could face severe risks at this time. The period following the baby's birth and the placenta's complete ejection is referred to as the third stage of labor. As a result of the placenta being separated, there is some blood loss following the delivery. Both high-income and low-income nations experience a high maternal mortality rate due to postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). The term \"active management of the third stage of labor\" refers to the procedures of administering a drug to the mother (often by injection to aid in womb contraction), clamping the placental chord, and pulling on the cord while exerting counter-pressure to aid in placenta delivery (controlled cord traction or CCT). It could make the woman feel uncomfortable and sabotage her desire for a natural birth.\n\n【47】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【48】* * *\n\n【49】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the Third Stage of Labor?**\n\n【50】The third labor stage is when the baby is fully delivered until the placenta is fully delivered. The uterine contractility and the length of placental separation impact the length of the third stage and associated problems. The third stage lasts less than 30 minutes for both multiparous and nulliparous women.\n\n【51】#### **2.**删除换行**When Does the Third Stage of Labor Begin and End?**\n\n【52】The third labor stage begins with the baby's complete delivery and ends with the full delivery of the placenta and its connected membranes. However, after placenta delivery, the doctor immediately realizes that difficulties are possible from a practical standpoint. Due to this, many authorities have supported what is known as the fourth stage of labor. It starts with the placenta delivery and continues for an unspecified amount of time after.\n\n【53】#### **3.**删除换行**What Do You Mean by Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor?**\n\n【54】It involves prophylactic uterotonic therapy, early cord clamping, and carefully timed cord traction to deliver the placenta.\n\n【55】#### **4.**删除换行**What Steps Are Involved in Actively Managing the Third Stage of Labor?**\n\n【56】The third stage of labor can be effectively managed in one of two ways,  \n\\- The placenta is delivered spontaneously during the third stage of labor under expectant or passive management.   \n\\- The third stage of labor is actively managed with prophylactic uterotonic therapy, early cord clamping, and carefully timed cord traction to deliver the placenta.  \n\\- Prophylactic uterotonic therapy provides uterotonics during the third stage of labor, which can significantly reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.  \n\\- Delivery of placenta with controlled cord traction.   \n\\- Uterine fundal massage after placental expulsion.\n\n【57】#### **5.**删除换行**Which Drugs Are Used for Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor?**\n\n【58】Various uterotonic agents used in active management of the third stage of labor are as follows,  \n\\- Oxytocin - Oxytocin is the drug of choice and the most widely used substance. The amplitude and frequency of contractions are increased by Oxytocin, which only affects the smooth muscles of the uterus.   \n\\- Ergometrine (Methergine) - Ergot alkaloids have a variety of physiological effects. They are non-selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-1 agonists with an affinity for dopamine and noradrenaline receptors.   \n\\- Syntometrine - This has 0.5 mg of Ergometrine and 5 IU of Oxytocin. The uterine reaction starts sooner after IM injection than Ergometrine alone, and the effect lasts many hours.   \n\\- Misoprostol - This is a synthetic derivative of prostaglandin E1. It is a cheap medicine that may be easily kept. It is safe for patients with asthma and does not raise blood pressure.   \n\\- Tranexamic Acid (TA) - It can travel via the placenta and reach a nursing child.\n\n【59】#### **6.**删除换行**What Are the WHO Guidelines for Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor?**\n\n【60】WHO guidelines for active management of the third stage of labor include:  \n\\- Uterotonics are recommended for all births to prevent postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) during the third stage of labor.  \n\\- Oxytocin is the most recommended uterotonic drug for the prevention of PPH.   \n\\- In settings where skilled birth attendants (doctors, nurses, or midwives) are available, controlled cord traction (CCT) is recommended for vaginal births. For settings with no skilled birth attendants, CCT is not recommended.  \n\\- Sustained uterine massage is not recommended to prevent postpartum hemorrhage in women who have received prophylactic Oxytocin.  \n\\- CCT is the recommended method for removing the placenta in a cesarean section.\n\n【61】#### **7.**删除换行**What Are the Complications of the Third Stage of Labor?**\n\n【62】In the third stage of labor, complications are possible for every woman who gives birth.  \n\\- These complications include,  \n\\- Uterine Inversion.  \n\\- Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH).  \n\\- Retained Placenta.  \n\\- Conditions Manifested During First Stage of Labor (Placenta Accreta). When the placenta inserts itself too deeply into the uterine wall during pregnancy, a dangerous condition known as placenta accreta develops. \n\n【63】#### **8.**删除换行**What Are the 3 Ps of Labor?**\n\n【64】Successful labor involves three essential factors that affect the labor and delivery process. It includes maternal efforts, uterine contractions, fetal characteristics, and pelvic anatomy. This triad is classically termed as the passenger, power, and passage.\n\n【65】#### **9.**删除换行**What Is the Most Difficult Stage of Labor?**\n\n【66】The second stage is when the baby descends via the vagina and is born during the second stage. This is usually the most difficult and painful stage of labor and can last anywhere from half an hour to several hours. \n\n【67】#### **10.**删除换行**Which Is the Longest Stage of Labor?**\n\n【68】The first stage is the longest of all three. It is divided into two phases — early labor and active labor. The first stage of labor occurs when the mother begins to feel continuous contractions. These contractions become stronger, more regular, and more frequent over time. They cause the cervix (neck of the womb) to open (dilate) by 10 cm and shorten and thin (efface) to let the baby move into the birth canal.\n\n【69】#### **11.**删除换行**What Is the Fastest Stage of Labor?**\n\n【70】The third stage is the shortest and usually takes at most 20 minutes. The placenta is delivered during the third stage.\n\n【71】#### **12.**删除换行**Why Is Oxytocin Administered in the Third Stage of Labor?**\n\n【72】Oxytocin is the common uterotonic agent in actively managing the third labor stage to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. The amplitude and frequency of contractions are increased by Oxytocin, which only affects the smooth muscles of the uterus. Oxytocin may be administered after the baby's front shoulder has been delivered, or the placenta has been expelled.\n\n【73】#### **13.**删除换行**What Is the Purpose of the Third Stage of Labor?**\n\n【74】The third labor stage is when the baby is fully delivered until the placenta is completely delivered. During this stage of labor, the placenta and attached membranes that support the baby in the uterus come out through the vagina. The healthcare provider can help by guiding the placenta and giving an injection to help the uterus contract.\n\n【75】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【76】无关删除-1:<u>*   Management of the Third Stage of Labor  \n    https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02319707\n*   Active management of the third stage of labor: A brief overview of key issues  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127474/\n*   Normal third stage of labour  \n    https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/8-1-normal-third-stage-of-labour-51417770.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

In HIV patients, it is the primary cause of mortality, and they possess the risk throughout. Isoniazid preventive therapy is the administration of INH (Isoniazid) to people with latent tuberculosis infection to prevent its progression to active tuberculosis disease.\n\n【2】What Is Isoniazid Preventive Therapy?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【3】Preventive therapy is also known as chemoprophylaxis. Isoniazid is one of the most efficient bactericidal and anti-tuberculosis drugs. This drug protects against the progression of tuberculosis (TB) infection to active disease and the recurrence of the tuberculosis infection after exposure to any open case of TB. It has been proved that Isoniazid preventive therapy is very effective and safer than Pyrazinamide and Rifampicin regimens used to prevent latent TB infection. It was also found that Isoniazid preventive therapy effectively reduced the incidences of tuberculosis and death in HIV-infected patients. Isoniazid preventive therapy is used to prevent active TB infection, reinfection, and relapse, and the toxicity is as good as a regimen that includes Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Rifapentine. Isoniazid preventive therapy reduces the overall risk of developing tuberculosis by 33 percent. Isoniazid preventive therapy should be avoided if monthly monitoring is not possible. The patients should be educated and should be monitored monthly in person.\n\n【4】How Is Isoniazid Therapy Given in Children?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Children with TB infection differ from adults in their response to the disease. As the children are at risk of progression of TB disease, they are targeted for preventive treatment. Children more commonly develop TB infections as compared to adults. So, there is a need for improvement in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of TB infection in children by including NTPs in line with proper standards and guidelines. The NTPs successfully and effectively prevent TB in children. If the children are diagnosed with active TB, then an entire course of anti-TB treatment is given to them. If the children do not have active TB, Isoniazid (INH) should be given 4.53 mg/lb daily for six months. The main groups for preventive therapy include the individuals who are the most at risk of acquiring TB are:\n\n【6】*   PLHIV (people living with HIV).\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Gyromitra Mushroom Toxicity - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Triazolam - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, And Precautions</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Bacillus Clausii - Indications, Dosage, and Side Effects</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Infants and children in contact with TB patients.\n    </u>\n\n【8】How Is Isoniazid Preventive Therapy Given to Pregnant Women?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The efficacy, safety, and appropriate timing of Isoniazid therapy for tuberculosis prevention in pregnant women with HIV infection receiving antiretroviral treatment are unknown. A trial conducted included a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial for pregnant women with HIV infection to receive Isoniazid preventive therapy for 28 weeks, initiated during pregnancy or at 12 weeks after the delivery. The infants and the mothers were followed through 48 weeks after the delivery. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the treatment for active TB has not yet developed preventive therapy during pregnancy. In addition, clinical and laboratory monitoring has shown reports of Isoniazid-related hepatotoxicity in pregnant and postpartum women. Some studies have shown that Hispanic and black women, especially postpartum, may be at higher risk of severe or fatal reactions, so they should be monitored closely.\n\n【10】How Is Isoniazid Preventive Therapy Given in HIV Patients?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The risk for people with both M. tuberculosis and HIV is much higher than those without HIV infection. However, the people with latent TB who took Isoniazid benefit have shown a significant reduction in the infection, observed in HIV-negative and HIV-positive, and TST (tuberculin skin test)-positive individuals. In addition, there is a reduction in the risk of developing active TB, around 60 percent in HIV and TST-positive individuals with a high prevalence of TB. Therefore, the world health organization recommends that information about Isoniazid preventive therapy be made available to all PLHIV, and Isoniazid preventive therapy itself should be offered as a care package to all HIV-infected. TST-positive individuals, those individuals with active TB have been safely excluded.\n\n【12】In conditions where a TST test cannot be performed or carried out, HIV patients, when treated with Isoniazid, reduce the risk of developing active TB by 40 percent. In the conditions where TST testing is not available, then the individuals should be considered for preventive therapy if they are infected with HIV:\n\n【13】*   Health care workers.\n\n【14】*   Prisoners.\n\n【15】*   Miners.\n\n【16】*   People with a high risk of transmitting or acquiring TB infection.\n\n【17】*   In-house contacts with TB patients.\n\n【18】*   Individuals are living in areas where M. tuberculosis infection is prevalent.\n\n【19】What Are the Benefits of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Appropriately and adequately Isoniazid preventive therapy plays a vital role in eliminating tuberculosis. In the area with a high prevalence of TB, the duration of Isoniazid preventive therapy should be six months for full benefit. The primary purpose of Isoniazid preventive therapy is to prevent latent infection from developing into a clinical disease and is also used in the prevention of initial infection and prevention of recurrence of past infection.\n\n【21】What Are the Adverse Effects of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The adverse effects of Isoniazid preventive therapy for latent TB infection include:\n\n【23】*   **Gastrointestinal and Hepatic Effects** - The adverse effects were gastrointestinal symptoms, including hepatotoxicity and hepatitis.\n\n【24】*   **Dermatological Effects** \\- Few patients developed generalized rashes and acneiform rashes. No patients reported alopecia.\n\n【25】*   **Neuropsychiatric Effects** \\- Most common neuropsychiatric effects reported were lethargy and cognitive impairment. Few people reported headaches, disturbance in sleep, and blurred vision.\n\n【26】**Conclusion:**\n\n【27】Preventive therapy has mainly been used for its beneficial effects on the individual. Therefore, preventive therapy is recommended for HIV-positive people who do not have active TB infection. The patients should be thoroughly educated and monitored monthly, in person, by appropriately trained personnel.\n\n【28】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【29】无关删除-1:<u>*   Isoniazid preventive therapy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK310749/\n*   Isoniazid preventive therapy plus antiretroviral therapy for the prevention of tuberculosis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7875572/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is also known as photoallergic contact dermatitis, which occurs when the eyes are exposed to an allergen such as sunlight or other ultraviolet light rays.\n\n【2】The condition is similar to sunburn except that it affects the eye's corneal surface. It is a temporary yet painful condition that may last a few hours to a few days.\n\n【3】**What Is Photokeratitis?**\n---------------------------\n\n【4】Photokeratitis is a condition in which a person experiences temporary eye symptoms on exposure to sunlight or UV (ultraviolet rays). This condition can temporarily damage the corneal tissues of the eye (clear transparent layer of the front portion of the eye). It may also affect the conjunctival tissues. Studies have shown that snow blindness is a type of photokeratitis that occurs when ultraviolet rays are reflected by snow and ice.\n\n【5】**What Are the Causes of Photokeratitis?**\n------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Ultraviolet rays like UV-A and UV-B from the sun can cause short-term and long-term damage to the eyes. This can also affect vision and cause long-term damage to the eye's tissues. The UV-C radiation, however, is filtered and absorbed by the ozone layer and does not damage the eyes.\n\n【7】Direct staring or gazing at the sun during a solar eclipse could also result in photokeratitis and the long-term effects of photokeratitis. It could also cause retinal burns and temporary loss of vision. Here are some other causes of photokeratitis:\n\n【8】*   Laser lights directly reflect into the eyes.\n\n【9】*   Direct vision to sunlight and eye exposure to sunlight.\n\n【10】*   Eye exposure to lamps used in tanning beds and booths.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Can cataract surgery be had in a person with high blood sugar levels?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I have acne and seborrheic dermatitis on the face and steroid cream did not help.

The symptoms may last a few minutes to a few hours and are usually temporary.\n\n【16】Symptoms usually last from six hours to a couple of days. However, there may be long-lasting effects on chronic and repeated exposure. The following are the symptoms of photokeratitis:\n\n【17】*   Eye redness and pain that may last for a few hours.\n\n【18】*   Watery eyes.\n\n【19】*   Tearing and burning sensation of the eyes.\n\n【20】*   Blurred vision.\n\n【21】*   Twitching of the eyelids.\n\n【22】*   Frequent blinking of the eyes.\n\n【23】*   Temporary loss of vision may be rare; however, it may occur.\n\n【24】*   Extreme sensitivity to light until the symptoms subside.\n\n【25】*   Seeing halos.\n\n【26】*   Headaches and migraines.\n\n【27】*   Color changes in the vision.\n\n【28】**What Are the Long-Term Consequences of Photokeratitis?**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】*   Chronic UV radiation can be damaging to the eyes. It can lead to cataracts, macular degeneration, and even blindness. The damage occurs because the UV rays damage the photoreceptor cells in the retina.\n\n【30】*   In addition to these short-term effects, people with photokeratitis are more likely to develop a range of serious eye disorders, including cataracts and retinal detachment. Furthermore, even if one recovers from the initial symptoms, long-term corneal scarring can prevent clear vision for a lifetime.\n\n【31】*   The long-term consequences of photokeratitis may also include permanent vision loss, scarring, and inflammation of the eye's tissues.\n\n【32】*   Individuals with photokeratitis may also experience decreased sensitivity to light, making them more prone to developing conditions such as glaucoma. In addition, Pingueculae and pterygia (elevations on the surface of the eye due to chronic UV exposure) can also occur.\n\n【33】*   Long-term exposure to blue and violet light emitted from LED lights, computers, laptop screens, and smartphones can also be a risk factor for photokeratitis and macular degeneration.\n\n【34】**How Is Photokeratitis Diagnosed?**\n------------------------------------\n\n【35】Ophthalmologists diagnose the eye condition after a thorough eye checkup and examine the changes in different light environments. In addition, routine eye examinations help the ophthalmologist determine the extent of eye damage.\n\n【36】The doctor may also conduct tests to diagnose superficial irregularities in the corneal tissues and eye surfaces. This process involves putting eye drops containing fluorescein into the eyes, which helps to understand the changes and eye damage clearly.\n\n【37】**What Is the Treatment for Photokeratitis?**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Usually, the condition or symptoms of photokeratitis go away on their own within a few hours to days (or even hours), as the condition is temporary. However, if symptoms persist for longer durations, it is important to seek medical attention or visit an ophthalmologist who may prescribe eye drops to mitigate the risk of infection.\n\n【39】Here are some necessary precautions to take if one experiences photokeratitis symptoms:\n\n【40】*   Go indoors immediately.\n\n【41】*   Consider staying in a less lit environment (dark room) in case of extreme light sensitivity.\n\n【42】*   Remove the contact lenses till symptoms subside and one is comfortable wearing them again.\n\n【43】*   Avoid rubbing eyes, as it will aggravate the condition and cause severe eye redness.\n\n【44】*   The discomfort can be relieved by placing a cold washcloth over the closed eyes, using artificial tears, or taking pain-relieving medications as prescribed by an ophthalmologist.\n\n【45】**How Can One Prevent Photokeratitis?**\n---------------------------------------\n\n【46】Here are some measures one can take to prevent photokeratitis -\n\n【47】*   Wear proper eye protection, such as sunglasses or snow goggles. Sunglasses or goggles that block or absorb 99 % to 100 % of UV rays are recommended if one spends most of their time outdoors. Wrap-around sunglasses or those that protect the sides of the eyes (full coverage eyewear) are recommended to block all harmful UV rays. Glare from the snow, sand, or water can cause burns to the eyes, even if it is cloudy.\n\n【48】*   One should wear a wide-brimmed hat during the day or extreme sunlight exposure.\n\n【49】*   One should use eye protective equipment if exposed to UV radiation in their professional lives.\n\n【50】*   One can opt for or consider wearing UV-absorbed contact lenses to protect their eyes.\n\n【51】*   One must see an ophthalmologist or eye care specialist at least once a year for routine eye checkups to identify early symptoms of eye disorders and early signs of photokeratitis to prevent its long-term consequences.\n\n【52】**Conclusion:**\n\n【53】Photokeratitis is temporary when the eyes are directly exposed to ultraviolet rays, direct light, or sunlight. Symptoms include red eyes, burning, and irritation. One can opt for at-home remedies to relieve symptoms and prevent flare-ups or seek the right diagnosis and treatment from an ophthalmologist.\n\n【54】Preventive measures like wearing sunglasses or other protective equipment that blocks or absorbs UV rays when outside can prevent photokeratitis and its long-term effects on the eyes. Regular annual eye examinations can be beneficial in the early diagnosis and treatment of photokeratitis.\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>*   Photokeratitis  \n    https://eyewiki.aao.org/Photokeratitis\n*   Corneal damage in photokeratitis--why is it so painful?  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2381684/\n*   Photokeratitis induced by ultraviolet radiation in travelers: A major health problem  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5820813/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Sometimes, the vision may be disturbed because of the presence of spots in the vision. The person may see black or gray specks, or strings while moving the eyes, which may disappear while trying to look at them directly. The eye floaters are most noticeable when an individual looks at a plain bright background such as a white wall or blue sky. The condition can be annoying but does not require treatment unless it interferes with vision. If there is any presence of such eye floaters, an individual should immediately contact a physician, more specifically an eye specialist or an ophthalmologist, especially when an individual sees light flashes suddenly or experience loss of peripheral vision.\n\n【2】**What Are Eye Floaters?**\n--------------------------\n\n【3】Eye floaters are semi-transparent, small, or cloudy fibers that float in the vitreous humor (a gel-like substance that is present inside the eye). These floaters can appear as irregular shapes, dots, cobwebs, or specks. Eye floaters are common and increase with age. Sometimes floaters tend to be less noticeable over time.\n\n【4】**What Are the Causes of Eye Floaters?**\n----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Eye floaters can be associated with any underlying medical condition. The following can cause eye floaters:\n\n【6】*   **Age-Related Changes in the Eye:** The shape of the vitreous-jelly-like substance that fills the eyeball shrinks. Also, with time, it may liquefy which leads to pulling away from the interior surface of the eyeball. This causes the fibers to clump together and form floaters.\n\n【7】*   **Eye Injury:** Trauma to the eye such as during low to the head can cause bleeding in the eye. This can lead to the development of eye floaters.\n\n【8】*   **Medical Conditions:** Some medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and migraine can cause floaters as a symptom.\n\n【9】*   **Tearing of the Retina:** If it is not treated, it can lead to retinal detachment and, ultimately permanent vision loss.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I am having large floaters in my eyes.

Individuals who are above 50 years of age are at more risk.\n\n【14】*   **Myopia (nearsightedness):** Individuals with nearsightedness or myopia are at increased risk of developing eye floaters because the vitreous humor is more likely to detach from the retina and the eyeballs in these individuals are elongated.\n\n【15】*   **Eye Trauma:** Any injury or trauma to the eye can cause eye floaters.\n\n【16】*   **Eye Surgery:** Any complications due to cataract surgery can lead to the development of the condition.\n\n【17】*   **Diabetes:** People with diabetes are at increased risk of developing eye floaters.\n\n【18】*   **Family History:** Eye floaters may run in families. People with a family history of floaters are at increased risk of developing the condition.\n\n【19】**What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Eye Floaters?**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】There can be various symptoms that might help to diagnose this condition, which is as follows:\n\n【21】*   Any small, cloudy, or semi-transparent shapes present in the vision can be visualized as dark specks, any transparent string of material in a floating manner.\n\n【22】*   Presence of lines, dots, and cobwebs and they move around while moving the eyes, which disappear while trying to look directly at it.\n\n【23】*   Presence of any spot or dot while staring at a plain background such as a white wall or blue sky.\n\n【24】*   Presence of small shapes that subside on their own.\n\n【25】*   Some people may experience other symptoms such as flashes of light, blurred vision, loss of peripheral vision, eye pain, or redness.\n\n【26】**When Should an Individual Consult a Physician?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Immediate consultation with an eye specialist is important in the following cases:\n\n【28】1\\. Increased eye floaters than usual.\n\n【29】2\\. Presence or emergence of eye floaters suddenly.\n\n【30】3\\. Eye floaters, along with flashes of light in the same eye.\n\n【31】4\\. Any peripheral vision loss characterized by darkness on any side of the vision.\n\n【32】These are mostly painless symptoms but are of much importance and can be caused by a retinal tear, which can be or cannot be attached to retinal detachment and again is a very important condition that needs immediate medical attention.\n\n【33】**How Can Eye Floaters Be Diagnosed?**\n--------------------------------------\n\n【34】Eye floaters can be diagnosed by a combination of personal history, medical history, and symptoms that an individual is facing. Following that, certain tests will be conducted to check the eye status. During an examination, the doctor will ask the patient about symptoms and medical history including any past eye diseases or surgeries. The eye doctor will perform a visual acuity test to diagnose myopia. The dilated eye examination includes putting drops in the eyes to dilate the pupils and that allows the clear visualization of the back of the eye. The test helps check eye abnormalities such as retinal detachment or tears. The eye doctor may advise imaging tests like optical coherence tomography which provides a detailed picture of the back of the eye.\n\n【35】**How Can Eye Floaters Be Treated?**\n------------------------------------\n\n【36】Initially, it is important to manage the underlying cause of eye floaters like diabetes, hypertension, etc. Eye floaters can frustrate the individual and the individual will take time to adjust to it.\n\n【37】But, in case the condition is severe, it might need medical attention and the available treatment includes the following:\n\n【38】1.  **Surgery:** This can be done to remove the vitreous and replace it with a saline solution. The surgical procedure is known as a vitrectomy.\n\n【39】2.  **Laser Therapy:** The therapy involves the use of lasers to break the floaters into smaller pieces. This can help in disrupting the floaters.\n\n【40】3.  **Medications:** The medications such as antibiotics or corticosteroids treat underlying infections or inflammation that may cause eye floaters.\n\n【41】**Conclusion:**\n\n【42】Eye floaters can be normal or pathologic, but it needs immediate medical attention in case of severe conditions. It can affect normal life if not managed early. While eye floaters are usually harmless and do not require treatment. With the help of online medical platforms, people can now consult a specialist or physician at the ease of their home.\n\n【43】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【44】* * *\n\n【45】#### **1.**删除换行**How Long Do Eye Floaters Last?**\n\n【46】Although eye floaters do not disappear completely, they steadily reduce in size as weeks and months pass.

{"seq_id": "7e43cb7d-7abe-47ec-a617-2fe28e38d902", "title": "Cabazitaxel - Uses, Mechanism of Action, Precautions and Side Effects", "text": "【0】Cabazitaxel - Uses, Mechanism of Action, Precautions and Side Effects\n**Overview**\n\n【1】Cabazitaxel is an antineoplastic and taxane drug used in chemotherapy, along with steroids, to treat men who have metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (a type of prostate cancer that cannot be treated by surgery or medicines that lower testosterone levels). It is mainly used in patients who have already been treated with other medicines and do not respond to that medicine like Docetaxel. The administration of Cabazitaxel causes disturbances in the growth of cancer cells, which get destroyed and eventually lead to the proliferation of the normal cell. Cabazitaxel falls in a class of medications called microtubule inhibitors and is a semi-synthetic drug derived from the natural taxoid 10-deacetylbaccatin III. In addition, the drug has antineoplastic potential. Cabazitaxel binds and stabilizes tubulin, inhibiting microtubule depolymerization and cell division, cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, and resulting in inhibition of the tumor cell proliferation.\n\n【2】**Dosage**\n\n【3】*   Cabazitaxel is indicated with steroids for the treatment of prostate cancer. An initial dose of 25 mg over one hour as an intravenous infusion every three weeks in combination with Prednisone 10 mg orally daily throughout treatment is necessary.\n\n【4】**Preparation**\n\n【5】Cabazitaxel comes in a kit and requires preparation of the mixing or diluting of the drug before use. The drug is prepared as below:\n\n【6】*   **First Dilution -** Mix a small amount of Cabazitaxel 60 mg/1.5 ml from the container. Avoid foaming during dilution; do not shake. The final concentration of Cabazitaxel will be 10 mg/mL.\n\n【7】*   **Second Dilution -** Take the recommended dose from the first dilution and dilute in a 250 mL polyvinyl chloride-free container with either 0.9 % sodium chloride or 5 % dextrose solution. Cabazitaxel solution should be between 0.1 mg/mL and 0.26 mg/mL. If the dose is greater than 65 mg, use a larger volume of infusion solution so that the concentration of Cabazitaxel is at most 0.26 mg/mL, which is an ideal concentration of Cabazitaxel. Use this final solution within eight hours stored at room temperature or within 24 hours if refrigerated, including infusion time.\n\n【8】**Dosages and Usage**\n\n【9】**1\\. Prostate Cancer -** Cabazitaxel is indicated along with Prednisone for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in patients previously treated with a Docetaxel-containing treatment. The recommended dose is 20 mg/m2 IV throughout the treatment.\n\n【10】**2\\. Neutropenia -** In prolonged grade 3 neutropenia, despite appropriate medication, including G-CSF, delay the treatment until the neutrophil count is above 1,500 cells/mm3, then reduce the dose by 1 level.\n\n【11】**3\\. Diarrhea -** In grade 3 diarrhea despite appropriate medication, fluid, and electrolyte replacement, delay the treatment and then reduce the dose by 1 level.\n\n【12】**4\\. Peripheral Neuropathy -** In grade 2, reduces the dose by 1 level, and in grade 3, discontinue the therapy.\n\n【13】**5\\. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors -** Avoid coadministration; if unavoidable, reduce the dose by 25 %.\n\n【14】**6\\. Renal Impairment -** In all the severities, dosage adjustment is not necessary. End-stage renal disease (CrCl <15 mL/min) requires continued monitoring.\n\n【15】**7\\. Hepatic Impairment**\n\n【16】*   **Mild:** A 20 mg/m2 is given.\n\n【17】*   **Moderate:** The dose is reduced to 15 mg/m2; based on tolerability.\n\n【18】*   **Severe:** Contraindicated.\n\n【19】**Use in Special Populations**\n\n【20】*   **Renal Impairment -** No formal trials have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. Population pharmacokinetic trials included patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. However, no major effects were seen on the pharmacokinetics of Cabazitaxel. No data are available on the use in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.\n\n【21】*   **Hepatic Impairment -** No formal trials have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. The liver extensively metabolizes Cabazitaxel. However, hepatic impairment will likely increase Cabazitaxel concentrations.\n\n【22】How Cabazitaxel Works?\n----------------------\n\n【23】Cancerous disorders lead to uncontrolled cell division. Normal cells stop proliferating when they come into contact with similar cells; this mechanism is known as contact inhibition, and cancerous cells lose this ability to control proliferation and cell division.\n\n【24】Chemotherapy kills cancer cells and can potentially stop the process of cell proliferation. If the cells fail to divide, they die. The use of chemotherapy damages the RNA or DNA of the cells. Chemotherapy leads to shrinkage of the tumor.\n\n【25】Chemotherapy is the most effective treatment and kills cells rapidly. However, chemotherapy fails to differentiate cancerous cells from normal ones. The normal and healthy cells are most commonly affected by chemotherapy. In addition, it affects the blood cells, the cells in the mouth, stomach, bowel, and hair growth, causing mouth sores, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n【26】**Warning and Precautions**\n\n【27】The administration of Cabazitaxel comes with some warnings and recommendations. Also, there are some precautions to avoid unfortunate circumstances. The followings are the warnings and precautions about Cabazitaxel:\n\n【28】**1\\. Hypersensitivity Reactions -** Patients undergoing the treatment should be pre-medicated before initiating the infusion of Cabazitaxel. Patients should be monitored closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions can be observed in the first few minutes of the initial infusion of Cabazitaxel. Thus, facilities and equipment for treating low blood pressure and breathlessness should be available. Severe hypersensitivity reactions need supportive treatment. Cabazitaxel should be discontinued in patients with hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n【29】**2\\. Bone Marrow Suppression -** Cabazitaxel used in chemotherapy can result in bone marrow suppression, causing a lack of normal blood cells produced in the bone marrow by the hematopoietic stem cells.\n\n【30】**3\\. Risk of Neutropenia -** Patients treated with Cabazitaxel may receive prophylactic G-CSF, per American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines and current institutional guidelines, to reduce the risk or manage neutropenia complications. Low white blood cell count is the most common adverse reaction of Cabazitaxel. Monitoring of complete blood counts is essential weekly during cycle one and before each treatment cycle is important.\n\n【31】**4\\. Gastrointestinal Disorders -** Symptoms such as abdominal pain, tenderness, fever, constipation, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea should be considered early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity. Gastrointestinal (GI) reactions like hemorrhage and perforation, ileus and colitis, and some life-threatening conditions have been reported in patients treated with Cabazitaxel.\n\n【32】**5\\. Risk of Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, and Dehydration -** Some patients who experience diarrhea with Cabazitaxel may be treated with common anti-diarrheal medications. Supportive treatment should be given to patients. It is important to rehydrate the patients and monitor their serum electrolyte levels. Dose reduction is important for grade 3 diarrhea.\n\n【33】**6\\. Damage to the Peripheral Nerves -** In cases of nerve damage, peripheral sensory neuropathy, paraesthesias, dysaesthesias, and peripheral motor neuropathy can occur in patients receiving Cabazitaxel.\n\n【34】**7\\. Anemia -** Caution measures should be taken in patients with anemia. Anemia has been reported in patients receiving Cabazitaxel. Hemoglobin and hematocrit should be checked before the indication of the drug and if patients have anemia or blood loss symptoms.\n\n【35】**8\\. Renal Failure -** Renal disorders have been associated with sepsis, severe dehydration due to diarrhea, vomiting, and obstructive uropathy. Renal failure, including cases of death, has been observed. It is recommended to take immediate actions to identify the causes and treat them accordingly.\n\n【36】**9\\. Respiratory Disorders -** Interstitial pneumonia and interstitial lung disease have been observed in many cases. Patients should be closely monitored, investigated, and appropriately treated if new pulmonary symptoms develop. Cabazitaxel therapy should be paused until the diagnosis is available. Symptomatic and supportive care should be indicated.\n\n【37】**10\\. Risk of Cardiac Arrhythmias -** Cardiac arrhythmias have been reported in patients with ongoing treatment, most commonly tachycardia and atrial fibrillation.\n\n【38】**11\\. Elderly -** Older adults (65 years of age or more) are more likely to have adverse reactions, low blood cell count, and low blood pressure, which can lead to unfortunate life-threatening conditions.\n\n【39】**12\\. Patients with Liver Impairment -** Treatment with Cabazitaxel is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment. The dose should be reduced for patients with mild hepatic impairment to avoid serious conditions.\n\n【40】**Pre-Medication**\n\n【41】Pre-medication is important to reduce the risk of getting severe hypersensitivity reactions. At least 30 minutes before administration of Cabazitaxel following medication can be given to the affected individual -\n\n【42】*   Antihistamine (Diphenhydramine 25 mg).\n\n【43】*   Corticosteroids (Dexamethasone 8 mg).\n\n【44】*   H2 antagonist (Ranitidine 50 mg).\n\n【45】**Drug Interactions**\n\n【46】Drug interactions refer to the reaction in the body when one or more drugs are administered simultaneously, or vaccines are injected to avoid getting affected by certain types of disorders that can also react with some drugs and result in serious medical conditions. Therefore certain medicines should be used in a variety of ways. In these cases, the healthcare provider wants to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When indicted for having these medicines, it is very important to consult the health care provider.\n\n【47】Indicating Cabazitaxel medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended and can result in certain life-threatening conditions.\n\n【48】*   Measles virus vaccine.\n\n【49】*   Mumps virus vaccine.\n\n【50】*   Rotavirus vaccine.\n\n【51】*   Rubella virus vaccine.\n\n【52】*   Varicella virus vaccine.\n\n【53】*   Zoster vaccine.\n\n【54】Indication of Cabazitaxel with the following medicines is not recommended -\n\n【55】*   Adenovirus vaccine.\n\n【56】*   Atazanavir.\n\n【57】*   Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin vaccine.\n\n【58】*   Boceprevir.\n\n【59】*   Ceritinib.\n\n【60】*   Cholera vaccine.\n\n【61】*   Clarithromycin.\n\n【62】*   Cobicistat.\n\n【63】*   Conivaptan.\n\n【64】*   Delavirdine.\n\n【65】*   Dengue tetravalent vaccine.\n\n【66】*   Idelalisib.\n\n【67】*   Indinavir.\n\n【68】*   Influenza Virus Vaccine, Live.\n\n【69】*   Itraconazole.\n\n【70】*   Ketoconazole.\n\n【71】*   Lopinavir.\n\n【72】*   Nefazodone.\n\n【73】*   Nelfinavir.\n\n【74】*   Poliovirus Vaccine, Live.\n\n【75】*   Posaconazole.\n\n【76】*   Ritonavir.\n\n【77】*   Saquinavir.\n\n【78】*   Smallpox Vaccine.\n\n【79】*   Telaprevir.\n\n【80】*   Telithromycin.\n\n【81】*   Tipranavir.\n\n【82】*   Typhoid vaccine.\n\n【83】*   Voriconazole.\n\n【84】*   Yellow Fever Vaccine.\n\n【85】**For Patients**\n\n【86】**What Is Prostate Gland?**\n\n【87】The prostate gland is an organ with seminal vesicles and belongs to the male reproductive system. The prostate is a small gland and weighs around 28 grams. The seminal vesicles are two small paired glands. These glands are located on both sides of the prostate. The prostate gland is posterior to the bladder and inferior to the rectum. The prostate encircles the urethra. The urethra is a tube-like structure that helps in carrying urine from the bladder to the penis. Men with an enlarged prostate have difficulty urinating.\n\n【88】Prostate and seminal vesicles play the main job during ejaculation. Sperms are produced in the testicles and then move to the urethra. Simultaneously, fluid produced and stored in the prostate and the seminal vesicles also moves into the urethra and mix with the semen and ejaculates out of the penis by the urethra.\n\n【89】What Is Prostate Cancer?\n------------------------\n\n【90】Prostate cancer is considered an uncontrolled growth of cells in the prostate gland. The prostate is a small-sized gland in men, situated below the bladder and in front of the rectum, around the urethra. The urethra is a tube that carries urine out of the bladder. The prostate produces and stores a fluid that helps produce semen.\n\n【91】Prostate cancer is a common type of cancer seen in men all around the globe and often begins without symptoms. Prostate cancer can be slow-growing. However, many prostate cancers are more aggressive and can involve other internal organs, which can be life-threatening. The prostate cancer prognosis is greatly improved with early detection and personalized treatment.\n\n【92】Who Can Most Likely Get Affected?\n---------------------------------\n\n【93】Every man has a prostate and can develop prostate cancer. But it can also depend on some factors like -\n\n【94】*   **Age** - The chance of developing prostate cancer increases as a person ages. Prostate cancer is rare in younger men aged under 50 years.\n\n【95】*   **Family History** - The risk of prostate cancer is higher if prostate cancer runs in the family history.\n\n【96】*   **Race** - African Americans are more likely to get prostate cancer. Even at a younger age.\n\n【97】What Are the Symptoms of Prostate Cancer?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【98】Prostate cancer does not always cause symptoms. If it shows some symptoms, it may include:\n\n【99】*   The urine stream becomes weak.\n\n【100】*   Sudden urge to urinate.\n\n【101】*   Urinating often, especially at night.\n\n【102】*   Pain or a burning sensation when urinating.\n\n【103】*   Blood in the urine or semen.\n\n【104】*   Pain in the lower back, hips, or pelvis.\n\n【105】*   Painful ejaculation.\n\n【106】**Cabazitaxel Side Effects:**\n\n【107】Important facts about the side effects of Cabazitaxel:\n\n【108】*   Cabazitaxel's side effects are not common for everyone.\n\n【109】*   Cabazitaxel side effects are often predictable regarding their onset, duration, and severity.\n\n【110】*   Cabazitaxel side effects are often reversible and likely to improve after complete therapy.\n\n【111】*   Cabazitaxel's side effects are quite manageable. There are many options to prevent the side effects of cabazitaxel.\n\n【112】The following side effects are common for patients taking Cabazitaxel:\n\n【113】*   Low blood counts cause amenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.\n\n【114】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【115】*   Fatigue.\n\n【116】*   Nausea.\n\n【117】*   Vomiting.\n\n【118】*   Constipation.\n\n【119】*   Weakness.\n\n【120】*   Abdominal pain.\n\n【121】*   Presence of blood in the urine sample.\n\n【122】*   Lack of appetite.\n\n【123】*   Back pain.\n\n【124】*   Damage to the peripheral nerves.\n\n【125】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【126】*   Fever.\n\n【127】*   Taste changes.\n\n【128】*   Joint aches.\n\n【129】*   Cough.\n\n【130】*   Hair loss.\n\n【131】*   Heartburn.\n\n【132】Infusion-related side effects include allergic reactions like rash, flushing, fever, and lower blood pressure. This rarely happens and usually occurs during the initial and final infusion. The patient should be closely monitored during the infusion, and if any signs of allergic reaction are observed, the treatment should stop immediately, and the patient should be under observation. Side effects on the drug administration site include darkening of the vein, redness of the skin, swelling of the vein, or pain.\n\n【133】**For Doctors**\n\n【134】**Pharmacology**\n\n【135】**Indication**\n\n【136】Cabazitaxel is indicated in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer previously treated with a Docetaxel-containing treatment regimen and did not respond.\n\n【137】**Associated Conditions**\n\n【138】Refractory or metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.\n\n【139】**Contraindications**\n\n【140】*   Bad infection.\n\n【141】*   Caloric undernutrition.\n\n【142】*   Dehydration.\n\n【143】*   Anemia.\n\n【144】*   Decreased blood platelets.\n\n【145】*   Low levels of white blood cells are called neutrophils.\n\n【146】*   Liver problems.\n\n【147】*   Severe liver disease.\n\n【148】*   Acute kidney failure.\n\n【149】*   Inflammation of the bladder with hemorrhage.\n\n【150】*   Vomiting.\n\n【151】*   Excessive diarrhea.\n\n【152】*   Pregnancy.\n\n【153】*   Lung tissue problem.\n\n【154】**Pharmacodynamics**\n\n【155】Cabazitaxel has antineoplastic properties and is effective against Docetaxel-sensitive and insensitive cancers.\n\n【156】**Mechanism of Action**\n\n【157】Cabazitaxel is a microtubule inhibitor. Cabazitaxel binds to tubulin and promotes its conversion into microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting the destruction of microtubules. This results in the stabilization of microtubules, which causes mitotic and interphase cellular functions to temper. The cell is then unable to progress further in the cell cycle and holds up at metaphase, which results in the triggering apoptosis of the cancer cell.\n\n【158】**Absorption**\n\n【159】After administering the intravenous dose of Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 every three weeks in patients with prostate cancer, the mean Cmax in patients with metastatic prostate cancer was 226 ng/mL. 991 ng/mL in the mean AUC in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Simply put, peak plasma time is one hour, peak plasma concentration is 226ng/mL, and AUC is 991 ng/mL. Administration with Prednisone does not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of Cabazitaxel.\n\n【160】**The Volume of Distribution**\n\n【161】The volume of distribution (Vss) was 4,864 at a steady state. Compared to other taxanes, it penetrates the CNS to a greater extent.\n\n【162】**Protein Binding**\n\n【163】Cabazitaxel holds a chemical bonding with human serum albumin and lipoproteins (89 to 92 %, respectively).\n\n【164】**Metabolism**\n\n【165】Cabazitaxel is mainly metabolized in the liver. In addition, it is metabolized by the CYP3A4/5 isoenzyme (80 % to 90 %) and a bit by CYP2C8, which results in 20 different metabolites which are detected in feces or urine. Two of these 20 metabolites belong to demethylate derivatives Cabazitaxel and are referred to as RPR112698 and RPR123142, respectively.\n\n【166】**Route of Elimination**\n\n【167】After administering a one-hour intravenous infusion of Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2, almost 80 % of the administered dose was eliminated within two weeks. Cabazitaxel is mainly excreted in the feces, and 3.7% of the dose is excreted by the urine.\n\n【168】**Half-life**\n\n【169】Plasma concentrations of Cabazitaxel can be described by three compartments like, alpha, beta, and gamma, of the pharmacokinetic model with a half-life of 4 minutes, 2 hours, and 95 hours, respectively.\n\n【170】**Clearance**\n\n【171】Cabazitaxel slows plasma clearance by 48.5 L/h in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\n【172】**Adverse Effects**\n\n【173】Indication of Cabazitaxel comes with some adverse effects -\n\n【174】*   Anemia.\n\n【175】*   Leukopenia.\n\n【176】*   Neutropenia.\n\n【177】*   Thrombocytopenia.\n\n【178】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【179】*   Fatigue.\n\n【180】*   Nausea.\n\n【181】*   Vomiting.\n\n【182】*   Asthenia.\n\n【183】*   Constipation.\n\n【184】*   Abdominal pain.\n\n【185】*   Hematuria.\n\n【186】*   Anorexia.\n\n【187】*   Back pain/arthralgia.\n\n【188】*   Peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【189】*   Pyrexia.\n\n【190】*   Dyspnea.\n\n【191】*   Cough.\n\n【192】*   Dyspepsia.\n\n【193】*   Alopecia.\n\n【194】*   Peripheral edema.\n\n【195】*   Weight loss.\n\n【196】*   Dizziness.\n\n【197】*   Headache.\n\n【198】*   Urinary tract infection.\n\n【199】*   Dysuria.\n\n【200】*   Febrile neutropenia.\n\n【201】*   Mucosal inflammation.\n\n【202】*   Hypotension.\n\n【203】*   Arrhythmia.\n\n【204】*   Gastritis and intestinal obstruction.\n\n【205】*   Interstitial pneumonia or pneumonitis.\n\n【206】*   Interstitial lung disease.\n\n【207】*   Acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n【208】*   Bone marrow suppression.\n\n【209】*   Renal failure.\n\n【210】*   Renal and urinary disorders.\n\n【211】**Toxicity**\n\n【212】Administration of Cabazitaxel can cause side effects such as neutropenia, hypersensitivity reactions, gastrointestinal symptoms, and renal disorders. Anticipated overdose complications include exacerbating adverse reactions such as bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal disorders. Cabazitaxel can also penetrate the blood-brain barrier.\n\n【213】Severe hypersensitivity reactions like hypotension, bronchospasm, and generalized rash or erythema have also been reported. If these reactions occur, the infusion should be immediately discontinued, and appropriate supportive treatment should be administered.

If any blockage occurs over these areas, it can cause upper airway obstruction. One such cause of obstruction is edema of the upper airways. Upper airway edema (swelling) can lead to swelling of the face, lips, and larynx. Asphyxia (a condition where there is oxygen deprivation in the body leading to unconsciousness and death in some cases) and aphonia (inability to talk due to the damaged voice box or larynx) can be a result of this condition. This topic describes upper airway edema, its clinical features, triggering factors, and management of upper airway edema.\n\n【2】What Is the Upper Airway?\n-------------------------\n\n【3】The upper airway is the upper respiratory tract. The human respiratory system consists of two airways, one is the upper airway, and the other is the lower airway. The upper airways consist of the nose, mouth, sinuses, pharynx (throat), and larynx (voice box). And whereas the lower respiratory airways consist of the trachea (windpipe), bronchioles (small air tubes present in the lungs), and lungs.\n\n【4】**The functions of the upper airway are:**\n\n【5】*   The upper airways cleans the air passing to the lower airways.\n\n【6】*   It also protects the lower respiratory airways.\n\n【7】*   It works in the formation of sound by the vocal cords.\n\n【8】*   It also connects the nasal cavity with the oral cavity.\n\n【9】What Causes the Blockage in the Upper Airways?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【10】The upper airways can get blocked when the upper respiratory tract gets narrowed. There are many reasons that are involved in blocking the upper airways. Some of the prevalent reasons are infections, allergic reactions, injuries to the upper respiratory tract, chemical burns, asthma attacks (a respiratory condition where the airways become narrow, swollen, causing breathing difficulty with mucus secretion), throat cancers, peritonsillar abscesses (a pus-filled cavity formation in the tonsils and the infection spreads to regions beyond the tonsils like neck and chest), vocal cord problems, and tracheomalacia (which involves the trachea cartilages as they get weakened).\n\n【11】What Causes Upper Airway Edema?\n-------------------------------\n\n【12】Upper airway edema is caused by many factors. Some of the commonly associated causes of upper airway edema are hereditary angioedema and laryngeal edema (swelling), which is caused by the Pseudoterranova species.\n\n【13】*   Laryngeal edema by Pseudoterranova species is a severe condition in which bacterial or viral infections are involved in causing the edema along with allergic reactions like anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction).\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Hypertensive Peristalsis - An Esophageal Motility Disorder</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Angioedema - Types, Causes, Symptoms, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Scleroderma Esophagus - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal disorder resulting in repeated swelling in the upper respiratory tract, skin, and the gastrointestinal tract. It is caused due to mutations in the genes that are encoded with factor XII proteins. It is a very rare disorder. Such mutations can cause the dysfunction of the cascade system, like the complement system, and the release of bradykinin. The bradykinin release here leads to extravasation of plasma into the space present interstitially and thus leads to the formation of edema.\n    </u>\n\n【15】What Are the Clinical Features Involved in Upper Airway Edema?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Clinical features that are involved in upper airway edema are:\n\n【17】*   Sore and scratchy throat\n\n【18】*   Itchy throat.\n\n【19】*   The sensation of a lump in the throat.\n\n【20】*   Throat tightness.\n\n【21】*   Dysphagia (difficulty while eating or swallowing).\n\n【22】*   Voice changes.\n\n【23】*   Hoarseness in the voice.\n\n【24】*   The roughness of voice.\n\n【25】*   Cough.\n\n【26】*   Stridor (a high-pitched breathing sound resembling whistling).\n\n【27】*   Dyspnea (breathing difficulty).\n\n【28】*   Feeling of suffocation.\n\n【29】*   Aphonia.\n\n【30】*   Sometimes, the affected person is unable to speak, breathe, or even cough.\n\n【31】*   Anxiety.\n\n【32】*   Edema on the lips or face can occur.\n\n【33】**What Are the Main Symptoms of Upper Airway Edema?**\n\n【34】The one main symptom of upper airway edema involves angioedema. Angioedema involves the swelling of the face, lips, tongue, mucous membranes of the nose, and larynx or throat. It can be severe in cases where it involves the larynx. However, its initiation is not known, but it can be due to insect bites or drugs, or even allergens.\n\n【35】What Is the Clinical Course of Upper Airway Edema?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】Upper airway edema involves the swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and severe swelling involving the larynx too. When it starts evolving, it takes nearly eight hours to develop a severe condition. The course of development of this severe condition is quite sooner in children than in adults. It is because children have small diameters of airways with less physiological reserves, and the fatigability of muscles of respiration is easier as even a minor swelling in the airways of the child patient can cause the severity of a condition with breathing difficulty. Along with these, tonsil swelling and inflammation also lead to dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) and dyspnea of the case.\n\n【37】What Are the Triggering Factors Related to Upper Airway Edema?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】There are many triggering factors that can lead to upper airway edema. Some of them are:\n\n【39】*   Mechanical trauma.\n\n【40】*   Emotional stress.\n\n【41】*   Surgical procedures that involve the head and neck region only. Surgical procedures like endotracheal intubation.\n\n【42】*   Diagnostic procedures that involve the head and neck region only.\n\n【43】*   Hormonal imbalance involving the period of puberty, menstruation, and pregnancy.\n\n【44】*   Certain food items.\n\n【45】*   Certain medicine that alters the hormones, such as estrogen-containing contraceptives like oral contraceptives.\n\n【46】*   Dental surgery.\n\n【47】How Are the Management of Upper Airways Edema Done?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】Management of the upper airway edema:\n\n【49】*   Plasma replacement therapy is required in these cases. Drugs like Icatibant, which is a bradykinin antagonist, and Ecallantide (a medicine to treat acute acute attacks in angioedema cases) are given intravenously or as subcutaneous injections. The results will be seen in 30 to 60 minutes.\n\n【50】*   If these are not available, then frozen plasma can also be used.\n\n【51】*   Cricothyroidotomy is an emergency surgical procedure where a cut is made through the cricothyroid membrane and skin to create a patent airway in some life-threatening circumstances.\n\n【52】*   Percutaneous tracheostomy (PCT) is also one of the surgical procedures used in the management of this condition.\n\n【53】What Could Be the Prophylaxis for Upper Airway Edema?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【54】*   Prophylaxis can be done, by eliminating the triggering factors. The factors that evolve further upper airway edema like mechanical trauma or hormonal changes, or oral contraceptives. All these factors need to be eliminated to control upper airway edema.\n*   Oral treatments can also be used as an alternative, like androgens.\n\n【55】*   The use of fresh frozen plasma is also an alternative to emergency treatment.\n\n【56】**Conclusion**:\n\n【57】Upper airway edema is basically fluid in the interstitial spaces of the airways leading to swelling in the upper airway. It is accompanied by angioedema which is the swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and larynx. There are many triggering factors that evolve upper airway edema. And, by following the management and prophylaxis technique’s discussed above the living condition of the patient can be improved.\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>*   Treatment of upper airway oedema prior to extubation  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5064707/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

In cases where HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) status is unknown, and HIV testing is complex, specific oral lesions strongly indicate HIV infection. The oral lesions associated with HIV are important, as they affect the patient's quality of life and are also useful markers of disease progression and immunosuppression.

Thrombocytopenic purpura.\n    </u>\n\n【14】**1) Oral Candidiasis:**\n\n【15】It is the most common intraoral opportunistic fungal infection strongly associated with HIV infection. It has been reported that oral or esophageal candidiasis in HIV-infected patients may indicate an advanced stage of AIDS. The four clinical patterns of oral candidiasis seen are as follows:\n\n【16】*   **Pseudomembranous Candidiasis -** It clinically appears as white to yellowish-white plaques. These lesions can be easily scraped off, exposing red areas. The lesions cover a large area of more than one site in the oral cavity. It also extends to involve the oropharynx and esophagus.\n\n【17】*   **Erythematous Candidiasis -** This type of candidiasis is clinically seen as red lesions. It is commonly located on the upper surface of the tongue, buccal mucosa, and palate. When it occurs on the tongue, it is referred to as central papillary atrophy.\n\n【18】*   **Hyperplastic Candidiasis -** In hyperplastic candidiasis, there are characteristic white plaques that cannot be wiped off. This candidiasis type can be differentiated from other oral white lesions depending on how they respond to topical or systemic antifungal therapy. Diagnosis can be confirmed by biopsy, with fungal hyphae seen on the keratinized layers of the epithelium.\n\n【19】*   **Angular Cheilitis -** Fissuring and scaling of the angles of the mouth clinically characterize this lesion. This lesion is a mixed infection of Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n【20】**Diagnosis and Treatment -** Candidiasis can be diagnosed with its clinical appearance. The PAS (Periodic acid-Schiff) staining for candidal hyphae of biopsied tissue or smears from the lesions or culturing the organism on Sabouraud's agar helps with the diagnosis. The topical application of antifungal agents such as Nystatin or Clotrimazole can effectively treat Candidiasis. The systemic antifungals used are Fluconazole or Itraconazole. Although systemic azoles produce longer disease-free intervals, these are more frequently associated with drug interactions and drug resistance.\n\n【21】**2) Periodontal Lesions:**\n\n【22】It may become rapidly destructive, which is difficult to manage. Anaerobic bacteria play a dominant role. Aggressive necrosis and ulceration of the gingival margin (necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis) may occur. It spreads to adjoining oral mucosa and palate, leading to necrotizing stomatitis (NS). Extension of ulcer can lead to bone destruction, tooth loosening, and loss. These lesions are associated with pain, fever, gingival bleeding, and foul breath.\n\n【23】**Diagnosis and Treatment -** Initially, it would be identified with bleeding gums and non-plaque induced gingivitis. This is followed by the destruction of one or more interdental papilla and marginal gingiva. In chronic cases of periodontitis, increased loss of periodontal attachment and bone exposure may confirm the diagnosis. Mouthwashes with povidone-iodine followed by chlorhexidine help with periodontal infections. Local debridement of necrotic material may be needed. Antibiotics (Clindamycin, Metronidazole, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate) are given in severe infection.\n\n【24】**3) Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection:**\n\n【25】Herpes labialis is clinically seen as blisters on the lip and adjacent facial skin, rapidly breaking down to produce shallow ulcers. Intraoral lesions on the gingiva are referred to as acute herpetic gingivostomatitis. Lesions may extend to involve the palate, pharynx, and tonsils. The lesions present as numerous pinhead-sized vesicles, which collapse to form small ulcers, exhibiting a red base covered with yellow fibrin. The persistence of active sites of HSV infection for more than 1 month in a patient with HIV infection is one of the accepted definitions of AIDS.\n\n【26】**Diagnosis and Treatment -** Mucosal herpes simplex virus infections cannot be accurately diagnosed with clinical examination. Laboratory diagnosis such as herpes simplex virus DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture is used to diagnose the HSV-associated mucocutaneous lesions. These lesions can be treated with the administration of oral Acyclovir.\n\n【27】**4) Herpes Zoster:**\n\n【28】Herpes zoster is a recurrent viral infection seen in HIV-infected patients. It presents a clinical course that is more severe in disease prevalent populations than in immunocompetent patients. In AIDS patients, herpes zoster begins as a unilateral cluster of vesicles and ulcers in a classical dermatome distribution. However, it later extends beyond the dermatomal boundary and heals by scarring.\n\n【29】**Diagnosis and Treatment -** The polymerase chain reaction is the best test to confirm the diagnosis in HIV patients. It is used to rapidly detect varicella-zoster DNA, and it is widely used now. Oral Acyclovir, Famciclovir, and Valacyclovir are the drugs of choice in the treatment of herpes zoster.\n\n【30】**5) Kaposi’s Sarcoma:**\n\n【31】The mouth is the common site for Kaposi’s sarcoma. The lesions are red or violet, flat, raised, and nodular, usually found over the hard palate. Bulky lesions may ulcerate and bleed. They may cause pain and swallowing problems.\n\n【32】**Diagnosis and Treatment -** Diagnosis is made by biopsy of lesions and is examined with Warthin-Starry stain. Treatment features intralesional Vinblastine or surgical removal. Systemic chemotherapy is indicated for widespread or dispersed forms.\n\n【33】**6) Oral Hairy Leukoplakia:**\n\n【34】It is a white corrugated lesion presumed due to EBV (Epstein-Barr virus). It occurs mostly on the lateral borders of the tongue but may involve adjacent buccal mucosa. It does not transform into malignancy. The presence of this lesion is highly suggestive of concurrent HIV infection and is more prevalent in advanced disease.\n\n【35】**Diagnosis and Treatment -** The presence of Epstein-Barr virus could confirm oral hairy leukoplakia, where the in situ hybridizations, PCR, or immunohistochemistry help confirm the diagnosis. Antiviral, antifungal, and antiretroviral therapy may improve the condition. Surgical excision may help prevent remission.\n\n【36】**7) Aphthous Ulcers:**\n\n【37】Aphthous ulcers present as recurrent, round, shallow, and painful ulcers of variable sizes and duration typically found on the non-keratinized oral mucosa. Oral ulcers in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus are large and more extensive. They usually measure more than 2 cm in diameter with regular borders.\n\n【38】**Diagnosis and Treatment -** Blood test, culturing the lesions, taking the biopsy of the lesion, and examining it under the microscope helps confirm the diagnosis. Aphthous ulcers respond to topical steroids. Chlorhexidine and tetracycline rinses have been reported to be useful in treating herpetiform aphthae.\n\n【39】**8) Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma:**\n\n【40】It has been reported in HIV or AIDS patients with the same frequency as in the general population associated with the same risk factors but at a younger age. A few suggested causes are increased chance of human papillomavirus infection and impaired recognition of foreign pathogens.\n\n【41】**Diagnosis and Treatment -** It can be diagnosed by histological examination and surgical biopsy, and they are the gold-standard treatment to confirm the diagnosis. The treatment consists of surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.\n\n【42】**9) Molluscum Contagiosum:**\n\n【43】Molluscum contagiosum or water warts is an infection of the skin caused by a pox virus. It appears as shiny, white, and skin-colored dome-shaped papules that often demonstrate a central depressed crater.\n\n【44】Diagnosis and Treatment - It can be diagnosed with bumps on the skin, and to confirm the diagnosis, the doctor might scrape a bit and examine under the microscope. In patients with AIDS, numerous lesions may be present, and histologically, it exhibits large intracytoplasmic inclusions known as molluscum bodies. Cryotherapy is recommended for large and disfiguring lesions. Antiviral drugs like Cidofovir, Imiquimod, and Interferon are effective. In addition, surgical methods like electrodessication, curettage, and laser surgery are used when they do not respond to medicines.\n\n【45】**10) Thrombocytopenic Purpura:**\n\n【46】Thrombocytopenic purpura in HIV or AIDS is characterized by decreased production of platelets due to medications, malnutrition, immunological alterations, microbial invasion, or the course of HIV disease. Pinpoint petechiae characterizes oral thrombocytopenic purpura following minor trauma and even mastication. Spontaneous gingival hemorrhage is a common oral manifestation.\n\n【47】Diagnosis and Treatment\n-----------------------\n\n【48】Blood tests revealing increased median CD4 cells and low platelet counts are related to HIV disease progression. Platelet transfusions or corticosteroid therapy may be beneficial if the cause is removed.\n\n【49】**Conclusion**\n\n【50】There are many oral lesions that are associated with the human immunodeficiency virus. However, periodontitis, pseudomembranous candidiasis, and oral hairy leukoplakia are the most common oral lesions that are widely observed. With the help of antiviral and antifungal medications, these oral lesions can be managed, and it requires medical supervision.

In addition, people consume Barbiturates on purpose or accidentally, which leads to drug overdose and fatal consequences. Barbiturates were mainly used to treat seizures, insomnia, headaches, and pre-operative sedatives. But these drugs are replaced with Benzodiazepines because of the side effects and overdose caused by Barbiturates. Therefore, Barbiturates can cause both physical and psychological addiction and dependency.\n\n【2】**What Are the Common Names for Barbiturate Drugs?**\n\n【3】*   Red devil.\n\n【4】*   Christmas tree.\n\n【5】*   Pinks.\n\n【6】*   Barbs.\n\n【7】*   Yellow jacket.\n\n【8】*   Goof balls.\n\n【9】**What Is the History of Barbiturate Drug Abuse?**\n\n【10】*   Barbiturates became popular for insomnia, seizure, and anxiety in the 1960s and 1970s.

The drug can treat migraines and headaches with these different combinations.\n\n【48】*   **Secobarbital**\\- This medication is usually ineffective against insomnia, and doctors also avoid prescribing it.\n\n【49】*   **Primidone**\\- The medication can treat seizures as it can prevent convulsions.\n\n【50】**What Is the Mechanism of Action of Barbiturate Drugs?**\n\n【51】Barbiturates work by inhibiting the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) system leading to central nervous system depression. The GABA system consists of a chloride channel, and when Barbiturate interacts with GABA, these chloride ions enter the brain's cells for a prolonged period. Barbiturates alter the nerve impulses of the brain cells, thus causing depression of the nerve impulses and central nervous system.\n\n【52】What Are the Complications Related to Barbiturate Toxicity?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】The complications related to Barbiturate toxicity are as follows.\n\n【54】*   Barbiturates can reduce blood pressure and heart rate and may also cause cessation of breathing which can be fatal and life-threatening.\n\n【55】*   The drug can also affect the liver, thus altering the other drug effects and making them less effective.\n\n【56】*   Barbiturates increase the medical tolerance of the drugs at higher doses. However, it can cause drug dependency, which can be fatal if the drug is not taken longer.\n\n【57】*   Barbiturates lead to drug addiction on prolonged use despite having hazardous health effects and consequences.\n\n【58】*   The drugs affect fetal growth and development and cause harm to breastfeeding newborns.\n\n【59】How Is Barbiturate Toxicity Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【60】Medical professionals can diagnose Barbiturate toxicity in the following ways:\n\n【61】*   Urine and blood test.\n\n【62】*   Chest x-rays.\n\n【63】*   ECG (electrocardiogram).\n\n【64】*   CT scan (computed tomography).\n\n【65】What Are the Treatment Options for Barbiturate Toxicity?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【66】*   Barbiturate toxicity does not have any antidote treatment available.\n\n【67】*   First-line treatment for Barbiturate toxicity is mainly supportive in managing airway obstruction and circulation.\n\n【68】*   Intubation and mechanical ventilation support are provided if a person shows respiratory depression and sedation symptoms.\n\n【69】*   Activated charcoal therapy is done via a nasogastric tube to remove toxic substances from the stomach.\n\n【70】*   Severe cases of Barbiturates may also need hemodialysis and alkaline diuresis.\n\n【71】*   During the recovery phase, a person must be given counseling about Barbiturate misuse and overuse.\n\n【72】**What Are the Contraindications of Barbiturates?**\n\n【73】*   Barbiturates should not be taken with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants such as sleep medications, antihistamines, narcotics, muscle relaxants, or medicines for seizures. Multiple CNS depressants can lead to unconsciousness and death.\n\n【74】*   Barbiturates can produce side effects in children causing unusual excitement.\n\n【75】*   These drugs can also cause depression and confusion in older people.\n\n【76】*   Barbiturates have the potential to alter medical test results.\n\n【77】*   People with a history of drug abuse, mental depression, and suicidal tendencies should be administered Barbiturates carefully and cautiously.\n\n【78】*   Barbiturates are contraindicated in pregnancy because they can cause harm to the fetus and also produces withdrawal symptoms in newborn babies if a mother consumes Barbiturates in the last trimester of the pregnancy.\n\n【79】*   Breastfeeding mothers should also avoid Barbiturates as they can be present in breast milk, causing harm to newborns.\n\n【80】What Is the Differential Diagnosis for Barbiturate Toxicity?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【81】*   Alcohol toxicity.\n\n【82】*   Benzodiazepine toxicity.\n\n【83】*   Hypoglycemia.\n\n【84】*   Myxedema coma.\n\n【85】What Are the Barbiturate Withdrawal Symptoms?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【86】A person using Barbiturates for drug abuse should never stop consuming the drug instantly. It can be fatal, leading to the death of a person. The withdrawal symptoms include:\n\n【87】*   Stomach pain.\n\n【88】*   Seizures.\n\n【89】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【90】*   Disorientation.\n\n【91】*   Hallucinations.\n\n【92】*   Hyperthermia (increased body temperature).\n\n【93】*   Restlessness.\n\n【94】**Conclusion**\n\n【95】Barbiturates are sedative medications that can relax the body. However, the drugs can cause severe health hazards and dependency with small doses. Barbiturates have a small therapeutic window which means even a tiny extra amount can cause a drug overdose. Although the drug is not commonly used these days due to alternative medications available. Cases of acute poisoning with Barbiturates are still experienced in many developing countries. Barbiturate toxicity can cause fatal health consequences and prolonged medical care; quitting the drug can enhance recovery from an overdose.\n\n【96】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【97】无关删除-1:<u>*   Barbiturate Toxicity  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499875/#:~:text=The%20toxic%20dose%20of%20barbiturates,40%20to%2080%20mcg%2FmL\n*   Barbiturate intoxication and overdose  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000951.htm</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Paraneoplastic pemphigus typically presents with painful mucosal erosions and dusky patches on the skin. A variety of lesions with painful mucosal erosions and different morphologies, ranging from flaccid blisters to widespread lichenoid eruptions, are seen in paraneoplastic pemphigus. Mucosal lesions may be the earliest presenting symptom of the disease. Extensive epidermal loss can result in extreme dehydration, protein depletion, and an increased evaluation risk. Patients often require intensive care and should be managed, similar to burn patients. Adults aged 45 to 70 years are most commonly affected.\n\n【2】What Is Paraneoplastic Pemphigus?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】Paraneoplastic is a mucocutaneous, blistering disease almost always associated with confirmed neoplasms. Paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome (PAMS) is another name due to potential autoimmune reactions, which also appear in internal organs, such as bronchiolitis obliterans in the lungs.\n\n【4】Who Gets Paraneoplastic Pemphigus?\n----------------------------------\n\n【5】Paraneoplastic pemphigus is a rare form of autoimmune bullous disease variant; It is the tiniest but most serious form of pemphigus, about three to five percent of all cases. Most commonly, it develops in adults between 45 to 70 years of age with equal male and female sex prediction, seen in children.\n\n【6】Almost all the cases are associated with the underlying cancerous process.\n\n【7】*   Approximately five percent of patients with internal malignancy may develop paraneoplastic pemphigus.\n\n【8】*   Paraneoplastic pemphigus is often a presenting feature of Castleman's disease (giant cell or angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) seen in children and adolescents.\n\n【9】*   Lymphoproliferative neoplasms are the most common underlying disease: precisely, non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common type of underlying cancer in adults, followed by chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\n【10】What Causes Paraneoplastic Pemphigus?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【11】Paraneoplastic pemphigus is caused by underlying malignancy (most commonly lymphoproliferative neoplasm), which stimulates an autoimmune response.\n\n【12】*   Autoreactive T-cells by neoplasm can include both humoral and cell-mediated immunity.\n\n【13】*   Components of desmosomes (which interconnect the keratinocytes in the epidermis), such as bullous pemphigoid.\n\n【14】*   Humoral immunity through IgG1 autoantibodies against desmosome and hemidesmosome components can cause acantholysis, resulting in intraepidermal blistering and bronchitis obliterans.\n\n【15】*   Genetic factors also play a role in the autoimmune response.\n\n【16】What Are the Clinical Features?\n-------------------------------\n\n【17】There are five major clinical subtypes of paraneoplastic pemphigus available, which are likely linked to the range of autoantibodies:\n\n【18】*   Pemphigus like.\n\n【19】*   Bullous pemphigoid-like.\n\n【20】Erythema multiforme paraneoplastic pemphigus clinical features may include:\n\n【21】*   Painful mucous membrane erosions and extensive refractory mucostomatitis.\n\n【22】*   Blisters, hemorrhagic crusting, and genitals.\n\n【23】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Bronchiolitis Obliterans - Causes, Symptoms, and Diagnosis</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Rituximab: Current and Future scope</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Skin Manifestations of Autoimmune Disorders - Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Diffuse polymorphic skin lesions, usually seen after mucous membrane involvement, are often very itchy.\n\n【24】*   Involvement of other epithelia and internal organs like lungs, gastrointestinal tract, thyroid gland, and kidneys.\n\n【25】*   Muscle weakness and high titers of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies are evidence of myasthenia gravis.\n\n【26】*   Evidence of underlying malignancy.\n    </u>\n\n【27】What Are the Complications of Paraneoplastic Pemphigus?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】*   Fluid protein and loss from epidermal erosions and blisters can cause dehydration and imbalances.\n\n【29】*   Loss of skin barrier function predisposing to sepsis and infections.\n\n【30】*   Treatment-resistant for mucosal lesions.\n\n【31】*   Malnutrition and dehydration due to painful oropharyngeal lesions.\n\n【32】**Potential Eye (Ocular) Complications:**\n\n【33】*   Pseudomembranous conjunctivitis.\n\n【34】*   Conjunctival and corneal erosions or ulcerations.\n\n【35】*   Progressive scarring.\n\n【36】*   Eyelid thickening.\n\n【37】*   Pterygium.\n\n【38】**Potential Lung Complications:**\n\n【39】*   Bronchiolitis obliterans.\n\n【40】*   Repeated infections.\n\n【41】*   Respiratory failure.\n\n【42】How Is Paraneoplastic Pemphigus Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【43】Paraneoplastic pemphigus diagnosis is based on clinical and histologic findings, direct and indirect immunofluorescence, and immune serology.

But there are some conditions or disorders of women those are recognized as well as manifested by the change in amount, color, consistency, duration or even smell of the vaginal discharge. Thus, it is of utmost importance to know the difference between a normal and an abnormal vaginal discharge.\n\n【2】What are the different types of vaginal discharges?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】### 1\\. Normal vaginal discharge (Leucorrhoea):\n\n【4】Almost all women experience some form of vaginal discharges at any point in time. This is usually clear or milky or more like a sticky liquid. These are the secretions from the glands situated in the vagina and cervix. This constant secretion helps in vaginal lubrication, clears out old cells, keeps the vagina clean and safe from outside infections. Usually, it amounts 1 to 4 ml in 24 hours in a normal reproductive-aged woman.\n\n【5】#### Neonates:\n\n【6】The discharge can be seen within the first few days after birth due to estrogen exposure from mother, within the womb. It looks more like a clear or white mixture with a mucus type of texture.\n\n【7】#### Pre-pubertal:\n\n【8】The secretion is comparatively thinner and has a different bacteria flora.\n\n【9】#### Puberty:\n\n【10】As the production of estrogen begins at this age, there is an increase in the vaginal discharge along with an increase in glycogen content leading to increased lactobacilli content in the vagina. This, in turn, leads a to more acidic environment inside the vagina which helps to protect the vagina from outer infections.\n\n【11】#### Menstrual cycle:\n\n【12】In the normal menstrual cycle, there is some form of vaginal discharges which are considered normal. During the mid-cycle, there is an increase in vaginal secretion which is an indicator of ovulation.\n\n【13】#### Pregnancy:\n\n【14】During pregnancy, due to an increased level of hormones inside the mother's body, the vaginal secretion is increased but without any itching or foul smell. The secretion is commonly white or mildly grey in color associated with a musty smell.\n\n【15】#### Menopause:\n\n【16】Vaginal secretions decrease after menopause due to the effect of a decrease in sex hormone production inside the body.\n\n【17】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【18】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-3:<u>I have vaginal discharge, itching and irritation while peeing.

Bloody, brown colored discharge:**\n\n【46】This can be due to periods, or cervical or endometrial cancer. This can be associated with pelvic pain.\n\n【47】**2\\. Yellow or cloudy:**\n\n【48】Infection like Gonorrhea. The other associated symptoms include pelvic pain, involuntary or uncontrolled urination, bleeding in between periods cycle.\n\n【49】**3\\. Yellow, greenish and frothy with a bad smell:**\n\n【50】This is seen in cases of trichomoniasis and can be associated with itching and pain while urinating.\n\n【51】**4\\. Pink colored:**\n\n【52】This is seen due to uterine lining shedding after delivery of the baby.\n\n【53】**5\\. White and cheesy thick secretion:**\n\n【54】This is very common and is caused due to yeast or fungal infections. The associated symptoms include pain and swelling around the vulva, pain during sexual intercourse, and itching.\n\n【55】**6\\. White or grey or yellow secretion with fishy odor:**\n\n【56】This is another common condition caused due to bacterial vaginosis and rarely associated with itching, but redness and swelling around the vulva can be seen.\n\n【57】**Based on the days of the menstrual cycle and color of the discharge: In normal conditions, it is as follows:**\n\n【58】*   Days 1 to 5: Beginning of cycle cum periods, it is red or bloody due to the shedding of the uterine lining.\n\n【59】*   Days 6 to 14: Less vaginal discharge with cloudy or milky and sticky mucus.\n\n【60】*   Days 14 to 25: Thin and slippery mucus. Once the ovulation occurs, the mucus again turns to milky, yellow or cloudy and may be sticky.\n\n【61】*   Days 25 to 28: Lightening of cervical mucus and less in quantity before the starting of next period.\n\n【62】How vaginal discharge is diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【63】On visiting the doctor, he will start with getting a complete history of yours (medical and personal) along with details regarding your vaginal discharge along with the associated other symptoms and medical examination. If required, a vaginal swab might be taken to help in confirming the diagnosis along with microbiological examination, pH estimation. PAP smear can also be used to diagnose the condition.\n\n【64】###### _Source Image Credit: ouh.nhs_\n\n【65】What are the treatment and prevention methods?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【66】Once the diagnosis is confirmed for a pathological condition, the treatment aims at eradicating the underlying disease which can be done using antimicrobials (ant-fungal, anti-virals or anti-bacterial) along with symptomatic relief.\n\n【67】**The prevention can be done using the following methods:**\n\n【68】1\\. Washing the vagina properly with the help of mild soap and water and keeping the area clean.\n\n【69】2\\. Wear properly fitting (not too tight or loose garments) preferably cotton.\n\n【70】3\\. Do not use scented or high chemicals near the vagina.\n\n【71】4\\. After using the washroom, wipe from front to back in order to prevent migration of organisms from anus to vagina.\n\n【72】5\\. Have protected sex if not planning for a baby.\n\n【73】Even though vaginal secretions are common, they might also be due to some underlying pathological condition and hence it is better to consult your physician when in doubt in order to cure and get guided about the condition earlier and this can be achieved from the comfort of your home with the help of online medical platforms. This helps to consult your doctor online in just a click.\n\n【74】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【75】* * *\n\n【76】#### **1.**删除换行**How Much Vaginal Discharge Is Normal?**\n\n【77】Under normal conditions, women usually produce vaginal discharge in an amount ranging from one to four ml in 24 hours. However, this quantity tends to change daily, and it is commonly affected by normal and artificial factors like ovulation and birth control.\n\n【78】#### **2.**删除换行**How to Get Rid of Vaginal Discharge?**\n\n【79】Vaginal discharge can be prevented by keeping the vaginal area always clean by washing it frequently with a bar of gentle, mild soap and warm water. Scented soaps and feminine products or douche should be avoided as they may irritate the vaginal area that can lead to infections. Personal hygiene measures like once the woman has used the bathroom, she should always ensure to wipe from front to back for the prevention of bacteria from getting inside the vaginal canal and leading to an infection.\n\n【80】#### **3.**删除换行**Why Do I Have Vaginal Discharge?**\n\n【81】Increased vaginal discharge can be normal in most women, mainly caused by the regular menstrual cycle changes. Pathological causes could be a vaginal infection or cancer, which is not quite ordinary. If a woman experiences a vaginal discharge that is more than her usual amount, it is advised to seek a consultation with a gynecologist. Vaginal discharge is widespread with associated symptoms like itching or burning near and around the vagina, indicating vaginitis.\n\n【82】#### **4.**删除换行**Why Is My Vaginal Discharge Brown?**\n\n【83】Brown vaginal discharge noted right after a menses might just indicate the remaining blood of that cycle. Spotting of blood or brownish-white discharge can occur when the woman is in her mid-cycle. Sometimes brown vaginal discharge can be abnormal, especially in early pregnancy, known as a spot that might be caused due to an abortion.\n\n【84】#### **5.**删除换行**How to Stop Vaginal Discharge?**\n\n【85】Treatment options are available to treat abnormal and excessive vaginal discharge conditions. It is mainly treated symptomatically based on the cause of the discharge. However, it is reasonable to have 4 to 6 ml of vaginal discharge produced to protect the female genitalia from acquiring infections and provide lubrication for sexual intercourse. This average amount does not have to be stopped.\n\n【86】#### **6.**删除换行**What Color Should Vaginal Discharge Be?**\n\n【87】The amount of vaginal discharge produced can vary in different women, also can the odor and color.

Emergency medical care should be given when a pregnant woman experiences abnormal vaginal discharge with abnormal color and odor.\n\n【98】#### **12.**删除换行**Is It Normal to Have Discharge every day?**\n\n【99】Yes, it is normal to have vaginal discharge every day in an amount ranging from 4 to 6 ml. The vaginal fluid serves as a protective mechanism and also a lubricant during sexual intercourse that provides moisture.\n\n【100】#### **13.**删除换行**Does Uti Cause Discharge in Females?**\n\n【101】Yes, the female's chief symptom of a urinary tract infection is noted to be vaginal discharge. The nature and appearance of the vaginal discharge appear based on the cause of urinary tract infection. Urinary tract infection also presents with flank pain, fever, and pain during urination.\n\n【102】#### **14.**删除换行**Can Stress Cause Vaginal Discharge?**\n\n【103】Yes, stress is capable of causing vaginal discharge in women. Due to the alterations that are done in the hormonal levels of a female during a sudden increase in emotional stress, or women who are having a stressful daily routine, they can be noted to have vaginal discharge.\n\n【104】#### **15.**删除换行**What Are the Home Remedies for Discharge?**\n\n【105】There are a variety of effective home remedies that are present to treat vaginal discharge. That includes the usage of boric acid, the essential oil of oregano, probiotic suppositories, and supplements that are effective against certain yeast species, coconut oil application, tea tree oil, apple cider vinegar, and garlic intake.\n\n【106】#### **16.**删除换行**What Should I Eat to Stop White Discharge?**\n\n【107】Based on the studies of Ayurvedic medicine, the most essential food causes of white vaginal discharge are foods that are rich in fats, sugars, highly calorific, and cold beverages. The risk further increases with the intake of an unhealthy diet, especially during menstruation.\n\n【108】#### **17.**删除换行**How Can I Stop White Discharge Naturally?**\n\n【109】In most women, vaginal discharge resolves naturally by home remedies. It includes the use of boric acid, the essential oil of oregano, probiotic suppositories, and effective supplements against certain yeast species, coconut oil application, tea tree oil, apple cider vinegar, and garlic intake.\n\n【110】#### **18.**删除换行**Is Too Much Discharge Bad?**\n\n【111】Yes, too much vaginal discharge is terrible for a woman's health. Too much vaginal discharge indicates poor sanitary habits and infections that could be as severe as sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, immediate medical care from a gynecologist is required to prevent complications.\n\n【112】#### **19.**删除换行**Is Vaginal Discharge Normal?**\n\n【113】Yes, it is normal to have vaginal discharge daily in normal amounts because the vaginal fluid serves as an essential protective layer from germs by its acidic nature and also a lubricant during sexual intercourse that provides moisture and prevents dyspareunia.\n\n【114】#### **20.**删除换行**Vaginal Discharge After Intercourse?**\n\n【115】Some amount of vaginal discharge after sexual activities is usually expected. It is mainly due to the hormonal changes in a woman's sexual arousal and is not usually accompanied by pain or any associated symptoms. However, new white discharge after unprotected sexual intercourse can sign an infection transmitted during the last sexual intercourse. Common causes of those vaginal discharges include bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, and sexually transmitted infection.\n\n【116】#### **21.**删除换行**Is Milky Discharge After Sex a Sign of Cervical Cancer?**\n\n【117】Abnormal vaginal bleeding in between the menstrual cycle and after intercourse, or even after the woman has attained menopause, are chief symptoms of cervical cancer. However, the presence of vaginal discharge that does not resolve, and appears to be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling are also signs of cervical cancer.\n\n【118】#### **22.**删除换行**How Many Days Before Period Does White Discharge Occur?**\n\n【119】Before a period, vaginal discharge appears for three to five days, which looks white, cloudy, or sticky. All these changes occur during the follicular phase, where an egg is developing in the female ovary. During this period, the right amount of bright and stretchy or clear and watery discharge is seen, and it is normal at the time of ovulation.\n\n【120】#### **23.**删除换行**What Does Early Pregnancy Discharge Look Like?**\n\n【121】In most pregnant females, sticky, white, or pale-yellow mucus can be seen during their first trimester, and some women have it throughout their pregnancy.

The contractions help widen the cervix, making the baby’s journey through the birth canal easier. Unlike actual labor contractions, prodromal labor contractions do not get closer or stronger together and do not cause any cervical changes. The word “prodromal” originates from a Greek word that means precursor. However, doctors do not use the terms prodromal labor and false labor often as they find them misleading or imprecise.\n\n【2】What Is Prodromal Labor?\n------------------------\n\n【3】Prodromal or false labor is a part of labor that occurs before active labor, where noticeable patterns of contractions begin and end but do not progress into labor. First-time parents experience prodromal labor of less severity and duration than people who have already given birth. Prodromal labor can happen days, weeks, or even a month before active labor. Prodromal labor contractions often come and go at the same time every day or at regular intervals. Even though prodromal labor contractions do not progress beyond a certain point or dilate the cervix, they can be considered the closest thing to active labor one can experience.\n\n【4】What Are the Causes of Prodromal Labor?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【5】There is no definitive cause for prodromal labor. However, the possible causes of prodromal labor are as follows:\n\n【6】*   Irregular pelvis.\n\n【7】*   Anxiety or stress.\n\n【8】*   Uterine anomalies.\n\n【9】*   Changes in the position of the baby, especially breech baby (baby’s feet or buttocks are positioned to come out of the birth canal first).\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Herpes Labialis</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Viral Exanthem Rash - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Presyncope- Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   History of having three or more previous pregnancies.\n    </u>\n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms of Prodromal Labor?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【12】The symptoms of prodromal labor are almost similar to the actual labor and are as follows:\n\n【13】*   Hardening or tightening in the front portion of the abdomen.\n\n【14】*   Contractions of short duration (one minute) that come and go.\n\n【15】*   Cramping or pain that does not get severe with time.\n\n【16】*   Contractions that occur five minutes apart and do not get closer than that.\n\n【17】*   No cervical dilation or no change in the cervix since the previous week.\n\n【18】*   Contractions that become better on drinking water, changing positions, or taking rest.\n\n【19】How to Differentiate Prodromal Labor From Active Labor?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Even though prodromal labor is a lot like active labor, there are differences in the contractions experienced. The differences are as follows:\n\n【21】*   **Frequency of Contractions:** The contractions can be monitored using a clock or watch. The time at which each contraction begins should be noted down. Prodromal labor contractions are irregular, whereas active labor contractions follow a regular pattern and grow closer together.\n\n【22】*   **Duration of Contractions:** The duration of each contraction should be noted by jotting down the time it begins and stops. The duration of prodromal contractions varies, whereas active labor contractions last for more than 30 seconds at the onset and can extend progressively up to 60 seconds.\n\n【23】*   **Changes in Contractions:** Active labor contractions continue regardless of the mother’s activity and may become stronger with activities like walking. On the other hand, prodromal labor contractions stop regardless of the mother’s activity.\n\n【24】*   **Nature of Contractions:** In active labor contractions, pain starts high in the abdomen and radiates throughout the entire abdomen and lower back or vice versa. In prodromal labor, contractions are concentrated in the groin and lower abdomen.\n\n【25】Is Prodromal Labor an Indicator of Active Labor?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Even though prodromal labor occurs during the last month of pregnancy, it does not mean that active labor is going to occur the next day or even week. Prodromal labor may lead to active labor, but it does not cause active labor to start. As birth and labor are unpredictable, prodromal labor can be considered only as the body’s way of preparing for active labor and delivery.\n\n【27】How to Diagnose Prodromal Labor?\n--------------------------------\n\n【28】Generally, prodromal labor does not require a diagnosis as it is not considered a complication or medical emergency. Women who have experienced prodromal labor before can differentiate prodromal labor contractions from real labor. However, women who have not experienced prodromal labor in previous pregnancies or are pregnant for the first time may need the advice of a doctor to help them differentiate it from active labor contractions. The doctor collects information about the timing, intensity, and duration of the contractions. The doctor may suspect prodromal labor in a patient with on and off contractions. The doctor will perform a pelvic examination to find out if the cervix has begun to dilate. No signs of dilation or extremely small change since the last examination would indicate prodromal labor. Clinically contractions that do not cause any cervical change are diagnosed as prodromal labor. Additionally, a cervical length of 1.5 centimeters or less is considered the most accurate clinical sign of true labor.\n\n【29】How to Cope With Prodromal Labor?\n---------------------------------\n\n【30】It is important to take rest during prodromal labor contractions as it is going to help in conserving energy for the actual labor and delivery. The measures that can help in coping with prodromal labor are as follows:\n\n【31】*   Taking a shower in warm water.\n\n【32】*   Drinking lots of water to stay hydrated.\n\n【33】*   Indulging in activities like watching a movie, reading a book, listening to music, or drinking a safe herbal tea.\n\n【34】*   Trying some light activity like packing the hospital bag.\n\n【35】*   Eating well. Munching on some snacks can also help.\n\n【36】*   Taking short leisurely walks.\n\n【37】*   If prodromal labor occurs at night, trying to get some sleep may help.\n\n【38】*   Trying meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga.\n\n【39】**Conclusion:**\n\n【40】Prodromal labor can be frustrating for the mother who is about to deliver the baby in a few days. Even though prodromal labor can cause painful contractions, it helps in preparing for active labor that leads to the birth of the baby. Any type of contractions which are doubtful should be reported to the doctor immediately to find out if they are part of active labor or prodromal labor. Delay in informing the doctor about the contractions might lead to accidental home birth. Staying positive by knowing about the ways to cope with prodromal labor and looking at the brighter side helps women prepare for stress-free delivery.\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>*   Prodromal Labor  \n    https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/labor-and-birth/prodromal-labor/\n*   How Long Does Prodromal Labor Last?

It is the non-occurrence of the outer covering of the heart. It is a congenital disorder. This has a prevalence of 0.0002 % and has been found more in males as compared to females. The defect can be a complete, incomplete, or partial absence of the pericardium. People with such defects are asymptomatic, and the maximum cases are incidental findings. However, there are options to correct pericardial agenesis.\n\n【2】Why Does the Absence of Pericardium Happen?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The heart develops in the third week of intrauterine life. The two heart tubes fuse into a single heart tube by lateral foldings. This line of fusion is called the transverse septum, and lateral foldings are called pleuropericardial folds. Failure of fusion of the pericardial sac at the transverse septum or the pleuropericardial folds. These folds are supplied by ducts of Cuvier. In cases of premature atrophy of the ducts of Cuvier can cause pericardial agenesis.\n\n【4】What Are the Symptoms in the Absence of Pericardium?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Patients are asymptomatic and live normal lives. Even after doing regular physical activity, sports, stress-related work, traveling, etc. patients never have breathing problems, pain, or headaches. These findings are often incidental and need treatment if symptoms arise.\n\n【6】Symptoms like chest pain, dyspnea, restlessness, syncope, heart compression, or acute infarction could be seen.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-3:<u>Why am I having sharp pain just left of sternum?</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-3:<u>What is the reason for chest pain that occurs with deep breath and pressing?</u>\n\n【11】Morning Sickness - Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention\n\n【12】How to Diagnose the Absence of Pericardium?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Common cardiac function tests include electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).\n\n【14】*   **Electrocardiogram** \\- An ECG (electrocardiogram) may reveal changes when the patient is placed on the same side of the defect. In order to explain better, for a patient with pericardial agenesis defect on the left side of the heart, ECG changes are noted when the patient is examined in the left lateral position. However, the ECG comes normal when the position is changed to supine or right lateral. The ECG reports will be increased sinus rhythm with a deviation of the axis to the affected side, absence of R-wave growth, and presence of swinging phenomenon on the affected side.\n\n【15】*   **X-Rays** - They are taken on a regular basis to view hard tissue changes (bone). It also shows dense, soft tissues, such as the heart. Yet the impression of the heart on the X-ray remains inaccurate. However, change in the shape of the heart and change in size and position of the heart can be noted. In the absence of pericardium, the shift of position of the heart towards the affected side is seen, thus losing the integrity of the cardiac groove.\n\n【16】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** \\- The accurate test to view soft organs in the body is MRI. On MRI, a shift of the heart to the defect site can be seen; heart apex placed posteriorly, no pericardial effusion, absence of complete pericardial lining around the heart, interposition of lung tissue between the heart aorta and pulmonary artery, and affected side lung interposition between the diaphragm and inferior side of the heart on the affected side.\n\n【17】What Other Factors Can Be Seen With Pericardial Agenesis?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The congenital defect of pericardial agenesis is often associated with other disorders, collectively called syndromes.\n\n【19】*   **Marfan Syndrome**\\- It is a genetic disorder affecting connective tissues in the body. The syndrome affects the connective tissue fibers and ligaments, thus affecting bone, muscles, and organs. People with such syndrome present with tall and thin body types, long and thin fingers, and overly flexible joints. Cardiac Marfan syndrome, which is a syndrome affecting the heart, has a higher risk of mitral valve prolapse and aortic aneurysm, which are life-threatening. Treatment of this disease is based on addressing the symptoms. It can be treated with medications like beta channel blockers and calcium channel blockers or surgically repair the valve and aorta as symptoms arise.\n\n【20】*   **Vater Syndrome**\\- A congenital defect of unknown cause. The effects are vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiovascular anomalies, tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia, renal anomalies, and limb defects. Physicians prefer to treat such conditions symptomatically.\n\n【21】*   **Pallister-Killian Syndrome**\\- A genetically inherited rare disorder that affects the muscles. This syndrome extremely weakens the muscles in infants and causes intellectual disability, shortened limbs, facial hypoplasia, flat nasal bridge, frontal bossing of the forehead, high arched palate, and cardiac defects. This condition can be diagnosed prenatally through USG- ultrasonography. However, symptomatic treatment is the choice.\n\n【22】What Are the Types of Pericardial Defects?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The pericardium is a two-layer structure enclosing the most important organ of the body, the heart-serous layer (outer layer) and visceral layer (inner layer).\n\n【24】Defects involving pericardium can be acquired or congenital.\n\n【25】*   **Acquired Pericardial Defects** - They occur from infection or injury to the heart that is attained after birth. The most common is pericarditis. It can be constrictive or restrictive pericarditis, acute or recurrent pericarditis, pericardial effusion, or cardiac tamponade. Treating these conditions vary according to the disease.\n\n【26】*   **Congenital Pericardial Defects** - They are present from birth. The most anticipated common cause is developmental disturbance during the formation of the heart. Pericardial defects can be of different grades and affect different locations in the heart. It can affect the left or right side - that is, the absence of pericardium on the left side of the heart or right side of the heart. It can be graded as complete absence, incomplete, partial, or diaphragmatic. As per defect size, it can be mild, moderate, or severe. Treatment requires surgical intervention.\n\n【27】How to Treat Pericardial Agenesis?\n----------------------------------\n\n【28】Some organs of the human body have the ability to regenerate and repair physiologically. Sadly, pericardium cannot repair or regenerate itself. Hence, to correct pericardial agenesis, surgical intervention is required. Mild to moderate grades of pericardial agenesis need pericardiectomy, widening of the discontinuity to reduce risks of heart incarceration, and pericardial plasty by conservative surgery or surgical repair.\n\n【29】*   **Pericardiectomy** \\- This procedure involves complete removal of the pericardium.\n\n【30】*   **Pericardial Plastic** - Includes repair of the defect with alloplastic graft or patchwork from the adjacent pericardium or Gore-Tex graft.\n\n【31】However, treating pericardial agenesis has been a topic of continuous research and controversies with research in medical science.\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】Pericardium absence is a rare birth defect that is clinically asymptomatic. It is often found to be associated with syndromes. Syndromic cardiac defects need immediate treatment and must consult pediatricians and neonatologists. With early detection of the underlying causes and suitable, timely intervention helps avoid fatalities to a great extent.\n\n【34】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【35】* * *\n\n【36】#### **1.**删除换行**How Is Pericarditis Managed?**\n\n【37】Pericarditis is managed by eliminating the causative agent and treating the symptoms. The primary treatment is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce the body’s inflammation caused by pericarditis.\n\n【38】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is the Best Diagnostic Test for Pericarditis?**\n\n【39】Cardiac computed tomography or CT scan is the best diagnostic test for pericarditis. The test can detect constrictive pericarditis by showing the signs of heart thickening.\n\n【40】#### **3.**删除换行**Is the Diagnosis of Pericarditis Challenging?**\n\n【41】Diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is challenging because it is a rare condition that gets confused with other common diagnoses.\n\n【42】#### **4.**删除换行**Does Pericarditis Cause Any Major Complications?**\n\n【43】The complications related to pericarditis are as follows:  \n\\- Constrictive pericarditis or scarring and thickening of the heart’s lining.  \n\\- Pericardial effusion or fluid build-up around the heart.   \n\\- Cardiac tamponade or pressure on the heart caused by fluid build-up.\n\n【44】#### **5.**删除换行**Can Pericarditis Be Diagnosed Clinically?**\n\n【45】Pericarditis can be diagnosed clinically based on the following outcomes:  \n\\- Pericardial friction rub.  \n\\- Chest pain.  \n\\- Pericardial effusion.  \n\\- ECG (electrocardiogram) changes.\n\n【46】#### **6.**删除换行**Can We See Pericarditis on ECG?**\n\n【47】Electrocardiogram or ECG is very helpful in diagnosing acute pericarditis condition. It shows diffuse ST-segment elevation and other symptoms of acute pericarditis.\n\n【48】#### **7.**删除换行**Can Chest X-ray Show Pericarditis?**\n\n【49】Chest X-ray shows constrictive pericarditis symptoms and presents pleural effusions without biatrial enlargements and significant alveolar edema. In addition, chest X-rays usually show the thickness of the heart lining, thus indicating constrictive pericarditis.\n\n【50】#### **8.**删除换行**Which Drugs Can Cause Pericarditis?**\n\n【51】Drugs such as Isoniazid and Procainamide can cause pericarditis in a person through the reactions caused by lupus erythematosus.

It is caused by the Marburg virus belonging to the Filoviridae family (filovirus). The only other known member of the Filoviridae family is the Ebola virus. Both viruses cause rare diseases and outbreaks with high fatality rates. MVD is characterized by viral hemorrhagic fever with a fatality rate as high as 88 %.\n\n【2】In 1967 the Marburg virus was first discovered when two large outbreaks were reported concurrently in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany and Belgrade, Serbia. The initial outbreak was due to laboratory exposure to African green monkeys imported from Uganda. Thirty-one individuals were seriously ill, including the laboratory workers, healthcare professionals, and family members who came in contact with them. The mortality rate was 23 %. Sporadic outbreaks of MVD have been reported throughout Africa as in Uganda, Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Angola, and South Africa. In addition, cases have also been reported outside Africa, though infrequently.\n\n【3】How Is Marburg Virus Disease Transmitted?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【4】The African fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus is the host of the Marburg virus. These fruit bats are residents of various caves and mines throughout Africa. Though the transmission from these bats to humans is unclear, unprotected contact with theinfected bat feces or aerosols is most likely the suspected transmission mode. Further, human-to-human transmission occurs via direct contact. It could be through:\n\n【5】*   Cuts or bruises in the skin or mucous membrane.\n\n【6】*   Infected blood or body fluids include sweat, saliva, semen, breast milk, urine, feces, or amniotic fluid.\n\n【7】*   Contaminated objects of an infected person.\n\n【8】*   Infection to the health care workers while treating an infected patient can happen with poor infection control, contaminated equipment, or improper sterilization protocol.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Diagnostic Tools for Ebola Virus</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Emerging Infectious Diseases - Causes and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Viral Hemorrhagic Fever - Types, Causes, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Direct contact with the deceased body is also capable of transmitting the infection.\n\n【10】*   Individuals can transmit the infection as long as the virus is present in their blood.\n    </u>\n\n【11】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of This Disease?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The period from the onset of infection to the appearance of the first symptoms is known as the incubation period, which is 2 to 21 days in MVD. After that, the disease begins abruptly with high-grade fever, chills, headache, and fatigue. The course of this disease is given below:\n\n【13】How Is This Disease Diagnosed?\n------------------------------\n\n【14】Clinical diagnosis of MVD can be difficult as the signs and symptoms overlap various infectious diseases and other endemic conditions. Confirmatory diagnostic tests include:\n\n【15】*   **ELISA –** Antigen and Antibody capture (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).\n\n【16】*   **PCR –** Polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【17】*   Virus isolation and culture.\n\n【18】*   Electron microscopy.\n\n【19】*   Serum neutralization assays.\n\n【20】*   **RT-PCR -** reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【21】The samples collected from infected patients are considered extreme biohazards. Hence all samples should be handled with extreme caution. They should be transported with a triple packaging system and handled only in a high-containment laboratory. Antibody-ELISA is exceptionally beneficial for testing patients for follow-up, recovery, or during the later phases of the disease. In addition, Immunohistochemistry, PCR, virus isolation, and culture may be used in deceased patients to test retrospectively.\n\n【22】How Can MVD Be Treated?\n-----------------------\n\n【23】Presently no vaccines or specific treatments have proved efficient in treating or preventing MVD. Therefore, supportive measures such as hydration, maintaining the fluid-electrolyte balance, sustaining the oxygen saturation and blood pressure, and specific treatments pertaining to complications or other adverse events are being followed to prevent fatalities.\n\n【24】Monoclonal antibodies and antivirals like Remdesivir and Favipiravir that have proved efficient in the Ebola virus clinical trials can also be studied and tested for MVD. Additionally, the European Medicine Agency (EMA) granted an Ebola vaccine regimen comprising Zabdeno (Ad26.ZEBOV) and Mvabea (MVA-BN-Filo) to deliver acquired immunity against the Ebola virus. These vaccines may prove efficacious against MVD; however, further clinical trials are required to assess the safety and efficacy against the Marburg virus.\n\n【25】What Are the Ways to Prevent MVD?\n---------------------------------\n\n【26】Increasing awareness and efficient community involvement are vital in preventing the spread of the disease. In addition, isolating the affected individuals, using appropriate protective measures, and prompt diagnosis is imminent to prevent a large outbreak or development of a pandemic. Certain measures to prevent and control the disease are:\n\n【27】*   Reduce the risk of spread from the infected bats to humans. Individuals visiting the caves or mines infested with fruit bats should wear protective equipment such as a mask, gloves, eye shield, or protective face shield. In addition, they should take care not to touch rodent feces or droppings. In case of an outbreak, people who consume meat should cook it thoroughly before consuming it.\n\n【28】*   Human-to-human transmission can be curtailed by restricting direct physical contact with the infected person. Appropriate isolation protocol should be followed. Health workers and caregivers should preferably wear personal protective equipment, which should be disposed of carefully after every visit. Good hand hygiene techniques should be strictly followed.\n\n【29】*   Community spread can be restricted by increasing public awareness of the disease. In addition, maintaining good environmental hygiene, monitoring diseases, isolating the healthy from the sick, and safely burying the deceased can prevent contamination and control its spread.\n\n【30】*   WHO recommends that affected male survivors practice safe sex for 12 months from the onset of symptoms or twice till their semen sample tests negative.\n\n【31】How to Control Infection in a Healthcare Setting?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Healthcare and laboratory workers must take extra caution and care to prevent nosocomial infections. Certain measures that could control the spread of the disease in a hospital environment are:\n\n【33】*   Best hand hygiene practice.\n\n【34】*   Respiratory hygiene.\n\n【35】*   Use personal protective equipment such as a gown, mask, gloves, face shield, and eye shield.\n\n【36】*   Safe injection procedures.\n\n【37】*   Dignified and safe burial for the deceased.\n\n【38】*   Appropriate infection control of the contaminated belongings such as clothing or bedding.\n\n【39】*   The personal protective equipment should be removed and disposed of without causing any further contamination.\n\n【40】Which Specialists Treat Marburg Virus?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】Hematologists, Infection-specialists, Critical care specialists, and pulmonologists are those who treat Marburg viral infection.\n\n【42】**Conclusion:**\n\n【43】MVD is a rare condition in humans. However, considering the fruit bats' widespread geographic distribution and the virus's prolonged incubation period, the potential risk for global spread is higher, thus posing a significant public health hazard. Prevention and control should be most emphasized, given the high fatality rates of MVD and no specific treatments or vaccines. Early awareness, sufficient isolation, and protection protocol improving diagnostics, particularly in rural areas, and effective community surveillance can help prevent a larger outbreak or possible future pandemic of Marburg virus disease.\n\n【44】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>*   Marburg virus disease  \n    https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease\n*   Marburg (Marburg Virus Disease)  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/marburg/prevention/index.html\n*   Marburg virus outbreak in 2022: a public health concern  \n    https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2666-5247%2822%2900258-0</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

On the contrary, non-communicable diseases can be inherited from one generation to another.\n\n【30】*   **Causative Agents:** The causative agents in communicable diseases are the pathogens that are highly infectious and are transmitted by vectors through different routes like transmission through blood, bodily fluids, fecal-oral, sexual contact, skin, surface contamination, droplet, etc. The causative agents in non-communicable diseases are lifestyle changes, environmental changes, allergies, abnormalities in cell proliferation, malnutrition, nutrient deficiency, etc.\n\n【31】*   **Type:** Communicable diseases can develop over a short period of exposure (or almost immediately) to the causative agents; thus, they have an acute onset. Whereas non-communicable diseases develop over a period of time and last for a long duration; thus, they are chronic diseases.\n\n【32】*   **Infecting Agent:** The agents causing communicable diseases are bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Non-communicable diseases have no causative agents in the development and progression of the disease.\n\n【33】*   **Treatment Modality**: Communicable diseases are treated with conventional methods. Non-communicable diseases are treated and monitored through conservative measures or surgical methods.\n\n【34】*   **Preventive Measures**: Vaccination (with regular dosing and scheduling), wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing, maintaining personal hygiene, and frequent and thorough handwashing are the essential preventive measures to protect from communicable diseases. Whereas routine evaluation and monitoring of health and lifestyle interventions like diet, physical activity, and good personal hygiene are preventive measures in avoiding or reducing the risk of developing non-communicable diseases.\n\n【35】*   **Examples:** Examples of communicable diseases include AIDS, COVID-19, Ebola, tuberculosis, ringworm, etc. Non-communicable diseases include diabetes, hypertension, allergies, cancer, heart disease, pneumonia, etc.\n\n【36】What Are the Types of Transmission of Communicable Diseases?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Communicable diseases can spread through:\n\n【38】**1\\. Direct Transmission** \\- Infectious diseases can be spread through direct contacts, such as:\n\n【39】*   **Person to Person:** The most common ways that communicable diseases are transmitted are through infected blood, the interchange of bodily fluids during sexual activity, skin-to-skin contact, surface or item contamination, and droplets from the infected person's cough or sneeze.\n\n【40】*   **Animal to Person:** It occurs by being bitten or scratched by insects or infected animals. The other most common example is toxoplasmosis, an infection caused by the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which usually develops by consumption of undercooked and contaminated meat, being exposed to infected cat feces, or transmission from the mother to the child during pregnancy.\n\n【41】*   **Congenitally:** It is also known as mother-to-unborn child transmission, where contagious infections, including toxoplasmosis, HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis, Chagas, rubella, herpes simplex virus, etc. are vertically transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. The route of transmission is through the placenta, breast milk, or from the infected causative pathogens present in the vagina exposed to the baby during childbirth.\n\n【42】**2\\. Indirect Transmission -**This can spread through transmission from infected air, water, food, surface, or object contamination.\n\n【43】What Are the Common Symptoms of Communicable Diseases?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Some of the common symptoms of infectious communicable diseases include:\n\n【45】*   Flu-like-symptoms.\n\n【46】*   Fatigue.\n\n【47】*   Headache.\n\n【48】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【49】*   Dysentery.\n\n【50】*   Diarrhea.\n\n【51】*   Cough.\n\n【52】*   Runny nose.\n\n【53】*   Rashes.\n\n【54】*   Itching.\n\n【55】*   Muscle aches.\n\n【56】*   Joint pain.\n\n【57】*   Reduced sensory function.\n\n【58】What Are the Risk Factors for Developing Communicable Diseases?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【59】*   While anyone can contract a communicable disease, it is more likely that individuals who have issues with their immune system or have low immunity are more prone to develop or contract communicable diseases. This is because their body’s immune system can not fight foreign invaders or disease-causing organisms (bacteria, viruses)\n\n【60】*   Individuals taking steroids or other medications that suppress their immune system, such as anti-rejection drugs for transplanted organs, are also prone to communicable diseases.\n\n【61】*   Individuals with certain types of cancer or other medical conditions can hamper their immune systems.\n\n【62】*   In addition, other medical conditions may also predispose an individual to transmissible infections, including implanted medical devices, malnutrition in childhood, and old age.\n\n【63】What Are the Communicable Diseases That Are Prevalent Now?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【64】In the recent past, COVID-19 disease, monkeypox, Zika, dengue, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola, cholera, H1N1, measles, yellow flu, avian flu, influenza A, Lassa fever are the most common emerging and re-emerging communicable disease outbreak prevalent in the world.\n\n【65】How Can Communicable Diseases Be Treated?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【66】Some communicable diseases simply produce mild symptoms that subside on their own. Others could result in serious symptoms or complications that could be fatal. Treatment for various communicable diseases includes the following:\n\n【67】*   **Bacterial Infections:** A course of antibiotics may be necessary for someone with a bacterial infection to help control the infection. These drugs can help kill the disease-causing bacteria or inhibit bacterial growth so the immune system can fight them.\n\n【68】*   **Viral Infections:** Several viral infections can be prevented with the use of vaccines. A weakened form of the virus is given to the patient as a vaccine. In response, the immune system creates antibodies that can later kill a strong or active virus. However, an individual who is already affected by a viral infection will require antiviral drugs to treat the infection.\n\n【69】*   **Fungal Infection:** Antifungal drugs in the form of pills and topical ointments can be prescribed to treat various fungal infections.\n\n【70】**Conclusion:**\n\n【71】Communicable diseases, also known as infectious diseases, contagious diseases, or transmissible diseases, are illnesses that result from the spread of infection from one person to another via an array of susceptible routes like blood, fluids from the body, sexual contact, skin, surface contamination, presence and growth of pathogenic and biologic agents (that have the potential to cause infections) in an individual human or an animal host.\n\n【72】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【73】无关删除-1:<u>*   Alameda Country Public Health Department- List of Communicable Diseases  \n    https://acphd.org/communicable-disease/list-of-communicable-diseases/\n*   WHO- Disease Outbreak News (DONs)  \n    https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Hence the oral surgeon or the implantologist often adopts crucial choices that may deviate from conventional implant surgery and prosthesis at times, be it by bone augmentation, regeneration, under preparation of the implant osteotomy site, or selecting a specific implant diameter, length, or thread design that varies from patient to patient.\n\n【2】What Are the Evolutionary Variations and Development of Jaw Bone Density?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The average bone density is not uniform throughout the jaw and varies at different positions that depend on our dentition, the masticatory, and jaw forces. For the stabilization of dental implants, bone density is an essential factor that influences osseointegration success. According to traditional medical research, the different bone densities within the maxillary and mandibular arches are related to human evolutionary pressures within the cranium region of our skull to keep it light at a sufficient pace. This may also be according to widely understood theories of evolution. The numerous developments prenatally and postnatally eventually transformed the facial skeleton and skull bones. The earliest observations in implant dentistry are interlinked to the understanding that the maxilla or the upper jaw acts as a force distribution unit, and the mandible or lower jaw acts as a force absorption unit.\n\n【4】Therefore, the changes in bone density or the tooth anatomy, especially in the anterior section of the jaw bones, are as per evolutionary changes. Research upon it indicates that primarily the varying functions of incisors, canines that exert the grinding forces or the comparatively sharper incisal edges, are responsible for the anterior bone density changes. Also, because the functionality of the anterior teeth is mainly for food tearing and cutting purposes, these teeth withstand lateral displacement forces that require more resistance to stress, strain forces, and more bone support primarily.\n\n【5】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-3:<u>Can you suggest a suitable implant for my wife, a 50-year-old with a bone density of D3?</u>\n\n【8】Osseointegration: Science Behind Dental Implant Fusion\n\n【9】Disinfection of Dental Implants in Laboratory\n\n【10】Conversely, when the posterior teeth anatomy is considered, i.e. the premolars and molars, these masticatory forces laterally are reduced. In contrast, the vertical chewing forces for food (masticatory forces) are more. Also, compared to the male and female patients, a significant difference is noticed more in the males with a thicker or higher bone density. In numerous clinical trials and traditional dental implant research, the surveys indicate that male patients had much higher bone density than female patients. Similarly, female patients tend to exhibit a difference in the denser cortical bone than males. While age does not remain a question in terms of predicting bone density, in terms of gender, these differences in bone density may be due to specific anatomic regions that compose the trabecular bone.\n\n【11】What Are the Bone Density Measurement Methods?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The most reliable bone density measurements to accuracy can be obtained thus by the following methods :\n\n【13】A. CT Bone Density Measurements - Through CT scan, the radiographic data can be collected in Hounsfield units that utilize a calibrated scale to objectively measure the jaw bone density. However, in recent decades, the concerns of radiation exposure to the patient have now been addressed by dentists across the globe with the advent of CBCT technology (cone-beam computed tomography).\n\n【14】B. CBCT - Cone beam computed tomography has shown to be very clear in three-dimensional assessment and planning preoperatively and has limited radiation exposure to the patient. Hence, this technique effectively helps dental implant treatment planning, assessing bone density, and assessing the position of the surgical template guide used for correct implant position and placement to prevent angular deviations or operator-based errors.\n\n【15】C. DEXA (Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry) - This technique is extremely advanced with its advent for measuring the bone mineral density, though its measurements are purely two-dimensional. However, like any other 2d imaging modality, this makes it prone to bone artifact errors.\n\n【16】D. Accessory Methods - Other newer methods by advances in implant dentistry include histomorphometric measurements, application-based techniques upon the Archimedes principle, or the other technique introduced being biopsy assessment through micro CT. However, these techniques may not be effective in measuring the bone mineral density compared to the modalities of CT and CBCT and are used as an option available in non-clinical settings because they are also invasive radiographically and may be prone to technical or radiographic errors.\n\n【17】E. Advances in Measuring BMD - The recent advent in implant dentistry by the use of specific torque measuring micromotors is one of the effective techniques that is gaining trend in this field as it enables the operator to measure specific bone density measurements at anatomic regions or particular areas of the jaw just like CBCT and also has an added advantage of quantitatively and intraoperatively aiding in obtaining quantitative data at the specific site. Hence the micromotor-based system is operator dependent and is now considered an advanced, reliable surgical measurement system for bone density.\n\n【18】**Role of Bone Density in Dental Implantation:**\n\n【19】Be it for early or immediate loading protocols adopted by the dental implantologist, implant stabilization within the bone or the BIC (bone-implant contact) is considered the most influential factor for achieving primary stability. Therefore, there should be no micromovements or displacement of the fixtures after the implant insertion to accomplish the same. This can lead to bone loss or inflammation (peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis). In addition, after the displacement exceeds a particular threshold, the implant tends to be mobile, or eventually, it can fail because these displacing forces hinder osseointegration within the trabecular bone.\n\n【20】**Conclusion:**\n\n【21】To conclude, though patients seek implant-supported restorations and dental implants to replace the missing teeth as a long term esthetic and functional option, the dental implantologist should assess the bone density preoperatively because of the variation in trabecular bone density based upon the anatomic region, site, and the patient-related factors discussed. Hence, the treatment options for dental implantation and prosthetic replacement should be customized and planned accordingly by a thorough pre-operative assessment of bone density.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "83ec3261-5828-4e40-9c16-dff364a5a705", "title": "Bacillus cereus Infection", "text": "【0】Bacillus cereus Infection\nWhat Is Bacillus Cereus?\n------------------------\n\n【1】Bacillus cereus is an aerobic gram-positive and rod-shaped bacteria capable of forming spores. It can also at times grow in anaerobic conditions, i.e. in the absence of oxygen. This bacterium produces toxins that bring about diarrheal and emetic types of food poisoning.\n\n【2】What Toxins Are Produced by Bacillus Cereus?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The toxins produced are of two types:\n\n【4】*   One emetic toxin (Cereulide).\n\n【5】*   Three enterotoxins.\n\n【6】The emetic toxin has a ring shape and has a chemical structure similar to that of potassium ionophore valinomycin. It causes emetic types of food poisoning.\n\n【7】The three enterotoxins include the following:\n\n【8】*   Three-component hemolysin (HBL).\n\n【9】*   Three-component non-hemolytic enterotoxin (NHE).\n\n【10】*   One-Cytotoxin K.\n\n【11】Hemolysin is one of the three enterotoxins. Of the three enterotoxins, two are responsible for food poisoning, while the other toxin is only a simple protein component and shows no involvement. Diarrheal type of food poisoning is associated with enterotoxins.\n\n【12】What Causes Bacillus Cereus Infection?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【13】Bacillus cereus is widely prevalent in the soil. Bacillus Cereus is a soil saprophyte and hence is detected in plants. However, few species have been isolated dairy products, eggs, and meat products.\n\n【14】These bacteria grow on food when placed at room temperature or a favorable temperature, say between 8°C to 55°C for more than 2 hours and at a pH greater than 4.8. Once they grow on the food materials, even heat treatment cannot destroy them. This type of bacteria can even grow on foods that have undergone heat treatment. Spores are responsible for food poisoning, germination of which is enhanced by heat treatment.\n\n【15】The formation of vegetative spores is needed for causing the infection. When the food is contaminated with bacteria producing celeuride toxin, emetic symptoms occur, and diarrheal symptoms occur in those infected with bacteria producing enterotoxins.\n\n【16】For an infection to occur and exhibit symptoms, both diarrheal and emetic, the Bacillus cereus should be present in numbers greater than 10,000 for every gram of food. However, few studies suggest that even fewer numbers can cause infections associated with hospitalization.\n\n【17】What Is Bacillus Cereus Infection?\n----------------------------------\n\n【18】It is a food-borne bacterial infection characterized by gastrointestinal illnesses like emetic and diarrheal syndromes.\n\n【19】Once contaminated with the Bacillus cereus, symptoms of an emetic syndrome are seen when there is a production of an emetic toxin called cereulide, and diarrheal symptoms are produced with enterotoxin production. Bacteria enter the human body through contaminated food.\n\n【20】How Is Bacillus Cereus Infection Manifested?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Bacillus cereus infection has two types of manifestations, namely:\n\n【22】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【23】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【24】Ocular and Lens Cultures and Its Bioburden\n\n【25】Acute Medical Conditions in Athletes - Conditions, Symptoms, Treatment\n\n【26】1.  Gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n【27】2.  Extragastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n【28】**1\\. Gastrointestinal Symptoms:**\n\n【29】**a .Emetic-Type**\n\n【30】The following are the symptoms associated with emetic-type:\n\n【31】*   Nausea.\n\n【32】*   Vomiting.\n\n【33】*   In some cases, diarrhea may be present.\n\n【34】The emetic toxin, cereulide, causes these manifestations, and it can occur within half an hour to six hours of taking foods that have been kept at room temperature, although these foods have been reheated.\n\n【35】**b. Diarrheal-Type**\n\n【36】Symptoms of diarrheal-type include the following:\n\n【37】*   Abdominal pain and cramps.\n\n【38】*   Profuse and watery diarrhea. There can be a discharge of blood or mucus with diarrhea at times.\n\n【39】*   Sometimes, nausea and vomiting may be associated.\n\n【40】The enterotoxins produced by Bacillus cereus bacteria are responsible for this type of diarrhea. Eating food that has been stored at room temperature for more than two hours is an important cause of Bacillus cereus infection. The onset of symptoms occurs anywhere between 6 and 15 hours after taking the food.\n\n【41】Both the types of toxins are heat-labile, i.e. they are not destroyed by heat. Also, the symptoms usually resolve within a day of onset.\n\n【42】**2\\. Extragastrointestinal Symptoms**\n\n【43】When the bacillus cereus comes in direct contact with wounds and the bloodstream, there is a risk of a severe type of infection.\n\n【44】The extraintestinal manifestations of Bacillus cereus infection are:\n\n【45】*   Endophthalmitis.\n\n【46】*   Bacteremia.\n\n【47】*   Endocarditis.\n\n【48】*   Keratitis.\n\n【49】*   Infections of the soft tissue and bone.\n\n【50】The risk of developing extraintestinal complications is further increased in the following conditions:\n\n【51】*   In neonates.\n\n【52】*   Immunocompromised individuals.\n\n【53】*   Individuals with intravenous drug abuse.\n\n【54】How Can We Diagnose Bacillus Cereus Infection?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【55】Bacillus cereus infection can be diagnosed by assessing patients' vomitus samples or feces. Isolations of strains or large numbers of the same serotype of Bacillus cereus in the food samples or samples of vomitus or feces help confirm the diagnosis. Serology tests are available for diagnosing the presence of the diarrheal toxin, while biological tests can detect both emetic and diarrheal toxins.\n\n【56】Vitreous fluid is assessed for the presence of Bacillus cereus bacteria to confirm the diagnosis of endophthalmitis, an extraintestinal infection. However, when this bacteria is present in the bloodstream, it is a more serious condition called bacteremia.\n\n【57】How Is Bacillus Cereus Infection Treated?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【58】Bacillus cereus infection does not usually have a need for targeted therapy. Symptomatic treatment along with oral or intravenous rehydration is needed in most patients.\n\n【59】In case of extragastrointestinal infections like endophthalmitis, immediate medical intervention is necessary. Depending on the organism involved, the antibiotics are chosen. The Bacillus cereus is resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, and hence these are not recommended in treating Bacillus cereus infections.\n\n【60】Since Bacillus cereus is resistant to antibiotics like Clindamycin and Erythromycin, they are not the recommended first-line drugs in most cases.\n\n【61】Administration of antibiotics is done through intravenous or intraocular routes when there is a severe risk of systemic infection.\n\n【62】The following antibiotics are recommended in Bacillus cereus infections:\n\n【63】*   Ciprofloxacin.\n\n【64】*   Gentamicin.\n\n【65】*   Rifampicin.\n\n【66】*   Chloramphenicol.\n\n【67】*   Gatifloxacin.\n\n【68】*   Levofloxacin.\n\n【69】*   Streptomycin.\n\n【70】*   Tetracycline.\n\n【71】*   Linezolid.\n\n【72】*   Vancomycin.\n\n【73】*   Moxifloxacin.\n\n【74】*   Tigecycline.\n\n【75】What Are the Complications of Bacillus Cereus Infection?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【76】Gastrointestinal symptoms usually do not cause severe symptoms. However, immunocompromised share a risk of developing fatal complications.\n\n【77】Following are the extraintestinal complications of Bacillus cereus infection:\n\n【78】*   Cellulitis.\n\n【79】*   Gangrene.\n\n【80】*   Septicemia.\n\n【81】*   Aseptic meningitis.\n\n【82】*   Death.\n\n【83】What Is the Differential Diagnosis of Bacillus Cereus Infection?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【84】*   Bacterial infection caused by other groups of bacteria like Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Shigella, Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, and Yersinia enterocolitica.\n\n【85】*   Appendicitis.\n\n【86】*   Rotavirus infections.\n\n【87】*   Mesenteric ischemia.\n\n【88】*   Diverticulitis.\n\n【89】*   Parasitic infections with Cyclospora, Entameba, Giardia, Microsporidium, and Cryptosporidium.\n\n【90】How Can We Prevent Bacillus Cereus Infection?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【91】*   Maintain food at a temperature greater than 60°C or less than 4°C.\n\n【92】*   To destroy the vegetative cells, food should be reheated at a temperature above 74°C for 15 seconds.\n\n【93】*   However, food should be reheated at 121°C for about 80 minutes when the toxins are present, which is almost impossible. Therefore, preventing infection in the first place is important.\n\n【94】*   Leftovers should be rapidly cooled to less than 4°C to prevent contamination.\n\n【95】**Conclusion:**\n\n【96】With adequate preventive measures, preventing the contamination of food by Bacillus cereus is possible. Food products should be handled, processed, and stored effectively. When you have vomiting and diarrhea, it is essential to contact your healthcare provider to identify the cause.\n\n【97】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【98】* * *\n\n【99】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is Bacillus Cereus Infection?**\n\n【100】Bacillus cereus is a gram-positive bacteria that can produce toxins and spores.

It causes food poisoning manifested in two types- emetic type and diarrheal type.\n\n【101】#### **2.**删除换行**What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Bacillus Cereus Infection?**\n\n【102】The common signs and symptoms are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, etc. If the bloodstream gets infected by the bacteria, extraintestinal symptoms such as bacteremia (presence of bacteria in the bloodstream), endocarditis (inflammation of heart’s inner lining), keratitis (inflammation of the cornea), infections of the soft tissue and bone can occur.\n\n【103】#### **3.**删除换行**How Does Bacillus Cereus Infection Occur?**\n\n【104】When the infected food is not adequately cooked, the bacterial endospores survive, increasing the problem when the food is inadequately refrigerated. The endospores germinate and produce toxins that cause the characteristic infection in humans.\n\n【105】#### **4.**删除换行**What Are the Toxins Produced by Bacillus Cereus?**\n\n【106】If the bacteria produce toxins such as celeuride (heat-stable emetic toxin), it causes emetic symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. If it produces enterotoxins, diarrheal symptoms can occur.\n\n【107】#### **5.**删除换行**How to Diagnose Bacillus Cereus Infection?**\n\n【108】The bacterial infection can be confirmed by isolating bacteria in food, stool, or vomit samples. Different culture media are available to culture this bacteria. Serology tests are available for diagnosing the presence of the diarrheal toxin, and biological tests can detect both emetic and diarrheal toxins. Commercial kits are available to detect the diarrhoeal enterotoxin, but not for the emetic toxin.\n\n【109】#### **6.**删除换行**How Does Bacillus Cereus Bacteria Look Like?**\n\n【110】Bacillus cereus is a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria capable of forming spores. They are straight or slightly curved, and the spores are oval. It is motile and flagellated. It may appear as single bacteria or in chains.\n\n【111】#### **7.**删除换行**What Is the Method of Prevention for Bacillus Cereus Infection?**\n\n【112】One of the easiest ways to prevent this infection is by ensuring that foods are cooked thoroughly and cooled rapidly. We should maintain food at a temperature greater than 60 degrees Celsius or less than 4 degrees Celsius. Food is reheated at a temperature above 74 degrees Celsius for 15 seconds to destroy the vegetative cells. Food leftovers should be rapidly cooled to less than 4 degrees Celsius. To prevent toxins from contaminating the food, it should be reheated at 121 degrees Celsius for 80 minutes which is almost impossible.\n\n【113】#### **8.**删除换行**Is Bacillus Cereus Infection Contagious?**\n\n【114】Bacillus cereus is not a contagious pathogen. The greatest risk is improper and incorrect food preparation, particularly temperature abuse, poor hygiene, and inadequate reheating.\n\n【115】#### **9.**删除换行**What Is the Treatment for Bacillus Cereus Infection?**\n\n【116】Symptomatic treatment, which includes oral and intravenous rehydration, is necessary for most patients. In complicated situations like endophthalmitis and other extragastrointestinal infections, immediate medical intervention is required. The bacteria is resistant to beta-lactam and antibiotics like Clindamycin and Erythromycin. Hence antibiotics like Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin, Rifampicin, Levofloxacin, etc.\n\n【117】#### **10.**删除换行**What Is the Prognosis of a Bacillus Cereus Infection?**\n\n【118】Most emetic patients recover within 6 to 24 hours. But in some cases, the toxins can bring about severe complications like a fulminant hepatic failure, septicemia, etc.\n\n【119】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【120】无关删除-1:<u>*   Bacillus cereus  \n    http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/bacillus-cereus\n*   Bacillus Cereus  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459121/\n*   Preventing Foodborne Illness: Bacillus cereus  \n    https://nifa.usda.gov/sites/default/files/resource/Preventing-Foodborne-Illness-Bacillus-cereus.pdf</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Testicular disorders may be congenital (present at birth) or acquired later in life. Some may be asymptomatic, meaning you will not experience any symptoms unless they progress to a more serious condition. Testicular disorders have many potential causes and risk factors. Read on to know more about testicular disorders.\n\n【2】What Are Testicular Disorders?\n------------------------------\n\n【3】Some of the common disorders include testicular cancer, hydrocele, varicocele, epididymitis, orchitis, and testicular torsion.\n\n【4】**1) Testicular Cancer:** Testicular cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the testicles. It is the most common type of cancer that develops in men between the ages of 15 and 50. Testicular cancer is often curable if it is diagnosed in its early stages. But if it is not diagnosed until later stages, it can be fatal. Testicular cancer is caused by abnormal cell growth in the testicles. The exact cause of this abnormal growth is not known. However, several risk factors can increase a person’s chance of developing it. Men over the age of 35 have a greater risk of developing testicular cancer. Having an undescended testicle or having one or both of the testicles descend into the scrotum before birth can increase one's risk of developing testicular cancer. A family history of testicular cancer will also increase the risk of testicular cancer. There is some evidence that certain types of chemicals can increase the risk of testicular cancer, such as those used to make dyes, pesticides, and chemicals used in rubber manufacturing. Having an undiagnosed heart disorder can increase one's risk of developing testicular cancer.\n\n【5】**2) Orchitis:** Orchitis is an infection or inflammation of the testicles. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites like worms that enter the scrotum through the urethra. It can also be caused by autoimmune disorders that damage the testicles, such as mumps or fever. Orchitis is most commonly seen in boys who have not yet reached puberty and adults who contract viral illnesses. Orchitis can cause pain, fever, swelling, and discharge from one or both testicles. The longer the condition goes untreated, the greater the chance of permanent damage to the testicles.\n\n【6】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【7】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【8】Delta-Beta Thalassemia - Causes, Clinical Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【9】Genodermatoses - Types and Treatment\n\n【10】Kennedy Disease - Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【11】**3) Varicocele:** Varicocele is a condition in which the veins that carry blood away from the testicles become swollen and enlarged. Varicocele is present in half of all men, but many are unaware as it does not typically cause symptoms. Varicocele is accused of obstructing or inflammation in the veins that lead away from the testicles. It can be brought on by several different factors, including genetics, an autoimmune disorder, or even having too little exercise. However, the most common symptom of varicocele is a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. If left untreated, varicoceles can lead to infertility, low testosterone levels, and testicular atrophy.\n\n【12】**4) Hydrocele:** A hydrocele is a collection of fluid in the scrotum, the sac that contains the testicles. It can occur at any age but is most common in newborn boys and aging men. The cause is unknown in most cases, but it may be due to an injury or infection. Hydroceles are usually painless and do not require treatment. However, if the hydrocele is large or gets worse, it may need to be drained with a needle or surgery.\n\n【13】**5) Testicular Torsion:** Testicular torsion is a condition in which one of the testicles becomes twisted and cuts off its blood supply. This can occur at any time in a man’s life and can be very painful. Testicular torsion most often affects men between the ages of 10 and 30. It is most common in men between the ages of 15 and 20. Symptoms of testicular torsion include sudden and severe pain in the scrotum that worsens over a short period. Other symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, and a rapid heartbeat.\n\n【14】**6) Epididymitis:** Epididymitis is swelling and inflammation of the epididymitis, a small organ on the back of each testicle that stores and transports sperm. Epididymitis can be caused by various factors, such as bacterial or viral infections, injury, or sexually transmitted diseases like chlamydia or gonorrhea.\n\n【15】How Are Testicular Disorders Treated?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【16】Several different treatment options are available for men with testicular disorders, depending on the specific condition. Orchitis is treated with antibiotics and can be prevented by wearing clean underwear and washing the genitals frequently. Testicular torsion is treated with surgery to untwist the testicle and repair any damage. If the condition is caused early enough, it can often be corrected without leaving any long-term effects. Epididymitis can be treated with antibiotics and pain medications but left untreated, and it can lead to infertility. Varicocele can be treated with surgery, but it also can be prevented by wearing a scrotal support device and avoiding activities that can increase the pressure in the veins of the testicles. Ultimately, the best course of treatment will be determined by a doctor based on the individual patient’s situation.\n\n【17】How to Prevent Testicular Disorders?\n------------------------------------\n\n【18】There are several things men can do to help prevent testicular disease.\n\n【19】*   Perform a self-exam at least once a month. This exam should be done when the testicles are relaxed.\n\n【20】*   Men should wear loose-fitting underwear and avoid tight-fitting clothing.\n\n【21】*   They should avoid exposure to hot baths.\n\n【22】*   Practicing safe sex will prevent testicular disorders.\n\n【23】*   Avoid weightlifting.\n\n【24】*   They should see a doctor if they have any concerns or notice any changes in their testicles.\n\n【25】**Conclusion:**\n\n【26】The first step in protecting testicles is ensuring one's awareness of the signs and symptoms of testicular disorders. If an individual experiences any of these symptoms, they should see a doctor as soon as possible. With these tips, one can better protect the testicles from harmful conditions.\n\n【27】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【28】无关删除-1:<u>*   Testicular Disorders  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/testiculardisorders.html\n*   Testicular Disorders  \n    https://www.chcrr.org/health-topic/testicular-disorders/\n*   Testicular Diseases - Science topic  \n    https://www.researchgate.net/topic/Testicular-Diseases/publications</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Effective pain management help in improving the comfort of the patient, thereby giving better well-being and faster recovery to get improved outcomes. Sometimes managing pain in critical care can be challenging for various reasons like complex medical conditions, altered communication ability, and potential drug interaction.\n\n【2】What Is the Importance of Managing Pain in Critically Ill Patients?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Managing pain in critically ill patients is important because of the following reasons:\n\n【4】*   **Patient Comfort -** Patients in critical care often experience pain due to underlying medical problems, surgery, invasive procedures, and due to various medical interventions. Adequate and appropriate management of pain helps improve the patient's comfort, decreases suffering, and increases overall well-being.\n\n【5】*   **Faster Recovery -** Uncontrolled pain can sometimes delay recovery time and hinder the healing process in critical care patients. The healing process and recovery time can be improved by managing the pain, thereby improving the patient's outcome.\n\n【6】*   **Reduced Stress Response -** In case of pain, the stress response will be triggered in the body, which will negatively affect critically ill patients. High-stress levels can exacerbate cardiovascular problems and reduce immune function and wound healing. Adequate and proper management of pain helps reduce the stress response, giving a more stable physiological state.\n\n【7】*   **Prevention of Complications -** Uncontrolled pain can result in various complications in critical care patients. Some complications associated with uncontrolled pain include immobility or reluctance to participate in therapy, high risk of pneumonia (infection resulting in inflammation of the air sacs present in the lungs), venous thromboembolism (presence of blood clots in the veins), and pressure ulcers. Effective pain management in critically ill patients helps improve mobility and reduce the risk of these complications.\n\n【8】*   **Enhanced Patient-Provider Communication -** Pain is considered a most valuable indicator of the patient's condition and how the patient responds to treatment. By reducing the pain, there will be effective communication between the health care professional and the critically ill patient, thereby improving the progress and can adjust the medical intervention accordingly as needed.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Fascial Traction Technique in Closure of an Open Abdomen</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Stage-2 Pressure Ulcers - Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, And Prevention</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Aspirin and Ketamine Combination for Pain Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   **Improved Patient Satisfaction -** Managing the pain in critically ill patients helps in improving satisfaction and overall experience and care. When the pain is appropriately managed and acknowledged by the healthcare provider, there will be more likely to have trust between the healthcare providers and the patient, which will give support throughout the critical illness.\n    </u>\n\n【10】How Is Pain Assessed in Critically Ill Patients?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Pain assessment in critically ill patients can be challenging due to various factors like sedation, altered communication abilities, and underlying medical conditions. So a systemic approach to assess the pain in critically ill patients is needed to manage the pain effectively. Some of the key considerations in assessing the pain in critically ill patients include the following:\n\n【12】*   By using validated pain assessment tools, which are used in critically ill patients, like the critical care pain observation tool (CPOT) or behavioral pain scale (BPS). These pain assessment tools rely on behavioral indicators like body movements, vocalization, and facial expression, which help assess pain in critically ill patients.\n\n【13】*   If the critically ill patient can report the pain by themselves, then encourage themselves to rate the pain on a scale basis, like a visual analog scale (VAS) or numeric rating scale (NRS), which helps indicate the pain's intensity. Other methods like eye blinking or simple gestures can also be used in patients who have limited communication abilities.\n\n【14】*   Non-verbal cues of pain like guarding of the body parts, agitation, facial grimacing, increased heart rate, restlessness, or changes in the vital signs should be noticed. These signs can indicate pain in patients admitted to critical care who cannot communicate verbally.\n\n【15】*   Involving the family and caregivers to seek input and insights about the patient's behavior by assessing their discomfort and signs of pain can be used.\n\n【16】*   Regular assessment of pain at scheduled intervals helps to know the changes in the patient's condition. Pain can vary in critically ill patients, and reassessment is needed to ensure appropriate management of the pain.\n\n【17】*   The medical condition or the recent intervention and procedures should be considered to know the potential source of pain, like the wound, invasive lines, or surgical sites.\n\n【18】*   Pain in critically ill patients can be a multidimensional experience. The sleep pattern, mood, and overall quality of life should be assessed to know the intensity of pain.\n\n【19】What Are the Pharmacological Approaches For Pain Management in Critically Ill Patients?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The pharmacological approaches to managing the pain in critically ill patients include the following:\n\n【21】*   **Analgesics -** Analgesics are considered the cornerstone in the management of paint. Non-opioid analgesics like Acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioid analysis like Morphine, Hydromorphone, and Fentanyl can be used. These analgesic medications will act on the central nervous system, reduce pain perception, and give relief.\n\n【22】*   **Patient-Controlled Analgesia -** The patient-controlled analgesia helps in the self-administration of a predetermined dosage of opioid analgesics. This will give a controlled approach to managing the pain.\n\n【23】*   **Neuropathic Pain Medications -** During neuropathic pain or pain related to nerve damage, medications targeted to the nerve are prescribed like Gabapentin, Pregabalin, and Amitriptyline (tricyclic antidepressant).\n\n【24】*   **Adjuvant Medications -** In combination with analgesics, adjuvant medications are used to reduce the pain and to manage the symptoms related to the pain. Antidepressants like selective serotonin reactive inhibitors and Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant, are effective in neuropathic pain management. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, can be used for its anti-inflammatory properties in some conditions.\n\n【25】*   **Local Anesthesia -** Lidocaine or Bupivacaine can be used as local anesthetics for site-specific pain relief. It can be administered by epidural routes, infiltration, or nerve blocks, depending on the need of the patient and the nature of the pain.\n\n【26】*   **Sedatives and Anxiolytics -** Sedatives or anxiolytics can sometimes be used indirectly to manage pain. These medications act by improving relaxation and decreasing anxiety, thereby reducing pain and improving the patient's comfort.\n\n【27】What Are the Non-pharmacological Approaches For Pain Management in Critically Ill Patients?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】The non-pharmacological approaches to managing the pain in critically ill patients include the following:\n\n【29】*   Proper positioning and repositioning of the patient help in reducing the pain due to pressure ulcers, immobility, or muscle tension.\n\n【30】*   The application of cold and heat packs helps in reducing the pain locally. Heat therapy includes warm compresses, which help relax the muscles and decrease the muscle spasm. Cold therapy includes cooling devices and ice packs, which will reduce inflammation and numb painful areas.\n\n【31】*   Gentle massages or therapeutic touch techniques help improve relaxation and reduce pain perception. These methods will help in the release of endorphins which are considered to be a natural pain-relieving substance.\n\n【32】*   Engagement of patients in distracting activities like watching videos, listening to music, or playing games help in getting a diversion from the pain and reduce the intensity.\n\n【33】*   Breathing and relaxation exercises help in decreasing anxiety and help in managing the pain more effectively.\n\n【34】*   Cognitive behavioral techniques and relaxation training help develop a coping strategy and decrease or modify the emotions and negative thoughts associated with the pain.\n\n【35】*   Complementary and alternative therapy like acupressure, acupuncture, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation can be used in managing pain.\n\n【36】**Conclusion:**\n\n【37】In conclusion, managing pain in critical care patients need a multi-factorial approach that considers their challenges and needs. By giving a comprehensive pain management plan, healthcare personnel will remove the pain and discomfort, improve healing and increase the patient's overall outcome. Pain management in critically ill patients includes non-pharmacological and pharmacological inventions and regular pain assessment.\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>*   Current Perspectives on the Assessment and Management of Pain in the Intensive Care Unit  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8214553/\n*   Pain Management in the Intensive Care Unit: Do We Need Special Protocols?  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4018715/\n*   Comparison of Two Pain Scales: Behavioral Pain Scale and Critical-care Pain Observation Tool During Invasive and Noninvasive Procedures in Intensive Care Unit-admitted Patients  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6390431/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Gastric bypass surgery is done when diet and exercise have not helped reduce weight or serious health issues because of being overweight. After the surgery, the stomach will be smaller. The food will not go into some parts of the stomach and small intestine that will absorb food. The body will not get all of the nutrients from the food we eat. It is also known as bariatric bypass surgery.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Gastric Bypass Surgery?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【3】There are various types of gastric bypass surgery:\n\n【4】*   **Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass:** This is one common type of gastric bypass surgery. Surgery is done under general anesthesia. In this procedure, the surgeon first makes a small stomach pouch by stapling part of the stomach or by vertical banding. Next, the surgeon attaches a Y-shaped portion of the small intestine to the pouch. This limits the amount of food you eat and creates a bypass for food, so it skips part of the digestive system.\n\n【5】*   **Extensive Gastric Bypass:** This is a complicated surgery. In this surgical procedure, the lower part of the stomach is removed. Then the surgeon connects the small pouch that remains to the last part of the small intestine. It works for weight loss, but this surgery is not done widely because it has high complications.\n\n【6】What Are the Ways of Doing Gastric Bypass Surgery?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Gastric bypass surgery can be done in two ways - open surgery and laparoscopic surgery.\n\n【8】In open surgery, the surgeon makes a large open cut in the abdomen. The bypass is done by accessing the organs through the large cut.\n\n【9】Another way is laparoscopic surgery, in which small cuts are made, and a laparoscope with a tiny camera is inserted through these cuts, which are used to see inside of the belly. Surgical tools are also inserted through the small cuts to perform the surgery. Laparoscopic surgery has advantages like less pain, quicker recovery, and a short hospital stay. The procedure takes about two to four hours.\n\n【10】Who Needs Gastric Bypass Surgery?\n---------------------------------\n\n【11】Gastric bypass is not done for everyone who is extremely overweight. Doctors use body mass index (BMI) and systemic conditions like diabetes mellitus and hypertension to determine the candidates for weight loss surgery.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-3:<u>Is bariatric surgery advisable for the second time?</u>\n\n【15】Korsakoff Syndrome - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【16】Please suggest the best remedy for back pain.\n\n【17】The procedure is recommended under the following conditions:\n\n【18】*   People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or more. Someone with a BMI of 40 or more is at least 45kgs higher than the recommended body weight.\n\n【19】*   A body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more and a serious medical condition like type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea.\n\n【20】What Happens Before the Surgery?\n--------------------------------\n\n【21】*   Before the surgery, a complete physical examination is done.\n\n【22】*   Blood tests and ultrasound are done to confirm the eligibility for surgery.\n\n【23】*   Medical problems such as diabetes and blood pressure should be under control.\n\n【24】*   A urine catheter is placed in the bladder to drain urine.\n\n【25】*   Quit smoking a few weeks before the surgery.\n\n【26】*   Inform the doctor about your pregnancy and the vitamin and herbal supplements you are taking.\n\n【27】*   Inform the doctor about the medications you are taking, such as blood thinners like Aspirin, Clopidogrel, and Warfarin. These drugs should be stopped for a few days before the surgery.\n\n【28】What Happens After the Surgery?\n-------------------------------\n\n【29】Patients will stay in the hospital for one to four days after the surgery. The patient can not eat for one to three days after the surgery. After that, liquid foods are first given, and then solid foods are introduced. Special stockings are worn on the leg to prevent the formation of blood clots. Painkillers and antithrombotics are given.\n\n【30】What to Eat After the Surgery?\n------------------------------\n\n【31】Gastric bypass surgery reduces the size of the stomach and changes the way food enters the intestine. After surgery, it is important to get enough nutrients while maintaining the weight-loss goals on track.\n\n【32】*   **Eat and Drink Slowly:** Eat the meals for at least 30 minutes and take 30 to 60 minutes to drink one cup of liquid. This can avoid dumping syndrome. You may have to wait for 30 minutes before or after each meal to drink liquids.\n\n【33】*   **Keep Meals Small:** Eat multiple numbers of small meals a day. Start with six meals a day, then four meals, and finally regular, three meals.\n\n【34】*   **Drink Liquids Between Meals:** Drink at least eight cups (1.9 liters) of fluids a day to prevent dehydration. But do not drink more fluids during mealtime.\n\n【35】*   **Chew Food Thoroughly:** Eat small bites of food and chew them thoroughly before swallowing to avoid blockages in the new opening from the stomach to the intestine.\n\n【36】*   **Focus On High-Protein Foods:** Eat protein-rich foods.\n\n【37】*   **Avoid Foods That Are Rich in Fat and Sugar Content:** These foods can cause dumping syndrome.\n\n【38】*   **Take Recommended Vitamin and Mineral Supplements:** Multivitamin supplements are taken daily for the rest of your life.\n\n【39】What Are the Risks of Gastric Bypass Surgery?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【40】Gastric bypass is major surgery, and it has many risks.\n\n【41】*   Pouch Stretching: The stomach stretches and changes to its original position over time.\n\n【42】*   The staples fall apart.\n\n【43】*   Allergic reactions to anesthesia.\n\n【44】*   Gastritis, stomach ulcers, or heartburn.\n\n【45】*   Injury to the stomach, intestine, or other organs during surgery\n\n【46】*   Nutritional, vitamin, and mineral deficiencies.\n\n【47】*   Stomal Stenosis: A narrowing at the connection of the stomach and small intestine causing nausea, and vomiting\n\n【48】*   Gastric bypass surgery also causes a dumping syndrome, in which the food moves too quickly from the stomach to the small intestine.\n\n【49】What Is the Alternative for Gastric Bypass Surgery?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is a newer type of weight-loss procedure. This is a minimally invasive procedure. The procedure uses a flexible tube attached to a camera and an endoscopic suturing device. The endoscope is inserted down the throat into the stomach.\n\n【51】The doctor places sutures in the stomach using the endoscope. The sutures change the stomach making it smaller. This restricts the amount of food you eat.\n\n【52】**Conclusion:**\n\n【53】Gastric bypass can provide long-term weight loss. The surgery also improves daily activities and the quality of life. It improves or resolves health conditions related to overweight issues. This surgery is irreversible in most cases.\n\n【54】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【55】* * *\n\n【56】#### **1.**删除换行**What's the Minimum Weight for Gastric Bypass?**\n\n【57】A body mass index (BMI) between 35 and 40 is the minimum BMI required for undergoing gastric bypass surgery with an obesity-related condition, such as severe sleep apnea, high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. In addition, weight should be less than 204 kilograms, the maximum weight that hospital radiology equipment can accommodate.\n\n【58】#### **2.**删除换行**Is Gastric Bypass Surgery a Serious Medical Procedure?**\n\n【59】Yes, gastric surgery is serious surgery. It is a major surgery involving various risks, such as stomach lining inflammation (gastritis), heartburn, ulcers, poor nutrition, and vomiting. Also, fluid can leak from the stomach lining where it has been stapled.\n\n【60】#### **3.**删除换行**What Is Life Expectancy After Gastric Bypass?**\n\n【61】According to the studies, the life expectancy after gastric bypass surgery is higher when compared to obese patients. However, the mortality rate in both cases is still higher than the normal population. In addition, an individual's median average life span after gastric bypass surgery compared to the control group is three years.\n\n【62】#### **4.**删除换行**What Are 3 Common Long-Term Complications of Gastric Bypass?**\n\n【63】The three common long-term complications of gastric bypass surgery are bowel obstruction, dump syndrome, and gallstones. Other complications include poor nutrition, lung or breathing problems, blood clotting, infections, and leaks in the gastrointestinal system.\n\n【64】#### **5.**删除换行**What Does a Gastric Bypass Leak Feel Like?**\n\n【65】Gastric bypass is weight-loss surgery. During the surgery, the stomach is reduced to a small gastric pouch, and the loop of the small intestine is cut, brought up, and connected to the gastric pouch. Food is then rerouted to an area much lower in the digestive system and bypasses the stomach. As the food bypasses the stomach, the body does not absorb as many calories. As a result, you will feel full much faster than before after eating.\n\n【66】#### **6.**删除换行**What Is a Possible Downside to Having a Gastric Bypass?**\n\n【67】   \n\\- Pouch Stretching: The stomach stretches and changes to its original position over time.  \n\\- The staples fall apart.  \n\\- Allergic reactions to anesthesia.  \n\\- Gastritis, stomach ulcers, or heartburn.  \n\\- Injury to the stomach, intestine, or other organs during surgery.  \n\\- Nutritional, vitamin, and mineral deficiencies.  \n\\- Stomal Stenosis or narrowing at the connection of the stomach leads to nausea and vomiting.  \n\\- Gastric bypass surgery also causes dumping syndrome, in which the food quickly moves from the stomach to the intestine.\n\n【68】#### **7.**删除换行**Can I Eat Sugar After Gastric Bypass Surgery?**\n\n【69】Eating sugar or high-fat food after gastric bypass surgery can cause dumping syndrome. In this syndrome, food high in sugar and fat enters and moves speedily from the stomach into the small intestine. If a large amount of food enters the small intestine quickly, causing vomiting, nausea, dizziness, sweating, and diarrhea. High-fat or high-sugar food on consumption causes nausea and vomiting after meals.\n\n【70】#### **8.**删除换行**Can You Vomit After Gastric Bypass?**\n\n【71】Vomiting and food intolerance are common occurrences early on after gastric bypass surgery. This normally happens due to the narrow gastro-jejunostomy. The passage is narrow while healing, so it can cause vomiting.\n\n【72】#### **9.**删除换行**Can You Drink Alcohol After a Gastric Bypass?**\n\n【73】Alcohol should be completely avoided for the first six months after the surgery. After that, a physician's advice should be sought before starting the intake of alcohol. In addition, carbonated drinks and other high sugar-containing drink mixers should be avoided.\n\n【74】#### **10.**删除换行**How Often Should You Pass Stools After Gastric Bypass?**\n\n【75】Bowel movements should be normal and tracked after the gastric bypass surgery. Many people suffer from constipation after the surgery. Stools should be passed once every day.\n\n【76】#### **11.**删除换行**Which Is Better, the Sleeve or the Gastric Bypass?**\n\n【77】In the long run, gastric sleeve surgery has lesser complications and risks of death. Also, patients with sleeve surgery needed follow-up surgery. Both surgeries have a 50 % to 80 % success rate. It is always better to discuss which surgery suits you with the healthcare provider and then opt for it.\n\n【78】#### **12.**删除换行**Is the Gastric Bypass Worth It?**\n\n【79】Gastric surgery is worth undergoing in patients with complicated weight loss patterns. It is a boon for people with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or more. Someone with a BMI of 40 or more is at least 45 kgs higher than the recommended body weight.\n\n【80】#### **13.**删除换行**What Percent of Gastric Bypass Patients Gain the Weight Back?**\n\n【81】The early weight loss following a gastric bypass surgery ranges from 47 % to 80 % of excess weight. Moreover, a typical weight regain is 15 % to 25% of that lost weight. This can be bad news for patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery, and managing weight expectations post-surgery is very important.\n\n【82】#### **14.**删除换行**How Big Is Your Stomach After Gastric Bypass Surgery?**\n\n【83】Gastric bypass surgery helps reduce weight by changing the pattern of food absorption in the stomach and small intestine. Post-surgery, the stomach becomes smaller in size. There is early satiety with less food intake. And the food consumed will no longer go through some parts of the stomach and small intestine that absorb food.\n\n【84】#### **15.**删除换行**Can Your Stomach Grow Back After Gastric Sleeve?**\n\n【85】No, the stomach does not grow after gastric sleeve surgery. However, it allows the patient to have a long-term normal life once they achieve their weight loss success.\n\n【86】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【87】无关删除-1:<u>*   Gastric bypass surgery  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007199.htm\n*   Risks of Gastric Bypass Surgery: Anastomotic Leaking  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/risks-of-gastric-bypass-surgery-anastomotic-leaking\n*   Gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y)  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/gastric-bypass-surgery/about/pac-20385189</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The other name for cellulitis is Phlegmon. It first appears as an area that is hot to touch and is red and swollen. Cellulitis can occur anywhere in the body, but usually, it affects the skin of the lower legs and can be painful. It can spread to the deeper layers of the skin, lymph nodes, and blood rapidly and can be fatal.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Cellulitis?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】Cellulitis can occur anywhere in the body, so it is divided into different types depending on the body part affected.\n\n【4】1.  Cellulitis of the Extremities - This affects the arms, legs, and feet. It is the most common type of cellulitis.\n\n【5】2.  Facial Cellulitis - It can occur anywhere in the face, lips, and tongue.\n\n【6】3.  Orbital and Periorbital Cellulitis - Skin infection of the eyelids or the structures surrounding the eye.\n\n【7】4.  Breast Cellulitis - Women with breast cancer and a history of lumpectomy are more susceptible to develop breast cellulitis.\n\n【8】5.  Perianal Cellulitis - This is usually seen in children. Here the skin around the anal orifice gets infected.\n\n【9】What Are the Causes and Risk Factors for Cellulitis?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Bacteria are present on the surface of the skin and normally do not cause any infection. But in the following cases, bacteria (Streptococcus and Staphylococcus) enters the skin and causes infection:\n\n【11】*   Cut or trauma to the skin.\n\n【12】*   Diabetes.\n\n【13】*   Conditions causing poor blood flow to the arms and legs, for example, varicose veins.\n\n【14】*   Liver diseases like hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.\n\n【15】*   Skin conditions like psoriasis, eczema, athlete’s foot, etc.\n\n【16】*   Weak immune system.\n\n【17】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I am suffering from eczema.

Skin dimpling means having a skin texture similar to orange peel. This is due to the protrusion of the underlying fat through the weakened areas of connective tissue.\n\n【32】What Is Dental Cellulitis?\n--------------------------\n\n【33】*   Dental cellulitis will have a dental cause as the origin. When a dental abscess is unable to drain through the surface of the skin, cellulitis occurs.\n\n【34】*   Streptococci are known to be the cause.\n\n【35】*   There will be widespread swelling even in the eyes, extending even beyond the ears. There will not be any definite localization.\n\n【36】*   The swelling will be red and painful. There will be tenderness on palpation.\n\n【37】*   Tissues will be discolored. Temperature is elevated with malaise and lethargy.\n\n【38】*   In severe cases, the pus may evacuate into the nose, vestibules, the floor of the mouth, infratemporal fossa and maxillary sinus.\n\n【39】*   If the pus is seen on the superficial surface, erythematous spots are known to develop.\n\n【40】*   Diagnosis involves a lot of laboratory tests. A biopsy might also be needed.\n\n【41】*   Management of cellulitis involves a surgical incision and drainage. This may be accompanied by antibiotic therapy.\n\n【42】*   Extraction of the affected tooth may be required.\n\n【43】When Do You Need to See a Doctor?\n---------------------------------\n\n【44】Untreated cellulitis might be fatal, so if you see the following symptoms, get immediate medical attention:\n\n【45】*   Fever.\n\n【46】*   Chills.\n\n【47】*   Feeling tired.\n\n【48】*   Dizziness.\n\n【49】*   Muscle pain.\n\n【50】*   Sweating.\n\n【51】*   Drowsiness.\n\n【52】*   Lethargy.\n\n【53】*   Blisters and red streaks on the affected skin.\n\n【54】What Are the Methods to Diagnose Cellulitis?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【55】The doctor will usually diagnose the condition through clinical presentation and physical examination. Sometimes, the doctor might ask for the following tests:\n\n【56】*   Blood test - If the doctor suspects the infection to have spread to the blood.\n*   X-ray - To check if the underlying bone is infected.\n*   Culture - The fluid collected from the infected area is sent to the lab for a culture test.\n\n【57】What Are the Treatment Options for Cellulitis?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【58】### Oral Antibiotics:\n\n【59】Your doctor might prescribe oral antibiotics for 10 to 21 days. The length of the antibiotic regimen will depend on the severity of the infection. You will usually see improvement after taking oral antibiotics for 7 to 10 days, but complete the antibiotic course even after all the signs and symptoms go away.\n\n【60】### Painkiller:\n\n【61】Along with antibiotics, your doctor might also prescribe painkillers to relieve the pain and discomfort caused by the infection.\n\n【62】### IV Antibiotics:\n\n【63】If you have a high fever or high blood pressure or immunologically compromised or if oral antibiotics are not effective, then the doctor might advise hospitalization. In such cases, antibiotics are given intravenously.\n\n【64】### Surgery:\n\n【65】In some rare cases, when the infection is severe, surgery might be needed. Here, the doctor may drain the collected pus and cut away dead tissue to promote healing.\n\n【66】### Home Remedies:\n\n【67】*   Elevate the infected part of the body.\n\n【68】*   Take over-the-counter pain medications like Paracetamol or Ibuprofen.\n\n【69】*   A cool and damp cloth can be placed on the affected area for comfort.\n\n【70】*   Keep moving the joint near the affected area to prevent it from getting stiff.\n\n【71】*   Drink plenty of fluids.\n\n【72】*   Do not wear compression stockings until the infection is resolved.\n\n【73】How Can Cellulitis Be Prevented?\n--------------------------------\n\n【74】Following are some of the preventive measures:\n\n【75】*   Keep your skin clean.\n\n【76】*   Practice good personal hygiene.\n\n【77】*   Do not wear tight-fitting socks and shoes.\n\n【78】*   If you get injured, wash the area properly with warm water and soap.\n\n【79】What Are the Complications?\n---------------------------\n\n【80】The complications include:\n\n【81】*   Repeated and recurrent episodes of cellulitis can damage the lymphatic system and cause swelling of the limb.\n\n【82】*   It can cause a deep-layer infection called necrotizing fasciitis.\n\n【83】*   Blood infection.\n\n【84】*   Bone infection.\n\n【85】*   Gangrene (tissue death). It might occur due to poor blood flow or severe bacterial infection. It occurs in the hands and feet.\n\n【86】If you are suffering from cellulitis, which is not getting better with antibiotics, you can consult a dermatologist online. You can obtain a prescription for cellulitis with convenience. You can click pictures of the affected area and share it with the doctor along with the symptoms, or you can talk to an experienced doctor through real-time video consultation.\n\n【87】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【88】* * *\n\n【89】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the Main Reason for Cellulitis?**\n\n【90】Cellulitis occurs due to bacterial infection. These bacteria can enter through a crack or break in your skin. Currently, the infection caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is highly increasing, and is the major cause of cellulitis.\n\n【91】#### **2.**删除换行**Which Treatment Is Effective for Cellulitis?**\n\n【92】In mild cases, cellulitis can be treated with medications such as Dicloxacillin, Cephalexin, and Amoxicillin. In severe cases, incision and drainage may be required.\n\n【93】#### **3.**删除换行**Is Cellulitis Infection Dangerous?**\n\n【94】Cellulitis is a severe infection affecting the deeper layers of skin and most of the underlying tissue. The infection might develop rapidly and can spread through the body. If not treated, the infection can lead to life-threatening complications.\n\n【95】#### **4.**删除换行**Can Cellulitis Be Transmitted?**\n\n【96】Cellulitis cannot be transmitted from an infected person to another. Since it is caused by bacteria, the pus that is drained should be eliminated carefully in a hospital set up. There is an increased risk of developing cellulitis through a cut, injury, fracture or burns.\n\n【97】#### **5.**删除换行**When Is a Person Prone to Cellulitis?**\n\n【98】Certain conditions raise the risk of developing cellulitis and other skin infections. Those conditions include having a weakened immune system, having a history of cellulitis or other skin problems, obesity, lymphedema, and use of injectable drugs.\n\n【99】#### **6.**删除换行**What Happens If Cellulitis Gets Severe?**\n\n【100】People with a mild form of cellulitis might heal with antibiotics. If the symptoms of cellulitis begin to get worse, the infectious substances get released. When the release continues, the body continues to react in many abnormal ways.\n\n【101】#### **7.**删除换行**Will My Cellulitis Go Away?**\n\n【102】Cellulitis should usually subside within seven to ten days after you start antibiotic therapy. A longer treatment might be needed in severe cases. The curative rate may be delayed due to chronic conditions or a poor immune system. You have to continue antibiotics for some days till your doctor advises you to stop.\n\n【103】#### **8.**删除换行**How Long Does It Take for Cellulitis to Develop?**\n\n【104】The time it takes for the symptoms of cellulitis to develop varies depending on the bacteria responsible for the infection. When cellulitis is caused by Pasteurella multocida species, which is commonly found in animal bites, the symptoms can occur in less than 24 hours after the bite.\n\n【105】#### **9.**删除换行**Is Cellulitis an Autoimmune Disorder?**\n\n【106】An autoimmune disorder is the one that displays a weakened immune response. An autoimmune disorder like rheumatoid arthritis can make a person more susceptible to cellulitis. This does not mean cellulitis itself is an autoimmune disorder.\n\n【107】#### **10.**删除换行**How Long Should I Stay in Hospital After the Treatment of Cellulitis?**\n\n【108】The duration of stay in the hospital after the treatment for cellulitis usually lasts for three to five days. In case of severe infection, you might have to stay longer. You may need a proper dressing and wound care before discharge.\n\n【109】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【110】无关删除-1:<u>*   https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/cellulitis  \n    https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/cellulitis\n*   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5414024/  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5414024/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "aaa87a7c-797a-4682-a332-1b04e2dc50e4", "title": "Dental Cavities", "text": "【0】**Introduction**\n\n【1】Cavities are holes or openings present on the hard surface of the teeth. These are permanent damage to the teeth and are primarily irreversible conditions. They are also known as dental caries, dental decay or tooth decay. They can occur for many reasons. But basically due to excess sugar intake, improper brushing, bacteria in the mouth, improper cleaning of the teeth, and frequent eating of snacks.\n\n【2】**What Are Dental Caries?**\n---------------------------\n\n【3】Dental caries is defined as a bacterial disease of the calcified tissues of teeth and is characterized by demineralization of the inorganic and destruction of the organic substance of the tooth.\n\n【4】**Who Is Affected by Dental Caries?**\n\n【5】Dental caries is seen in all age groups, including infants, children, adults, and older adults. If the dental caries is not treated at the correct time, the decay will progress deeply and result in toothache, tooth infection, tooth structure loss, or sometimes complete tooth loss. Proper brushing and flossing can help prevent the formation of dental caries.\n\n【6】**What Causes Dental Cavities?**\n--------------------------------\n\n【7】The causes for dental caries are as follows:\n\n【8】1.  **Plaque Formation -** The excess intake of sugar, starch, candies, and other sugary foods and not brushing properly may lead to plaque formation. Plaque is a filmy coat or film-like covering around the surface of the teeth. It is formed due to excess intake of sugar and improper cleaning. Because bacteria develops in the filmy coat around the teeth, plaque also thickens and spreads, either on the gum line or deeper to the gum line to form calculus. It creates a shield around the teeth and makes them difficult to remove.\n\n【9】2.  **Plaque Progression -** The formed plaque progresses into the enamel, the hardest substance of the teeth. It erodes the enamel or forms a hole removing the enamel layer of the tooth's surface. It gradually moves to the dentin surface, deeper to the enamel. The dentin is softer than enamel and gets easily destroyed by the plaque. The dentin layer of the teeth has a tubular structure called dentinal tubules, which connect the dentin to deeper areas of the tooth, the dental pulp. In this way, the plaque progresses. The plaque has acid contents, and bacteria in it causes erosion of the tooth surface. This erosion causes a small hole in the tooth surface. When it progresses to dentin, it develops sensitivity.\n\n【10】3.  **Plaque Causing Destruction -** The plaque then progresses deep into pulp, the innermost structure of the teeth. The pulp has blood vessels and nerve supply. The plaque involving the pulp causes pulpal swelling and irritation. It is primarily due to the bacteria in the plaque. As the pulp has no space to expand, during pulpal swelling caused by plaque, it will cause further infection in the teeth, around the root, and the bone. When the infection spreads to the pulp, it will cause some pain.\n\n【11】**What Are the Risk Factors of Dental Caries?**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The risk factors for dental caries are as follows:\n\n【13】1.  **Tooth Location -** The teeth located posteriorly have an increased risk of developing dental caries because of the location and structure. The posterior teeth have grooves, cusps, fissures, and pits. This will lead to the deposition of sugary foods and cavity formation.\n\n【14】2.  **Improper Brushing -** Improper brushing results in incomplete removal of sugary foods leading to food deposition and dental caries.\n\n【15】3.  **Eating Disorder -** Certain eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia can cause erosion that can develop into dental caries. Vomiting causes the stomach acid to enter the oral cavity, resulting in erosion, which further develops into caries.\n\n【16】4.  **Dry Mouth -** Saliva protects teeth from the acid produced by bacteria, thereby preventing the formation of plaque and food debris. A lack of saliva causes dry mouth, which may become a risk factor for cavity formation. The dry mouth may be caused by some medications, radiation therapy to the head and neck, and certain medical conditions.\n\n【17】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Role of Fluorides in Tooth Mineralization</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Dental Cavities</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Prevent Tooth Decay With Coconut Oil</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n5.  **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease -** Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a condition that causes reflux of stomach acid into the oral cavity causing the tooth to be exposed to the stomach acid. This further causes the teeth to lose the enamel covering. The bacteria directly attacks the dentin and causes dental caries.\n\n【18】6.  **Age-Related Factor -** Dental caries is commonly seen in younger and older people. In young children, the increased intake of sugar causes the dental cavity, whereas, in older people, the dental cavity is caused by the wearing of the teeth' enamel surface due to attrition and aging, receding of the gums. Specific medications taken by older people also cause dry mouth, thus leading to dental caries.\n\n【19】7.  **Food and Diet -** Certain foods that tend to stick to the tooth surface for an extended period, such as hard candies, honey, dry cereals, mint, sugar, chocolates, milk, ice cream, cake, soda, cookies, dry fruits, and chips cause dental caries. The frequency of sticky food intake also increases the risk of dental caries.\n\n【20】8.  **Bedtime Sugary Beverages -** The infants and toddlers may get nursing bottle caries. Drinking milk, juice, or other sugar-containing liquids at night might cause the beverages to stick to the tooth during sleep, which becomes a risk factor for dental cavity formation.\n\n【21】9.  **Less Fluoride -** Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that helps prevent dental caries. It is a common ingredient in toothpaste and mouthwashes. The fluoride is added to the public drinking water supplies. Certain places with less fluoride may lead to dental caries.\n\n【22】10.  **Old Dental Restoration -** The old dental restoration will wear out, weaken, and break at the edges, creating a space for the plaque to accumulate and produce dental caries.\n    </u>\n\n【23】What Are the Symptoms of Dental Caries?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【24】The symptoms of dental caries depend on the location and period of cavity formation. Dental caries at the initial stages will not show any signs, but later when it progresses, it will show different symptoms such as,\n\n【25】*   Brown or black stains on the surface of the teeth.\n\n【26】*   Black holes or cavities.\n\n【27】*   Pits in the tooth surface.\n\n【28】*   Sensitivity.\n\n【29】*   Acute, sharp pain can be present continuously or while chewing or drinking cold or hot food.\n\n【30】**How Are Dental Caries Diagnosed?**\n------------------------------------\n\n【31】The following methods can help diagnose dental caries,\n\n【32】*   Clinical examination of teeth.\n\n【33】*   Pits or cavity in the teeth surface.\n\n【34】*   Intraoral periapical radiographs.\n\n【35】*   Orthopantomogram.\n\n【36】*   Percussion using dental probe into the dental cavity.\n\n【37】*   Probing using a dental probe into the dental cavity.\n\n【38】**What Is the Treatment for Dental Caries?**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【39】The treatment methods of dental caries vary according to the depth and location of dental caries. Regular dental checkups help in identifying dental caries at the earliest stage. So the treatment procedure will be conservative, and no extensive treatment is needed. Dental caries can be prevented or reversed before it causes pain. But once dental caries cause pain, extensive treatment procedures have to be followed.\n\n【40】1.  **Fluoride Restoration -** Fluoride treatment is available in gel, liquid mouthwash, foam, and varnish. The fluoride is added to dental caries at the initial stage. This fluoride can stop the further development of dental caries and also remove dental caries. The fluoride restores the tooth enamel and helps in reversing dental caries if it's at the initial stages only.\n\n【41】2.  **Dental Restoration -** Dental caries can be treated with dental restoration or filling after removing dental caries or cleaning dental caries. Dental glass ionomer cement, composite, amalgam, and porcelain materials are used for restoration purposes.\n\n【42】3.  **Root Canal Treatment and Crowns -** If dental caries reach the pulp, then the restoration will not be a successful treatment plan for dental caries. In this case, a root canal treatment has to be done. It involves removing dental caries, cleaning the infection, providing intracanal medicaments, and replacing it with gutta-percha resin. The permanent restoration can be placed on the tooth after completing root canal treatment. Crowns can also be used after root canal treatment to maintain esthetics and prevent tooth breakage after root canal treatment. Crowns are made of ceramic or porcelain, metal, porcelain fused metal, gold, resin.\n\n【43】4.  **Extraction of Teeth -** If dental caries go deeper and the tooth structure is broken, it is a grossly decayed tooth. These teeth cannot be restored using restoration material. The root canal treatment also will not be successful. These teeth have to be extracted. After extraction and complete healing, the teeth have to be replaced using a dental bridge or implant to prevent a shift of the neighboring teeth.\n\n【44】**What Are the Complications of Dental Caries?**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】Dental caries will have specific and long-lasting complications and effects, which are usually not well noted and taken seriously.\n\n【46】*   Tooth sensitivity.\n\n【47】*   Toothache.\n\n【48】*   Swelling.\n\n【49】*   Pus discharge.\n\n【50】*   An abscess around the teeth.\n\n【51】*   Tooth loss.\n\n【52】*   Difficulty in chewing due to pain.\n\n【53】*   Difficulties in chewing due to tooth loss after dental caries.\n\n【54】*   Malocclusions after removing grossly decayed primary teeth.\n\n【55】*   Teeth may get broken.\n\n【56】*   Damage to the tongue and buccal mucosa caused by sharp cusp tips.\n\n【57】*   Periodontal problems, including pocket formation in the gingiva.\n\n【58】*   Cellulitis (a potentially serious bacterial skin infection).\n\n【59】*   Osteomyelitis (infection in a bone).\n\n【60】**What Are the Preventive Methods of Dental Caries?**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】1.  **Fluoridated Water -** People need fluoride minerals, so it has been added to public water supplies. The intake of fluoridated water prevents dental caries.\n\n【62】2.  **Fluoridated Toothpaste -** Fluoridated toothpaste, that is, the toothpaste that has fluoride as an ingredient, can be used. This also prevents dental caries.\n\n【63】3.  **Fluoridated Mouthwash -** Mouthwash or mouth rinse that has fluoride and other chlorhexidine products can also be used to prevent dental caries.\n\n【64】4.  **Proper Brushing -** One should brush your teeth twice a day, using a toothbrush and toothpaste after meals. This helps remove the food deposits and other sticky foods and plaque from the tooth surface. One can also use interdental brushes to remove debris between the teeth.\n\n【65】5.  **Dental Floss -** Dental floss is a thread-like structure that helps remove debris and food entrapment between the tooth surface.\n\n【66】6.  **Proper Diet and Nutrition -** Proper healthy diet, including fruits and vegetables, should be taken. Avoid sticky foods and if sticky foods are taken, brush the teeth to prevent dental caries. Certain foods are needed for healthy teeth. Taking calcium-rich foods and fruits and vegetables will increase the salivary flow and prevent dental caries. Avoid snacks and other beverages which will have an acid attack on the enamel surface of the teeth and cause dental caries.\n\n【67】7.  **Fluoride Gel -** The fluoride gel is applied to children aged 5, 9, and 13 years, using customized trays to prevent dental caries. The fluoride gel is applied in the tray, and then the tray is inserted into the oral cavity and placed for three to five minutes; then, the patient is asked not to wash or rinse the mouth for half an hour at least. This helps in the prevention of dental caries.\n\n【68】8.  **Regular Dental Check-Up and Cleaning -** Regular dental check-ups and cleaning help remove plaque and and identify and treat dental caries (if any) in the early stages.\n\n【69】9.  **Pit and Fissure Sealant -** Pit and fissure sealant are restorative materials placed along the pits in the posterior teeth of all age groups, including children and adults. It controls the acid attack on teeth and plaque formation, thus preventing the occurrence of dental caries.\n\n【70】10.  **Xylitol Gum -** Antibacterial mouth rinse can also prevent dental caries. It is usually given when the medical condition causes dry mouth and causes dental caries. The xylitol gum-chewing along with antibacterial mouthwash also helps in reducing dental caries.\n\n【71】**When to See a Dentist for Dental Caries?**\n\n【72】Most people would not notice the black stain or pit on the tooth surface and get to know of it only when they get a toothache. But when toothache starts, dental caries would have gone to the deep layers of the tooth structure. So dental check-up every six months once is needed to identify dental caries and prevent its further progression.\n\n【73】**Conclusion:**\n\n【74】Deposition of sugary foods and beverages on the tooth surface, which are not adequately removed by brushing, results in dental caries. Treating the dental carious lesion at an early stage not only saves the tooth structure but also prevents exposure to pain and reduces treatment costs.\n\n【75】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【76】无关删除-1:<u>*   Dental Caries  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551699/\n*   Sugars and dental caries  \n    https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sugars-and-dental-caries\n*   Cavities  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/fast-facts/cavities/index.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic condition affecting the joints of millions of people worldwide. The condition causes inflammation and stiffness of the joints, most commonly of the knees, hands, hips, and spine. Doctors recommend opioids for pain relief; however, they do not recommend long-term usage due to their potential side effects. Alternate treatments like acupuncture, hot and cold therapy, massages, or trying herbal supplements can help relieve pain.\n\n【2】What Is Acupuncture?\n--------------------\n\n【3】Acupuncture is an alternative medicine technique that uses small needles inserted into the body for the treatment of pain in chronic conditions. Chinese medicine believes that the procedure stimulates nerves, muscles, and tissues and works by balancing the energy flow in the body, thereby reducing pain and promoting healing. Researchers believe that acupuncture makes the body release natural pain killers, thus giving relief to pain.\n\n【4】Acupuncture is given as a complementary therapy to patients who also receive medical treatment. Treatment with acupuncture is found to provide relief for days to weeks post-treatment. However, patients may require six to eight sessions to get considerable relief from pain, though it may differ from patient to patient.\n\n【5】What Are the Types of Acupuncture?\n----------------------------------\n\n【6】Apart from the traditional acupuncture, the other options available include:\n\n【7】*   **Electro-Acupuncture:** Electro-acupuncture differs from the traditional type by using two needles instead of one. A mild current is passed between the needles, which helps in additional stimulation of the points on the skin.\n\n【8】*   **Auricular Acupuncture:** Also known as ear acupuncture, the technique works on the concept that there are acupuncture points on the ear, which correspond to the various body parts. Auricular acupuncture, when followed, is thought to provide relief from pain within 48 hours.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Nonarticular Rheumatism: A Complete Picture</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility - An Overview</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Ayurvedic Treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis - An Overview</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【10】*   **Battlefield Acupuncture:** This is a type of auricular acupuncture that military facilities use for immediate pain relief. However, more research is being done on using the therapy for long-term benefits.\n\n【11】How Does Acupuncture Benefit Knee Pain?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【12】Knee pain can have a negative impact on the quality of life of the patient. It becomes difficult for them to carry out day-to-day activities and may also cause disturbed sleep due to pain. Acupuncture is believed to give much-needed relief to people with knee pain.\n\n【13】Acupuncture needles send signals to the brain, along the spinal cord, to release “feel good” hormones or endorphins into the body, which is considered the reason for acupuncture to work in patients with knee pain. Also, acupuncture is believed to decrease the production of the hormone cortisol that controls inflammation. Acupuncture treatment causes a reduction in pain and inflammation, thereby improving the mobility and function of the knees.\n\n【14】Research is being done on various factors that play a role in the positive effects of acupuncture, one of which is whether a patient's confidence in the technique helps improve the results of treatment.\n\n【15】What Are the Knee Conditions in Which Acupuncture Is Found Helpful?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Scientific studies reveal that acupuncture has been found to be effective in delaying and reducing the need for the use of opioid medications post-surgery to relieve pain.\n\n【17】The knee conditions in which acupuncture is found to be useful include:\n\n【18】**1\\. Osteoarthritis:** Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, usually beginning in the 50s. It can cause severe inflammation, stiffness, and immobility of joints. Rheumatologists, doctors specializing in the treatment of arthritis, have approved the use of acupuncture treatment in people having knee, hip, and hand pain. Evidence shows that the result of treatment is best in reducing knee pain. Therapy is shown to have both short-term and long-term benefits, with short-term pain relief for almost 13 weeks.\n\n【19】**2\\. Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system attacks its own cells and tissues. The condition can cause painful and swollen joints, more commonly involving the hands, knees, and ankles. Doctors suggest that acupuncture treatment is worth trying in rheumatoid arthritis patients and has been shown to improve the daily activities and the way joints work. Acupuncture has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects and also helps improve immunity in RA patients.\n\n【20】**3\\. Chronic Knee Pain:** Chronic knee pain can occur as a result of injury or various health conditions. Acupuncture helps in better pain management. However, pain relief must not completely rely upon acupuncture; it has to be combined with other therapies and lifestyle changes as well.\n\n【21】Acupuncture therapy for use in the following conditions is still under research. The related conditions include:\n\n【22】*   **Fibromyalgia:** A condition affecting the muscles and soft tissues that causes chronic pain, tenderness, and tiredness.\n\n【23】*   **Gout:** A kind of arthritis that causes joint inflammation due to excess accumulation of uric acid, mainly involving the big toe.\n\n【24】*   **Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS):** A painful condition occurring due to inflammation of one or more joints of the spine.\n\n【25】*   **Lupus:** It is an autoimmune disease causing skin rashes, arthritis, and kidney failure in rare cases.\n\n【26】What Are the Risks and Side-Effects Involved in Acupuncture Treatment?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】The risks involved in acupuncture treatment are pretty low; hence doctors may advise the patients to try it as an additional option. The patient must be sure that the acupuncture practitioner is experienced and licensed. Care must be taken to use sterile needles to prevent infection. The practitioner must be informed well in advance about the medical conditions and medicines the patient is using.\n\n【28】The following conditions have to be informed prior to treatment, which includes:\n\n【29】*   Use of blood thinners or any bleeding disorders.\n\n【30】*   Pregnant females or those who plan to get pregnant.\n\n【31】*   Use of pacemakers for heart conditions.\n\n【32】Common side-effects that are noted include bruising, soreness, or bleeding at the point of application of the needle. Less common side effects like dizziness, nausea, or an increase in pain can occur.\n\n【33】Treatment from a competent and well-experienced practitioner can reduce the risks and side effects.\n\n【34】What Happens During an Acupuncture Session?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【35】During the first appointment, the acupuncturist asks for medical history, lifestyle habits, and the condition for which they need treatment.\n\n【36】Before the start of the session, the practitioner will make the patient lie down or sit on a chair in a relaxed position. Then the area to be treated is wiped with an alcohol-based solution to disinfect the skin, following which needles are passed to specific points on the skin. Most patients do not feel pain or discomfort during the insertion of the needles. Some even reported to have felt relaxed during the sessions. However, a few patients may experience mild pain or side effects if the needles are not positioned properly or the patient moves during the placement. The session may last for a few minutes, with a need for longer sessions for different conditions.\n\n【37】The duration of therapy depends upon the type and severity of the condition. The practitioner may advise for a session once or twice a week. Also, the sessions may be continued for several weeks to months, based on the treatment response shown by the patient.\n\n【38】**Conclusion:**\n\n【39】Knee pain is a condition that has an impact on the lives of people affected. It can cause constant pain and discomfort that prevents daily activities from being carried out smoothly. But the good news is knee pain can be managed without the need to take opioid medicines for longer periods. Doctors themselves have advised patients to try alternative therapies for pain management, the popular one being acupuncture. Studies have shown an improvement in pain in patients going for acupuncture, thereby improving their quality of life. However, choosing a well-qualified acupuncture practitioner is pivotal in getting optimal results.\n\n【40】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【41】* * *\n\n【42】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Various Options for Treating Knee Pain?**\n\n【43】Doctors recommend the use of opioid medications for the relief of knee pain.

Such connections are present naturally within the body. Sometimes, they are surgically created to bypass or replace a damaged portion. Anastomosis is mainly done in the bowel or blood vessels and can be of different types. It is up to the surgeon to choose the correct procedure suitable for the patient’s condition.\n\n【1】What Is Surgical Anastomosis?\n-----------------------------\n\n【2】Anastomosis is the creation of a connection between two tube-like structures by the surgeon. Anastomosis is usually made when there is damage to a part of an organ that is surgically removed, which then requires the remaining parts to be connected for normal functioning. It is also done in cases where a new pathway is needed to bypass the original blocked pathway. Hence, the surgeon can create an anastomosis between two arteries, two veins, two parts of the intestine (bowel), or two parts of the digestive tract.\n\n【3】Are Anastomoses Always Created Surgically?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Anastomosis is not always created surgically. It is also naturally present in the body where the arteries or veins are connected to carry the blood to all body parts. There is a structure called the circle of Willis, an example of a natural anastomotic connection. It connects the two internal carotid arteries and two vertebral arteries. These are the main arteries that supply the brain. The arrangements of the arteries are in such a way that it creates a backup supply of blood to the brain, even if any one of the arteries gets blocked or damaged. This ensures a continuous supply of oxygenated blood to the brain to prevent cerebral ischemia (an injury to the brain due to inadequate blood flow).\n\n【5】Why Is Surgical Anastomosis Required?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【6】The surgeon recommends a surgical anastomosis in the following situations:\n\n【7】*   For repairing damage to the arteries or veins.\n\n【8】*   For creating a blood supply to a donor organ after transplantation.\n\n【9】*   To create a bypass to the blocked arteries.\n\n【10】*   For connecting two parts of the bowel after removing the damaged section.\n\n【11】It is used in managing the following conditions:\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【14】Impacts on Pregnancy and Lactation After a Bariatric Surgery\n\n【15】Bariatric Surgery and Its Link With Cancer\n\n【16】Biliary Bypass Procedures: Detour Ahead\n\n【17】*   Inflammatory bowel diseases (diseases that cause inflammation to the digestive tract) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\n\n【18】*   Intestinal blockage.\n\n【19】*   Intestinal polyps (polyps are overgrowths in the lining of the intestine).\n\n【20】*   Intestinal cancer.\n\n【21】*   Traumatic injury to any body part.\n\n【22】When Is Surgical Anastomosis Not Indicated?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【23】After surgery of removing an artery or a part of an intestine, the anastomosis may not be recommended to be performed on the same day of surgery. This is because of inflammation, which requires some time to heal. During the healing time, an ostomy (a surgical opening created on the body) can be used to divert the contents. After complete healing occurs, the surgery for anastomosis is performed, and the ostomy is closed.\n\n【24】What Are the Different Types of Surgical Anastomosis?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Anastomosis is mainly of three types:\n\n【26】*   **End-To-End Anastomosis -** Here, the surgeon connects two open ends to form a single tube.\n\n【27】*   **Side-To-Side Anastomosis -** The sides of two parts are connected rather than two ends. The ends of both sides are closed.\n\n【28】*   **End-To-Side Anastomosis -** This connects one end to the side of another tubular structure. The two open ends of the side channel are closed.\n\n【29】The surgeon decides which type of anastomosis to use depending on the diameter of the parts to be connected. Anastomosis is most often created in the bowel or the vascular system.\n\n【30】*   **Bowel Anastomosis (Intestinal Anastomosis) -** It is a procedure to reconnect two parts of the bowel or to other structures in the digestive tract to establish continuity. Some of the surgical anastomosis procedures in the bowel include:\n    *   **Intestinal Anastomosis:** Involves replacing the removed, damaged part by connecting the other two ends of the intestine.\n    *   **Ileocolonic Anastomosis:** Connects the ends of the small intestine to the large intestine. Bowel resection surgery requires this type of anastomosis to maintain a ceaseless flow of intestinal contents.\n    *   **Colectomy:** Here, the colon (large intestine) is completely removed. So, the small intestine is connected to the rectum.\n    *   **Single Anastomosis Gastric Bypass:** Gastric bypass surgeries help bypass a part of the digestive tract, usually done in most weight loss procedures. In this type of anastomosis, the upper part of the stomach is attached to a tube (that forms a new smaller stomach) and connected to the lower part of the intestine. This helps keep the remaining portion between the stomach and the lower part of the intestine to be bypassed.\n    *   **Hepaticojejunostomy:** It refers to the anastomosis between the hepatic duct (liver duct) and the jejunum (a part of the small intestine). This procedure is done in conditions where the bile duct is damaged, and hence the connection between the duct directly to the jejunum ensures the free flow of bile.\n\n【31】*   **Vascular Anastomosis -** The connection between blood vessels when one gets injured or blocked. Some of the surgical anastomosis procedures in the vascular system include:\n    *   **Arterio Arterial Anastomosis:** Connecting two arteries.\n    *   **Venovenous Anastomosis:** Connecting two veins.\n    *   **Arteriovenous Anastomosis:** Connecting an artery to a vein.\n\n【32】The procedures that require vascular anastomosis are:\n\n【33】*   **Arterial Bypass Surgery -** It redirects a damaged artery by connecting the normal functioning artery to an artery or vein graft from another body site. Hence, the donor and the recipient site both require anastomosis.\n\n【34】*   **Dialysis -** In dialysis, access is created between the dialysis machine and the patient's bloodstream by anastomosis between two blood vessels (artery and vein). Such a connection is called an arteriovenous fistula.\n\n【35】How to Perform a Surgical Anastomosis?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【36】The doctor determines the patient's condition and provides the proper treatment accordingly. The whole procedure is done under general anesthesia. The surgery can be done using any of the following types:\n\n【37】1.  **Laparoscopic or Keyhole Surgery:** The surgeon uses a laparoscope (fiber-optic instrument with a camera attached). An incision is made, and the laparoscope is introduced through the incision. The surgeon can visualize the structures in the operating site with the camera. This procedure involves small incisions, is painless, and has faster healing.\n\n【38】2.  **Laparotomy or Open Surgery:** This procedure uses a larger incision. Hence, postoperative pain may occur, and the recovery rate is slower.\n\n【39】3.  **Hand-Assisted Laparoscopy:** This technique uses an incision greater than the laparoscopic surgery but smaller than the open surgery. The surgeon inserts the hand through the incision and does the procedure.\n\n【40】4.  **Robotic Surgery:** This allows the doctor to perform the surgery with great precision and is minimally invasive.\n\n【41】How Is the Recovery After Surgical Anastomosis?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【42】The complete recovery can take anywhere from six weeks to twelve months. Open surgery takes a longer time to heal. The basic instructions to be followed after discharge from the hospital include:\n\n【43】*   Maintaining a healthy diet.\n\n【44】*   The surgeon prescribes painkillers that must be consumed regularly.\n\n【45】*   Gentle exercises, as instructed by the surgeon, must be followed to maintain a good blood flow.\n\n【46】*   The patient must avoid doing heavy exercises that put too much strain on the body.\n\n【47】*   Patients with smoking and alcohol habits must quit them.\n\n【48】What Are the Complications of Surgical Anastomosis?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】*   **General Complications:** Like bleeding, infection, injury to adjacent organs or vessels, and allergic reactions may occur.\n\n【50】*   **Anastomotic Leak:** One of the major complications of anastomosis that requires immediate treatment. When the anastomosis is not healed completely, the contents or fluid passing through it may leak. This is more common with bowel anastomosis. The cause for the leak can be due to poor wound healing, malnutrition, or any underlying medical illness. These patients require another surgery to repair the leakage.\n\n【51】*   **Anastomotic Stenosis:** Stenosis refers to the narrowing or blockage of the anastomosis. The presence of scar tissue within the anastomosis will lead to its narrowing. These can be treated using a balloon to dilate or widen the pathway of anastomosis.\n\n【52】Changes that occur with the operated site, such as leakage, infection, pain, or any discomfort, must be brought to the surgeon's notice immediately. This helps the surgeon find the cause and provide treatment to prevent further complications.\n\n【53】**Conclusion**\n\n【54】Surgical anastomosis is a connection between two tubular structures created by humans through surgery. It may seem easy, but it requires accurate technique and flexibility to perform the surgery without complications. Complications are rare, but if they occur, the surgeon must be ready to manage them immediately. Overall, the outcome of the surgery is good and helps to establish continuity and functionality.\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>*   Anastomotic integrity after operations for large-bowel cancer: a multicentre study.  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1713296/\n*   Anastomotic Leaks After Intestinal Anastomosis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876987/\n*   Bowel anastomoses: The theory, the practice and the evidence base  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3536859/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Nanoemulsion is a mixture of small particles of liquid in a dispersed phase (oil or water) in another base liquid in dispersing medium (surfactant) mainly used to deliver compact active, reagents in the controlled process, these liquids are stable containing a combination of oil, water phase with surfactant.\n\n【2】What Are the Preparation Methods and Composition of Nanoemulsions?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Nanoemulsion can be prepared by using high-pressure homogenization. It is a method in which high pressure is passed in the tank of product, which creates a small particle of uniform size of approximately 1 nm. The other method is microfluidization which is a mixing device with high pressure. It consists of microchannels. The product is passed through it, which is then filtered to create the small uniform size of nanoemulsion. The emulsion can be composed of oil, surfactants like solubilizing agents, adsorption enhancers, and aqueous media like water, glycerine, ethanol, and propanol.\n\n【4】What Is the Use of Nanoemulsion in Cosmetics?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Nanoemulsions have gained much popularity by the manufacturers as they help maintain the stability of the product. Because of the fine droplet particles, they can spread in the larger area easily. The active ingredient can penetrate the skin better and reduce water loss from the body through the skin. Nanoemulsion helps in increased absorption of the product. They are available in water-oil concentrations and helpful in topical, oral, and injectable mode for product use. They are insoluble in water. The fine particles help them to give the product a transparent look; they require less amount of surfactant compared to microemulsion, help in increasing the bioavailability of the product, and the absorption of active ingredient is faster and efficient and can be easily used by the consumer.\n\n【6】They are widely known for their property of spreading to large surface areas with small volumes; because of these properties, they are widely used in sunscreen creams and moisturizing creams. Nanoemulsions help in increasing the shelf life of products with controlled release of the active ingredient. They are available in a variety of formulations in the form of cream, liquid, gel, foam, and sprays. These formulations are made without irritation and toxicity that can be easily applied to the skin without itching and burning sensation on the mucous membrane.\n\n【7】What Are the Types of Nanoemulsions Used in Cosmetics?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】A variety of nanoemulsions are used in beauty products like fairness cream, makeup base products, and lipsticks. Nanoemulsions are used to make colored makeup products. Like gold nanoparticles give red or blue coloration, silver nanoparticles give yellow coloration, and gold-silver nanocomposites give orange color. They are also used in skin whitening cosmetic products giving desired skin tone.\n\n【9】Nanoemulsions are used in lip care products like lip gloss, lipstick, lip balm, and liner to retain moisture in lips. Silver and gold nanoemulsions are used to give color to lipstick in various modulations for long-lasting lipstick.\n\n【10】Nanoemulsions are also used in hair care products like oil, shampoo, conditioner, serum, gel, and spray to prevent hair fall and hair growth, improving the texture of hair, ammonium salts are added to give shine, softness, and smoothness to hair, silver, gold, copper, and other nanoparticles are used for hair coloring.\n\n【11】How Are Nanoemulsions Delivered?\n--------------------------------\n\n【12】Nanoemulsions have many properties and advantages, and because of that, they are used extensively; nanoemulsions are available in various forms, like parenteral drugs, oral and topical modes, and ocular and pulmonary modes. Nanoemulsions are used in biotechnology for an enzymatic chain reaction and the synthesis of ester, peptides, and sugar acetyl. Also used in hydrolysis reactions, steroid reactions, and used in disinfectant cleaners used in hospitals, and healthcare centers; as the particles are fine, they are less or no irritant to eyes and skin.\n\n【13】*   The parenteral mode of drug administration with nanoemulsion is far more effective than macro and microemulsion, as nanoemulsion particles are fine; they are easily absorbed and transported into the system and are much more effective as they are slowly cleared out. They are also used in vaccines as a vehicle to transport protein to the mucosal surface to fasten the absorption of antigens in cells.\n\n【14】*   Oral and topical mode of delivery helps in easy absorption with less drug toxicity with efficient potency. They are ideally used with steroids, antibiotics, diuretics, and hormone formulations. They are easily penetrated through the skin because of the fine droplet size and are absorbed better.\n\n【15】*   Ocular and pulmonary mode for eye and lung diseases in the form of eye drops and nasal spray. The fine drop of nanoemulsion is easily absorbed, helping in the solubility of carrier drugs that are poorly dissolved.\n\n【16】What Is the Disadvantage of Nanoemulsion?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【17】Due to the extensive use of nanoemulsion in multisector giving promising results, a concern has been raised by several governments and non-government bodies on use. Guidelines have been proposed by the European Commission and Food and Drug Administration on use. The use of nanoemulsion is registered under research, evaluation, authorization, and restriction of chemicals aiming to utilize safe usage.\n\n【18】*   A large concentration of surfactant is a must for balancing nanodroplets to avoid toxicity.\n\n【19】*   Because of its property to cover the high surface area to the volume of nanoparticle ratio and small particles, it becomes highly reactive, which can raise toxicity.\n\n【20】*   Due to the excellent penetration properties, the toxicity spreads fast into the system, leading to adverse effects.\n\n【21】*   The nanoparticles can permeate through the skin into the bloodstream and are absorbed into the skin. Blood supplying organs, the pulmonary tract, and the brain, which can be advantageous or disadvantageous depending upon the toxicity of surfactant present in it, causing benefit or harm to the body.\n\n【22】*   Studies have shown titanium oxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles used in sunscreen can absorb ultraviolet rays and cause harm to the skin leading to cell destruction and skin cancer; traces of titanium dioxide nanoparticles were also found in brain cells, which leads to brain damage.\n\n【23】*   Research has also found free radicals of aluminum oxide nanoparticles lead to stem cell toxicity and the destruction of brain blood vessel cells.\n\n【24】**Conclusion**\n\n【25】Cosmetic nanoemulsion has shown promising results over the years and is used extensively by manufacturers for its benefits, but still, there is not much data available on its adverse effect, so one must use these products mindfully with the advice of a healthcare provider.\n\n【26】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【27】* * *\n\n【28】#### **1.**删除换行**Which Method Is Most Effective for Creating Nanoemulsions?**\n\n【29】High-pressure homogenization can be used to create nanoemulsion.

Oil, surfactants such as adsorption enhancers, solubilizing agents, and aqueous media such as water, glycerine, ethanol, and propanol can be used to create an emulsion.\n\n【30】#### **2.**删除换行**What Causes the Instability of Nanoemulsion?**\n\n【31】In contrast to microemulsions, nanoemulsions are thermodynamically unstable systems because some nanoemulsions require significant energy to form. The free energy of the colloidal dispersion in a nanoemulsion is greater than the free energy of the separate phases (oil and water), indicating that the nanoemulsion is thermodynamically unstable. Three methods are commonly used to prepare nanoemulsions: high-pressure homogenization, microfluidization, and the phase-inversion temperature method.\n\n【32】#### **3.**删除换行**Is Nanoemulsion Safe?**\n\n【33】Cosmetic nanoemulsion has shown promising results over the years. Manufacturers widely use it for the benefits, but there is little data on its adverse effects, so these products must be used with caution and under the supervision of a healthcare provider. Most recent research on the safety and toxicity of nanoemulsions in biological systems suggests that their use is safe. There have been a few studies in which researchers discovered that nanoemulsions are toxic, most likely due to the high doses used.\n\n【34】#### **4.**删除换行**How Can the Particle Size of a Nanoemulsion Be Reduced?**\n\n【35】Nanoemulsions are colloidal particulate systems with submicron particle sizes that act as drug carrier molecules. Their dimensions range from 10 to 1,000 nm. Ultrasonication is a popular high-energy method for reducing the droplet size of nanoemulsions. Mechanical vibrations from ultrasound waves (> 20 kHz) cause sinusoidal pressure variation in the emulsion system in this method.\n\n【36】#### **5.**删除换行**Why Are Nanoemulsions Kinetically Stable?**\n\n【37】Nanoemulsions are thermodynamically unstable systems because some nanoemulsions require significant energy to form. In contrast, they are kinetically stable because of their small particle size. Nanoemulsions have a bluish appearance due to Rayleigh scattering because the droplet sizes are smaller than the wavelength of incident light.\n\n【38】#### **6.**删除换行**Which Emulsion Is Best for Dry Skin?**\n\n【39】Hyaluronic acid emulsions are intended to treat dry skin. Emulsions are also excellent in hot and humid climates because they quench thirsty skin, like traditional creams and face oils, without leaving it greasy. Emulsions, on the other hand, can benefit dry skin.\n\n【40】#### **7.**删除换行**What Exactly Is Cosmetic Nanotechnology?**\n\n【41】Nanotechnology incorporation in cosmetic formulation is regarded as the most recent and emerging technology. Cosmetic manufacturers use nanoscale ingredients to provide better ultraviolet protection, long-lasting effects, deeper skin penetration, finish quality, increased color, and many other benefits.\n\n【42】#### **8.**删除换行**Which Is More Effective, Emulsion or Moisturizer?**\n\n【43】The primary function of skin emulsion is to keep the skin hydrated, better than moisturizers and face creams, regardless of the skin type. An emulsion is non-comedogenic due to its water-based formula. It clearly indicates that emulsion does not clog the skin pores.\n\n【44】#### **9.**删除换行**When Is The Best Time To Use Emulsion?**\n\n【45】In general, an emulsion should be used as one of the last steps in the skincare routine to lock in any ingredients you feed the skin to treat a specific issue. Then, after the most active product, an emulsion should be applied.\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>*   Nanoemulsions for health, food, and cosmetics: a review  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7956871\n*   Nanotechnology in cosmetics pros and cons  \n    https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-959X/abf46b\n*   Challenges and Future Prospects of Nanoemulsion as a Drug Delivery System  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27799037</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The condition is a normal occurrence during pregnancy and breastfeeding; however, when it occurs during other times due to disease or the use of certain medicines, it must be addressed and treated. Hyperprolactinemia can affect both men and women, causing symptoms like menstrual disturbances, infertility, and breast milk production.\n\n【2】What Is Prolactin?\n------------------\n\n【3】Prolactin is produced by the pituitary gland, a small pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain. Also called lactotropin, the hormone helps in the development of mammary glands in the breast tissue, milk production, and lactation. Small amounts of prolactin are also produced by the uterus, nervous system, and immune system. Apart from promoting breast milk production, prolactin also suppresses other pituitary hormones like luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thereby decreasing the levels of estrogen (in women) and testosterone (in men) affecting fertility. Prolactin levels are low in non-pregnant, non-lactating people and in males. Elevated levels are common in pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.\n\n【4】The normal prolactin values include:\n\n【5】*   **In Males:** Less than 20 ng/mL.\n\n【6】*   **Non-pregnant and Non-lactating Women:** Less than 25 ng/mL.\n\n【7】*   **In Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women:** 80 to 400 ng/mL.\n\n【8】All the above units of measurement are nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL).\n\n【9】Who Does Hyperprolactinemia Affect More Commonly?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Hyperprolactinemia affects people below the age of 40. It is more common in females when compared to males and very rare in children.\n\n【11】How Is Prolactinoma Different From Hyperprolactinemia?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Prolactinoma is a benign (harmless) tumor of the pituitary gland which leads to excess production of the hormone prolactin.\n\n【13】Hyperprolactinemia occurs due to increased blood levels of prolactin. Apart from prolactinomas being the reason, other medical conditions or the use of certain medicines can also lead to hyperprolactinemia.\n\n【14】What Are the Causes of Hyperprolactinemia?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The causes of hyperprolactinemia include:\n\n【16】1.  Prolactinoma.\n\n【17】2.  Certain health conditions.\n\n【18】3.  Certain medicines.\n\n【19】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Does lack of periods due to high prolactin level damage general health?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I am a PCOS patient and my prolactin level is 42.

Other tumors of the pituitary gland.\n    </u>\n\n【20】Sometimes there can be no particular cause for hyperprolactinemia. This condition is called idiopathic hyperprolactinemia. They usually subside on their own without any treatment.\n\n【21】**Prolactinomas:** A prolactinoma is a harmless tumor of the pituitary gland which results in excess production of prolactin. It is the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia.\n\n【22】**Health Conditions:**\n\n【23】Certain health conditions apart from prolactinomas can also cause high prolactin levels in the blood, which include:\n\n【24】*   Kidney diseases.\n*   Hypothyroidism is a condition due to a decrease in the production of thyroid hormones.\n*   Shingles are a viral infection that causes painful blisters and rashes on the skin.\n*   Polycystic ovary disease is a hormonal disorder that affects women of childbearing age.\n*   Cushing’s syndrome is a disorder occurring due to high levels of the hormone cortisol.\n*   Nelson syndrome is a condition occurring in patients after treatment for Cushing’s syndrome due to the removal of both adrenal glands.\n*   Chest wall injuries like fractured ribs or breastbone or bruising of the lungs.\n\n【25】**Medications:**\n\n【26】The brain releases a chemical called dopamine, which suppresses the production of prolactin in the body. Medicines that affect dopamine levels in the body can cause an increase in prolactin levels, which include:\n\n【27】*   Contraceptives or birth control pills.\n\n【28】*   Pain relievers that contain opioids.\n\n【29】*   Medicines like Metoclopramide are used to treat nausea.\n\n【30】*   Antipsychotic medications like Haloperidol and Risperidone.\n\n【31】*   Medicines for the treatment of menopause symptoms like estrogen therapy.\n\n【32】*   High blood pressure medications like Methyldopa or Calcium channel blockers.\n\n【33】*   Medicines for the treatment of heartburn and GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease).\n\n【34】Stopping the suspected medicine can return the prolactin levels to normal within three to four days. However, change or stoppage of medicines has to be done after the advice of a doctor.\n\n【35】**Other Tumors:**\n\n【36】Large tumors near the pituitary gland prevent dopamine that suppresses prolactin from reaching the pituitary gland.\n\n【37】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Hyperprolactinemia?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】As hyperprolactinemias occur more commonly in women, the following symptoms are noted, which include:\n\n【39】*   Irregular or no periods.\n\n【40】*   Discomfort and pain during sex due to dry vagina.\n\n【41】*   Breast milk production in non-pregnant and non-lactating females.\n\n【42】*   Pain in the breast.\n\n【43】Symptoms in males include:\n\n【44】*   Low levels of the hormone testosterone.\n\n【45】*   Gynecomastia or enlarged breast tissue.\n\n【46】*   Erectile dysfunction (inability to get and maintain an erect penis during sexual activity).\n\n【47】*   Decreased body hair and muscle mass.\n\n【48】As increased prolactin levels do not cause obvious symptoms in men, headaches and changes in vision that occur due to pituitary tumors may be the first sign of hyperprolactinemia.\n\n【49】Symptoms that are common in both males and females include:\n\n【50】*   Infertility.\n\n【51】*   Loss of interest in sex.\n\n【52】*   Decrease in bone mass.\n\n【53】How Is Hyperprolactinemia Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------\n\n【54】*   Diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is made based on blood test reports which indicate high prolactin levels. The doctor may advise repeating the test in case of high blood prolactin levels, probably after fasting for at least eight hours.\n\n【55】*   Doctors may suggest an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan in order to look for any growths or tumors in the pituitary gland or the surrounding structures. MRI scan uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of internal body parts.\n\n【56】Additional blood and imaging tests may be required to determine other causes and treat the same.\n\n【57】How Is Hyperprolactinemia Treated?\n----------------------------------\n\n【58】*   Treatment of hyperprolactinemia depends on the cause. Treatment is not required in cases of few symptoms.\n\n【59】*   Patients with prolactinomas, which is the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia, require treatment in the form of medications, surgery or radiation therapy, or a combination of the above.\n\n【60】Treatment options for prolactinomas include:\n\n【61】**Medication:**\n\n【62】*   Medicines called Dopamine agonists are used to control the prolactin levels in the blood. They also help to shrink the size of tumors, thereby reducing the effects of pressure on the surrounding tissues and nerves.\n\n【63】*   Cabergoline, Bromocriptine, and Quinagolide are the most commonly used medications.\n\n【64】*   Common side effects of these medicines include dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n【65】*   The doctor prescribes medications for two years. Treatment is started with a low dosage, and once the patient's body gets accustomed to the medicines, the dosage is gradually increased.\n\n【66】*   Fertility is restored once the treatment is started. However, the patient is asked to avoid the medication during pregnancy, and regular monitoring of the prolactin levels is recommended.\n\n【67】**Surgery:**\n\n【68】*   Surgery is considered in cases where the patient has side effects due to medicines, drug interactions (with other drugs that the patient is using), or a large tumor.\n\n【69】*   The two types of surgeries that are used to treat prolactinomas include:\n\n【70】    *   **Transsphenoidal Surgery:** This is the most commonly employed technique. Access to the tumor is achieved through the nasal cavity. Therefore, complications are less in the transsphenoidal approach.\n\n【71】    *   **Transcranial Surgery:** Larger tumors that are difficult to remove through transsphenoidal or nasal surgery are removed by the surgeon through surgery in the upper part of the skull.\n\n【72】**Radiation:**\n\n【73】*   Therapy with radiation is suggested in cases that do not respond to medicines or surgery. However, it is a rarely employed technique. A single dose or multiple doses of radiation are decided based on the size of the tumor and the prolactin levels in the blood.\n\n【74】If the cause of high blood prolactin levels is due to prescribed medicines, doctors may recommend alternative options for the medicines. Hyperprolactinemia that occurs due to hypothyroidism can be managed by prescribing synthetic thyroid hormones, which bring the prolactin levels back to normal.\n\n【75】Can Hyperprolactinemia Be Prevented?\n------------------------------------\n\n【76】Hyperprolactinemia cannot be prevented. However, patients whose first-degree relatives (parent or sibling) are diagnosed with prolactinoma or MEN type 1 can go for genetic testing to know whether they have the condition as well.\n\n【77】**Conclusion:**\n\n【78】Hyperprolactinemia occurs due to increased levels of the hormone prolactin in the blood. The condition has a positive outlook and is treatable. In most cases, prolactinomas, which are the common cause, can be managed with medications or surgery, leading to a reversal of symptoms. Though the condition is not life-threatening, it can affect the quality of life due to issues like irregular periods and infertility. Men can face social embarrassment due to symptoms like enlarged breasts or hair loss. Consultation with a health care provider can always help the patients recover positively.\n\n【79】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【80】* * *\n\n【81】#### **1.**删除换行**Is High Prolactin Treatable?**\n\n【82】Yes. High prolactin conditions can be treated with medications and help the brain to produce more dopamine. These are called dopamine antagonists. Dopamine levels help keep prolactin levels in check. Surgery may be indicated in case of hyperprolactinemia caused by tumors.\n\n【83】#### **2.**删除换行**What Causes High Prolactin in Females?**\n\n【84】The most common cause for high prolactin levels in females is the development of prolactinoma. Prolactinoma is a tumor of the pituitary gland which produces more prolactin than normal. This can cause the female to produce breast milk even if the woman is not pregnant.\n\n【85】#### **3.**删除换行**What Is the Natural Treatment for Prolactin?**\n\n【86】Here are some natural ways to keep prolactin levels low –  \n\\- Reduce stress.  \n\\- Follow a healthy diet.  \n\\- Avoid activities heavy workout activities.  \n\\- Avoid activities that stimulate the nipples.   \n\\- Balance and reduce blood sugar levels.\n\n【87】#### **4.**删除换行**What Is Hyperprolactinemia Side Effects?**\n\n【88】Hyperprolactinemia or high prolactin levels can cause infertility, reduced sex drive, low libido, and altered sexual behaviors. It can cause the secretion of breast milk in both men and women (in non-pregnancy cases). Hyperprolactinemia is also known to cause significant bone loss in both males and females.\n\n【89】#### **5.**删除换行**What Are the Complications of Hyperprolactinemia?**\n\n【90】Complications of hyperprolactinemia can cause erectile dysfunction, smaller muscles, and enlarged breasts in males. Females suffer from infertility and irregular menstruation. Both males and females experience reduced sex drive, low libido, and osteoporosis (excessive bone loss).\n\n【91】#### **6.**删除换行**Can Stress cause Hyperprolactinemia?**\n\n【92】Yes. Studies show an association between stress and increased prolactin levels. Prolactin levels respond to increased stress levels in the body. This is called stress-induced hyperprolactinemia. Hence decreasing stress levels can help keep prolactin levels within normal range.\n\n【93】#### **7.**删除换行**Which Medications Cause Hyperprolactinemia?**\n\n【94】Medications that can cause prolactin levels to increase are –  \n\\- Antidepressants.  \n\\- Butyrophenones.  \n\\- Estrogens.  \n\\- H2 blockers.  \n\\- Methyldopa.  \n\\- Metoclopramide.  \n\\- Opiate medicines.  \n\\- Phenothiazines.  \n\\- Reserpine.  \n\\- Risperidone.  \n\\- Verapamil.\n\n【95】#### **8.**删除换行**What Is Normal Prolactin Level?**\n\n【96】Normal prolactin levels in the blood differ for men and women and in pregnant non-pregnants.  \n\\- In men, prolactin levels in males are less than 20 ng/mL.  \n\\- In non-pregnant women, prolactin levels are less than 25 ng/mL.  \n\\- Pregnant women- prolactin levels are usually higher– 80 to 400 ng/mL.\n\n【97】#### **9.**删除换行**Does Prolactin Affect the Brain?**\n\n【98】Yes. Studies show high prolactin levels are associated with psychosis, anxiety, short-term memory, memory loss, altered stress coping ability, and various other cognitive impairment.\n\n【99】#### **10.**删除换行**Does Exercise Reduce Prolactin?**\n\n【100】No. Exercising does not reduce prolactin levels but increases prolactin levels in the blood. Researches and studies show evidence that exercise may affect the release of prolactin hormone. With the increase in magnitude and high-intensity workouts, prolactin levels shoot up. Therefore, one must avoid high-intensity activities if they are suffering from hyperprolactinemia.\n\n【101】#### **11.**删除换行**Can Prolactin Cause Weight Gain?**\n\n【102】It can also lead to increased low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides and reduced high-density lipoproteins levels, likely the result of reduced lipoprotein lipase activity. This can lead to further weight gain and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【103】#### **12.**删除换行**At What Level of Prolactin Indicates a Tumor?**\n\n【104】Depending on the prolactin levels, doctors can predict the tumor size (prolactinoma).   \nProlactin levels are directly proportional to the size of the tumor, ranging from:  \n\\- Prolactin levels below 200 ng/ml indicate a tumor size of less than 1 centimeter in diameter.   \n\\- Prolactin levels of 200 ng/ml to 1000 ng/ml indicate tumor size of 1 cm to 2 centimeters.   \n\\- Levels more than 1000 ng/ml with tumor-sized more than 2 centimeters in diameter.\n\n【105】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【106】无关删除-1:<u>*   Hyperprolactinemia (High Prolactin Levels)  \n    https://www.reproductivefacts.org/news-and-publications/patient-fact-sheets-and-booklets/documents/fact-sheets-and-info-booklets/hyperprolactinemia-high-prolactin-levels/\n*   Hyperprolactinemia  \n    https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/hyperprolactinemia\n*   Hyperprolactinemia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3853872/\n*   Hyperprolactinemia  \n    https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/hyperprolactinemia</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Physiological changes in men and women occur as they become older, impacting sex life. In most healthy adults, the pleasure and desire in sex do not wane with age. Age is not the reason to change sexual habits. Older people may need to make a few minor adjustments to accommodate physical limits or the impact of specific illnesses or medications.Sexuality in later life is often despised, denied, and treated as a matter of amusement. It is critical to recognize that the need for sex and intimacy is universal and that older person are sexually motivated as well.\n\n【2】What Changes Affect the Sexual Lives of Older Men?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】*   Erection and ejaculation are delayed.\n\n【4】*   Erection may be less rigid.\n\n【5】*   The time between ejaculations may lengthen.\n\n【6】*   Ejaculation can be postponed for prolonged periods.\n\n【7】*   Orgasm could be milder.\n\n【8】*   In older persons, the reduced anticipatory arousal and refractory period last hours to days, whereas it only takes minutes in younger ones.\n\n【9】Most of these physical changes are caused by a progressive decrease in testosterone levels.\n\n【10】What Changes Affect the Sexual Lives of Older Women?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】*   Vaginal wall thinning and elasticity loss causes discomfort during intercourse.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Female Sexual Arousal Disorder: Break the Shackles and Seek Help!!</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I am below the normal BMI index.

Testosterone hormone is reduced in men during andropause. Andropause can cause physical, psychosocial, and sexual problems, such as:\n\n【19】*   Reduced muscle mass and a sense of physical weakness.\n\n【20】*   Swollen or sore breasts, smaller testicles, hair loss, and hot flashes.\n\n【21】*   Erection is less frequent, durable, and reliable.\n\n【22】*   Infertility due to a decrease in libido.\n\n【23】They usually strike men about the same time as women who enter menopause.\n\n【24】What Are the Causes of Reduced Sexual Activity in Older Adults?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】*   Inability to find a compatible companion.\n\n【26】*   Loss of interest due to a lack of privacy, poor health, and reduced libido.\n\n【27】*   A failure to perform.\n\n【28】*   Being regarded as sexually unappealing.\n\n【29】*   Negative opinions from family and coworkers.\n\n【30】Can Aging Cause Sexual Dysfunction?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【31】The regular sexual response cycle occurs in 4 phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. The absence of one or more steps in the response cycle is called sexual dysfunction.\n\n【32】Sexual dysfunction can be broadly classified based on its cause:\n\n【33】**Primary -** When a person has never experienced any phases of usual sexual response.\n\n【34】**Secondary -** When the phases were functional in the past, but now either one or all of them are non-functional (age-related factors).\n\n【35】**Situational or Conditional -** The phase lapse can be situational as it is influenced by certain factors (conditions that require medications or chronic illness).\n\n【36】Some illnesses, disabilities, medications, and procedures can interfere with your ability to have and enjoy sexual activity.\n\n【37】How Does Diabetes Impair Sex Life in Older Adults?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Any condition that impacts the overall health and well-being may also affect sexual health. Cardiovascular illnesses, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, hormone issues, melancholy (severe depression), or anxiety, might make it challenging to engage in sexual activity.\n\n【39】Men with diabetes are more likely to lack interest in sex and suffer from erectile dysfunction. Men and women are reported to have more orgasm problems, such as climaxing too rapidly (men) or not at all (women).\n\n【40】How Does Arthritis Impair Sex Life in Older Adults?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Arthritis causes joint pain, which can make sexual intercourse uncomfortable. Exercise, medications, and possibly joint replacement surgery could all help to alleviate the discomfort. Rest, warm baths, and repositioning or timing sexual activity are suggested.\n\n【42】How Does Urinary Incontinence Impair Sex Life in Older Adults?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】As people, particularly women, get older, they are more likely to lose bladder control. Urine loss can occur when there is too much pressure on the belly during intercourse. Changing postures or emptying the bladder before and after intercourse can help.\n\n【44】Is It True That Older Individuals Are Less Prone to Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】No. There is no protective shield that develops with age against STDs. STDs are likely to occur regardless of age if unprotected intercourse is performed. The most common sexually transmitted disease among the elderly is HIV or AIDS. This can happen for various reasons, including needle sharing, blood transfusions, and iatrogenic causes.\n\n【46】At What Specific Age Does a Man or Woman Stop Caring About Sex?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Having good physical and sexual health is crucial at any age. Sex may not be the same as the age progresses, but it may still be incredibly satisfying. And the urge for closeness is limitless. It is a fallacy that when people reach their fifties, they lose interest in sex. Libido is not age-dependent, but it is age-sensitive. While being older does not alter sexual impulses, difficulties connected with getting older, such as diabetes, dementia, death of a partner, and mental stress, can reduce libido. Thereby, there is no number for people to lose interest in sex.\n\n【48】How to Have a Satisfying Sex Life in Your Older Age?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】There are a few fundamental ways that can be helpful:\n\n【50】*   Being innovative, adaptable, and willing to adjust.\n\n【51】*   Exploring the body for sexual sensations and hypersensitive spots.\n\n【52】*   Communication of feelings to partner honestly and transparently.\n\n【53】*   The knowledge of the current medical situation should be kept in mind to increase the rate of satisfying sex.\n\n【54】*   When it comes to intimacy, it is always better to choose a time of day when they are most at ease, private, and have the most energy.\n\n【55】*   Reduce your symptoms by using remedies (stretching, warm bath, pain medication).\n\n【56】**Conclusion**\n\n【57】Sexual issues associated with aging can be stressful and upsetting. Our body's weight, skin, and muscle tone change as we age, and some older folks do not feel at ease with their aging bodies. Men and women of a certain age may be concerned that their spouses may no longer find them appealing. This anxiety can prevent one from having a satisfying sex life. It is important to discuss concerns with a partner or a therapist. Also, sex life is meaningful at all ages. Being tagged as a \"boomer\" does not mean being deprived of sex life.\n\n【58】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【59】* * *\n\n【60】#### **1.**删除换行**What Are the Sexual Changes in the Old Age?**\n\n【61】With age, the sexual response of a person starts to slow down, usually after the age of 50. However, the sexual drive is mostly affected by the health of a person and the behavior of the person with respect to sex or intimacy. In males, it may take longer to get an erection, and more time would be needed in between the erections.\n\n【62】#### **2.**删除换行**Does Sexual Attraction Decrease With Age?**\n\n【63】Aging brings significant physical changes in the human body that sometimes may also interfere with the ability to have and enjoy sex. With age, body changes include skin, weight, and muscle tone. Females usually experience a drop in sexual desire in their late 40s and early 50s, and for older men, this shift may not happen until their 60s and 70s.\n\n【64】#### **3.**删除换行**What Age-Related Changes Do Men Experience Sexually?**\n\n【65】It is natural for men to experience sex-related changes with aging. With age, there is a gradual decrease in sexual drive (libido). This can be related to underlying conditions such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease. The majority of men are able to maintain some amount of sexual desire in the late 60s or 70s.\n\n【66】#### **4.**删除换行**What Age Is the Sexual Urge the Highest?**\n\n【67】The sexual urge or libido tends to be highest at the age of 20s. In the case of females, it increases as the fertility declines, and the libido decreases after a female attains menopause. In females, sexual desire is found to be found at its peak during their 30s, and in males, it is usually in their 20s which declines with age.\n\n【68】#### **5.**删除换行**How to Make a Penis Harder?**\n\n【69】To strengthen erections and make the penis harder, some of the following steps can be done, such as -  \n\\- Doing kegel exercises.  \n\\- Eating a healthy diet.  \n\\- Get enough sleep.  \n\\- Drink less alcohol.  \n\\- Stop smoking.\n\n【70】#### **6.**删除换行**What Is a Normal Time to Release Sperm?**\n\n【71】There is no specific time of ejaculation as some men ejaculate within a few seconds, or some may ejaculate after a few minutes. However, the time can be increased by doing some lifestyle changes. The average time of ejaculation is considered to be five and a half minutes, and men who ejaculate within a few seconds of penetration may have premature ejaculation.\n\n【72】#### **7.**删除换行**Why Does a Man Get an Erection in the Morning?**\n\n【73】The early morning erection is usually due to high testosterone levels, as its level is highest in the morning after a male wakes up. It is highest after a person wakes up from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This hormone activates the nerves that stimulate the smooth muscles of the penis, increasing the blood supply in the interior of the penis.\n\n【74】#### **8.**删除换行**What Happens if a Man Goes Too Long Without Ejaculating?**\n\n【75】In some cases, men tend to choose not to ejaculate for a long time. This may cause some harmful side effects to the body. Not ejaculating may trigger psychological problems, such as people may start to experience sexual dysfunctions that may affect their ability to ejaculate. This may also lead to problems in their relationships.\n\n【76】#### **9.**删除换行**How to Increase Stamina in Bed?**\n\n【77】Sexual performance can be enhanced by following steps -  \n\\- Doing regular exercise to increase overall stamina.  \n\\- Spend more time on foreplay.  \n\\- Try to maintain a healthy weight.  \n\\- Get good quality sleep.  \n\\- Have a protein-rich diet.\n\n【78】#### **10.**删除换行**How to Get Healthy Sperm?**\n\n【79】A person can follow some of the following steps to increase their chance of producing healthy sperm which include -  \n\\- Maintaining a healthy weight.  \n\\- Eating a healthy diet.  \n\\- Following healthy sexual practices and preventing sexually transmitted diseases.  \n\\- Managing stress.  \n\\- Doing regular physical exercise.\n\n【80】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【81】无关删除-1:<u>*   Sexuality and Intimacy in Older Adults  \n    https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/sexuality-and-intimacy-older-adults\n*   Sexuality and Physical Changes With Aging  \n    https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/hw159186#hw159201</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This condition happens when there is a deficiency or any developmental defects associated with the erectile tissues of the penis. This anomaly is usually associated with other developmental malformations involving the organs such as kidneys and other genitourinary organs. Isolated megalourethra (megalourethra without the presence of any other developmental anomaly) is very rare. The megalourethra is not very life-threatening, but the presence of other developmental abnormalities can complicate the condition. Read further to know its types, causes, prevalence, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and management.\n\n【2】What Is a Megalourethra?\n------------------------\n\n【3】Megalourethra is an abnormal non-obstructive dilatation of the penile urethra due to the deficiency or failure in the development of the erectile tissues of the penis. The erectile tissues of the penis are the corpus cavernosum (two columns of spongy tissue that are present in the penis of males on either side of the ureter) and corpus spongiosum \\[a column of tissue that surrounds the urethra and runs along the shaft or the body of the penis, ends in its tip (also called glans penis)\\]. Megalourethra is also called megaurethra, megalomaniac urethra, or a macro penis. It can be identified at any age between 16 weeks of gestation and 24 years of age.\n\n【4】How Prevalent Is Megalourethra?\n-------------------------------\n\n【5】Megalourethra is an extremely rare condition with very few reported cases in the literature. Reports suggest that only 10 cases with prenatal megalourethra were reported before 2003. After which, further research has identified 100 cases of megalourethra post-natally in infants and 80 congenital cases, which concludes the total number of cases that have been reported so far in the history of the world population. The first case of congenital megalourethra was reported in the year 1955 by Nesbitt. It is more common in the anterior urethra but can affect the posterior urethra as well (the urethral valve is divided into anterior and posterior urethral valves).\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms Associated With Megalourethra?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Megalourethra can result in various problems, including;\n\n【8】*   Urinary retention (a situation wherein emptying the entire urinary bladder is not possible, leading to retention of the urine in the bladder).\n\n【9】*   Incontinence (lack of control over urination).\n\n【10】*   Enuresis or bedwetting.\n\n【11】*   Spontaneous rupture of the urinary bladder is also a very serious problem that can occur with the megalourethra.\n\n【12】*   Swelling under the penis.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I had unprotected sex.

Scaphoid or focal megalourethra (also called deformity of the penis).\n\n【20】2.  Fusiform or diffuse megalourethra (impotence).\n\n【21】**Scaphoid Megalourethra:**\n\n【22】It is the most common type of megalourethra among the cases that have been reported. This type has been spotted in around 80 % of the reported megalourethra cases. This type of megalourethra involves only the corpus spongiosum. The corpus spongiosum is deficient or absent in this type of megalourethra. This type is less serious and mild when compared to the fusiform type.\n\n【23】**Fusiform Megalourethra:**\n\n【24】This type has been spotted in fewer cases and only 20 % of the total cases. This type of megalourethra involves both the corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum. Both these structures are deficient or absent in this type. It is also found that this type of megalourethra has a very poor prognosis and is very serious comparatively.\n\n【25】What Are the Diagnostic Tests for Megalourethra?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Detailed investigation of the upper and lower urinary tract is required to identify megalourethra as early as possible to minimize the complications and morbidity rate. Following are the tests that are usually performed to identify and analyze megalourethra. The tests are selected based on the patient’s condition and the preference of the doctors.\n\n【27】*   CT (computed tomography) scan.\n\n【28】*   Ultrasound abdomen and pelvis.\n\n【29】*   Urethrogram (examination of the male urethra by using X-rays).\n\n【30】*   Cystoscopy (It is the endoscopy of the urinary bladder, which is accessed through the urethra).\n\n【31】*   Serum urea and creatinine levels need to be monitored periodically.\n\n【32】What Are the Syndromes and Conditions Associated With Megalourethra?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Following are a few common syndromes which, along with other developmental anomalies, can be associated with megalourethra;\n\n【34】*   Mega cystitis (very large urinary bladder compared to normal).\n\n【35】*   Pyelectasis (extra fluid in kidneys prenatally).\n\n【36】*   Distended bladder (retention of urine in the bladder).\n\n【37】*   Oligohydramnios (very less amniotic fluid).\n\n【38】*   Other urogenital abnormalities.\n\n【39】*   Prune belly syndrome.\n\n【40】*   VACTERL or VATER (vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac anomalies, tracheal anomalies, limb-related anomalies) syndrome.\n\n【41】*   Potter syndrome.\n\n【42】What Are the Differential Diagnoses of Megalourethra?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】Megalourethra is commonly mistaken for the below conditions that are associated with the urethra;\n\n【44】*   Urethral webs.\n\n【45】*   Urethral atresia.\n\n【46】*   Urethral diverticulum.\n\n【47】*   Urethral duplication.\n\n【48】How Is Megalourethra Treated?\n-----------------------------\n\n【49】*   Reduction urethroplasty is the common surgical procedure performed to manage megalourethra. It is a major surgery that is performed in various stages depending upon the severity of the condition; as per reports, in cases of megalourethra, one or two stages of urethroplasty are indicated.\n\n【50】*   Megalourethra requires a long-term follow-up to monitor if there are any complications associated with the penis function, like poor erection and fertility-related complications. Patients treated for fusiform megalourethra as babies or younger might require a prosthetic penis as adults.\n\n【51】*   In prenatally diagnosed megalourethra, various tests are done to identify the intensity and severity of megalourethra along with other associated congenital anomalies.\n\n【52】*   In cases with other severe developmental anomalies, termination of pregnancy is considered the best option.\n\n【53】*   In milder forms, resolution of the condition spontaneously has also been noted.\n\n【54】**Conclusion:**\n\n【55】Megalourethra is a very rare condition. Hence, diagnosing it properly and seeking treatment at the earliest is necessary for a positive treatment outcome. It is also seen that prompt treatment has provided very pleasing functional and cosmetic results in the treatment of the scaphoid variant of megalourethra. Management of this condition entirely depends upon each individual’s condition and developmental anomalies associated with megalourethra.\n\n【56】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【57】* * *\n\n【58】#### **1.**删除换行**When Does Blood Fill up in the Corpus Spongiosum?**\n\n【59】The corpus spongiosum is the mass of spongy tissues that is surrounding the male urethra inside the penis. The corpus spongiosum contains blood vessels that fill with blood. This makes the penis swollen and stiff and helps to make an erection, and keeps the surrounding urethra open during the erection.\n\n【60】#### **2.**删除换行**Can A Lacerated Erectile Tissues Repair on Its Own?**\n\n【61】No, the erectile tissue cannot be repaired or regenerated on its own. A mild form may heal on its own in 6 to 15 months. In case of nerve injury, it may require up to 18 months to heal and restore the nerve integrity.\n\n【62】#### **3.**删除换行**Where Is Corpus Spongiosum in Females?**\n\n【63】The corpus spongiosum is located in the clitoris among the muscular bundles of the urethral wall in females. The corpus spongiosum in females splits into two erectile tissues of the labia majora, the folds of flesh that enclose the external genitals of the females.\n\n【64】#### **4.**删除换行**Why Is There Pain in My Corpus Spongiosum?**\n\n【65】The rupture of the corpus spongiosum following an injury or trauma when the penis is fully erect can cause pain and tenderness. Other conditions may include  \n\\- Urinary tract infection.  \n\\- Peyronie’s disease (scar tissue in the penis as a result of injury or autoimmune condition).  \n\\- Balanitis affects the head of the penis.  \n\\- Priapism (painful erection lasting for longer hours).  \n\\- Penile cancer.\n\n【66】#### **5.**删除换行**How Can I Increase Blood Supply to Erectile Tissue?**\n\n【67】Adopting certain lifestyle changes can improve the blood circulation to erectile tissue, such as  \n\\- Eat a healthy diet.  \n\\- Exercise regularly.  \n\\- Avoid smoking and alcohol consumption.  \n\\- Manage your blood pressure.  \n\\- Maintain a healthy weight.  \n\\- Control blood sugar levels.  \n\\- Have an active sexual life.\n\n【68】#### **6.**删除换行**Which Muscle Makes the Penis Hard?**\n\n【69】Surrounding the penis region is the ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles in the pelvic region that helps to hold the erection in males. The contractions of these muscles produce a rigid erection phase. The rhythmic contractions of the muscles help in ejaculation.\n\n【70】#### **7.**删除换行**How Much Time Does It Take For a Man to Release Sperms?**\n\n【71】Orgasm occurs in both males and females. This may vary for different men and women if they want to delay their orgasm. Through orgasm, the males are able to release their sperms On average, and it may take five to seven minutes for a man to release sperm or ejaculate.\n\n【72】#### **8.**删除换行**For How Long Can a Man Hold an Erection?**\n\n【73】An average man may be able to have an erection for a minimum of ten minutes. The maximum time limits vary greatly and can be influenced by several external factors. This will, however, vary due to many factors, such as stress, sleep, medical history, or medication.\n\n【74】#### **9.**删除换行**Can an Erectile Tissue Damage Be Fixed?**\n\n【75】Yes, erectile tissue damage is often treated with surgery and repaired with absorbable stitches. Medications may be injected to repair the scar tissue in a non-surgical treatment. The time to heal depends on several management strategies and lifestyle changes from two months to fifteen months.\n\n【76】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【77】无关删除-1:<u>*   Isolated megalourethra: A rare case report and review of literature  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4155639/\n*   Congenital Scaphoid Megalourethra: A Case Report  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5458059/\n*   Prenatal diagnosis of congenital megalourethra: a rare anomaly  \n    https://www.ijrcog.org/index.php/ijrcog/article/view/4243</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Traumatic injury due to sports events often leads to fractures, sprains, strains, and dislocations. Hence, special attention is required for children and adolescents due to skeletal immaturity (bone not yet developed completely). The initial treatment aims at stabilizing the injury, followed by recognizing appropriate treatment for fractures in skeletally immature individuals.\n\n【2】What Are the Most Common Musculoskeletal Injuries in Children and Adolescents?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The most common musculoskeletal injuries are:\n\n【4】*   **Tendon Attachment Site Injury or Growth Plate Traction Injuries:** The growth plates are located at the terminal end of bones, wherein tendons are placed in close proximity to the growth plate. The attachment site of the tendon is relatively weak among children and more prone to injury (tendinitis - inflammation of tendon) due to overuse of muscles. Symptoms include pain during and after physical activity, swelling, tenderness, and bone thickening at the attachment site. Alteration of exercise is an integral part of managing this condition.\n\n【5】*   **Patella Dislocations and Subluxations:** The knee cap displacement due to traumatic injury (hard hit to the knee or changing the direction of one leg while sprinting). Symptoms include unbearable pain, joint deformity, instability, swelling, and difficulty in weight bearing. They are managed appropriately by plenty of rest and a rehabilitation program to strengthen the specific muscles. Unfortunately, the chance of recurrence is high; therefore, surgery is indicated in particular conditions, such as in the case of spontaneous dislocations.\n\n【6】*   **Fractures:** The types of fractures differ from adult to adolescent due to skeletal immaturity. The common types of fractures are:\n\n【7】1.  **Greenstick Fracture:** During development in children, the bones are more flexible and rubbery than in adults and more prone to bend or crack due to falls. Common sites of injury are forearms and lower legs.\n\n【8】2.  **Growth Plate Fracture:** The growth plates are located at the terminal end of bones (epiphysis). The bones are actively growing around the growth plate. Fractures involving the growth plates lead to typical changes in growth patterns. Common sites of injury include the wrist, elbow, ankle, and hip.\n\n【9】3.  **Avulsion Fracture:** It is most commonly seen in teenagers due to kicking, jumping, and sprinting, and it often results in a partial or complete displacement of a tendon followed by a tear of muscle or tendon. The condition recovers through physical therapy and requires surgery in rare situations.\n\n【10】*   **Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis:** The condition is characterized by instability due to a growth plate fracture of the hip joint. The symptoms include hip, knee, and groin pain, restricted movement, difficulty with weight bearing, and shortening of the affected leg (duck foot). The treatment protocol includes surgical intervention.\n\n【11】*   **Radial Head Subluxation:** This condition is characterized by partial dislocation of the elbow. It is commonly seen in children between one to four years of age as a result of picking or swinging up a child by one arm. Predominant symptoms are pain, restricted movement, and difficulty in bending the elbow.\n\n【12】What Are the Common Causes of Musculoskeletal Injury?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The primary causes are distinguished based on the age of the children:\n\n【14】1.  **Toddlers or Preschool:**\n\n【15】*   Infection (leads to septic arthritis, osteomyelitis of the hip, and spin).\n\n【16】*   Trauma.\n\n【17】*   Congenital or developmental disorder (like hip dysplasia).\n\n【18】*   Neurological disease (like cerebral palsy and hereditary syndromes).\n\n【19】*   Inflammatory arthritis.\n\n【20】*   Cancerous disease (like leukemia, neuroblastoma).\n\n【21】*   **5–10 Years of Age:**\n\n【22】*   Trauma (due to overuse or sports injuries).\n\n【23】*   Reactive arthritis (hip irritation).\n\n【24】*   Perthes’ disease.\n\n【25】*   Inflammatory arthritis.\n\n【26】*   Idiopathic pain syndromes (cause is unknown).\n\n【27】*   Cancerous disease.\n\n【28】*   **10–17 Years of Age:**\n\n【29】*   Trauma (due to overuse or sports injuries).\n\n【30】*   Slipped capital femoral epiphysis.\n\n【31】*   Inflammatory arthritis.\n\n【32】*   Idiopathic pain syndromes.\n\n【33】*   Tarsal coalition (two bones grow together and are connected by a bridge of bone, cartilage, or fibrous tissue).\n\n【34】*   Cancerous disease (leukemia, lymphoma, primary bone tumor).\n\n【35】What Are the Risk Factors?\n--------------------------\n\n【36】The common risk factors are:\n\n【37】*   **Sports Injury-** During growth spurt or development, the muscle and tendon can create tightness and inflexibility around joints due to trauma, resulting in imbalance (tendons are relatively weak among children and more prone to injury).\n\n【38】*   **Amenorrhoeic Athletes-** It is characterized by decreased bone density, skeletal maturity, and muscle strength in female athletes who have not attained puberty.\n\n【39】*   **Inappropriate Training-** Improper sports equipment and exercise leads to a major risk of injury.\n\n【40】*   **Psychological Factors-** Participation in high-risk events can increase the probability of severe sports injuries.\n\n【41】How to Diagnose Musculoskeletal Injury?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【42】The diagnosis is based on past medical conditions, physical examination with the correlation of X-rays, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), CT (computed tomography), and ultrasound required for the confirmative diagnosis of the condition.\n\n【43】What Is the General Protocol of Management?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【44】The general principles in managing musculoskeletal injury include:\n\n【45】*   Early diagnosis.\n\n【46】*   Evaluation of causative agents like biomechanical problems, non-fitted sports equipment, and frequent training load increase.\n\n【47】*   Adequate rest followed by injury.\n\n【48】*   Maintenance of cardiac health.\n\n【49】*   Avoid straining the non-affected muscles.\n\n【50】*   Maintenance of muscle strength and endurance on unaffected sites.\n\n【51】*   Avoid aggressive physical activity.\n\n【52】*   Gradual increase in sports activity without causing strain to the muscle and tendon.\n\n【53】What Is Physical Therapy and How Does It Heal Musculoskeletal Injury?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【54】Physical therapy is also known as physiotherapy, which heals the tissue with the help of exercise based on injury and physiological demands of the human body. Physical therapists use various techniques in the rehabilitation phase, along with physical modalities of therapeutic exercise and cold or heat therapy.\n\n【55】*   **Therapeutic Exercise:** Exercise is employed to stretch the muscles to improve joint mobility, maintain cardiac health, and increase strength, power, endurance, speed, agility, and sport-specific skills.\n\n【56】*   **Cold Therapy:** Cold therapy (ice) helps reduce swelling, pain, and inflammation. It eventually limits secondary injury, ischemia (restricted blood flow), and damage to other structures. The ice pack is applied to target muscles without compression (compression increases contact between ice and skin and may limit rewarming) for 25 minutes to promote healing.\n\n【57】*   **Heat Therapy:** Heat therapy reduces pain and muscle spasms. Simultaneously, it increases blood flow. The standard form is warm-up exercises or passive heating modalities like hot packs, hydrotherapy, and ultrasound. It is mostly used in chronic conditions and restricted muscle or joint motion.\n\n【58】*   **Other Modalities:** Ultrasound and electrical stimulation also promote healing in the rehabilitation phase.\n\n【59】**Conclusion**\n\n【60】Commonly seen in young athletes, musculoskeletal injuries can be managed by primary care providers with appropriate training, followed by a rehabilitation program to protect the affected site and maintain muscle strength and endurance in unaffected muscles, followed by gradual reintroduction of sport-specific activities.\n\n【61】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【62】无关删除-1:<u>*   Musculoskeletal injuries in the pediatric and adolescent athlete  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16282035/\n*   Musculoskeletal conditions in children and adolescents managed in Australian primary care  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24885231/\n*   Musculoskeletal pain in children and adolescents  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27437719/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Swaddling, a sleep enhancer for babies with troubled sleep, could be problematic if continued after certain months of age. If your answer is no - Well, It is. Swaddling soothes the newborns giving them the feeling of a mother's womb. Though some pediatricians do not suggest swaddling, they agree that it eases and calms the baby to sleep. Before practicing, it is necessary to know the correct way to swaddle, its merits and demerits, when to stop swaddling, etc. rather than following it as a mere tradition.\n\n【2】What Is Swaddling?\n------------------\n\n【3】Swaddling the baby is a postnatal tradition started by the nurses immediately after birth and followed by the parents and family after that. It involves wrapping the baby's body, excluding the neck and head, and using a comfortable blanket to give them comfort as a mother's womb. It is practiced worldwide and is considered one of the postnatal care that a baby requires. Swaddling and making the babies lie on their backs provide the baby stability during sleep and help them sleep longer. Though it helps with sleep, there are certain demerits to swaddling when followed for a period more than advised.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Swaddling Clothes?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Swaddling clothes are designed in various patterns and shapes. They are available for purchase in any baby store and can be chosen based on the parent's preference. Some of them are simple square or rectangular blankets, while the others are sack-like and allow zipping the baby up. Some have additional flaps on the side that wrap across the baby's body and can be secured with sticky strips.\n\n【6】How to Swaddle a Baby?\n----------------------\n\n【7】The right way of swaddling the baby involves the following steps;\n\n【8】*   Ensure that the baby is relaxed and in a calm state.\n\n【9】*   Use a light, breathable cloth, preferably cotton, to swaddle the baby.\n\n【10】*   See that your baby does not wear multiple layers of clothing underneath the wrap, as it can cause overheating.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Pterygium (Surfer’s Eye) - Causes, Prevention and Treatment Options</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What to Do When Someone Turns COVID-Positive At Home?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Detailed Information About Muscular Dystrophy</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Lay the cloth flat while folding the top corner.\n\n【12】*   The baby should be laid on its back, with the head positioned above the fold.\n\n【13】*   Hold the baby in place, tuck in the left corner of the cloth to the right side of the body, and vice versa.\n\n【14】*   Then the bottom of the cloth should be folded and tucked on one of the sides.\n\n【15】*   Take care not to wrap it tightly or let it loose. Also, make sure that the neck and head are not covered, as it might suffocate the baby.\n\n【16】*   Adequate space should be left so that normal chest expansion occurs uninterruptedly and maintains normal breathing. Also, make sure that the baby can move the hip freely.\n    </u>\n\n【17】What Are the Benefits of Swaddling?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【18】*   Swaddling helps the babies have an uninterrupted, comfortable, and quality nap for a longer period.\n\n【19】*   It is also said that swaddling recreates the mother's womb atmosphere for the baby and helps with the transition phase that the baby goes through post-birth.\n\n【20】*   Swaddling minimizes the parent's worry about making the baby fall asleep and get some time for themselves which is impossible when the baby is not asleep.\n\n【21】*   Research shows that preterm babies who are swaddled during hospitalization have shown developmental benefits such as less physiological distress, improved neuromuscular and motor development, etc.\n\n【22】What Are the Risks of Swaddling?\n--------------------------------\n\n【23】Pediatricians, parents, and caregivers give mixed opinions on swaddling a baby. There are a few complications associated with wrapping for a longer period, such as;\n\n【24】*   If the baby is not swaddled correctly, it could roll and lie on its stomach, which could become fatal to the baby. SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) is a condition in which healthy babies die due to unknown reasons. Though it is said that lying on the stomach is a common cause of SIDS, there is no strong evidence to prove this claim.\n\n【25】*   If the wrap is too tight, the babies could suffocate and have difficulty breathing, which could be fatal as well.\n\n【26】*   If the baby is wrapped in thick or multiple-layered blankets or if there are multiple layers of clothing under the swaddle, overheating occurs in babies. Overheating can result in sweating, heat rashes, damp hair, etc.\n\n【27】*   Hip dysplasia (abnormality in the hip joint when the thigh bone does not correctly fit the pelvis) could occur in babies when the legs are set straight and swaddled tight.\n\n【28】*   Delayed postnatal weight gain is noted in certain conditions if the newborns are swaddled immediately after birth.\n\n【29】When to Stop Swaddling the Baby?\n--------------------------------\n\n【30】*   Ideally, it is recommended to stop swaddling when the baby starts rolling over, which is usually between two to four months of age.\n\n【31】*   When the baby starts to roll over, they try to shift from lying on their back to lying on the stomach, which can result in various complications as well as SIDS.\n\n【32】What Are the Substitutes for Swaddling?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【33】*   In the initial stages of transition, using the same swaddle, one hand is left free, followed by the other hand and legs in the coming days, rather than wrapping the baby's hands and legs.\n\n【34】*   Using a sleep sack or sleep bag with holes in the neck, hands, and leg regions is not as suffocating as a wrap yet gives the baby a feeling of the swaddle.\n\n【35】*   The baby should be laid in a crib without blankets or swaddles that could cover the baby's face.\n\n【36】*   Pacifiers are given to make the baby fall asleep easily.\n\n【37】*   Variations in temperatures can disrupt the baby's sleep, so it is essential to maintain an average temperature in the sleeping room.\n\n【38】*   Refrain from doing things that might wake up the baby; the sleeping atmosphere should be peaceful.\n\n【39】*   Following a consistent sleep schedule helps the baby fall asleep quickly.\n\n【40】*   Feeding the baby and ensuring that the baby is not hungry before falling asleep.\n\n【41】**Conclusion:**\n\n【42】There are mixed opinions on swaddling the baby. However, it depends on the preferences of the parents and the family. Doing it is fine but doing it right is what needs emphasis. Before practicing it, it is necessary to know the right way to swaddle the baby and when to wean your baby from swaddling. Consult with your pediatrician if your baby has any birth complications.\n\n【43】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【44】* * *\n\n【45】#### **1.**删除换行**Is Swaddling at Night Necessary for Newborns?**\n\n【46】   \nSwaddling can help the baby sleep for longer, during the day and night. Swaddling is done to reduce the “startle or Moro” reflex. The startle reflex is a reflex that is present at the time of birth and is a protective mechanism. So, it is better to swaddle the baby, especially at night.\n\n【47】#### **2.**删除换行**Is Swaddling Safe for the Baby?**\n\n【48】In some cases, swaddling has shown to increase the risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) and unintentional suffocation when the babies are placed on their stomachs to sleep. So it is important to monitor the baby when swaddled, so they do not roll over.\n\n【49】#### **3.**删除换行**Till How Many Months Can the Baby Be Swaddled?**\n\n【50】   \nSwaddling should not be done when the baby starts to roll over. So it is better to stop swaddling the baby when the baby turns two to four months old. Some babies even start to roll over as early as two months. Hence, swaddling should be avoided in such cases. When the babies roll over, they may not be able to roll back over, which can be dangerous.\n\n【51】#### **4.**删除换行**What Are the Bad Effects of Swaddling on the Baby?**\n\n【52】The bad effects of swaddling on the baby are:  \nIncreased risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome).   \nAs the swaddling cloth is an extra clothing layer over the body, it can cause overheating of the baby.  \nWhen swaddling is not proper, it can increase the chance of developing hip dysplasia.  \nSwaddling can increase the risk of tying around the baby's neck if swaddling is improper.\n\n【53】#### **5.**删除换行**What Is the Alternative to Swaddling the Baby?**\n\n【54】Instead of swaddling, a sleep suit or sleep sack can be a better alternative. The suits will keep the baby’s hand in T-shape and prevent rolling. Also, make sure to keep the room cool while sleeping, as the suit can keep the baby warm\n\n【55】#### **6.**删除换行**Can SIDS Be Prevented by Swaddling the Baby?**\n\n【56】Instead of preventing SIDS, it is seen that swaddling can increase the chances of SIDS. But some studies also show a decreased incidence of SIDS by swaddling.\n\n【57】#### **7.**删除换行**Can You Burp the Baby When They Are Swaddled?**\n\n【58】To burp a swaddled baby, hold the baby outward facing away from the body, then pat and rub the back of teh baby. Even if the baby has fallen asleep, try to burp them for a few minutes before placing them back to sleep.\n\n【59】#### **8.**删除换行**How Tightly Should the Baby Be Swaddled?**\n\n【60】To understand how tightly a  baby should be swaddled, place two fingers between the chest of the baby and the swaddle. If the two fingers can fit between the baby’s chest and the swaddle, then the swaddle is correct- not too loose or tight.\n\n【61】#### **9.**删除换行**What Is the Importance of Swaddling a Baby?**\n\n【62】   \nSwaddling is the process of wrapping the baby with a breathable blanket to imitate the feeling of touch in the baby so the baby can feel calm and relaxed. Also, swaddling protects the baby against the startle reflex, improving the baby’s sleep. It will also keep the baby's hands off the face and prevent scratching.\n\n【63】#### **10.**删除换行**Is It Alright to Breastfeed the Baby When Swaddled?**\n\n【64】The baby should not be breastfed while the baby is swaddled as they can cause overheating. Also, the baby should be swaddled while they are asleep and should be removed once they are awake from sleep. Breastfeeding while swaddling also inhibits some of the important reflexes. The baby should be able to move to latch better and nurse more effectively and freely.\n\n【65】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【66】无关删除-1:<u>*   Swaddling: Is it Safe for Your Baby?  \n    https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Swaddling-Is-it-Safe.aspx\n*   Swaddling a baby: the benefits, risks and seven safety tips  \n    https://www.nct.org.uk/baby-toddler/slings-and-swaddling/swaddling-baby-benefits-risks-and-seven-safety-tips</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

However, in cases where the maximum exposure of the maxillary sinus, the floor of the orbit, and the pterygopalatine fossa are required- the Caldwell-Luc procedure is only used even today for easier access, surgical instrumentation, and hence scope for preventing recurrence of sinus tumors, fistulas, and infections.\n\n【3】It is mandatory for the oral and maxillofacial surgeon to see the risks and benefits of this surgery before adopting this line of surgical access, as it would be appropriate in certain low-risk cases to be more conservative. The Caldwell-Luc procedure is prone to complications as well, given that it needs a large opening for surgical access. The regeneration of the sinus mucosa after removal of the diseased mucosa either through ESS, conservative antrostomy, or Caldwell-Luc depends to a great extent on the systemic or bodily health status of the patient directly linked to his or her regenerative potential or capacity. This decision hence should be better advised by the physician or surgeon before operating on the patient.\n\n【4】**What Are the Causes And Symptoms of Sinus Disease?**\n\n【5】Sinus infections, cysts, polyps, tumors, or any lesions or foreign bodies that are the cause of sinus disease pose multiple problems to the patient.\n\n【6】The symptoms may resemble maxillary sinusitis like facial pain, blocked nose with discharge, tenderness of orofacial musculature, etc. with the more serious lesions causing mucous discharge tinged or permeated by blood and severe or unbearable pain and pressure along with facial inflammation.\n\n【7】**What Are the Objectives and Need of ESS or Caldwell-Luc Procedure?**\n\n【8】The aim hence be it of the current trending endoscopic sinus surgeries or of the historic and adopted Caldwell-Luc procedure, is the same as to achieve the following objectives after treating the patient:\n\n【9】*   Removal of the large foreign bodies or tumor or lesion (cyst or polyp or fistula) in the sinus region.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I have two cysts on my upper jaw and a soft tissue growth in my maxillary sinuses.

This portion is bound by the canine eminence of the upper or maxillary canine medially and is the easiest to breach for this surgery.\n\n【33】**2) The Infraorbital Foramen:**\n\n【34】This foramen situated approximately over the roof of the maxillary sinus transmits the neurovascular bundle that supplies the lower eyelid, nose, cheeks, and lip apart from the important vital infraorbital artery and vein.\n\n【35】Care should be taken during the elevation of the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus by the operator to avoid nerve injury. As this surgery or operation is mainly aimed at improving mucosal function and histologic appearance of the maxillary sinus, the advantage is that the access is both safe and easier for the maxillofacial surgeon as compared to the endoscopic sinus surgeries followed by a few practitioners this days. No special instrumentation other than the surgical equipment available in the oral and maxillofacial surgery operation room is needed.\n\n【36】**Anesthesia**: The surgery is planned under local anesthesia –(1 ml of 2% xylocaine mixed with 1 in 2,00,000 adrenaline) infiltrated over the canine fossa. (Xylocaine is mixed because the process of infiltration would be painless). The inferior orbital nerve and the anterior superior alveolar nerve are blocked by this anesthesia. A cotton pellet soaked in a 4% xylocaine adrenaline mixture can also be placed over the sublabial area to anesthetize the canine fossa mucosa. If general anesthesia is given, then the patient needs to be intubated primarily before positioning for the surgery.\n\n【37】**Procedure**: The surgeon gives a 3 to 4 cm incision on the buccogingival sulcus at the canine eminence area. The Langenbach's retractor is used to retract the soft tissue and a periosteal elevator to retract the anterior wall of the sinus till the infraorbital bundle is visible. (Care should be taken by the surgeon here to not to damage the bundle). Antrostomy opening round 1.5 to 2 cm diameter by a round cutting bur is done and the instrumentation done through this opening. The diseased mucosa can then be curetted out in direct vision by the operator. Some operators visualize the antrostomy via the inferior meatus (meatus nasi inferior or the air passage of the lateral nasal cavity), opening a nasoantral window.\n\n【38】**What Are the Postoperative Complications?**\n\n【39】There is no major complication of Caldwell-Luc other than self-limiting edema or swelling over the cheek that reduces within a week usually. However, infraorbital nerve damage, devitalization of tooth roots, or injury to the nasolacrimal duct (inferior meatus visualization as mentioned earlier) may be possible, but these complications differ only and mostly due to the operator’s limitations and skill. After surgery, precautions should be taken to prevent emphysema or edema of the cheek and for reduction of discomfort.\n\n【40】**What Precautions Have To Be Followed After the Surgery?**\n\n【41】*   Ice packs can be given externally to reduce swelling over the affected area.\n\n【42】*   Nasal or antral packing that is done by the operator can be removed within 48 hours post-surgery.\n\n【43】*   Dentures or other dental appliances should not be worn to facilitate proper wound healing at the surgical site.\n\n【44】*   Nose blowing should be avoided.\n\n【45】**Conclusion**:\n\n【46】Caldwell-Luc surgery thus remains the most effective and applicable management strategy for surgical resolution and elimination of maxillary sinus issues. Proper coordination and interaction between the operator and the patient pre and post-surgery will be useful in managing post-surgical complications, if any.\n\n【47】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【48】* * *\n\n【49】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the Location of the Incision for the Caldwell-Luc Procedure?**\n\n【50】The Caldwell-Luc procedure is an intra-oral procedure where the first surgical incision is made from the maxillary lateral incisor to the second molar. The incision is placed three millimeters above the line of reflection, starting at the canine ridge, and runs laterally for about 3.5 to 4 millimeters parallel to the tooth. \n\n【51】#### **2.**删除换行**Which Code Is Given to the Caldwell-Luc Procedure in Cpt?**\n\n【52】CPT, or current procedural terminology, is a universal language to code, communicate, and streamline medical procedure reporting. 84691002 is the CPT code given for the removal of the foreign body from the maxillary sinus by the Caldwell-Luc procedure. \n\n【53】#### **3.**删除换行**How Successful Are Endoscopic Sinus Surgeries?**\n\n【54】Endoscopic sinus surgeries, by far, have been largely successful, with most studies reporting a successful outcome in about 80 to 90 percent of cases. Comparative good results were also obtained in patients who had previously undergone sinus surgeries. The results, when compared to the Cardwell-Luc procedure, were found to be equally effective, but endoscopic means had a strong patient preference.\n\n【55】#### **4.**删除换行**What Is the Recovery Time of Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery?**\n\n【56】Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) has a strong patient preference. Although it might take a few months to go back to normal completely, most patients can go back to school or the workplace in a week or so. It is possible to resume their normal daily rhythm within a couple of weeks.\n\n【57】#### **5.**删除换行**What Can Be Done to Remove a Root Piece From the Maxillary Sinus?**\n\n【58】Owing to the close proximity of the maxillary teeth roots, especially the mesiobuccal root of the maxillary first molar and palatal root of the second premolar, there are chances of pushing a broken root or root fragment into the maxillary sinus by perforating the sinus wall. The root can be removed from the sinus by the following procedures under anesthesia:  \n\\- Carwell-Luc procedure.  \n\\- Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).\n\n【59】#### **6.**删除换行**How to Remove a Maxillary Sinus Cyst?**\n\n【60】Some maxillary cysts are small and regress on their own, but the condition requires constant imaging and monitoring. Large cysts or progressively enlarging cysts may precipitate symptoms. If the cyst is indicated for removal, it is done by a minor endoscopic sinus surgery that also includes either enucleation (removal of the cyst as a whole without rupture) or curettage (removal of the cyst with a special loop-shaped instrument).\n\n【61】#### **7.**删除换行**Is Endoscopic Sinus Surgery a Painful Procedure?**\n\n【62】Although endoscopic sinus surgeries are performed as outpatient procedures under general anesthesia, the patient should expect some nasal and sinus pressure for a few days following the procedure. They may also experience a dull ache and a sinus infection-like feeling. Mild discomfort is normal and may be relieved by analgesics.\n\n【63】#### **8.**删除换行**What Complications May Arise From Endoscopic Sinus Surgery?**\n\n【64】Major complications of endoscopic sinus surgery include the following:  \n\\- Cerebrospinal fluid leak.  \n\\- Bleeding.  \n\\- Recurrence of pathology.  \n\\- Visual problems.  \n\\- Alteration of taste and, or smell.  \n\\- Persistence or worsening of symptoms.  \n\\- Facial pain.  \n\\- Change in resonance.  \n\\- Change in voice,  \n\\- Bruising around the eye.\n\n【65】#### **9.**删除换行**What Is the Time of Hospital Stay Following a Sinus Surgery?**\n\n【66】Since sinus surgeries are usually performed as outpatient procedures, the patient may be able to go home after an observation of a few hours (usually two hours) without any complications. But the patient needs to limit certain activities for up to two weeks.\n\n【67】#### **10.**删除换行**What Are the Contraindications Post-sinus Surgery?**\n\n【68】Some of the contraindications following a sinus surgery are as follows:  \n\\- Avoid blowing the nose for at least a week.  \n\\- Avoid heavy lifting, straining, and strenuous activities.  \n\\- Do not sneeze with a closed mouth.  \n\\- Avoid Aspirin.\n\n【69】#### **11.**删除换行**What Is the Consequence of a Root Going Into the Sinus?**\n\n【70】Accidental displacement of a tooth into the sinus can cause chronic inflammation of the sinus, which may spread to the lymph nodes in the head and neck region. From there, the throat may even get irritated and inflamed and may even result in restriction of breathing. Some serious infections may also travel into the bloodstream.\n\n【71】#### **12.**删除换行**Is a Sinus Cyst a Serious Problem?**\n\n【72】A sinus cyst is typically not a serious condition, although there have been cases reported of a ruptured cyst after a head trauma. Small retention cysts remain asymptomatic. These cysts are regularly monitored for any change. Enlarging cysts may require intervention as symptoms keep developing.\n\n【73】#### **13.**删除换行**What Are the Problems Caused by a Sinus Cyst?**\n\n【74】Some of the clinical features of a sinus cyst are:  \n\\- Paresthesia.  \n\\- Sensitivity to palpation.   \n\\- Chronic headache.   \n\\- Nasal blockage.  \n\\- Dizziness.\n\n【75】#### **14.**删除换行**Which Patients Cannot Undergo Balloon Sinuplasty?**\n\n【76】Patient selection is a very important criterion for any surgical procedure. Similarly, certain criteria disqualify one as a candidate for balloon sinuplasty. The conditions for a good candidate include:  \n\\- The patient has had chronic, recurring sinus infections, not responding to medications.  \n\\- The patient has been struggling with nasal congestion, coughing, headaches, and chronic bad breath from sinus problems.  \n\\- Sinusitis is not of any structural origin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

When the functions of the kidneys get impaired, harmful substances and wastes accumulate within the body leading to high blood pressure and kidney failure, also known as end-stage kidney disease. In end-stage kidney disease, the kidneys lose around ninety percent of their working ability. The various causes that cause end-stage kidney disease include:\n\n【2】*   Diabetes.\n\n【3】*   Uncontrolled chronic high blood pressure.\n\n【4】*   Chronic glomerulonephritis is an inflammation and scarring of the tiny filters (glomeruli) present within the kidneys.\n\n【5】*   Polycystic kidney isdease is an inherited kidney disorder in which multiple cysts are formed in the kidneys leading them to enlarge and lose their function over time.\n\n【6】How Many Types of Kidney Transplants Are There?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Kidney transplants are of two types. They are:\n\n【8】*   Deceased donor kidney transplant.\n\n【9】*   Living donor kidney transplant.\n\n【10】What Are Living Donor Kidney Transplants?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【11】In living donation, the kidney is donated by a healthy living individual to another person who needs a kidney for survival. Around six thousand organ transplants are made by living donors.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【14】Robotic Surgery - Future of Medicine\n\n【15】Life After Kidney Transplant\n\n【16】My father, who had kidney transplant, gets fever once in every 15 days now. Why?\n\n【17】**Types of Living Donor Transplants:**\n\n【18】*   **Direct Donation** \\- Direct donation is a common type of living donation. In this type of donation, the donor knows the specific person receiving the donation. The donor can be either related or non-related. The related donor is a biological relative like a parent, brother, sister, or adult kid. The non-related donor is a biologically unrelated person having a personal or social connection with the donor, such as a spouse, friend, or co-worker.\n\n【19】*   **Non-Direct or Altruistic Donation** - In a non-direct donation, the donor does not know the person donating their organ. Instead, the match is made based on their medical compatibility. Some donors even choose to avoid meeting their recipients.\n\n【20】*   **Paired Donation or Paired Exchange** - Paired donation involves two or more pairs of living kidney donors whose blood types do not match. The recipients trade donors so that each receives a kidney from a donor with a compatible blood type. This kind of exchange involves multiple living kidney donors or transplant candidate pairs from various centers or parts of the world.\n\n【21】What Are the Advantages of Living Donor Transplant?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The advantages of a living donor transplant are as follows:\n\n【23】*   **Schedule the Surgery** - A living donation makes it possible to time the transplant surgery at a feasible time for both the donor and the recipient.\n*   **Decreased Risk of Organ Rejection** - Organ rejection risks are minimized in living donor surgery because of better genetic matching.\n\n【24】*   **Immediate Working** - The kidneys work immediately after being removed from a healthy owner and transplanted.\n\n【25】*   **Shorter Waiting Time** - A living donor transplant might reduce the time spent on dialysis or years of waiting for a deceased donor organ.\n\n【26】What Are Deceased Donor Kidney Transplants?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Deceased donors are mostly people dying from accidents or sudden death or wishing to be organ donors. The donated organs are matched to the waiting recipients by a national registry called the organ procurement and transplantation network (OPTN). The present kidney allocation system was implemented in December 2014 to provide recipients with longer functions with their transplanted kidney by matching the donated kidney with the most extended potential life. The recipient has the longest possible life with that kidney. Once listed for the transplant, the recipient will be allocated an estimated post-transplant survival score (EPTS) that ranges from zero to one hundred. This score is based on estimating how long the recipient would need a functioning kidney compared to the other candidates. The EPTS is determined with the help of a mathematical formula that takes into consideration four factors:\n\n【28】*   Does the recipient have diabetes?\n\n【29】*   The current age of the individual.\n\n【30】*   Is the recipient on dialysis? If yes, then for how long.\n\n【31】*   Has any organ transplantation been done previously?\n\n【32】Each one of the available kidneys is assigned a kidney donor profile index or KDPI score- a percentage score ranging from zero to one hundred. The KDPI score is associated with how long the kidney will function compared to the other kidneys. The KDPI is calculated based on the factors such as:\n\n【33】*   Age.\n\n【34】*   Height.\n\n【35】*   Weight.\n\n【36】*   Ethnicity.\n\n【37】*   Cause of Death is loss of heart function, brain function, or stroke.\n\n【38】*   History of blood pressure.\n\n【39】*   History of diabetes.\n\n【40】*   Hepatitis C exposure.\n\n【41】*   Serum Creatinine where the creatinine is the waste produced due to the normal wear and tear of the muscles. This provides information about the kidney function of the individual.\n\n【42】What Are the Different Types of Deceased Kidney Transplants?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】There are various types of deceased kidney transplants. They are:\n\n【44】*   **Standard Criteria Donors (SCD)** - These kidneys are from donors under the age of fifty years.\n\n【45】*   **Expanded Criteria Donors (ECD)** - These kidneys come from donors who are above the age of sixty or fifty, having at least two of the following criteria, a history of chronic high blood pressure in which the donor passed away from stroke or had a creatinine higher than the average value.\n\n【46】*   **Donation After Cardiac Death (DCD)** \\- These donors do not meet the criteria for brain death. Their heart stopped working before the kidneys were removed.\n\n【47】*   **Double Kidney Transplants (Duals)** - The deceased donor's kidneys are transplanted. It has been researched that using both kidneys is preferred over one.\n\n【48】*   **Donors With High-Risk Social Behavior** - These donors indulged in drugs, had sex with multiple partners or were imprisoned. In addition, these donors are tested for transmissible diseases during organ recovery.\n\n【49】**Conclusion**\n\n【50】A kidney transplant is a surgery carried out to replace a diseased kidney with a healthy one. After a few criteria are met, the kidneys can be transplanted from two types of donors: a deceased organ donor or a living kidney donor. Each of the transplant types has its pros and cons. However, people can live a healthy everyday life with one kidney and a lifelong intake of anti-rejection medications.\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【52】无关删除-1:<u>*   Kidney Transplant - Types  \n    https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-treatments/k/kidney-transplant-surgery/types.html\n*   Types of Transplants  \n    https://christianacare.org/services/kidneytransplant/transplantprocess/typesoftransplants/\n*   Types of kidney donation  \n    https://pkdcure.org/living-with-pkd/transplant/types-of-donation/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These sounds can be heard with a stethoscope. Breath sounds can be normal and adventitious or added sounds like crackles, whales, pleural friction rubs, stertor, and stridor. The sounds are classified based on the pitch and intensity of the sound heard during auscultation with a stethoscope.\n\n【2】What Are Normal Breath Sounds?\n------------------------------\n\n【3】Normal breath sounds are vesicular, bronchovesicular, bronchial, and tracheal. These are named based on the location of auscultation. Normal breath sounds are identified by the duration and quality of the sound. They are differentiated by the sound's frequency, intensity, and quality.\n\n【4】*   Tracheal sound is heard over the trachea (above the central notch in the collar bone). It is a loud and high-pitched sound. The expiratory sound duration is equivalent to the inspiratory sound.\n\n【5】*   Bronchial sound is heard over the manubrium (just above the collar bones). It is a loud and high-pitched sound. The expiratory sound duration is longer than the inspiratory sound. It is further classified into tubular, hollow, and amphoric breath sounds.\n\n【6】*   Tubular sound is a high-pitched bronchial sound. It is present during consolidation, pulmonary fibrosis, chest wall collapse, and mediastinal tumors with a patent bronchus.\n\n【7】*   A cavernous sound is a low-pitched sound. It is heard over the abscess and bronchiectasis cavity with a patent bronchus.\n\n【8】*   Amphoric sound is a low-pitched sound with a high-pitched overtone like a metal sound. It is heard over a large cavity with a patent bronchus and open pneumothorax. Amphoric breath sound indicates alveolar destruction.\n\n【9】*   Bronchovesicular sound is heard between the first and second intercostal space (space between the ribs) in the front and between the scapulae (triangular-shaped bones in the upper back). It is an intermediate sound. The expiratory sound duration is about equivalent to the inspiratory sound duration.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Barotrauma and Mechanical Ventilation - Causes, Risk Factors, Diagnosis and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Meigs’ Syndrome - Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia - Risk Factors, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Vesicular sound is heard over most of the lung region. It is a soft, low-pitched rustling sound. The expiratory sound duration is shorter than the inspiratory sound duration. The intensity of inspiration is greater than expiration.\n    </u>\n\n【11】How Are Breath Sounds Produced?\n-------------------------------\n\n【12】Normal breath sound is produced when the air flows through the tracheobronchial tree. But, breath sounds are produced only during turbulent and vorticose airflow. Laminar flow is silent. The air moves in a direction parallel to the walls of the tracheobronchial tree. Turbulent air movement produces sound because the air molecules collide with each other and with the walls. The vortices or whirlpools are produced when air enters a wider channel from a small opening.\n\n【13】What Does Absent or Decreased Sound Indicate?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Absent or decreased breath sounds are seen :\n\n【15】*   In pneumonia, pleural effusion and heart failure occur when air or fluid is in or around the lungs.\n\n【16】*   When the chest wall thickness is increased.\n\n【17】*   In emphysema, when a portion of the lungs is over-inflated.\n\n【18】*   When airflow to a portion of the lungs is reduced.\n\n【19】What Are Abnormal Breath Sounds?\n--------------------------------\n\n【20】The abnormal breath sounds include:\n\n【21】*   Wheeze is a continuous whistling sound. Wheeze is high-pitched and heard during expiration. It is produced when the airways are narrowed. It is seen in conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It can be heard without a stethoscope.\n\n【22】*   Rhonchi are high-pitched coarse, rattling sounds heard during inspiration. Rhonchi are produced when secretions are present in bronchial airways. This sound is similar to snoring. It is seen during acute bronchitis and COPD.\n\n【23】*   Stridor is a continuous, high-pitched, wheeze-like sound during inspiration and expiration. It occurs when the airflow is blocked in the airway or the back of the throat. It is seen during epiglottis and laryngeal edema, foreign body obstruction, and traumatic chest or neck injury.\n\n【24】*   Rales, called crackles, are continuous, high or low-pitched, small clicking, bubbling, or rattling sounds produced during inspiration. These sounds are also described as moist, dry, fine, and coarse. It occurs in pneumonia, pulmonary edema, tuberculosis, bronchitis, and left-sided heart failure.\n\n【25】*   An inspiratory gasp is a high-pitched whooping sound produced during inspiration. It is seen in pertussis (whooping cough).\n\n【26】*   The pleural friction rub is a discontinuous, low-pitched sound with many repeated rhythmic sounds. It is seen during inflammation of the pleural membrane (lining of the lungs) and lung tumors.\n\n【27】*   Hamman's sign or mediastinal crunch is a discontinuous, crunching, crackling, or rasping sound. It is heard over the precordium from the third to fifth intercostal space, along with the heartbeat. It occurs in pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium.\n\n【28】*   Grunting is a continuous, low-pitched sound that resembles snoring. It is produced in pneumonia, cardiac abnormalities, and surfactant deficiency. It is heard during expiration.\n\n【29】What Are the Complications?\n---------------------------\n\n【30】Abnormal breath sounds are common and manageable disorders but may cause some emergency problems.\n\n【31】Abnormal sounds may be present with the following conditions:\n\n【32】*   Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin).\n\n【33】*   Nasal flaring.\n\n【34】*   Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath.\n\n【35】It is important to consult a physician if any of the above complications are present.\n\n【36】What Are the Tests Done?\n------------------------\n\n【37】The physician asks for the following tests to determine the cause of abnormal breath sounds.\n\n【38】*   CT (computed tomography) scan.\n\n【39】*   Chest X-ray.\n\n【40】*   Blood tests.\n\n【41】*   Pulmonary function tests measure the volume of air inhaled and exhaled and its efficiency.\n\n【42】*   A sputum culture test is done to detect the presence of microorganisms.\n\n【43】How Are Abnormal Breath Sounds Treated?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【44】The treatment options depend on the diagnosis and the cause and severity of the symptoms. Medications are given to treat infections and to open the airways. In asthma, COPD, or bronchitis cases, breathing treatments are advised to open the airway. Inhalers or other medications are prescribed for asthma patients to reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma attacks. Hospitalization is essential if there is fluid in the lungs or if there is airway obstruction.\n\n【45】**Conclusion**\n\n【46】Breath sounds produced during breathing can be normal or abnormal. It is important to differentiate between normal and abnormal sounds to diagnose respiratory problems. Auscultation of the respiratory system is vital in diagnosing normal and abnormal breath sounds. It is essential to consult a doctor when abnormal breath sounds are noticed. Early diagnosis and treatment prevent the development of further complications.\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>*   Breath sounds  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007535.htm\n*   Lung Sounds  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537253/\n*   Abnormal breath sounds  \n    https://www.healthnavigator.org.nz/clinical-skills/b/breath-sounds-abnormal/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Moles are seen in any area of the body. Moles can be present alone or sometimes in groups. Moles commonly appear at birth as birthmarks. It is found that the development of moles can continue until the age of 40. Sometimes moles tend to fade in older people. Moles are self-diagnosable, and the common moles are usually harmless. But atypical mole can give rise to a chronic condition called melanoma, which requires treatment.\n\n【2】What Are Moles?\n---------------\n\n【3】Moles or nevus is the average growth present on the skin due to the cluster of pigment cells called melanocytes. Moles can be seen anywhere on the body, including the scalp, breast, above the wrist, armpits, nails, fingers, and toes. The typical mole is a tiny brown, pink or tan hue spot. Moles become darker and grow more prominent in adults due to hormonal changes.\n\n【4】The features of a typical mole with variations in color, shape, and size are listed below.\n\n【5】*   Color can be brown, tan, black, red, or pink.\n\n【6】*   The texture of the mole can be smooth, flat, wrinkled, or raised.\n\n【7】*   The shape of moles can be oval, round, and often dome-shaped.\n\n【8】*   A common mole is usually smaller than 5 mm.\n\n【9】*   Moles can be seen with or without the attachment of hair.\n\n【10】*   The edge of the moles is very distinct.\n\n【11】What Causes the Moles?\n----------------------\n\n【12】Moles are formed due to the cluster of pigment cells. Melanocytes are the pigment cells present in the epidermis of the skin. Melanin is the pigment produced by melanocytes. Melanin gives color to the moles. Melanoma is a neoplastic disorder of the moles. The amount of sun exposure in childhood and the inherited genes are mainly the determinants of mole numbers. Mole is also observed in the sun-protected areas of the body. Moles are observed in all races, including Caucasians, Asians, Indians, Africans, and even animals.\n\n【13】The causes of moles are mentioned below.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【15】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-3:<u>Is mole with large circular area a suspicious one?</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-3:<u>Are moles that fade in color and size suggestive of dysplasia?</u>\n\n【18】Please explain molecular karyotyping report taken after miscarriage.\n\n【19】*   Gene-associated moles.\n\n【20】*   Somatic mutation in RAS genes.\n\n【21】*   BRAF inhibitor drugs include Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib.\n\n【22】*   Immunosuppressive treatments.\n\n【23】What Are the Types of Moles?\n----------------------------\n\n【24】A mole is a small brown or tan-colored growth present on the skin. It may be small or big. Moles that are seen at birth are called a congenital nevus. Nevi denote the plural form of nevus. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, the typical mole is classified into dysplastic nevus, congenital nevus, spitz nevus, and acquired nevus.\n\n【25】The types of common moles are pointed out below.\n\n【26】*   Atypical mole or dysplastic mole.\n\n【27】*   Congenital mole.\n\n【28】*   Spitz mole.\n\n【29】*   Acquired mole.\n\n【30】**Atypical Mole:**\n\n【31】Atypical moles or dysplastic moles have a higher risk of melanoma. They are larger than the typical mole and acquire an odd shape. The atypical mole or dysplastic nevus is rarely observed. People with FAMMM, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma, mostly present with atypical nevus or dysplastic nevus.\n\n【32】**Congenital Mole:**\n\n【33】A congenital mole is present at birth, referred to as a birthmark. Congenital moles vary in size from small to giant as the child grows. An increase in the mole size tends to increase the risk of malignancy. The congenital mole has different subtypes.\n\n【34】The types of congenital moles are mentioned below.\n\n【35】*   A small congenital nevus is <1.5 cm in diameter.\n\n【36】*   A medium congenital nevus is 1.5 cm to 20 cm.\n\n【37】*   Giant nevus is greater than 20 cm.\n\n【38】*   A hairy congenital nevus is a nevus present with hair growth.\n\n【39】**Spitz Nevus:**\n\n【40】Spitz nevus mostly resembles melanoma. The spitz nevus color is dome-shaped, and the color of the spitz nevus is pink. Spitz nevus also varies, showing different colors like red, brown, and black. Young people and children are mostly present with spitz nevus, which is occasionally seen in adults. Sometimes, bleeding is present on the spitz nevus.\n\n【41】**Acquired Mole:**\n\n【42】A mole that appears after birth is called an acquired mole. About 10 to 40 acquired moles are usually seen in an average individual if the number of acquired moles increases the risk of melanoma.\n\n【43】How to Check the Mole for Cancer?\n---------------------------------\n\n【44】Moles are self-diagnosable. With the help of dermatoscopy and clinical examination, dermatologists differentiate the atypical moles from the typical moles. Treating people experiencing symptoms like bleeding, rash, or itching in the mole is essential. The physical examination of the mole must include the size, color, and other features to rule out any malignancy.\n\n【45】The diagnosing features for the diagnosis of nevus are given below.\n\n【46】*   Change in size, shape, and texture of mole.\n\n【47】*   Change in the color of the mole.\n\n【48】*   Occurrence of new moles in adults after 40 years of age.\n\n【49】*   Asymmetry, irregular borders, color change, and diameter of nevus are evaluated to diagnose any malignancy condition of nevus.\n\n【50】What Is the Treatment for Removing Moles?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【51】Moles are usually harmless and require treatment or removal when at risk of skin cancer. Another factor for the removal of nevus is the cosmesis of the patient. When it is felt unattracted by the individual, and it causes discomfort against clothing, it requires treatment. The dermatologists will remove the moles very easily. Complications include skin cancer, scarring, and infection when people try to remove the mole at home.\n\n【52】The treatment methods for the removal of moles are mentioned below.\n\n【53】*   Surgical excision is where the dermatologist removes the entire nevus, and suturing is done.\n\n【54】*   Surgical shaving to remove the mole.\n\n【55】*   Electrosurgical removal of the mole.\n\n【56】*   Laser surgery removes the pigment and the hair attached to the nevus.\n\n【57】How to Manage Moles?\n--------------------\n\n【58】Sun exposure and ultraviolet or UV rays will increase the risk of cancer from the moles. People with more moles than usual must be careful with regularly checking moles for any changes. Some preventive measures can be followed to protect the moles from sun exposure or during summer.\n\n【59】The preventive methods for moles from sun damage are mentioned below.\n\n【60】*   Avoiding strong exposure to sun rays between 11 am to 2 pm can be avoided.\n\n【61】*   Wearing light-weighted clothes, hats, and sunglasses can be helpful.\n\n【62】*   Avoid artificial sources of ultraviolet rays or UV rays.\n\n【63】*   Applying sunscreen with sun protection factor 30 can be applied to the skin.\n\n【64】**Conclusion:**\n\n【65】Moles are the normal brown or tan colored spot present anywhere on the skin due to sun exposure. Moles can appear alone or in groups. The accumulation of pigment cells is responsible for the formation of moles. Sometimes moles could be a sign of cancer called melanoma. Risks of moles can be prevented by reducing the amount of sun exposure, ultraviolet rays, UV rays, and other artificial sources. However, moles are usually harmless, and treatment is done to reduce the risk of cancer from the moles.\n\n【66】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【67】无关删除-1:<u>*   AAD - Moles: Who gets and types  \n    https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/moles-types\n*   NIH - Common moles  \n    https://www.cancer.gov/types/skin/moles-fact-sheet</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is a rare and controversial condition that is said to cause individuals to experience intense cravings for human flesh, as well as a range of other symptoms. The legend of the Wendigo is a part of the oral tradition of several Native American tribes, including the Algonquin, Cree, and Ojibwe peoples. The creature is said to be a malevolent spirit or demon that haunts the forests, preying on unsuspecting travelers and hunters. It is typically depicted as a gaunt and skeletal figure with glowing eyes and long, sharp teeth. The legend of the Wendigo is deeply rooted in the cultures of these tribes, and it is believed that the spirit can possess individuals who break certain taboos, such as cannibalism or the consumption of human flesh. Those who are possessed by the Wendigo are said to be transformed into monstrous creatures driven by an insatiable hunger for human flesh.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Wendigo Psychosis?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【3】The causes are as follows-\n\n【4】*   **Cultural and Historical Factors:** The legend of the Wendigo has been a part of the oral tradition of several Native American tribes for centuries. It is believed that the spirit of the Wendigo can possess individuals who break certain cultural taboos, such as cannibalism or the consumption of human flesh. The belief in the existence of the Wendigo and the fear of being possessed by it may contribute to the development of Wendigo psychosis in individuals who are exposed to these cultural beliefs.\n\n【5】*   **Psychiatric Disorders:** Some researchers believe that Wendigo's psychosis may be related to other psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia (a mental disorder that may result in hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking) or bipolar disorder (a mental disorder with mood swings). People with these disorders may experience hallucinations, delusions, and other symptoms that are similar to those associated with Wendigo psychosis.\n\n【6】*   **Environmental Factors:** Living in isolated and harsh environments, such as the northern forests of North America, may contribute to developing Wendigo psychosis. Extreme cold, lack of food and water, and isolation from other people may cause individuals to experience heightened levels of stress and anxiety, which could potentially trigger the onset of the condition.\n\n【7】*   **Substance Abuse:** Substance abuse, particularly the use of drugs like Methamphetamine, has been associated with the development of psychotic symptoms. Some researchers believe that substance abuse may be a contributing factor in the development of Wendigo psychosis.\n\n【8】*   **Social Isolation and Trauma:** Social isolation and traumatic experiences, such as physical or sexual abuse, may contribute to the development of Wendigo psychosis.

Tiny cracks or breaks appear between the bones of the vertebra (bones that form the spinal cord), which weakens the spine, leading to fracture and collapse. Compression fractures happen when the body cannot bear the compressive load (load level beyond which bending deformation of the bone occurs). These fractures mainly occur in the thoracic spine (middle portion of the spine).\n\n【2】What Is the Etiology of Vertebral Compression Fracture?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】*   **Trauma-** Road traffic accidents or accidental falls on the surface.\n\n【4】*   **Osteoporosis**\\- It causes the bones to weaken, and thus the bones are more prone to fractures.\n*   Osteomyelitis (bone infection).\n\n【5】*   Pathologic Fractures like cancer. The cancer spreads to the spine resulting in weak vertebrae, which causes the bone to break easily.\n\n【6】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Vertebral Compression Fracture?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】*   Sudden onset of localized back pain ranging from mild to severe.\n\n【8】*   Pain increases while moving or standing and decreases while resting or lying on the back.\n\n【9】*   Vertebral compression fractures are rarely associated with radicular pain (pain, numbness, or tingling sensation involving the anterior chest and abdominal wall).\n\n【10】*   Gradual height loss.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Oblique Fractures - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Supracondylar Fractures of the Femur - An Overview</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Stress Fractures- Causes, Symptoms, Prevention, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Deformity and disability with an increase in time.\n\n【12】*   A stoop shape to the spine.\n    </u>\n\n【13】What Is the Diagnosis of Vertebral Compression Fracture?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】*   **X-ray-** It shows the vertebral structure and joint outlines. Bone alignment, spinal disc degeneration, and bony spurs (irritates nerve root) are also visible on the X-rays. Visualization of the thoracic spine is difficult. X-ray does not provide a sharp image compared to MRI and CT scans.\n\n【15】*   **Computed Tomography (CT Scan)-** It can diagnose compression fractures within the spinal column. A myelogram is performed along with a CT scan for additional information on the fracture. Contrast dye is used before a CT scan to see the images clearly in the spinal cord.\n\n【16】*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-** It gives 3-D images using magnets and computer technology. It shows the spinal cord, nerve roots, surrounding areas, and degeneration and enlargements involving the spinal cord.\n\n【17】*   **Bone Densitometry or Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA)-** This test measures bone mineral density and thus helps in determining osteoporosis. It is a painless and rapid test and can detect even small changes in the bone mass of the spinal cord and the extremities. DEXA scanner directs X-rays from two sources at a set frequency towards the bone that has to be examined alternatingly.\n\n【18】What Is the Treatment for Vertical Compression Fractures?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Vertebral instability due to slow healing or non-healing of the fracture causes pain in vertical compression fractures. The pain decreases gradually over a few days or weeks. The treatment plan should focus on relieving pain, stabilizing the bones, and preventing secondary fractures. The treatment plan may include the following:\n\n【20】*   **Pain Relief Medication-** Over-the-counter medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and Acetaminophen are most commonly used. Muscle relaxants are often prescribed along with pain relief medicines. Opioid analgesics should be used for short periods in acute pain cases.\n\n【21】*   **Back Braces-** These provide stability and additional support to the spinal cord. It also restricts movement during the healing period of the fracture. A rigid back brace is used in vertebral compression fracture cases, thus limiting spine-related movements and activities like bending forward and twisting while maintaining a proper body posture.\n\n【22】*   **Bone Strengthening Medicines-** These medicines are prescribed to the patient to avoid subsequent fractures and restore bone loss. The most prescribed medicine is bisphosphonates, and it includes Alendronate, Ibandronate, Risedronate, and Zoledronic acid.\n\n【23】*   **Surgery-** It is considered when the conservative treatment has little or no effect. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are surgical and minimally invasive procedures to treat vertical compression fractures. In vertebroplasty, a needle is inserted into the vertebra, and then bone cement is injected into the fractured vertebra. The bone cement hardens, thus stabilizing and strengthening the vertebra. In kyphoplasty, an inflatable device (balloon) is filled with bone cement and directed at the fractured vertebra. It also increases the height of the collapsed bone. Thus, kyphoplasty relieves both pains and restores the height of the damaged vertebra.\n\n【24】What Are the Indications of Surgery in Vertical Compression Fracture?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】*   Pain in the fractured area lasted for more than two weeks.\n\n【26】*   Painful metastasis of bone tumor.\n\n【27】*   Painful vertebral hemangiomas (benign vertebral vascular lesion).\n\n【28】*   Vertebral osteonecrosis (death of bony tissue due to lack of blood supply).\n\n【29】What Are the Contraindications of Vertebral Compression Fracture?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】*   Vertebral compression fracture that is responding to the conservative treatment.\n\n【31】*   Surgery should be avoided in a vertebral compression fracture if the pain has lasted more than one year.\n\n【32】*   Osteomyelitis (bacterial infection of the bone).\n\n【33】*   Scoliosis (sideward bending of the spine) or kyphosis (abnormally curved spine resulting in forward bending of the spine) is caused due to reasons other than osteoporosis, like ankylosing spondylitis.\n\n【34】*   Spinal cord compression is not caused due to osteoporosis.\n\n【35】What Are the Complications of Vertebral Compression Fracture?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】*   **Loss of Height-** Fracture of the spinal cord shortens the spine. If many vertebrae collapse, the patient looks shorter.\n\n【37】*   **Stomach Problem-** As the vertebra collapses, the spine becomes short and compresses the stomach. It causes digestive problems like constipation, weight loss, and weak appetite.\n\n【38】*   **Breathing Problem-** A short spine compresses the lungs and results in breathing problems.\n\n【39】*   **Hip Pain-** The rib cage gets closer to the hip bones due to a short spine. If these two bones rub against each other, it causes hip pain.\n\n【40】*   **Kyphosis (Curved Back)-** The spine bends forward due to vertebral collapse. As the body tries to adapt, neck and back pain occurs.\n\n【41】**What Is the Prognosis of Vertebral Compression Fracture?**\n\n【42】The outcome of the vertebral compression fracture depends on the patient's age and the fracture's type and severity. Patients with osteoporosis are more prone to subsequent fractures and respond poorly to conservative treatment.\n\n【43】**Conclusion**\n\n【44】Vertebral compression fractures are very common fractures. The risk increases with age and usually results from osteoporosis. The risk can be lowered by visiting healthcare providers regularly, eating a healthy diet, and taking supplements of calcium and vitamin D. Bone density tests and medicines that prevent bone loss should be taken by elderly people to slow bone loss. Mild vertebral injuries require conservative treatment. However, severe cases of vertebral compression fractures require a specialized team of orthopedic surgeons, neurologists, physicians, and nurses to perform the surgery and monitor the recovery from neurological defects. Instructions from the healthcare provider should be followed for proper recovery.\n\n【45】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>*   Vertebral Compression Fractures  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448171/\n*   Vertebral Compression Fractures  \n    https://www.aans.org/en/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Vertebral-Compression-Fractures\n*   Evaluation and Management of Vertebral Compression Fractures  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3523935/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is characterized by the onset of poorly defined throbbing or dull pain and resolves on its own when it is due to minor trauma. In other cases, like arthritis, the pain may be long-lasting. The wide range of treatment modalities is based on the severity and extent of the conditions.\n\n【2】What Is Knee Pain?\n------------------\n\n【3】The knee is the biggest joint in the body, which bears the entire body weight resulting in stress. The menisci and slippery cartilage (shock-absorbing cartilage) protect and cushion the joint surface during stress. Meanwhile, it promotes a smooth, gliding path on movement. In addition, the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments join the thigh and lower leg bones. A disturbance in this complex structure can contribute to joint pain.\n\n【4】What Are the Types of Knee Pain?\n--------------------------------\n\n【5】Knee pain is broadly classified into four types based on the onset, injury, and severity.\n\n【6】*   **Acute Pain Due to Trauma**: The sudden onset of pain after traumatic injury results in effusion (abnormal collection of fluids in and around the knee joint) or disruption of surrounding tissue of the joint. Most probably due to a history of forceful knee flexion or collision (violent movement) and rapid joint twisting.\n\n【7】*   **Chronic Pain Due to Overuse**: Chronic pain is associated with prolonged physical activity and worsens even with fewer physical loads. Chronic pain is associated with osteoarthritis and is often characterized by tenderness, swelling, and muscle inflexibility. Chronic knee pain is more prevalent among athletes involved in running and jumping.\n\n【8】*   **Acute Pain Due to Overuse**: Acute knee pain is caused by minor trauma or acceleration of pre-existing conditions (like arthritis and tendinopathy - inflammation of the tendon) due to overuse. The acute onset of pain is the characteristic feature of degenerative meniscus injury or osteoarthritis.\n\n【9】*   **Generalized Knee Pain**: Some systemic conditions like lupus erythematosus, gout, sickle cell disease, leukemia, and malignancy can contribute to acute or chronic knee pain with or without effusion, along with fever, night sweats, chills, malaise, weight loss, or fatigue.\n\n【10】What Are the Major Contributing Factors to Knee Pain?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The most common contributing factors of knee pain include:\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-3:<u>Is the knee pain my child is experiencing after falling from the trampoline indicative of a fracture?</u>\n\n【15】My arthritic knee pain has worsened and there is edema of feet as well. Please help.\n\n【16】Acupuncture for Knee Pain - Types, Risk Factors, Side-Effects, Conditions and Benefits\n\n【17】*   **Arthritis**: Degradation and thinning of cartilage are common among older age groups, affecting both hip and knee joints.\n\n【18】*   **Bursitis**: Painful condition due to inflammation of the fluid-filled sac (bursae) and reduced cushioning effects of bone tendon and muscle around the joint.\n\n【19】*   **Tendonitis**: Inflammation of the joint tendon.\n\n【20】*   **Trauma**: Fractures of bone and tear and wear of muscle or tendon are expected, with traumatic injuries predominately causing severe joint pain.\n\n【21】*   **Sports injury**: Sprain (ligament of a joint is stretched or torn) is considered the most common sports injury.\n\n【22】*   **Other Medical Conditions**: They include autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis).\n\n【23】What Is the Risk Factor for Knee Pain?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【24】Predominantly, an individual's lifestyle and physical health can contribute to risk factors for knee weight (obese) directly impacting the knee joint, and a lazy lifestyle decreases the flexibility of muscles. The other risk factors are:\n\n【25】*   Age.\n\n【26】*   History of joint injuries.\n\n【27】*   Smoking.\n\n【28】What Are the Other Symptoms Associated With Knee Pain?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】The pain due to trauma or overuse and systemic conditions left with symptoms of:\n\n【30】*   Swelling.\n\n【31】*   Redness.\n\n【32】*   Warmth.\n\n【33】*   Crackling sound on joint movement.\n\n【34】*   Muscle stiffness.\n\n【35】*   Fever.\n\n【36】*   Night sweats.\n\n【37】*   Chills.\n\n【38】*   Fatigue and malaise.\n\n【39】How to Diagnose Knee Pain?\n--------------------------\n\n【40】The diagnosis is based on past medical conditions, prior injury, physical examination with the correlation of X-rays if needed, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), CT scan (computed tomography), and ultrasound required for the confirmative diagnosis of the condition. MRI and CT with or without arthrocentesis (fluid sample collected from the knee for lab investigation) is the gold standard for diagnosing intra-articular conditions.\n\n【41】What Are the Treatment and Management of Knee Pain?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】The standardized treatment with the minimally invasive to surgical intervention protocol is based on the condition's severity. The mild knee pain due to minor trauma often resolves on its own. Palliative care (symptomatic relief) is recommended for autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and other moderate conditions. NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) play a vital role in symptomatic relief and inflammatory conditions. In severe infections, intra-articular injection (therapeutic injections are given directly into the joint space) is advised to reduce the inflammation and for quick pain relief. Surgery is indicated based on the severity of the injury. The other treatment methods are listed below:\n\n【43】*   **Arthroscopic Surgery**: Arthroscopy is a process by which a fiber optic camera and the instruments are inserted into a knee through tiny incisions to repair damaged cartilage and reconstruct torn ligaments.\n\n【44】*   **Knee Replacement**: The entire or partial knee is replaced by an artificial joint, which is made up of metal alloys, high-grade plastics, and polymers.\n\n【45】*   **Osteotomy**: Removal of thigh bone from the thigh to reconstruct the knee and relieve pain.\n\n【46】*   **Physiotherapy**: It improves joint function and relieves pain after surgery, and it is also recommended for nonsurgical patients to improve muscle strength, balance, and flexibility. In addition, the power training program is used in sports to help people regain their lost capacities to perform specific activities (running or jumping).\n\n【47】What Is Home Care For Knee Pain?\n--------------------------------\n\n【48】A mild injury usually does not require any treatment, and home care is sufficient to overcome the pain.\n\n【49】*   Plenty of rest for two days with minimal physical activity.\n\n【50】*   Wearing compression stockings reduces the unwanted movement of the joint and decreases inflammation.\n\n【51】*   Cold compression with an ice pack reduces inflammation and gives a soothing effect.\n\n【52】*   Leg elevation with the help of a pillow decreases the vascularity of the joint, which aids in swelling and inflammation.\n\n【53】What Are the Exercises for Knee Pain?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【54】Exercise is strongly recommended for arthritis patients with knee and hip pain. The efficiency is based on the duration, intensity, and frequency of exercise. Walking and cycling are an individual's standard forms of physical activity. Using a weight machine and elastic bands, the strength training exercise addresses muscle weakness and reduces functional inability. Some studies show that being overweight is the primary cause of joint pain, and exercise is the only source to get rid of it.\n\n【55】**Conclusion**:\n\n【56】Knee pain is associated with chronic conditions that alter physical activities if not diagnosed and controlled on time. Life-threatening situations or complicated outcomes like suspected fractures and thrombosis (a blood clot that blocks blood vessels and veins) are rare. Physical activity and ice compression therapy decrease knee pain, develop bone density, flexibility, and muscular endurance, and decrease the risk of medical conditions.\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>*   Pain Rehabilitation’s Dual Power: Treatment for Chronic Pain and Prevention of Opioid-Related Risks  \n    https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-amp0000663.pdf\n*   Osteoarthritis Guideline  \n    https://www.rheumatology.org/Portals/0/Files/Osteoarthritis-Guideline-Early-View-2019.pdf</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Ordinarily, this drop is transient, lasting only through a few cardiac cycles. If an individual lacks the necessary circulatory reflexes or blood volume upon standing, less blood and oxygen will reach the brain. This is manifested by dizziness or syncope and increases the patient’s fall risk. The baroreceptor reflex normally kicks in to compensate for standing. Baroreceptors located in the vessels of the chest and carotid send a decrease in blood pressure that will lead to an increase in vasoconstriction and an increase in heart rate to bring blood pressure back up. In the longer term, epinephrine levels and antidiuretic hormone increase in the blood to help maintain blood pressure while standing.\n\n【2】What Are the Causes of Orthostatic Hypotension?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Some of the causes of orthostatic hypotension are mentioned below-\n\n【4】*   **Hypovolemia (Reduced Volume in the Vascular Compartment)-** Blood pressure may be sufficient when the person is sitting or lying down, but while standing, they can get lightheaded. Some causes of hypovolemia may include inadequate fluid intake, excessive urination, excessive use of diuretics, excessive sweating, loss of fluid by vomiting or diarrhea, and loss of fluid from prolonged bed rest. Heart conditions such as heart attack, heart failure, and bradycardia also decrease the cardiac output necessary to overcome the pull of blood away from the brain while standing up. Issues like hypothyroidism or low cortisol levels, such as with Addison's disease, can lower blood pressure and blood volume, putting a patient at risk for postural hypotension. Diabetes can also damage the neurons important in the feedback loop for increasing blood pressure while standing.\n\n【5】*   **Side Effects of Drugs****\\-** Many medications have side effects of postural hypotension and increase the risk of patient falls. Medications used for hypertension and angina fall into this category, including alpha-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers. Other medications that may cause orthostatic hypotension includes drugs used for erectile dysfunction (Sildenafil), sedatives or anti-anxiety drugs (Benzodiazepines), hypnotic drugs (Zolpidem, Diphenhydramine), muscle relaxants (Cyclobenzaprine), antidepressants, dopaminergic agents (Levo-Dopa), antipsychotics, anticholinergics (Oxybutynin), opioids (Morphine), and cardiac glycosides (Digoxin).\n\n【6】*   **Nervous System Complications****\\-** Peripheral neuropathy with diabetes mellitus, spinal cord injury, and cerebral vascular accidents such as stroke can all impair autonomic nervous system reflexes necessary to maintain blood pressure upon standing. In neurodegenerative conditions such as Lewy body dementia, amyloidosis, Parkinson's disease, and shy-drager syndrome, the autonomic nervous system may fail and bring orthostatic hypotension.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Felodipine - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Drug Warnings, and Precautions</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What is the reason for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【8】What Role Does Orthostatic Hypotension Play in Aging?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Orthostatic hypotension can become a more severe problem with increasing age. This is due to a decrease in the activity of compensatory mechanisms like the baroreceptor reflex. Elderly persons also have reduced blood volume and reduced skeletal pump function, which further complicates the problems. After the age of 70 years, patients are more likely to experience postural hypotension due to the aging process, and this is the most often systolic dysfunction that causes a decrease in blood flow to the brain.\n\n【10】Elderly patients are also more prone to taking antihypertensive medications or diuretics, further complicating the problem. In addition to dizziness, the patient may experience weakness and ataxia, including gait and speech abnormalities. It is important to treat and prevent orthostatic hypotension, especially in the elderly, because fluctuations in the blood pressure to the brain increase the risk for stroke and complications of cardiovascular disease like angina, heart failure, and arrhythmias.\n\n【11】How Orthostatic Hypotension is Diagnosed?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【12】It is important to take a thorough medical history, including a history of syncope and falls, medication history, and other medical conditions.\n\n【13】*   Blood pressure is measured when the patient is supine, sitting, or standing. Symptoms while being in these different positions will be noted. Diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension are decreased systolic pressure of at least 20 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or decreased diastolic pressure of at least 10 millimeters of mercury during the first three minutes of standing.\n\n【14】*   Blood tests for hypovolemia and anemia may be performed.\n\n【15】*   An EKG or echocardiogram may be performed to test for cardiac arrhythmias and for structural changes in the heart, such as valvular diseases. These tests may be performed while walking on a treadmill to determine heart function under tests.\n\n【16】How to Manage Orthostatic Hypotension in Older Patients?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Treatment in older patients focuses on determining the underlying cause first; for example, it may involve certain medications or vitamin supplements that the patient is taking. Important lifestyle modifications for patients include:\n\n【18】*   Standing up slowly to allow the negative feedback mechanisms to kick in while going from a supine position to a standing position.\n\n【19】*   It is also helpful to sit on the edge of the bed for a moment before standing up and, while doing so, contract the calf muscles to increase the blood return to the heart. If symptoms appear while standing, contract thigh muscles or rise up on your toes to contract the calf muscles.\n\n【20】*   If one needs to bend down to pick something up, it is advisable not to bend down from the waist instead, squatting while bending the knees is beneficial.\n\n【21】*   Using pillows to elevate the head while sleeping will decrease the chance of hypotension while getting up.\n\n【22】*   It is important to avoid things or conditions that can cause too much vasodilation, such as drinking alcohol or intense exercise in hot environments or saunas.\n\n【23】*   Be aware of what may lead to dehydration, including diaphoresis, lack of fluid intake, and vomiting or diarrhea.\n\n【24】*   Support clothes or abdominal support clothing can be used to keep blood pressure from pooling in the legs and abdomen. These supporting garments should be taken off while lying down.\n\n【25】*   Eating smaller meals may be necessary for those who may have a drop in blood pressure after meals. Also, measures should be taken to increase the vascular volume, such as increased salt in the diet but should be done in moderation and with physician approval.\n\n【26】*   Several medications may be used to treat orthostatic hypotension when lifestyle modifications are not working and are prescribed by a physician.\n\n【27】**Conclusion:**\n\n【28】Orthostatic hypotension is a common condition that can be encountered daily by an older person and drastically impacts their quality of life and results in rapid deterioration in physical and social activities. When diagnosed, it should not be ignored, and the patient should seek medical attention. One can easily manage this condition with proper lifestyle modification and treatment options, which can significantly impact maintaining independence in older people.\n\n【29】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【30】无关删除-1:<u>*   Orthostatic Hypotension  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3860797/\n*   Orthostatic hypotension in older people: considerations, diagnosis and management  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8140709/\n*   Hypertension  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.hyp.19.6.508</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Coronary arteries are the major vessels supplying the heart. CAD occurs primarily when the arteries of the heart get blocked, resulting in decreased or insufficient blood supply. This block in the arteries is also known as plaque. The plaque gradually builds over time and is composed mainly of fat (cholesterol) and calcium.\n\n【2】Initially, the plaque is a soft material; gradually, as they deposit in the blood vessels, they get calcified and occlude the blood vessel either completely or partially. This is also known as atherosclerosis. This would impede the blood flow, and the heart would be deprived of oxygen-rich blood. This would result in chest pain, shortness of breath, or a complete block that may also cause a heart attack.\n\n【3】Another consequence of the plaque buildup would be the rupture of the plaque resulting in a blood clot. This clot can block the blood flow resulting in heart attack, unstable angina, or myocardial infarction. Hence early detection of this plaque can be helpful in the management of CAD.\n\n【4】What Is a Coronary Calcium Scan?\n--------------------------------\n\n【5】A coronary calcium scan, also known as a heart scan, is a specialized imaging scan that uses computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the calcified plaque in the coronary arteries of the heart. It is a non-invasive procedure used to determine the presence, extent, and site of the calcified plaque. Based on the results, the doctors can advise medications, lifestyle changes, or further interventions to prevent any complications.\n\n【6】What Are the Uses of Coronary Calcium Scans?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【7】A coronary calcium scan is mostly indicated in low or medium-risk patients. It is done so that individuals diagnosed with moderate risk can make certain lifestyle changes to prevent coronary artery disease and its consequences. The risk factors associated with CAD are as mentioned below:\n\n【8】*   Patients with a familial history of heart disease.\n\n【9】*   Obesity.\n\n【10】*   Patients with a history of smoking and drinking alcohol.\n\n【11】*   Patients with a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.\n\n【12】*   Patients with a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n【13】What Are the Instructions Before the Procedure?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【14】*   Patients will be advised to avoid caffeine for 4 hours before the procedure.\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Am I at a risk for heart attack?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Atherosclerosis: The Silent Killer</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    My mother is having ribcage pain and mild chest discomfort while sleeping on left side.

The entire procedure would take 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n【24】*   The patient will be given a hospital gown to wear before the procedure.\n\n【25】*   Three small areas on the chest will be shaved, cleaned, and sterilized. Small sticky electrodes will be stuck on these areas in the chest and will be connected to the electrocardiograph machine (ECG). This helps the doctor to analyze the heart activity and facilitate the process of taking the images when the heart is relaxed and not contracting.\n\n【26】*   The patient will be made to lie on a table that slides into the CT scanning machine. The CT scanner is a hollow tunnel-like device.\n\n【27】*   Patients might be given medication that could slow down heart activity, thus enabling better images.\n\n【28】*   Patients will be asked to hold their breath for a few seconds when the images are being acquired.\n\n【29】*   These images are then processed in the computer and visible as two-dimensional images.\n\n【30】How Are the Results Interpreted?\n--------------------------------\n\n【31】The results are most likely available on the same day or the next day. It is broadly described as a negative cardiac CT scan and a positive cardiac CT scan.\n\n【32】*   Negative Scan: Absence of any calcification suggestive of minimal or no CAD.\n\n【33】*   Positive Scan: Calcifications are present suggestive of CAD irrespective of the presence or absence of any signs and symptoms.\n\n【34】The calcium present is quantified as the calcium score, also known as the Agatston score. The scoring is as given below:\n\n【35】*   A high score cannot be taken as an individual predictor of heart health. However, a high score is indicative of lifestyle changes, medications, and supplementary tests to prevent major cardiac issues.\n\n【36】*   The doctor may suggest a revised diet plan, new exercises, weight loss regime, or certain medications based on the scoring. Additional diagnostic tests and follow-ups may also be advised.\n\n【37】**What Instructions Should Be Followed by the Patient After the Procedure?**\n\n【38】There are no special instructions required post-procedure. It is a simple and easy procedure, and patients can carry on with their routine activities after the procedure is done.\n\n【39】What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of the Procedure?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】**Advantages**:\n\n【41】*   Detecting heart diseases at the earliest stage.\n\n【42】*   Non-invasive, fast, and painless.\n\n【43】*   Extremely convenient.\n\n【44】*   Well tolerated by the patients.\n\n【45】*   No injection of any contrast material or dye.\n\n【46】**Disadvantages:**\n\n【47】*   Limited radiation exposure.\n\n【48】*   Not indicated in pregnant ladies.\n\n【49】*   Other diagnostic tests may be required in patients with high scores, which may or may not corroborate clinical results.\n\n【50】What Are the Limitations of the Procedure?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【51】*   This test may not be vital to the patient associated with low-risk factors as there will be no calcium deposit present.\n\n【52】*   Patients with proven CAD, under treatment for CAD, or with suspicious symptoms of heart disease are not ideal candidates for this test.\n\n【53】*   Soft or early stages of plaque formation may also not be visible in the scan.\n\n【54】*   Obese patients or those weighing over 450 pounds may not be accommodated in the CT machine.\n\n【55】*   An increased heart rate may hinder the test.\n\n【56】What Are the Advances in Coronary Calcium Scans?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【57】*   A conventional CT can be replaced with electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) in a coronary calcium scan.\n\n【58】*   It is considered extremely fast to create 20 images per second.\n\n【59】*   The entire scanning procedure takes only a few seconds.\n\n【60】*   It can be used even when the heartbeat is rapid, as it causes no blurring.\n\n【61】*   The major limitation of EBCT is that it is not commonly available and is less versatile.\n\n【62】**Conclusion:**\n\n【63】A coronary calcium scan is an easy, convenient and effective way to diagnose heart problems at their earliest stage. Heart diseases, when identified at an early stage, can be easily treated with lifestyle modifications and medical management. It would help avoid surgical interventions and other complications too. Certain blood tests and cardiac markers also provide vital information on cardiac health. However, a heart scan is considered more precise and may prove extremely beneficial in individuals with high risk.\n\n【64】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【65】无关删除-1:<u>*   Coronary artery calcium score: current status  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487233/\n*   Coronary Artery Calcium Scanning: Past, Present, and Future  \n    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936878X15001369\n*   An Evidence-Based Guide for Coronary Calcium Scoring in Asymptomatic Patients without Coronary Heart Disease  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3384065/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is used for surgery of the upper abdomen.\n\n【30】*   **Paramedian**: A vertical cut that runs to one side of the midline. It is used to treat the kidneys and adrenal glands.\n\n【31】*   **Transverse:** A horizontal cut.\n\n【32】*   **Pfannenstiel:** This is used to access the pelvic region, for example- in the case of an emergency cesarean delivery.\n\n【33】*   **Subcostal:** This is a diagonal cut across one side of the upper abdomen. The subcostal incision is used to treat and diagnose the gallbladder, spleen, and liver.\n\n【34】*   **Rooftop (Chevron):** Subcostal incision on both sides of the body, meet in the middle to make a rooftop incision.\n\n【35】How to be Prepared for a Laparotomy?\n------------------------------------\n\n【36】There is not much time to prepare for laparotomy in emergency cases like accidents. However, in case of a scheduled surgery:\n\n【37】*   **The Week Before Surgery-** Basic preparations include:\n\n【38】    *   Stop smoking or alcohol intake.\n\n【39】    *   Well-managed health conditions (blood pressure, diabetes, etc.).\n\n【40】    *   Inform doctors about pregnancy, any other supplements, prescriptions, and over-the-counter medications.\n\n【41】*   **On the Day of Surgery-** Medications, and instructions given by doctors must be followed. Water intake should be minimum.\n\n【42】*   **Immediately Before the Operation-**\n\n【43】    *   The abdominal area is shaved.\n\n【44】    *   Surgical scrub and dress are given.\n\n【45】    *   An enema to empty the bowels.\n\n【46】    *   The patient is checked for any possible allergies before administering anesthesia.\n\n【47】    *   The principle of 'nil by mouth' (nothing to eat) is followed for a few hours before laparotomy.\n\n【48】    *   Previous operative scars or deformities of the abdominal wall are checked.\n\n【49】    *   Cross-matching of blood groups is done.\n\n【50】    *   A urinary catheter is placed.\n\n【51】    *   Intravenous antibiotics are given.\n\n【52】    *   Maintain adequate fluid and electrolyte balance in the body.\n\n【53】    *   A nasogastric tube might be placed (in cases of obstruction or perforation).\n\n【54】What Is the Procedure of Laparotomy?\n------------------------------------\n\n【55】General anesthesia is given to the patient for laparotomy.\n\n【56】The process is as follows:\n\n【57】*   An incision is made through the skin and muscles of the abdomen to examine the underlying organs.\n\n【58】*   Careful diagnosis and examination of the underlying organs are made.\n\n【59】*   After diagnosis, doctors may fix the problem, or the patient may need a second operation.\n\n【60】*   After completion, the wound is closed by placing sutures (stitches).\n\n【61】What to Expect After Laparotomy?\n--------------------------------\n\n【62】After the operation, the following procedures can be expected:\n\n【63】*   Careful monitoring of temperature, pulse, respiration, blood pressure, and wound site.\n\n【64】*   Insertion of a drain at the site of the wound.\n\n【65】*   Placement of a nasal tube to help drain stomach secretions for a few days.\n\n【66】*   A urinary catheter is placed.\n\n【67】*   Intravenous fluids (directly into the vein) for providing nutrition.\n\n【68】*   Painkillers are given.\n\n【69】*   Patients are encouraged to perform deep breathing, leg exercises, and early walking (it reduces the risks of blood clots and chest infections).\n\n【70】*   Daily wound care and regular observation is needed.\n\n【71】*   Medication is given at the time of discharge.\n\n【72】How Is Recovery After Laparotomy?\n---------------------------------\n\n【73】Recovery time after laparotomy varies depending upon the case and cause of laparotomy. Factors that affect recovery time are the overall health and age of the person. A good self after-care by the patient aids in rapid recovery. Along with the doctor's guidance, the patient should follow:\n\n【74】*   Taking sufficient rest for a few weeks as recommended by the doctor.\n\n【75】*   Avoid any heavy lifting, pulling or pushing, sexual activities, and swimming for at least six weeks.\n\n【76】*   Proper medication and exercise schedule.\n\n【77】*   Proper diet.\n\n【78】*   Contact the doctor immediately if:\n\n【79】    *   Areas around the wound show increased pain or tenderness, redness, swelling, and discharge from the wound site.\n\n【80】    *   Fever, vomiting, or nausea.\n\n【81】    *   Symptoms of a blood clot like severe pain in the legs, chest pain, or difficulty breathing.\n\n【82】What Are the Risks Associated With Laparotomy?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【83】Laparotomy is a major surgical procedure, so the general risk associated includes- bleeding, infection, bruising, hematoma, poor healing at the incision site, reaction to anesthesia, or skin numbness.\n\n【84】Other more specific complications include- lack of diagnosis (need for more procedures and tests), damage to bowels or abdominal organs, or hernia at the incision site.\n\n【85】*   **Scarring**\\- Red, painful, raised scar across the abdomen may appear, which usually resolves in six weeks to eight weeks. Sometimes, the scars may become permanent.\n\n【86】*   **Abdominal Adhesions-** Commonly seen after laparotomy, bands of scar tissues are formed inside the abdomen. Abdominal adhesion may cause symptoms like - pain, bloating, constipation, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Sometimes, it may lead to complications like a blockage in the intestines (small bowel obstruction) or infertility in females (reproductive system obstruction).\n\n【87】What Is Laparoscopy (Keyhole Surgery)?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【88】Laparoscopy or keyhole surgery is quite similar to laparotomy. In this procedure, small keyhole incisions are made on the abdomen then a tiny tube with a light and camera at its end is inserted through it. Laparoscopy is less invasive and has better recovery as compared to laparotomy.\n\n【89】**Conclusion**\n\n【90】Laparotomy or celiotomy is a major surgical procedure. An incision is made over the abdomen to diagnose or treat the underlying organs. Proper after-care and following the prescribed medications aids in early recovery and better prognosis.\n\n【91】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【92】* * *\n\n【93】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is Laparotomy?**\n\n【94】Laparotomy (celiotomy) is a surgical procedure performed by incising the abdomen to gain access to the underlying organs.

It is also known as wear and tear arthritis. Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage or protective tissues surrounding the ends of bones deteriorate, which causes the bones to rub together and results in pain and stiffness, reducing the flexibility of joints. Osteoarthritis commonly affects the hands, fingers, spine, hips, shoulders, knees, etc. However, hips are the most common site of developing osteoarthritis.\n\n【2】What Is Hip Osteoarthritis?\n---------------------------\n\n【3】When the cartilage wears in the weight-bearing joints or hip joints, the space between the joints reduces, and the bones in the joint start rubbing against each other. This results in the outward growth of bones known as osteophytes or bone spurs. The damaged cartilage causes severe pain and inflammation. Following are the four stages of osteoarthritis in the hip:\n\n【4】1.  **Minor**: There will be small signs of tension. The wear and tear of hip joints are minimum and small bone spurs may appear. Bone spurs are usually undetectable at this stage. But if detected, they are treatable. The person may experience little or no pain.\n\n【5】2.  **Mild**: The developing bone spurs are more visible in the X-ray. The person experiences symptoms like stiffness and joint pain, especially while standing up for a long time. This stage is also known as mild hip osteoarthritis.\n\n【6】3.  **Moderate**: More wearing of cartilage occurs resulting in joint inflammation. Large bone spurs are visible in the X-ray. Activities like walking, running, squatting, etc. are affected and a popping noise may also be heard while moving joints.\n\n【7】4.  **Severe**: In this stage, cartilage is almost completely worn out which causes severe inflammation of the hip joint. The person will experience pain and stiffness all the time.\n\n【8】Other arthritis that affects hip joints are:\n\n【9】*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: It is a type of arthritis that causes inflammation of the joints resulting in thickening and building of fluids lining the synovial membrane.\n\n【10】*   **Psoriatic Arthritis**: It is a type of arthritis which is associated with psoriasis, causing skin and nail disease along with swelling of joints.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Arthropathy - Causes, Symptoms, Clinical Manifestations, And Prevention</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Physiotherapy - Fall Prevention in Geriatric Population</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Common Aging Problems Associated With Feet</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   **Post-Traumatic Hip Arthritis**: The type of arthritis that occurs shortly after hip fracture is known as post-traumatic hip arthritis.\n\n【12】*   **Hip Arthritis Due to Avascular Necrosis**: When the bone loses blood supply, it starts to collapse leading to avascular necrosis. In the hip, the femoral head is prone to avascular necrosis.\n    </u>\n\n【13】What Are the Risk Factors for Osteoarthritis in the Hip?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】*   **Old Age**: As age advances, more wearing of hip cartilage can occur. Studies found higher incidence of hip osteoarthritis in people above 50 years and below 70 years.\n\n【15】*   **Gender**: Women during the post-menopausal period are at higher risk for developing osteoarthritis than men. During the post-menopausal period, the estrogen level is reduced in women. Estrogen plays a key role in reducing bone resorption in women.\n\n【16】*   **Genetics**: As part of certain autoimmune conditions, hip osteoarthritis can run in families.\n\n【17】*   **Obesity**: Increased weight or obesity can cause additional stress on hips and knees that can end up in osteoarthritis in both hips and knees.\n\n【18】*   **Structural or Developmental Abnormalities**: Abnormalities like hip dysplasia, slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), and hip impingement can increase the risk of hip osteoarthritis.\n\n【19】*   **History of Injury or Trauma**: Injury or tear in hip joints due to any accident or fall can lead to osteoarthritis.\n\n【20】*   **Intense Sports**: Athletes who participate in intense sports activities have a high risk of developing hip and knee osteoarthritis.\n\n【21】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Hip Osteoarthritis?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】*   Stiffness in the hip makes moving or rotating hips difficult. Activities that involve bending, such as putting a shoe on, sitting for a long time, etc. become difficult.\n\n【23】*   Popping sound while moving hip joints.\n\n【24】*   Pain in or near the area of the hip. A person with hip osteoarthritis often experiences pain in the groin, thigh, or buttock area, making the diagnosis difficult for the physician.\n\n【25】*   Some people may experience locking of the hip for a few moments.\n\n【26】How Is Hip Osteoarthritis Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------\n\n【27】After taking the detailed medical history that involves signs and symptoms, doctors will conduct the following tests:\n\n【28】*   Pain or tenderness in the hip and area surrounding the hip.\n\n【29】*   Pain on applying pressure on the hip.\n\n【30】*   Popping sounds or grating sounds while moving hips.\n\n【31】*   Range of motion.\n\n【32】*   Analysis of gait or walking patterns.\n\n【33】This is followed by X-ray analysis which can detect the narrowing of joints and the presence of bone spurs or osteophytes. Other advanced imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used to get an accurate picture of hip osteoarthritis as well as associated problems in soft tissues like muscles and tendons.\n\n【34】What Is the Treatment for Hip Osteoarthritis in the Elderly?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】The treatment for hip osteoarthritis is broadly classified into non-surgical and surgical.\n\n【36】**Non-Surgical Treatment**: This treatment modality involves medications, physiotherapy, and assisted devices.\n\n【37】*   **Medications**: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen and ibuprofen are prescribed to reduce pain and inflammation. Acetaminophen is the most effective painkiller that reduces severe pain associated with hip osteoarthritis. In some cases, corticosteroids are also given to relieve pain.\n\n【38】*   **Physiotherapy**: Physiotherapy plays a key role in the treatment of hip osteoarthritis. The goal is to improve strength and mobility. In patients with hip osteoarthritis, physiotherapy can reduce pain and restore normal mobility.\n\n【39】*   **Assisted Devices**: Canes, crutches, or walking sticks are the most common assisting aids for people with walking problems.\n\n【40】**Surgical Treatment**: Following are the surgeries performed for hip osteoarthritis:\n\n【41】*   **Hip Replacement Surgery**: In this surgery, the parts of the hip joints, such as the femoral head and damaged acetabular, are replaced with metal, ceramic, or plastic joint surfaces. This surgery can restore the function of the hip joint.\n\n【42】*   **Hip Resurfacing**: In hip resurfacing, the damaged part of the acetabulum in the hip joint is removed and replaced with a metal shell. However, the femoral head is preserved.\n\n【43】How to Manage Hip Osteoarthritis in the Elderly?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Even though there is no permanent cure for osteoarthritis, certain exercises, and lifestyle modifications can relieve pain and improve mobility in elderly patients.\n\n【45】*   **Weight Management**: Increased weight is a cause of hip osteoarthritis. Hence, being overweight or obese with hip osteoarthritis can add extra strain on the hip joint, which can worsen the condition. A balanced diet with regular exercise can help in weight management. Patients can also consult a nutritionist to help them in a healthy weight loss journey.\n\n【46】*   **Regular Walking**: Walking can improve blood flow to the cartilage and has many additional benefits. Hence, it is considered the best exercise for hip osteoarthritis.\n\n【47】*   **Exercise**: There are specific exercises for hip osteoarthritis in physiotherapy like hip extensions, chair squats, body weight squats, knee-to-chest stretches, etc. However, these exercises have to be performed only under the guidance of a licensed physiotherapist. Strengthening and aerobic exercises are also effective.\n\n【48】**Conclusion**\n\n【49】Hip osteoarthritis occurs due to cartilage degeneration surrounding the hip joint and most commonly affects older people. Post-menopausal women, obese people, and people with a history of hip injury are more likely to develop osteoarthritis. Severe hip pain and inflammation are the main symptoms of hip osteoarthritis. Hip replacement surgery and hip resurfacing are surgical procedures done to treat hip osteoarthritis. Non-surgical methods include medications and physiotherapy. With proper care, support, and certain lifestyle modifications, hip osteoarthritis in older people is manageable.\n\n【50】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【51】无关删除-1:<u>*   Osteoarthritis of the hip joint in elderly patients is most commonly atrophic, with low parameters of acetabular dysplasia and possible involvement of osteoporosis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5362671/\n*   Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip  \n    https://www.versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/conditions/osteoarthritis-oa-of-the-hip/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "af500198-4a21-4ddd-a652-dbc6de809252", "title": "Types of Hearing Loss", "text": "【0】What Is Hearing Loss?\n---------------------\n\n【1】Hearing loss is a condition that occurs when any part of the auditory system is not working in the normal manner. Also, hearing loss can occur as we gradually age, and that is common.\n\n【2】What Is the Mechanism of Hearing?\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】The human ear works by collecting the sound in the environment through pinna that passes through the ear canal and strikes the ear drum. Vibrations of the drum are transmitted to the inner ear through the chain of ossicles coupled to the drum. This stimulates hair cells of the organ of Corti. These hair cells act as transducers and convert mechanical energy into electrical impulses, which travel along the auditory nerve to the brain.\n\n【4】What Are the Different Types of Hearing Loss?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The type of hearing loss depends on the part of the auditory system affected. The following are different types:\n\n【6】*   Conductive hearing loss.\n\n【7】*   Sensorineural.\n\n【8】*   Mixed.\n\n【9】What Is Conductive Hearing Loss?\n--------------------------------\n\n【10】Conductive hearing loss is when there is any obstruction to the conduction of sound waves from the external ear to the inner ear. That is, in this case, the affected part of the auditory system may be the external ear or the middle ear. In this condition, the patient finds it difficult to hear soft sounds.\n\n【11】What Causes Conductive Hearing Loss?\n------------------------------------\n\n【12】Conductive hearing can be caused for the following reasons:\n\n【13】*   Ear Wax- Sometimes, the accumulation of earwax in the ear canal can block the sound waves and hence, cause impaired hearing.\n\n【14】*   Foreign Bodies Introduced Into the Ear Canal Like - children may put beads or pebbles in the ear, and sometimes bugs may go inside the ear of adults leading to conductive hearing loss.\n\n【15】*   Noncancerous bone growth inside the auditory canal is often linked with cold water swimming.\n\n【16】*   Aural Atresia\\- the defect of the external ear canal at birth seen along with defects of the external ear structure.\n\n【17】*   Hole in the eardrum caused by trauma, infection, or severe eustachian tube dysfunction.\n\n【18】*   Problems in the eardrum.\n\n【19】*   Infection of the middle ear can result in fluid accumulation in place of air, known as Otitis media, commonly seen in children.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    High-Frequency Hearing Loss - Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Bilateral Sensorineural Hearing Loss - Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatments</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Can hearing deterioration and vertigo be due to acoustic neuroma?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Sometimes the eardrum may collapse to the middle ear bones due to severe pressure imbalance in the middle ear because of poor function of the Eustachian tube.\n\n【21】*   Cholesteatoma is the presence of skin cells in the middle ear which is usually not present.\n\n【22】*   Damage to middle ear bones.\n    </u>\n\n【23】What Are the Symptoms of Conductive Hearing Loss?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】The symptoms of conductive hearing loss are as follows:\n\n【25】*   Sudden loss of hearing.\n\n【26】*   Difficult to hear soft sounds.\n\n【27】*   Pain in the ear.\n\n【28】*   Stuffiness in the ear.\n\n【29】*   Dizziness.\n\n【30】*   Muffled hearing.\n\n【31】*   Draining from the ear.\n\n【32】What Is Sensorineural Hearing Loss?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】Sensorineural hearing is the hearing loss originating from the inner ear or nerve pathways that run from the inner ear to the brain. The sound from the outer ear to the inner ear from where the signals are sent to the brain. The cochlea of the inner ear has tiny hair-like cells which are damaged in case of sensorineural hearing loss. It is the most common type of permanent hearing loss and, in most instances, cannot be medically or surgically treated.\n\n【34】What Causes Sensorineural Hearing Loss?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【35】The following are the causes of Sensorineural hearing loss:\n\n【36】*   Damage to the auditory nerve.\n\n【37】*   Damage to tiny hair cells on the cochlea.\n\n【38】*   Viral infections.\n\n【39】*   Exposure to loud noise.\n\n【40】*   Aging.\n\n【41】*   Trauma to the head.\n\n【42】*   An abrupt change in air pressure can cause the space that contains inner ear fluid to rupture.\n\n【43】*   Vestibular Schwannoma - noncancerous bony growth in the inner ear, which can compress the nerve to the brain.\n\n【44】*   Genetic abnormality during the formation of the inner ear.\n\n【45】*   Autoimmune conditions in which the body's own cells attack the hair cells of the cochlea.\n\n【46】*   Drug intoxication.\n\n【47】What Are the Symptoms of Sensorineural Hearing Loss?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】Symptoms may include:\n\n【49】*   Difficulty understanding the speech.\n\n【50】*   Muffled hearing.\n\n【51】*   Tinnitus (ringing sound in one or both ears)\n\n【52】*   Sudden loss of hearing.\n\n【53】*   Dizziness.\n\n【54】*   Stuffiness in the ear.\n\n【55】What Is Mixed Hearing Loss?\n---------------------------\n\n【56】Mixed hearing loss is the combination of both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss, which means the outer, middle, and inner ears are affected in this case. There is a conduction block to the sound waves as well as there is damage to either hair cells of the cochlea or the auditory nerve. The sensorineural component may be permanent, but the conductive part may be corrected.\n\n【57】What Causes Mixed Hearing Loss?\n-------------------------------\n\n【58】The causes of mixed hearing loss include causes of both Conductive and Sensorineural hearing loss and include:\n\n【59】*   Aging.\n\n【60】*   Birth abnormalities.\n\n【61】*   Certain medications.\n\n【62】*   Exposure to loud noise.\n\n【63】*   Tumors.\n\n【64】*   Collection of earwax.\n\n【65】*   Trauma to the head.\n\n【66】*   Infections.\n\n【67】What Are the Symptoms Of Mixed Hearing Loss?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【68】*   Reduced hearing in one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) the ears.\n\n【69】How to Diagnose Hearing Loss?\n-----------------------------\n\n【70】Even though hearing loss is common in old age people, it is not given much attention, and a proper diagnosis is never made. Impaired hearing can greatly affect one’s quality of living; hence it is always important to reach a diagnosis. If hearing loss is suspected, always consider consulting a specialist as early as possible so that proper treatment is received at the earliest as some conditions could be cured completely depending on the cause and severity.\n\n【71】The different types of tests to diagnose the type of hearing loss include:\n\n【72】*   **Standard Audiometry** - This method is used to make diagnoses in adults and older children. In this test, earphones are placed in each ear through which a range of tones is transmitted- patients are asked to respond when they hear each sound.\n\n【73】*   **Bone Conduction** - This test is used to determine the type of hearing loss. In this test, a device is used which sends vibrations directly to the inner ear or cochlea and not through the outer or middle ear, and if the patient can hear properly, then he has conductive hearing loss. In case the patient can hear well with both earphones and vibrator, then he/she might have a sensorineural hearing loss.\n\n【74】*   **Word Recognition Test** - In this test, the ability to differentiate the speech sounds of various words are evaluated.\n\n【75】*   **Acoustic Immittance** - This test evaluates the condition of the middle ear and related structures.\n\n【76】*   **Otoacoustic Emissions (OAEs)** - Assess the function of the cochlea.\n\n【77】*   **Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR)** - ABRs are procedures done to determine the functioning of neural pathways.\n\n【78】How Can It Be Treated?\n----------------------\n\n【79】The treatment for hearing loss depends on the type and severity of the condition and includes:\n\n【80】*   **Hearing Aids** - Hearing aids are advised in case of damage to the inner ear.\n\n【81】*   **Removing Earwax**\\- Hearing loss due to wax blockage is reversible.\n\n【82】*   **Surgery** - This is advised in case of any growth in the auditory system and some cases of damage to the eardrum.\n\n【83】*   **Cochlear Implants**\\- This option is for people with profound hearing loss who had no benefit from the usage of hearing aids. Cochlear implants bypass the damaged parts of the ear and directly send the signal to the nerve.\n\n【84】**Conclusion:**\n\n【85】Hearing loss can be because of improper functioning or even not functioning of any part of the ear. The part of the ear affected tells what type of hearing loss one is suffering from and the treatment option varies accordingly. The treatment options include either correcting the cause or using prosthetics to correct the hearing. Impaired hearing can affect your day-to-day life, and in some cases, the hearing loss may become permanent too. But, the interference by a physician at the right time will greatly affect the overall prognosis.\n\n【86】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【87】无关删除-1:<u>*   Types of Hearing Loss  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/hearing-loss/types-of-hearing-loss#:~:text=The%20three%20basic%20categories%20of,should%20know%20about%20each%20type\n*   Types of hearing impairment  \n    https://uihc.org/health-topics/types-hearing-impairment\n*   Hearing Loss Treatments  \n    https://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/hearing-loss/treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The amniocentesis procedure involves the aspiration of fluid from the womb of the pregnant mother. This fluid-filled inside the womb is called amniotic fluid which provides a cushioning effect and nutrients to the baby. Amniocentesis is helpful in diagnosing or excluding fetal genetic, biochemical, or infectious risks. The doctor will perform amniocentesis after 16 weeks of gestation.\n\n【2】Can Amniocentesis Cause Miscarriage?\n------------------------------------\n\n【3】The actual risk of miscarriage accounted for the amniocentesis procedure is yet not clear. The initial evaluation of amniocentesis-related miscarriage rate during the 1970s was 0.3 to 1.5 percent. In the 1980s, a prospective randomized trial study showed a risk of 1 percent. In the 1990s two meta-analysis studies showed a risk of 0.6 percent, whereas the latest study in 2020, found the miscarriage rate below 0.5 percent. This diverse result for miscarriage is because of the lack of data from randomized trials and due to the variety of the study method and populations involved. However, studies also showed that the risk of a miscarriage increases with multiple attempts of amniocentesis, due to the presence of blood-stained amniotic fluid. The risk of procedure-related miscarriage can be reduced with experience and familiarity with the amniocentesis procedure by the performing doctor.\n\n【4】However, there are some cases of miscarriage that occur after amniocentesis. But they are not associated with only the amniocentesis procedure alone, in fact, the fetal loss rate is also found to be associated with the mother’s age at the time of pregnancy and other underlying risk factors including pathological conditions of mother and baby as well.\n\n【5】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-3:<u>Does miscarriage affect fertility?</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>Should I need amniocentesis?</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-3:<u>Is miscarriage common in women with tubal blockage and PCOS?</u>\n\n【10】What Are the Other Risk Factors That Increase the Risk of Miscarriage After Amniocentesis?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】*   **The Mental Health of Pregnant Women:** Mental health during the peripartum period is highly important for women and the developing baby in the womb, as anxiety, stress, and depression during pregnancy are related to alterations in fetal and infant neurobehavioural development. Moreover, mental conditions are also a risk factor for the development of postpartum depression as well. In addition, women struggling with infertility may have higher levels of general anxiety and mental stress than women who have conceived naturally, during the time of the first pregnancy. As amniocentesis is prenatal invasive testing further increases maternal anxiety. With this invasive procedure, some consequent issues such as cramping, pain, and vaginal spotting may occur after the procedure. Moreover, in some cases, minimal amniotic fluid leakage also can occur. These complications of the procedure may exaggerate the mental condition of the mother, which puts her at risk of miscarriage.\n\n【12】*   **Leakage of Amniotic Fluid:** Women who experience leaking of amniotic fluid after amniocentesis as it is the procedure that involves puncturing the amniotic sac and retrieving amniotic fluid for the test. This leakage may occur in some women which further increases the risk of infection, fetal compromise may also happen due to compression of the cord that supplies the baby, premature rupture of membranes may also occur, and risk of preterm delivery.\n\n【13】*   **Fetal Abnormalities:** A positive screening test during the first or second trimester suggests fetal genetic abnormalities. These fetal chromosomal abnormalities are also one factor in the risk of miscarriage after amniocentesis.\n\n【14】*   **Mother’s Age at the Time of Pregnancy:** The risk of a miscarriage increases steeply after a women’s age of 35 years. It rises from 9 percent at 20 to 24 years to 75 percent after 45 years of age.\n\n【15】*   **Past History of Miscarriage:** Another important predictive and risk factor for fetal loss outcome is reproductive history. Research among women after an amniocentesis procedure established that women in their first pregnancy and women with a history of live baby births have a low risk of miscarriage during their next pregnancies compared to women who had a fetal loss in their most recent pregnancy. According to a study report, women with a history of more than three miscarriages or induced abortions have four times more risk of miscarriage than other women after undergoing amniocentesis.\n\n【16】*   **Bleeding:** Bleeding is also a risk factor for pregnancy loss associated with amniocentesis. Even without an invasive procedure, a history of spotting and serious bleeding in the first and early second trimesters are independent risk factors for a miscarriage. For the amniocentesis procedure, bleeding two weeks before the amniocentesis procedure is a contraindication. Studies data suggest that invasive diagnostic procedures like amniocentesis in case of previous bleeding may lead to miscarriage.\n\n【17】*   **Blood-Stained Amniotic Fluid:** Miscarriage is also related to intra-amniotic bleeding. Blood in amniotic fluid even without a history of vaginal bleeding may cause fetal loss. When amniotic fluid is blood stained at amniocentesis, it indicates an old intra-amniotic hemorrhage. In such cases, the risk of a miscarriage is almost six times higher. On the contrary, amniotic fluid mixed with fresh blood such as in cases of placenta perforation, the risk of miscarriage is not higher than in clear amniotic fluid cases. Thus, miscarriage after retrieval of blood-stained amniotic fluid is a result of hemorrhage.\n\n【18】*   **Uterine Fibroids:** The presence of fibroids in the uterus is also an independent predictive risk factor for miscarriage. Women who had uterine fibroids more than 20 mm in size have almost three times higher risk of miscarriage after amniocentesis. Women who had undergone surgery to remove the fibroids did not have an increased risk for fetal loss. This is true for any uterine surgery history.\n\n【19】**Conclusion**\n\n【20】Amniocentesis is the most commonly performed invasive procedure for prenatal genetic testing. However, amniocentesis is a relatively safe procedure and has fewer complications including miscarriage in rare cases. The actual miscarriage risk of an amniocentesis procedure is still uncertain and is certainly multifactorial. Gynecologists usually advise pregnant women to undergo amniocentesis for any reason such as an abnormal screening test or major ultrasonographic markers for fetal abnormalities. In that case, a woman should not be worried about the risk and should consult and communicate better regarding solving any doubt regarding the risks in her case. The genetic counselor can also be extremely helpful, to understand the risks of the testing procedures and also will guide the couple in case of any possibility of abnormal results.\n\n【21】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【22】无关删除-1:<u>*   Pregnancy Loss After Amniocentesis and Chorionic Villus Sampling: Cohort Study  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7780764/\n*   Fetal loss following second trimester amniocentesis.

Some of these strategies include:\n\n【14】1.  **Developing an Individualized Treatment Plan:** Every woman with a maternal seizure disorder is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to treatment. It is important to work with a healthcare provider to develop an individualized treatment plan that takes into account the patient's unique medical history, preferences, and values.\n\n【15】2.  **Regularly Monitoring Seizure Activity:** Regular monitoring of seizure activity during pregnancy can help ensure that the treatment plan is effective and make any necessary adjustments.\n\n【16】3.  **Taking Antiepileptic Medications:** Women with maternal seizure disorder may need to continue taking antiepileptic medications during pregnancy to reduce the risk of seizures. However, some medications may not be safe for the developing fetus, so it is important to work with a healthcare provider to choose the most appropriate medication.\n\n【17】4.  **Avoiding Seizure Triggers:** Some women with maternal seizure disorder may have certain triggers that can increase the risk of seizures, such as lack of sleep or stress. Avoiding these triggers can help reduce the risk of seizures.\n\n【18】5.  **Getting Adequate Prenatal Care:** Regular prenatal care is important for all pregnant women, but it is especially important for women with maternal seizure disorder. Healthcare providers can monitor the health of the mother and developing fetus, and make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan.\n\n【19】6.  **Being Prepared for Labor and Delivery:** Women with maternal seizure disorder may need specialized care during labor and delivery, such as continuous fetal monitoring and coordination with a neurologist.\n\n【20】By working closely with the healthcare providers and following these strategies, women with maternal seizure disorder can have successful pregnancies and healthy babies.\n\n【21】What Are the Potential Risks and Benefits of Antiepileptic Medications During Pregnancy?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Antiepileptic medications are commonly used to control seizures in pregnant women with epilepsy. However, these medications come with potential risks and benefits that must be carefully considered before use during pregnancy.\n\n【23】**Potential Risks:**\n\n【24】1.  **Birth Defects:** Certain antiepileptic medications, such as Valproic Acid and Phenobarbital, have been associated with an increased risk of birth defects when taken during pregnancy.\n\n【25】2.  **Cognitive and Behavioral Issues:** Exposure to certain antiepileptic medications during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of cognitive and behavioral issues in children, including developmental delays, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\n【26】3.  **Miscarriage and Stillbirth:** Women taking antiepileptic medications during pregnancy may have an increased risk of miscarriage or stillbirth.\n\n【27】4.  **Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome:** Infants born to women who took certain antiepileptic medications during pregnancy may experience withdrawal symptoms after birth, including irritability, jitteriness, and seizures.\n\n【28】**Benefits:**\n\n【29】1.  **Seizure Control:** Antiepileptic medications are used to control seizures in women with epilepsy. Uncontrolled seizures during pregnancy can be dangerous for both the mother and the developing fetus.\n\n【30】2.  **Improved Maternal Health:** Antiepileptic medications can also improve the overall health of the mother by reducing the risk of injury during seizures and improving the quality of life.\n\n【31】3.  **Prevention of Complications:** Antiepileptic medications can also prevent complications during pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, premature labor, and fetal distress.\n\n【32】It is essential for pregnant women with epilepsy to work closely with the healthcare providers to weigh the potential risks and benefits of antiepileptic medication use during pregnancy and make informed decisions about their treatment. Women should never stop taking antiepileptic medications without first consulting with their healthcare providers.\n\n【33】What Is the Importance of Individualized Treatment Plans Based on the Patient’s Unique Medical History and Circumstances?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】The importance of individualized treatment plans based on the patient's unique medical history and circumstances in managing maternal seizure disorder during pregnancy includes the following:\n\n【35】*   Every patient's medical history and circumstances are unique, and there is no \"one size fits all\" treatment approach for managing maternal seizure disorder during pregnancy.\n\n【36】*   Factors such as the type and frequency of seizures, the patient's age and overall health, and the potential risks and benefits of different medications must all be taken into account when developing an individualized treatment plan.\n\n【37】*   An individualized treatment plan can help optimize seizure control while minimizing potential harm to the developing fetus, as the risks and benefits of different medications will vary from patient to patient.\n\n【38】*   It is important for healthcare providers to work closely with the patients to develop an individualized treatment plan that takes into account the patient's unique medical history, preferences, and values. This can help ensure that the patient receives the best possible care and achieves the best possible outcomes for herself and her developing fetus.\n\n【39】*   Regular monitoring and adjustment of the treatment plan may be necessary throughout the course of the pregnancy to ensure that both the mother and the developing fetus are as healthy as possible.\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】Managing epilepsy during pregnancy requires an individualized approach that takes into account the unique medical history and circumstances of the patient. Strategies such as regular monitoring, taking antiepileptic medications, and avoiding triggers can help minimize the risks to both the mother and the developing fetus.

B-complex Vitamins:**\n\n【8】The vitamin B complex includes eight water-soluble vitamin substances:\n\n【9】*   Thiamine (B1).\n\n【10】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Does hair fall stop immediately with the use of Proscar?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What can be the reason for gray hair in children?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Alopecia - Hair loss Treatment Through Homeopathy</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Riboflavin (B2).\n\n【11】*   Niacin (B3).\n\n【12】*   Pantothenic acid (B5).\n\n【13】*   Vitamin B6,\n\n【14】*   Biotin (B7).\n\n【15】*   Folate.\n\n【16】*   Vitamin B12 aids in cell metabolism.\n    </u>\n\n【17】The B complex vitamins (deficiency) associated with hair loss are riboflavin, biotin, folate, and vitamin B12.\n\n【18】Reduced levels of vitamin B1 (thiamin), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), niacin, and pantothenic acid can contribute to the undernourishment of hair follicle cells. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is a component of two important coenzymes: flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Riboflavin deficiency can rarely cause hair loss.\n\n【19】Can Biotin Deficiency Lead To Hair Loss?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【20】Biotin or B vitamin is one of the excellent vitamins when it comes to hair. When there is a lack of biotin, the body cannot create enough red blood cells, and since less oxygen travels through the scalp, it can lead to poor nourishment of the scalp resulting in hair loss. Biotin deficiency can be acquired or can occur due to some genetic conditions.\n\n【21】**Genetic:**\n\n【22】Biotin deficiency caused due to genetics can be either neonatal or infantile. The neonatal type is a serious condition that can be fatal is manifested during the first six weeks of life. The symptoms of neonatal biotin deficiency may include severe dermatitis and alopecia. In addition, eyebrows, eyelashes, and lanugo hair (very thin and soft hair found on newborn babies) can also be absent. The infantile form of biotin deficiency usually occurs three months after birth due to a lack of biotinidase enzyme. In the infantile form, the hair of the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes are thinly distributed or absent. This form of biotin deficiency is an inherited condition and can be treated.\n\n【23】**Acquired:**\n\n【24】Avidin, a protein present in the egg white, can bind strongly to the biotin. Acquired biotin deficiency can be due to increased raw egg consumption, where avidin particles attach to biotin and inhibit its absorption into the intestinal gut. Egg whites contain high levels of avidin, but when cooked, avidin is partially denatured, and binding to biotin is reduced. However, in one study, it has been shown that 30% - 40% of the avidin activity was still present in the egg white even after frying or boiling. Other causes of acquired biotin deficiency include malabsorption, alcoholism, pregnancy, prolonged use of antibiotics that interrupt normal flora, and medications such as Valproic acid and Isotretinoin intake. The medicines mentioned above interfere with biotinidase activity. Evidence suggests that 50 % of pregnant women are deficient in biotin.\n\n【25】**Signs and Symptoms of Biotin Deficiency:**\n\n【26】The signs of biotin deficiency include:\n\n【27】*   Hair loss.\n\n【28】*   Skin rashes.\n\n【29】*   Brittle nails.\n\n【30】The efficacy of biotin in supplements for hair, skin, and nails as a remedy for these conditions has not been proved through large-scale studies. But only through case reports has it been used to justify the use of biotin supplements for hair growth. The daily use of 3 to 5 mg of biotin supplements in children with uncombable hair syndrome (dry and frizzy hair that cannot be adequately combed) has been reported to improve hair health after 3 to 4 months.\n\n【31】**3\\. Folic Acid:**\n\n【32】Folic acid is responsible for healthy cell growth. A decrease in folic acid may decrease hair follicle cell division and growth. One of the signs of folic acid deficiency is graying of hair. Therefore, folic acid can reduce hair fall and premature graying of hair. A recommended daily dose is 1000 mcg per day.\n\n【33】**4\\. Vitamin C:**\n\n【34】Vitamin C can promote hair growth and repair an unhealthy scalp. One of the major functions of vitamin C is to help produce and maintain healthy collagen. It is a type of connective tissue found within the hair follicle. Vitamin C acts as a strong antioxidant and protects cells found in hair follicles. A daily dose of 200 mg is recommended for hair and skin.\n\n【35】**5\\. Vitamin E:**\n\n【36】It helps maintain the integrity of hair follicles' cell membranes, provides physical stability to cell membranes, and acts as an antioxidant. A daily dose of 50 to 400 IU is recommended for hair and skin.\n\n【37】Minerals:\n---------\n\n【38】**Iron -** Iron deficiency symptoms include brittle hair and hair loss.\n\n【39】**Zinc -** Zinc is essential for DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) production, which leads to normal follicle cell division. It is also useful in the removal of free radicals.\n\n【40】**Copper -** Copper deficiency can lead to baldness, and the recommended dose is 1 mg.\n\n【41】Proteins:\n---------\n\n【42】Protein is necessary for the growth of all cells, including hair cells. L-Methionine is a sulfur-containing amino acid. It supports hair strength by providing an adequate amount of sulfur to hair cells, essential for hair's normal growth and appearance. A good source of protein for hair growth is fish, shellfish, and other marine proteins that contain essential fatty acids (EFAs) and vitamin B3 (niacin).\n\n【43】Do Too Many Vitamins Cause Hair Loss?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【44】Vitamins and nutritional supplements, when taken more than the daily recommended dosage can also cause hair loss. For example, excessive selenium can cause hair loss with hair brittleness, and taking too much vitamin A can cause hair loss, vomiting, and blurred vision. In addition, when you intake too much vitamin A, your body may develop a condition called hypervitaminosis A. Therefore, it is essential to avoid taking too many vitamins, leading to various health problems.\n\n【45】**Conclusion:**\n\n【46】The recommended daily allowances of these vitamins can be acquired by eating a balanced diet, but the biotin is the only B vitamin produced by the body. In healthy people, a biotin supplement is not required. The solution is to increase the intake of vitamins, minerals, and proteins. But it is also important that you do not intake these vitamins and nutrients above the recommended dosage.\n\n【47】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【48】* * *\n\n【49】#### **1.**删除换行**How Much Biotin in Milligrams Should I Take To Prevent Hair Loss?**\n\n【50】The Institute of Medicine's most recent recommendations for biotin say that an adult's daily average intake (AI) should be 30 g/day. Most healthy people may fulfill this need by eating a well-balanced diet, but many still need to supplement their diets with up to 1000 mg of biotin daily.\n\n【51】#### **2.**删除换行**If You Have Hair Loss, What Vitamins Are You Lacking?**\n\n【52】Only vitamin B12, biotin, riboflavin, and folate deficits have been linked to hair loss. Your hair follicles may be less effective at producing new hair when your vitamin B12 levels are low, leading to hair loss.\n\n【53】#### **3.**删除换行**What Supplements Can I Take to Grow My Hair Back?**\n\n【54】The following supplements can help in hair regrowth:  \n\\- Vitamin B, D, E, A, and C.  \n\\- Zinc.  \n\\- Biotin.  \n\\- Iron.  \n\\- Keratin.\n\n【55】#### **4.**删除换行**Which Is More Effective for Thinning Hair, Collagen or Biotin?**\n\n【56】Collagen and biotin are essential in maintaining your body in shape because they are both proteins and vitamins. They may also aid in accelerating hair growth. Scientific research suggests that collagen has a stronger case for enhancing hair health.\n\n【57】#### **5.**删除换行**Can Hair Regrow Once It Thins?**\n\n【58】Depending on what reasons caused the hair to thin in the first place, thinning hair may regrow. Regrowth of hair may be experienced by people whose hair is thinning because of vitamin deficiencies, stress, pregnancy, or other non-genetic causes. Therefore, one must see their doctor if they notice any new hair loss or thinning.\n\n【59】#### **6.**删除换行**What Dosage of Zinc Is Recommended for Hair Loss?**\n\n【60】The recommended daily dietary allowances for zinc are 11 mg and 8 mg for adult males and females, respectively. The tolerable amount or upper intake level (UL) for zinc in adults (19 years of age and older) is 40 mg daily.\n\n【61】#### **7.**删除换行**Does Excessive Biotin Use Result in Hair Loss?**\n\n【62】Occasionally, telogen effluvium, a transient disorder caused by high ingestion of specific nutrients, can result in hair loss. The effects of excessive vitamin B7, known as biotin toxicity, are still unknown.\n\n【63】#### **8.**删除换行**Does Biotin Affect Your Thyroid Function?**\n\n【64】A common ingredient in multivitamin products, biotin has been observed to interact with immunoassays at high doses, leading to incorrect thyroid function tests. The usage of biotin can lead to artificially high T4 and T3 levels and falsely low TSH values, which can lead to a mistaken diagnosis of hyperthyroidism or a misleading conclusion that the thyroid hormone dose is too high.\n\n【65】#### **9.**删除换行**What Prevents Female Hair Thinning?**\n\n【66】The following measures can help prevent female hair thinning:  \n\\- Eating a healthy, nutritious diet.  \n\\- Minoxidil.  \n\\- Low-level light therapy.  \n\\- Ketoconazole.  \n\\- Corticosteroids.  \n\\- Platelet-rich plasma.  \n\\- Hormone therapy.  \n\\- Hair transplant.  \n\\- Shampoos that are made especially for hair loss treatment.  \n\\- Scalp massage.\n\n【67】#### **10.**删除换行**Does Magnesium Aid in Preventing Hair Loss?**\n\n【68】Magnesium helps to promote healthy hair development by encouraging the growth of hair follicles. In addition, most professionals concur that magnesium is nature's anti-stress mineral, a significant factor in hair loss.\n\n【69】#### **11.**删除换行**Which Foods Are Beneficial for Thickening Hair?**\n\n【70】Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids promote healthy hair and growth. Examples include:  \n\\- Fatty fish, such as mackerel, salmon, and tuna.  \n\\- Canola oil, chia seeds, and flaxseeds.  \n\\- Walnuts.  \n\\- Tofu, cruciferous vegetables, and soybeans.  \n\\- Vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts).\n\n【71】#### **12.**删除换行**Will I Gain Weight if I Take Biotin?**\n\n【72】No, no proof exists that taking biotin pills can make you gain weight. However, biotin is occasionally promoted as a vitamin for weight loss.\n\n【73】#### **13.**删除换行**Which Natural Hair Loss Treatment Works the Best?**\n\n【74】Some of the home remedies that promote hair growth and decrease hair loss are as follows:  \n\\- Aloe vera.  \n\\- Fenugreek seeds.  \n\\- Coconut milk.  \n\\- Amla (Indian gooseberry).  \n\\- Beetroot juice.  \n\\- Onion juice.\n\n【75】#### **14.**删除换行**Which Protein Benefits Hair the Most?**\n\n【76】Biotin pills are frequently advertised for hair growth since they are necessary for synthesizing the protein keratin, which is found in hair. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that supplementing with additional biotin helps promote hair growth in those deficient in it.\n\n【77】#### **15.**删除换行**What Should Not Be Consumed With Biotin?**\n\n【78】Although there is no proof that any medication interacts with biotin, some medicines have the potential to lower biotin levels.

However, even after taking numerous precautions and protocols to prevent infection, any surgery that causes skin rupture is thus directed to a disease. These infections are known as surgical site infections because they occur on the part of the body where the surgery is done. In surgery, the possibility of developing a surgical site infection is about one percent to three percent.\n\n【2】Surgical site infections are induced by bacteria entering the body through the incisions produced during surgery. They endanger millions of patients' lives every year and lead to the spread of antibiotic resistance. Eleven percent of patients undergoing surgery in low and middle-income countries are infected. In Africa, up to twenty percent of women who have a cesarean section contract a wound infection, compromising their health and capacity to watch for their babies.\n\n【3】What Are the Types of Surgical Site Infections?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【4】A surgical site infection is a type of infection occurring within thirty days following surgery. There are three types of surgical site infections:\n\n【5】*   **Superficial Incisional Surgical Site Infections:** This type of infection appears on the skin site where the incision was created.\n\n【6】*   **Deep Incisional Surgical Site Infections:** This type of infection appears under the incision area in the muscle and the tissues enclosing the muscles.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Will antibiotics affect the sputum report?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Will antibiotics reduce the effect of OCP?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Abdominal Wall Reconstruction Surgery - An Overview</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   **Organ or Space Surgical Site Infections:** This type of infection can be in any area of the body different than the skin, muscle, and surrounding tissue involved in the surgery. This includes an organ or a space between organs.\n    </u>\n\n【8】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Surgical Site Infections?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Surgical site infection symptoms include redness, delayed healing, fever, pain, tenderness, warmth, or swelling.\n\n【10】In addition, there are indications and symptoms for specific types of surgical site infection:\n\n【11】*   Superficial incisional surgical site infections may create pus from the location of the wound. The pus samples may be cultivated in a culture to find the varieties of germs that induce the infection.\n\n【12】*   Deep incisional surgical site infections create pus. The region of the wound is unobstructed, or a surgeon will open it again and discover the pus in the wound.\n\n【13】*   An organ or space surgical site infection may indicate a discharge of pus from a drain positioned through the skin into a body space or organ. A collection of pus is known as an abscess; it is an encircled space of pus and disintegrating tissue wrapped by inflammation. An abscess may be noticed when the surgeon reopens the wound or by special X-ray studies.\n\n【14】What Are the Causes of Surgical Site Infections?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The most common cause of surgical site infections includes the bacteria Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas. Bacteria can infect a surgical wound through various forms of communication, such as from the touch of a contaminated caregiver or through a surgical instrument, through germs in the atmosphere, or through germs that are already on or in the body and then spread into the wound.\n\n【16】These other risk factors for surgical site infections are the duration of surgery exceeding two hours, a patient having different medical history or diseases, older age, overweight or obese patient, smoking, cancer patient, a weak immune system, diabetes, abdominal pain surgery, having emergency surgery. In addition, the risk of surgical site infections depends upon the type of wound.\n\n【17】These wounds can be classified as:\n\n【18】*   **Clean Wounds:** This type of wound is not inflamed or infected and does not affect operating on an internal organ. These types are elective, not an emergency, and nontraumatic; wounds in this type are primarily closed, with no acute inflammation, and respiratory, gastrointestinal, biliary, and genitourinary tracts are not entered.\n\n【19】*   **Clean-Contaminated Wounds:** These wounds, too, have no proof of infection at the time of surgery, but this wound involves operating on an internal organ. The urgent case that is otherwise clean; is the elective opening of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, biliary, or genitourinary tract with minimal spillage, not overlooking infected urine or bile.\n\n【20】*   **Contaminated Wounds:** These wounds involve operating on an internal organ with a spilling of contents into the wound from the organ. These are non-purulent inflammation, and there is spillage from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, there is entry into the biliary or genitourinary tract in the presence of infected bile or urine. Penetrating trauma more than four hours old and chronic open wounds to be wrapped.\n\n【21】*   **Dirty Wounds:** These wounds have a known infection present during the surgery. They are purulent inflammation like an abscess, perforation of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, biliary, or genitourinary tract preoperatively, or penetrating trauma more than four hours old.\n\n【22】What Are the Treatment for Surgical Site Infections?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】In most cases, antibiotics are used to treat the infection, and in some instances, surgical treatment is done to treat infections.\n\n【24】**Antibiotic Prophylaxis-**\n\n【25】*   Prophylactic antibiotics should be efficacious against microorganisms predicted to induce infection. In addition, they should acquire adequate local tissue levels, cause minimal side effects, should be relatively inexpensive, and not be possible to choose contagious living things. The presence of microorganisms its quantity in the wound and the hospital atmosphere has an impact on the selection of antibiotics; the range targets the microorganisms understood to induce infection postoperatively. Generally, a first-generation Cephalosporin satisfies these measures and is considered sufficient prophylaxis for most treatments.\n*   A commonly administered drug is Cefazolin. For treatment of the alimentary tract, genitourinary tract, and hepatobiliary system, coverage should be further affected by gram-negative and anaerobic microorganisms. In some cases, Cefotetan or Cefoxitin is the right agent.\n\n【26】*   For patients allergic to Cephalosporins, Vancomycin is an alternative for coverage of Staphylococcus. Aztreonam can be united with Clindamycin but not with Metronidazole. A quinolone, such as Ciprofloxacin, may be effective for the coverage of gram-negative organisms.\n*   Timing of administration is crucial. The drug should be administered within thirty minutes and within two hours of the time of incision. The foremost dose is delivered before the skin incision is executed.\n\n【27】*   For more prolonged treatment procedures, drug administration is indicated at intervals of one or two times the drug's half-life. For example, they might be giving the same dose. This guarantees satisfactory tissue levels throughout the procedure. The period of a satisfactory tissue level of the antibiotic need not overextend the operative period. The administration period is advanced only in conditions such as gross contamination secondary to a ruptured viscus or severe trauma.\n*   The administration of antibiotics time varies for each patient but generally for at least one week.\n\n【28】**Invasive Surgical Treatment-**\n\n【29】*   In some cases, the surgeon needs to do a surgical procedure to clean the wound; the procedure includes-They will open the wound by releasing the sutures, then doing tests of the pus to rule out if there is an infection and decide the type of antibiotics. Next, the eviction of infected tissue is done. Then irrigate the wound with salt water. They were followed by drainage of the pocket of pus. Finally, pack the wound with saline-soaked dressings.\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】Antibiotic administration decreases the occurrence of infection. Precaution is proposed in all clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty techniques. Timing of antibiotic administration is crucial for effectiveness. The first dose should always be delivered before the procedure, preferably within thirty minutes before the incision. Re-administration at one to two half-lives of the antibiotic is suggested for the period of the process. In general, postoperative administration is not advised. Antibiotic selection is affected by the organism most commonly causing wound infection in the specific procedure.\n\n【32】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【33】* * *\n\n【34】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the Best Antibiotic for Surgical Wound Infection?**\n\n【35】Cefazolin or vancomycin in addition to metronidazole is considered best for surgical wound infections.\n\n【36】#### **2.**删除换行**What to Do if a Surgical Wound Is Infected?**\n\n【37】The wound should be re-opened by removing sutures.

Likewise, ECT-Electroconvulsive Therapy (formerly known as electroshock therapy) can be termed as the holy grail in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Unfortunately, there are a number of myths about the dangers of ECT. These beliefs have no scientific basis, and it is about time that these myths are busted. Bad press and movies were equally responsible for bringing this time-tested treatment into disrepute. The general public and the medical fraternity are largely ignorant about the procedure and its manifold benefits.\n\n【2】An Italian neuropsychiatrist Ugo Cerletti along with Lucio Bini, developed the ECT in 1938 to treat a patient with schizophrenia, hallucinations, and delusions. ECT delivered electrically induced generalized seizures or brief recurrent shocks while chemically (Metrazol) induced convulsions were being employed before ECT was developed to treat schizophrenia. However, ECT came with a drawback that the duration of seizures could not be controlled, and the treatment could not be individualized.\n\n【3】What Are the Types of Electroconvulsive Therapy?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】**Unmodified or Direct ECT:**\n\n【5】*   In unmodified or direct ECT, no anesthesia or muscle relaxants are used before the procedure, and shock therapy is carried out while the person is awake.\n\n【6】*   This increases the risk of teeth and bone fracture, muscle damage, etc. due to the knocked out effect of the delivered electricity.\n\n【7】*   This was termed ''barbaric'' by liberal thinkers and human rights activists.\n\n【8】*   The Mental Health Care Act Bill, 2013 prohibits the usage of unmodified ECT.\n\n【9】**Modified ECT:**\n\n【10】*   In modified ECT, anesthesia is first administered, followed by the usage of muscle relaxant.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Depression - Awareness, Self-Diagnosis, and Treatment Modalities</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Brain Stimulation Techniques in Psychiatry</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Suffering from schizophrenia.Doubt regarding Sulpitac dosage.</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Only then is the electrical stimulus applied, which produces convulsions.\n\n【12】*   This way, the patient is immune to the pain of the electrical stimulus, and more importantly, is not aware of the seizure episode.\n\n【13】*   Administration of an electrical stimulus, along with central seizures, will also cause peripheral seizures, which may result in musculoskeletal injuries.\n\n【14】*   To prevent this, a muscle relaxant is used. But these muscle relaxants temporarily affect respiration.\n\n【15】*   To overcome this problem, anesthesia is administered prior to the injection of the muscle relaxant, which puts the patient to sleep.\n    </u>\n\n【16】Modern-day ECT suites are equipped with fancy equipment and fancier monitoring systems. All of these serve to minimize the risk to the patients. The components of an ECT suite include a sphygmomanometer to measure the blood pressure, a pulse oximeter to monitor the oxygen saturation levels, a central laminar airflow system, a cardiac defibrillator (if cardiac asystole occurs), an electroencephalogram (EEG), emergency medications, anesthetists, and psychiatrists.\n\n【17】How Does Electroconvulsive Therapy Work?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【18】**Mechanism of Action of ECT:**\n\n【19】*   What is surprising is that, given the tremendous efficacy of the ECT, to date, there has been no discovery on its exact mechanism of action. This may be one of the reasons for the stigma attached to it.\n\n【20】*   Proposed mechanisms by which ECTs are believed to work include modulation of the brain structure, function, and neural connectivity.\n\n【21】*   ECT also targets the neurotransmitters like monoamines and helps in stabilizing their concentrations.\n\n【22】*   Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction is frequently seen in depression. This results in an increased concentration of the steroid hormone cortisol. ECT has been shown to reverse this HPA axis dysfunction and thereby suppress the cortisol levels, which coincides with marked improvement in depressive symptomatology.\n\n【23】*   Then there is evidence to show that ECT modulates gene expression, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. To put it simply, the mechanism of action varies according to the illness, or rather the actions of ECT are multimodal in nature.\n\n【24】What Conditions Can Electroconvulsive Therapy Treat?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】ECTs are extensively indicated in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as,\n\n【26】*   Severe and agitated depression along with psychotic symptoms.\n\n【27】*   For rapid amelioration of the positive symptoms in schizophrenia.\n\n【28】*   Catatonia.\n\n【29】*   Patients with psychomotor retardation.\n\n【30】*   Uncooperative patients with psychotic symptoms.\n\n【31】*   Bipolar disorder with severe depressed phases or mania.\n\n【32】*   Severe aggression.\n\n【33】*   Parkinsonism.\n\n【34】*   Delirium that is resistant to medications and other treatment strategies.\n\n【35】*   People with schizophrenia resistant to treatment.\n\n【36】*   Bipolar disorders resistant to treatment, and possibly PTSD (Post-traumatic stress disorder).\n\n【37】ECT can be lifesaving in the aforementioned clinical conditions. A patient harboring severe suicidal ideations can be saved by this simple and cost-effective procedure.\n\n【38】What Are the Temporary Deficits Caused By Electroconvulsive Therapy?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】ECTs can cause temporary deficits, and certain conditions are discussed below.\n\n【40】*   Clinicians must take the responsibility to ease the fear amongst the general public about the supposed dangers of ECT. A vast majority of patients (and surprisingly some doctors too) believe that ECT can cause permanent ''brain damage'', which is an idea that is very far-fetched from reality.\n\n【41】*   Sure, ECT does cause temporary memory loss in the form of retrograde amnesia, which resolves by itself. However, retrograde amnesia is not seen in all the patients, but only a proportion of the patients undergoing ECT.\n\n【42】*   The more common cognitive deficits like impaired orientation, disturbances in the autobiographical memory, executive dysfunction disappear within 15 days of the treatment.\n\n【43】*   These temporary deficits can be further minimized by spacing out the treatments appropriately. Studies have shown that cognitive deficits are significantly lower for unilateral, twice weekly, low dose ECT as compared to bilateral, thrice weekly, high dose ECT. A baseline bedside clinical assessment of the cognitive functions prior to the administration of ECT is mandatory.\n\n【44】Hence, it is efficacious in a wide variety of disorders, ranging from depression to schizophrenia. The repertoire of the actions of ECT is mind-boggling by itself.\n\n【45】**Conclusion:**\n\n【46】Progress in the field of anesthesia has made the procedure all the safer. The benefits outweigh the risks by a huge margin. ECT produces a prompt treatment response that other treatment modalities hardly can. In conditions with rapid amelioration of symptoms, ECT is preferred. No doubt why ECT is considered the ''gold standard'' treatment in psychiatry.\n\n【47】Consult a psychiatrist online to know the benefits of Electroconvulsive Therapy --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/psychiatrist\n\n【48】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【49】* * *\n\n【50】#### **1.**删除换行**What Does an Electroconvulsive Therapy Do to the Brain?**\n\n【51】ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) involves passing small amounts of current to the brain under general anesthesia. It is also referred to as the brain reset. This can alter the state of the brain that controls mood, sleep, and other essential functions.\n\n【52】#### **2.**删除换行**Does an ECT Cause Damage to the Brain?**\n\n【53】The ECT may cause damage to the brain. This is because the ECT brings about specific changes in the brain and its functioning. But there are not many instances where an ECT has caused damage to the structure of the brain.\n\n【54】#### **3.**删除换行**Does ECT Have Any Side Effects?**\n\n【55】Yes, an ECT has its side effects. This treatment can cause memory loss, cardiovascular complications, and death. It can even impair the intellectual abilities of a person. In some patients, memory loss could even be permanent.\n\n【56】#### **4.**删除换行**What Does Electroconvulsive Therapy Do to the Brain?**\n\n【57】Electroconvulsive therapy is a procedure undertaken in certain medical conditions. This procedure passes a small amount of current through the brain. This procedure is carried out under general anesthesia. This can bring changes to various functions of the brain.\n\n【58】#### **5.**删除换行**Why Is ECT Treatment Known as Reset to the Brain?**\n\n【59】ECT treatment is known as reset to the brain. It provides much relief in conditions such as depression and psychosis. ECT helps in rebooting the visual memory and alters perceptions. This kind of reset is quite beneficial in patients with chronic depression.\n\n【60】#### **6.**删除换行**Does ECT Cause Memory Loss?**\n\n【61】Yes, ECT can cause memory loss. The memory loss caused by ECT treatment can be temporary or permanent. Temporary memory loss can be termed retrograde amnesia. Permanent memory loss is usually one event that happens just before the procedure.\n\n【62】#### **7.**删除换行**When Is the ECT Not Recommended?**\n\n【63】The ECT is not recommended in children under the age of 12. It is also not advisable in patients with cardiac devices such as pacemakers. In addition, this therapy, in general, is not recommended in cardiac patients and patients with other neuromuscular disorders.\n\n【64】#### **8.**删除换行**Is ECT More Effective Than Antidepressants?**\n\n【65】Yes, ECT is more effective than antidepressants in general. This is because ECT acts much more quickly when compared to medications. Therefore, it is much more effective in patients who need immediate attention, such as the ones with suicidal tendencies.\n\n【66】#### **9.**删除换行**Can ECT Make Things Worse?**\n\n【67】Yes, ECT can make things worse at times. This is because the therapy is known to flood the brain with various neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters are known to cause conditions such as depression and schizophrenia. So, in general, some patients experience discomfort after this therapy.\n\n【68】#### **10.**删除换行**Can There Be a Relapse of Depression After ECT?**\n\n【69】Yes, there can be a relapse of depression even after successful ECT. There is a relapse rate of 84 %. Hence it is advisable to obtain appropriate medical care even after the ECT to prevent relapse.\n\n【70】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【71】无关删除-1:<u>*   What is ECT?  \n    https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/ect\n*   Electroconvulsive Therapy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538266/\n*   Frequently Asked Questions about ECT  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/psychiatry/specialty\\_areas/brain\\_stimulation/ect/faq\\_ect.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

A smooth muscle antibody is a type of antibody that is known as an autoantibody. The role of autoantibody is to mistakenly attack the body's own cells and tissues. Smooth muscle antibodies target the smooth muscle tissues in the liver and other body parts. The primary role of smooth muscle is contraction. Blood is drawn from the patient for this test.\n\n【2】Every antibody is unique and is used to defend against only one type of antigen. However, sometimes the body mistakenly generates autoantibodies (antibodies that attack the body's healthy cells). If the body starts behaving this way, the affected individual may develop an autoimmune disorder.\n\n【3】Normally, the immune system detects infectious substances called antigens that may be harmful to the body. These antigens are covered with viruses and bacteria. The immune system after recognizing the foreign agent synthesizes a protein called an antibody to attack it.\n\n【4】Therefore, an anti-muscle antibody test detects the autoantibody that attacks smooth muscle. Anti-smooth muscle antibodies are primarily found in the blood in autoimmune liver diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis.\n\n【5】What Is Autoimmune Hepatitis?\n-----------------------------\n\n【6】Autoimmune hepatitis is a disorder where the immune system produces smooth muscle autoantibodies attacking the liver tissues. There are two types of autoimmune hepatitis:\n\n【7】*   Type 1 is the most common type of autoimmune hepatitis. Type 1 is predominantly found in women rather than men. It is also frequently present in people who are suffering from another autoimmune disorder.\n\n【8】*   Type 2 is a less common type of disease. This form mostly affects girls that fall in the age group of two to fourteen years.\n\n【9】Suppose the person suffers from persistent chronic liver disease. In that case, the healthcare professional will advise a smooth muscle antibody test to help identify whether the person is suffering from active autoimmune hepatitis disease. Most hepatitis diseases worldwide are affected by viruses. Autoimmune hepatitis is an exceptional liver disease where the body's immune system attacks the host’s liver cells. Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic liver condition that is characterized by liver cirrhosis or scarring and liver failure in advanced cases. The signs and symptoms include:\n\n【10】*   Enlarged liver (hepatomegaly).\n\n【11】*   Abdominal swelling.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Is my ANA titer high due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Goiter - Types, Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What is the reason for my weight loss?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Liver tenderness.\n\n【13】*   Dark-colored urine.\n\n【14】*   Pale-colored stools.\n\n【15】*   Jaundice (yellowish discoloration of skin and eyes).\n    </u>\n\n【16】*   Burning or itching.\n\n【17】*   Tiredness.\n\n【18】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【19】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【20】*   Pain in the joints.\n\n【21】*   Discomfort in the abdomen.\n\n【22】*   Skin rash.\n\n【23】Autoimmune hepatitis is usually managed with medications that suppress the host’s immune system. When the disorder is diagnosed early, treatment is found to be more effective. Without treatment, autoimmune hepatitis poses serious health problems such as liver destruction, cirrhosis, and liver failure.\n\n【24】What Are the Other Names of Smooth Muscle Antibody?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Other names include:\n\n【26】*   Anti-smooth muscle antibody.\n\n【27】*   Actin antibody.\n\n【28】What Is Smooth Muscle Antibody Used For?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【29】A smooth muscle antibody test is particularly used to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis. It is also used to identify if the disorder is type 1 or 2. Smooth muscle antibody tests are often used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests to rule out a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. The other tests include:\n\n【30】*   **F-Actin Antibodies Test-** F-actin is a protein present in the smooth muscles of the liver tissues and other body parts. F-actin antibodies attack the healthy liver tissues.\n\n【31】*   **Antinuclear Antibody Test-** These antibodies attack certain healthy cells' nuclei.\n\n【32】*   **Alanine Transaminase and Aspartate Aminotransferase Tests-** Both these enzymes are synthesized by the liver.\n\n【33】When Does One Need a Smooth Muscle Antibody Test?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】One may require this test if either they or their child suffers from autoimmune hepatitis. The symptoms include:\n\n【35】*   Extreme tiredness.\n\n【36】*   Jaundice.\n\n【37】*   Abdominal pain and discomfort.\n\n【38】*   Joint and muscle pain.\n\n【39】*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【40】*   Unexplained weight loss.\n\n【41】*   Loss of appetite.\n\n【42】*   Urine is dark in color.\n\n【43】What Happens During a Smooth Muscle Antibody Test?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】A health care professional will obtain a blood sample from a vein in the patient’s arm using a small needle. After the needle is pricked, a small amount of blood will be drawn into a test tube or vial. The patient may feel slightly stung when the needle moves in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n【45】Does One Need to Do Anything to Prepare for a Smooth Muscle Antibody Test?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】One do not require any special preparations for a smooth muscle antibody test.\n\n【47】What Are the Risks to a Smooth Muscle Antibody Test?\n\n【48】There is a very slight risk of having a blood test. The patient may have slight pain or bruising at the needle's location, but most symptoms disappear quickly.\n\n【49】**What Do the Results Indicate?**\n\n【50】If the results show high smooth muscle antibodies, it probably indicates that the affected individual has the type 1 form of autoimmune hepatitis. A lower amount of smooth muscle antibodies suggests that the patient has a type 2 form of the disease. If no smooth muscle antibodies were found, it indicates that the liver symptoms are being caused by some other disease than autoimmune hepatitis. Your doctor will order more tests to reach a diagnosis.\n\n【51】Is There Anything Else One Needs to Know About a Smooth Muscle Antibody Test?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】If the test results show that a person or a child has smooth muscle antibodies, the healthcare provider may suggest a liver biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. A liver biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of lesional liver tissue for histopathological testing.\n\n【53】**Conclusion**\n\n【54】Anti-smooth muscle antibody is a diagnostic blood test that is used to detect the presence of autoantibodies directed against smooth muscle. An autoantibody is a type of antibody that attacks the defence system of the body by mistake. Body’s own cells and tissues are attacked by the smooth muscle autoantibody. This smooth muscle antibody test is useful to confirm a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. The blood sample is usually collected from the arm or the back of the hand. There are generally no risks attached to this test.\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>*   Anti-smooth muscle antibody  \n    https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/anti-smooth-muscle-antibody\n*   Smooth Muscle Antibody (SMA) Test  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/smooth-muscle-antibody-sma-test/\n*   Anti-smooth muscle antibody  \n    https://www.ucsfhealth.org/medical-tests/anti-smooth-muscle-antibody</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Nevertheless, neonatal morbidity and mortality have been noticeably reduced due to pediatricians' application of their knowledge of the newborn's fundamental needs. Less immediately apparent among an infant's basic needs are those for gentle physical contact, pleasant and varied human voice sounds, antigravity play, visual stimulation from the human environment, and more subtle interpersonal communication. In short, an infant needs all of the things that a caring mother would typically provide.\n\n【2】What Is the Origin of Maternal Deprivation Syndrome?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The term maternal deprivation first appeared in the early writings of psychoanalyst John Bowlby on the effects of severing a child's mother from them. He believed that an infant's first three years of life were crucial for developing the caregiver-child bond. He referred to this as the critical period for attachment.\n\n【4】Based on Bowlby's theories, attachment is necessary for survival, and it is the prototype for future relationships. If the attachment relationship is problematic, the developmental difficulty is predicted, and can cause general developmental issues and social development problems.\n\n【5】What Is Maternal Deprivation Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【6】The inability of a child to form an attachment during the first five years of life is known as maternal deprivation, and it can have detrimental psychological effects, especially as adults. Deprivation results when a child never has the chance to form any kind of bond. It is a failure to thrive that affects infants and young children and is characterized by a lack of environmental responsiveness and frequent depression. It typically goes hand in hand with maternal loss, absence, or neglect.\n\n【7】Ineffective caregiver interactions, poverty, child abuse, and parents lack of knowledge about child care account for about two-thirds of the causes. Even though the mother and other primary caregivers may appear worried, the normal physical interaction between mother and child is either missing or distorted.\n\n【8】What Causes Maternal Deprivation Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Most infant and young child cases of failure to thrive (under two years old) are not brought on by the illness. Most cases are brought on by poor living conditions, child abuse, dysfunctional caregiver interactions, and parents unaware of proper child care. Such failures to thrive are referred to as non-organic. Failure to gain sufficient weight, failure of linear growth and failure to meet some or all developmental milestones are all considered indicators of underdevelopment in children under the age of two.\n\n【10】Maternal deprivation syndrome can occur when:\n\n【11】*   A child who lives in an institution has little contact with a mother figure and no significant substitute mother.\n\n【12】*   The infant receives insufficient care from their mother or a permanent replacement mother, and they interact with them insufficiently.\n\n【13】*   A mother figure is present and prepared to provide adequate care, but the child cannot interact with her. This inability is caused by a history of severing relationships with mother figures.\n\n【14】While the mother or other primary caregiver may appear worried in cases of maternal deprivation syndrome, the interaction and physical contact between mother and child may be missing or altered.\n\n【15】Maternal deprivation syndrome may be caused by several factors, including;\n\n【16】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【17】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-3:<u>Can ALS lead to burning sensations in the back and feet with muscle twitches throughout the body?</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-3:<u>Can muscle twitching affect eye and electromyography to rule out amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?</u>\n\n【20】Os Odontoideum - Causes, Development, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【21】*   The parent is a young adult (teenage parent).\n\n【22】*   Unintended or undesirable pregnancy.\n\n【23】*   Lower educational levels (especially failure to complete high school).\n\n【24】*   Poor socioeconomic status.\n\n【25】*   Absence of the father.\n\n【26】*   Absence of a support network (family, close friends, or other support).\n\n【27】*   Severe postpartum depression, among other mental illnesses.\n\n【28】*   The child's gender is not what the parent wanted or expected.\n\n【29】*   Low birth weight.\n\n【30】*   Congenital disorder.\n\n【31】*   Infants not breastfed.\n\n【32】*   Chronically ill babies.\n\n【33】*   Children with cerebral palsy or other neurocognitive problems.\n\n【34】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Maternal Deprivation Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】Phases of response to separation or deprivation:\n\n【36】*   **Protest:** Crying and severe distress at the loss of the mother, along with the child's feeble attempts to replace her\n\n【37】*   **Despair:** Rowing helplessness; withdrawal; and waning attempts to reclaim mother.\n\n【38】*   **Detachment:** In this situation, the kid settles down and takes care of whatever stand-in adult is available.\n\n【39】Signs and symptoms of maternal deprivation syndrome include:\n\n【40】*   Reduced or absent linear growth (falling off the growth chart).\n\n【41】*   A lack of proper hygiene.\n\n【42】*   Interaction between mother and child that ranges from subtle to obvious abnormality.\n\n【43】*   Having a weight below the 5th percentile or gaining too much weight.\n\n【44】*   Inappropriate clothing.\n\n【45】*   An unusual or overly restricted diet.\n\n【46】*   General lack of care.\n\n【47】Emotional effects of maternal deprivation syndrome:\n\n【48】It takes a certain level of maturity and conscious cerebral functioning to cause this syndrome.

To rule out serious medical conditions as the cause, a physical examination, medical history, and easy laboratory tests can be used. The doctor will carefully inspect the patient's growth chart. The doctor needs to contact family members and social service organizations to assist the mother. The child might need to stay in the hospital if the doctor worries about their safety or if the treatment has not worked.\n\n【65】How Is Maternal Deprivation Syndrome Treated?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【66】*   Failure to thrive treatment is a significant undertaking that calls for the involvement of a multidisciplinary team, including doctors, nutritionists, social workers, behavioral specialists, and visiting nurses.\n\n【67】*   For new parents, single parents, and parents with other issues. As soon as possible, referrals should be made to the right programs.\n\n【68】*   More support will be given to the mother and child if extended family members are assisted in realizing a problem and getting involved.\n\n【69】**Conclusion**\n\n【70】Maternal deprivation syndrome includes the loss of emotional support and a sense of well-being that is typically transmitted from mother to child and is not just limited to physical maternal loss. The condition must be recognised and prompt intervention must be impleted. Healthcare professionals, extended family members and social workers must support the child and help in its wellbeing. Full recovery can be anticipated with prompt, appropriate attention and care.\n\n【71】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【72】* * *\n\n【73】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the Reaction to Maternal Deprivation?**\n\n【74】The reaction to maternal deprivation is as follows:  \n\\- Attachment Problems: The child may face difficulties in building trust and intimacy.   \n\\- Emotional Issues: The child with a lack of maternal care may have emotional issues such as anxiety and depression.  \n\\- Social Issues: The child with a lack of maternal care may be socially isolated and maintain friendships.   \n\\- Behavioral Issues: The child may be aggressive and hyperactive.  \n\\- Physical Health Issues: A mother's care maintains the child's physical health. A lack of mother care can result in a weakened immune system of the child.\n\n【75】#### **2.**删除换行**How Does Maternal Deprivation Influence Children?**\n\n【76】Maternal deprivation affects children physically and mentally. The children may suffer from emotional problems such as anxiety, stress, and depression. The behavior of these children is hyperactive and aggressive in nature. Children with the condition may have a weakened immune system. \n\n【77】#### **3.**删除换行**Who Discovered the Term Maternal Deprivation?**\n\n【78】John Bowlby, a well-known psychologist, and psychoanalyst, introduced maternal deprivation. The British researcher developed the theory, which was focused on the mother-child bond. In 1950, the researcher did research on the separation effect between the mother and the infant and introduced maternal deprivation. \n\n【79】#### **4.**删除换行**How Can Maternal Deprivation Be Avoided?**\n\n【80】Maternal deprivation is avoided by following methods:  \n\\- Parent education about child development.  \n\\- Leave should be offered to working mothers so that they can balance their professional and personal responsibilities.  \n\\- Friends, family members, and community people should emotionally support the mother and reduce the strain.  \n\\- Counseling can help mothers in reducing anxiety, depression, and stress.\n\n【81】#### **5.**删除换行**What Factors Influence Deprivation?**\n\n【82】The factors that can influence deprivation are as follows:  \n\\- Separation of the mother and infant due to the working mother or if the mother is dead.  \n\\- Inadequate caregiving.  \n\\- Neglect or abuse by the mother.  \n\\- If the mother has mental health issues such as anxiety or depression.  \n\\- Lack of social support.  \n\\- Financial stress.  \n\\- Social stress.  \n\\- Cultural and societal factors.\n\n【83】#### **6.**删除换行**What Is Attachment Theory?**\n\n【84】Attachment theory is the theory based on the attachment of the mother and infant. The theory was described by the psychiatrist John Bowlby. The theory describes that humans have an innate ability to emotionally attach to their parents or caregivers. Some individuals have positive caregiver experiences, and some show anxious attachment.\n\n【85】#### **7.**删除换行**What Are the Features of Deprived Children?**\n\n【86】The features of deprived children are as follows:  \n\\- Attachment issues.  \n\\- Emotional and behavioral problems.  \n\\- Developmental delay.  \n\\- Social difficulties.  \n\\- Language delay.  \n\\- Cognitive difficulties.  \n\\- Lack of communication skills.  \n\\- Mental health issues.  \n\\- Difficulty in learning and social skills.\n\n【87】#### **8.**删除换行**How to Manage Deprivation?**\n\n【88】Some interventions that can manage deprivation are as follows:  \n\\- Establish a stable environment.  \n\\- Build secure attachment between parents and child.  \n\\- Counseling of children and caregivers.  \n\\- Establish a social support system for the child and caregivers.  \n\\- Education to caregivers.  \n\\- Access to regular healthcare services.  \n\\- Mental health support.\n\n【89】#### **9.**删除换行**What Are the Phases of Attachment Theory?**\n\n【90】The phases of attachment theory are as follows:  \n\\- Pre-Attachment Phase: The phase starts from six to eight weeks of birth. During this phase, the infant goes to everyone's lap and starts to smile at everyone.  \n\\- Attachment in the Making: The phases are between six to eight weeks and six to eight months. In this phase, the infant started showing expectations from their caregivers and building trust.  \n\\- Clear-Cut Attachment: The phase is between six to eight months to 18 to 24 months. The infant is more aware of their caregivers. If the caregiver is not present, the infant feels distressed.   \n\\- Reciprocal Relationships: In this phase, the child takes guidance from the caregiver. \n\n【91】#### **10.**删除换行**What Is Social Deprivation in Children?**\n\n【92】Social deprivation is the lack of social stimulation in the early stages of life. It occurs when the child is away from social experiences which are useful for their social and emotional development. Its lack harms their well-being and causes emotional and behavioral difficulties. \n\n【93】#### **11.**删除换行**How to Calculate the Maternal Mortality Rate?**\n\n【94】The maternal mortality rate (MMR) is used to calculate the maternal deaths per live birth.

It has become a problem for world health as morbidity and mortality have increased. Type 2 diabetes intervention strategies primarily center on glucose control and avoiding and managing associated problems because the disease is currently incurable. Interestingly, the development of metabolic illnesses, particularly type 2 diabetes, depends heavily on the gut microbiota. The gastrointestinal tract's environment, the gut microbiota, is thought to be a complex ecosystem made up of bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. There is mounting evidence that the gut microbiota is crucial to human health and that dysbiosis in this microbiome is linked to a number of disease disorders. The gut microbiota may be remodeled using medications, probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and diets to treat type 2 diabetes and its consequences.\n\n【2】What Is Diabetes?\n-----------------\n\n【3】Diabetes is a widespread chronic endocrine and metabolic condition that affects people worldwide. Even though the condition can affect people of any age, type 1 diabetes (T1D) is more common among children and teenagers. The etiology of T1D happens when the inability of the endocrine system to manufacture insulin results from an inflammatory response that causes inflammation and the death of pancreatic-islet cells. Kind 2 diabetes (T2D) is a more common kind of diabetes that most frequently affects adults. It is typically brought on by concomitant insulin resistance and insulin shortage.\n\n【4】Obesity, bad eating patterns, and a family history of diabetes are risk factors for developing diabetes. Following ongoing urbanization, dietary changes, and the advent of increasingly sedentary lifestyles, an international phenomenon is the rising prevalence of diabetes. A study estimates that 463 million individuals globally have diabetes and that by 2045 there will be 700 million such patients. Specific alterations in the variety of intestinal microflora are one of the hallmarks of diabetic patients, according to epidemiological observations. At the same time, there is mounting proof that diabetes and gut microbiota are closely related.\n\n【5】What Is Gut Microbiota?\n-----------------------\n\n【6】The human gut comprises a complex ecology of host cells, nutrients, and microbes. The intestinal tract contains roughly 100 trillion microorganisms comprising the gut microbiota. The microorganisms that make up the gut microbiota are numerous and diverse. In healthy individuals, the six phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia comprise most of the gut microflora. The human digestive tract is dominated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, which are crucial for nutrient absorption and assist the improvement of the intestinal barrier.\n\n【7】How Does the Gut Microbiome Impact Diabetes Mellitus?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】**1\\. Metabolic Process**\n\n【9】One of the most well-known metabolites generated by the gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate, propionate, and acetate, have been shown to interact with host metabolism. It has been demonstrated that the gut microbiome in people with diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders produces fewer short-chain fatty acids than normal, which triggers or exacerbates the host's autoimmune response. This is relevant to both type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes autoimmune islet inflammation, and it has also been linked to low short-chain fatty acids synthesis in the gut microbiome.\n\n【10】In particular, after eating, increased butyrate production plays a positive role in -pancreatic cell function, whereas increased propionate production or absorption has a negative impact on type 2 diabetes risk. As a result, microbial changes in metabolites might impact host metabolism, resulting in insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus.\n\n【11】**2\\. Immunologic Pathway**\n\n【12】There is mounting evidence that the activation of TLR-4 by bacterial LPS (lipopolysaccharide) causes an inflammatory response, the generation of cytokines, and the recruitment of inflammatory cells via chemokines. Significantly, the type 2 diabetes microbiota showed a rise in the oxidative stress response, which may have a direct bearing on the proinflammatory condition of type 2 diabetes patients. The LPS concentration is a potential tool to assess the metabolic risk profile in diabetic patients because diabetic subjects had higher fasting and postprandial LPS concentrations than lean nondiabetic subjects and obese subjects because of increased intestinal permeability and elevated LPS absorption contributing to the development of macrovascular and microvascular complications. Antibiotic and prebiotic therapy have been shown to alter the gut microbiota and enhance metabolic, inflammatory markers. This knowledge is helpful in the development of methods for slowing the progression of diabetes mellitus.\n\n【13】**3\\. Neural-Endocrine System**\n\n【14】Normal gut microbiota will reduce the neurological system's sensitivity to stress, whereas dysbiosis will cause the HPA (hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal) system to overreact to stress. The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the gut, as well as the ECM of other organs, including the skin, can break down as a result of the exaggerated HPA (hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal) response, which can subsequently cause an increase in cortisol release. This further exacerbates barrier dysfunction. The long-term rise of glucocorticoids can cause major health problems, including diabetes mellitus. The release of these cytokines by immune cells in the gut or elsewhere is thought to be stimulated by endotoxin and peptidoglycan, components of the bacterial cell wall, which may affect the areas of the central nervous system responsible for controlling the HPA axis response. It has been demonstrated that aberrations in autonomic balance, which the gut microbiota may mediate, are one of the early changes evident in the evolution of diabetes mellitus.\n\n【15】**Conclusion**\n\n【16】One of the most prevalent metabolic illnesses in the world is type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It has become a problem for world health as morbidity and mortality have increased. The major goals of T2DM therapeutic strategies include glucose control, as well as the avoidance and management of associated problems. It's interesting to note that the development of metabolic illnesses, particularly T2DM, depends heavily on the gut microbiota. It is anticipated that the gut microbiota will be employed as both a target for possible therapeutic therapies as well as a biomarker for diabetes. Gut microbiota will eventually play a role in diagnosing and treating diabetes, allowing for a more accurate and individualized approach.\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>*   Gut microbiota and diabetes: From correlation to causality and mechanism  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7415231/\n*   Gut Bacteria May Play a Role in Diabetes  \n    https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/gut-bacteria-may-play-a-role-in-diabetes/#:\n*   Gut Microbiota: An Important Player in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  \n    https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2022.834485/full</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The skin consists of different types of sweat and oil glands and hair follicles. It is composed of different layers named – dermis, epidermis, and hypodermis, which help the body protect from exposure to sunlight, bacteria, chemicals, and other external factors.\n\n【2】What Is Skin Pigmentation?\n--------------------------\n\n【3】Human skin color is due to melanin present in the skin, a brown color pigment inside melanocytes. Different races have different amounts of pigment in them. Apart from melanin, other substances like carotene and hemoglobin also impart color to the skin.\n\n【4】Melanin pigment is of two types – eumelanin and pheomelanin. Eumelanin is a brown or black-colored pigment that protects the skin from ultraviolet rays (UV rays). These UV rays penetrate into the skin, bond with the reactive oxygen radicals that damage the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and can lead to serious health complications like cancers. Pheomelanin is a red and yellow-colored pigment that also protects from ultraviolet rays but supports reactive oxygen radicals' activities.\n\n【5】What Is Skin Pigmentation Disorder?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【6】Skin pigmentation disorder is a health condition caused by damage to the melanin pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. It depends on the excessive or decreased production of melanin; it may affect small spots or entire body pigmentation. There are different skin pigmentation disorders; some are birthmarks present on the body since birth, which may not cause any problem, but if they get exposed to external factors, it may lead to serious complications. Hypopigmentation skin disorder refers to the less or defective production of melanin causing albinism, vitiligo, pityriasis alba. Hyperpigmentation skin disorders are caused by excessive or uneven melanin production, causing melasma, freckles, solar light, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.\n\n【7】How to Prevent Skin Pigmentation by Using Home Remedies?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Skincare is important for the prevention of skin pigmentation and related disorders. There are several home remedies for skin care and protection.\n\n【9】*   Olive oil - The application of olive oil blocks the damage caused by sunlight and boosts the skin.\n\n【10】*   Apple cider vinegar - The application of apple cider vinegar to the skin helps to reduce sunburn and dark spots.\n\n【11】*   Aloe vera - Aloe vera has natural depigmentation properties because of the presence of vitamins, enzymes, sugar, minerals, amino acids, lignin, and salicylic acid, which helps to reduce depigment spots.\n\n【12】*   Red onion - Application of cream extract on red onion helps lighten the skin's dark spots.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    How to get rid of melasma?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    How to Select a Sunscreen?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Why is there slow healing of boils on my face?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Green tea extract - Application of green tea extract after boiling it was found beneficial to some extent.\n\n【14】*   Turmeric paste - Turmeric has natural medicational values, which help to lighten the skin.\n\n【15】*   Milk - Apply raw milk to the skin to prevent dark spots and moisturize the skin.\n\n【16】*   Tomato paste - Tomato is rich in vitamin C and citric acid.\n\n【17】*   Use of natural exfoliate.\n    </u>\n\n【18】How to Prevent Skin Pigmentation With Proper Diet and Lifestyle?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Skin is the body's largest part, requiring care and nourishment. Eating healthy plays a vital role in preventing skin pigmentations; several superfoods are filled with all the nutritional values required for healthy skin. A healthy lifestyle with good food habits will increase the quality of the skin.\n\n【20】*   Fatty fish - Fish is really good for healthy skin because they are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and zinc, which prevents skin pigmentation.\n\n【21】*   Seed and nuts - Eating seeds and nuts bring a great value in nutritional supply to the body and skin, as they are loaded with vitamins, proteins, and minerals.\n\n【22】*   Avocados - Avocados help as an antioxidant for the skin that protects the skin from harsh sunlight damage.\n\n【23】*   Citrus fruits - Citrus fruits are loaded with antioxidants and vitamin C, which are very important for healthy skin.\n\n【24】*   Sweet potatoes and carrots - They have antioxidant properties with provitamin A, vitamin C, and carotene, which prevent skin damage.\n\n【25】*   Drinking water - Skin is a sensitive organ, and it is essential to keep it hydrated by drinking enough water.\n\n【26】How to Improve the Skin Tone?\n-----------------------------\n\n【27】For improving skin tone, the most important thing is protection from sunlight. Some tips to protect yourself from the sun and enhance skin tone are as follows:\n\n【28】*   Appropriate clothing to protect from sunlight is essential, especially for those who are sensitive to the sun and get sunburn easily. Properly woven clothes with broad-brimmed hats are very important for this purpose.\n\n【29】*   A good sunscreen with SPF 60 should be applied evenly and frequently, 30 minutes before going out. Physical sunscreens like zinc oxide give more protection than chemical sunscreen.\n\n【30】*   Vitamin C preparation has antioxidant properties. It scavenges free radicals in our skin and helps to improve skin tone.\n\n【31】*   For other pigmentation problems like melasma, bleaching agents, or skin lightening agents like Hydroquinone can be used, but it can also have side effects on the skin. A combination of Hydroquinone with Hydrocortisone and Retinol is better in lightening the skin tone.\n\n【32】*   Glycolic acid and other natural beta hydroxy acids can also improve skin tone.\n\n【33】*   Lasers like Q-switched lasers are used for pigmentary disorders like melasma, freckles, and lentigines.\n\n【34】*   Chemical peeling is done to improve the skin condition; it is a cosmetic procedure that involves the application of a chemical over the affected area, then the damaged skin gets peeled off, self-regulating the formation of a new skin layer.\n\n【35】*   Microdermabrasion is an invasive procedure performed to remove dark spots, acne, and hypopigmentation.\n\n【36】When to Consult a Dermatologist?\n--------------------------------\n\n【37】A dermatologist is a specialist doctor of skin and hair. Problems related to the skin should not be ignored as a small problem can lead to serious complications. Skin pigmentation is not just a skin condition; diffuse pigmentation in the body can also occur due to underlying disease and systemic causes like liver disorder, kidney disorder, malignancies, drugs, and endocrine problems. Other causes include,\n\n【38】*   Prolonged acne.\n\n【39】*   Severe hypopigmentation.\n\n【40】*   Burns.\n\n【41】*   Injury.\n\n【42】*   Gradually increasing moles or birthmarks.\n\n【43】*   Allergic reactions.\n\n【44】**Conclusion:**\n\n【45】It is very important to protect the skin from harmful rays or chemicals which can lead to permanent damage. As it is said, precaution is better than cure, it is essential for an individual to understand their skin type and take proper preventive measures and lead a happy and healthy life.\n\n【46】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【47】* * *\n\n【48】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is the Treatment For Skin Pigmentation?**\n\n【49】Options for hyperpigmentation therapy include the use of face acids, the application of retinoids, the use of peeling agents, laser peeling, and the use of whitening lotion.

Mixing water and apple cider vinegar in equivalence can be applied. Apply to dark areas, then wait two to three minutes before washing off. Next, use warm water to rinse. Repeat this process twice every day until you get the desired results.\n\n【52】#### **3.**删除换行**What Is the Cause for Hyperpigmentation?**\n\n【53】Patches of hyperpigmentation are most commonly caused by sun damage, which may significantly reduce by using SPF and avoiding direct sunlight. In addition, using products with components like retinol or niacinamide can help cure darker skin pigmentation.\n\n【54】#### **4.**删除换行**What Food Can Help in Reducing Pigmentation?**\n\n【55】Dark-green vegetable consumption in meals gives good results. Apart from that, citrus fruits, tomatoes, salmon, almonds, and yogurt are also good. Eating an antioxidant rich diet can help in reducing pigmentation.\n\n【56】#### **5.**删除换行**How to Reduce Melanin in the Body?**\n\n【57】Melanocytes are cells found in normal skin. Melanin is the pigment that is produced by these cells and gives skin its color. Hyperpigmented skin is described as having an excess amount of melanin. Hypopigmented skin is described as having insufficient melanin. During the sun's peak hour, staying inside, away from sunlight, can reduce melanin production in the skin. Wear safety gear, including caps, long sleeves, and sunglasses.\n\n【58】#### **6.**删除换行**Can Aloe Vera Help in Removing Pigmentation?**\n\n【59】Aloe vera contains aloin, a naturally occurring depigmenting substance that has been shown to lighten skin and function well as a nontoxic hyperpigmentation therapy. Apply pure aloe vera gel to pigmented regions before going to bed. Rinse the following morning with warm water.\n\n【60】#### **7.**删除换行**What Is the Fastest Way to Treat Pigmentation?**\n\n【61】The safest way includes using chemical exfoliants for the skin that can remove dead cells. Microdermabrasion and laser resurfacing using intense pulsed light (IPL). Nowadays, cryotherapy also gives good results.\n\n【62】#### **8.**删除换行**What Are the Causative Factors of Hyperpigmentation?**\n\n【63】Sun exposure and inflammation are the two main risk factors for generalized hyperpigmentation since both conditions can enhance melanin production. There is a risk of developing more pigmentation increases with increased sun exposure.\n\n【64】#### **9.**删除换行**Can Pigmentation Be Treated?**\n\n【65】Contrary to popular belief, freckles, melasma, and dark spots rarely disappear. In reality, in 90 % of cases, therapy is required to eradicate pigmentations from the face completely.\n\n【66】#### **10.**删除换行**How Hyperpigmentation Look Like?**\n\n【67】Spots or patches of hyperpigmentation may be brown, black, gray, red, or pink. The spots are also known as liver spots, age spots, and sunspots. The spots might appear all over the body or just in one location.\n\n【68】#### **11.**删除换行**How to Stop Pigmentation from Spreading?**\n\n【69】Avoid being in the sun. Try to avoid the sun between 10 am to 2 pm when it is at its strongest. It is also advised to wear a hat or a cap with a wide brim to protect your face and scalp. Make vitamin C a part of your cosmetic regimen. Apply sunscreen and avoid frequent touch to the skin.\n\n【70】#### **12.**删除换行**Can Turmeric Help in Removing Pigmentation?**\n\n【71】Turmeric evens skin tone, and its extract may help lessen the visibility of acne scars. In addition, turmeric can lessen hyperpigmentation, also known as dark spots on the skin. Turmeric extract reduced hyper-pigmentation by up to 10 % to 15 % after four weeks.\n\n【72】#### **13.**删除换行**How Much Time It Takes for Pigmentation to Fade Away?**\n\n【73】Fading might take time once the root of the dark spots or patches is identified and stopped. Usually, a spot a couple of shades darker than your normal skin tone will go away in 12 months. But it may take years for the color to fade if it is deeply ingrained in your skin.\n\n【74】#### **14.**删除换行**Is Vaseline Effective For Pigmentation?**\n\n【75】Vaseline does not eliminate dark marks, so the answer is no. Vaseline does not include any ingredients that would erase black stains; it is simply petroleum jelly that locks in moisture.\n\n【76】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【77】无关删除-1:<u>*   Skin Pigmentation Abnormalities and Their Possible Relationship with Skin Aging  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8038212/\n*   Pigmentation disorders  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/pigmentation-disorders\n*   Pigmentation Disorders: Diagnosis and Management  \n    https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/1215/p797.html</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

As a typical reaction to blood vessel injury, the body produces blood clots. Its primary function is to close a leak in a damaged blood artery.\n\n【2】Blood clots can develop in or move to the arteries and veins of the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and limbs. Blood clots can restrict or completely stop blood flow.\n\n【3】Blood clots are commonly associated with headaches, difficulty speaking, and disorientation. The majority of clotting factors are enzyme-like proteins. Normally, all of the components are present as inactive pro-enzymes. In order to induce clot formation, these pro-enzymes must be converted into enzymes. This process is repeated until the final active enzyme; thrombin is generated. Blood clotting happens in three phases in general.\n\n【4】*   Prothrombin activator formation.\n\n【5】*   Prothrombin to thrombin conversion.\n\n【6】*   Fibrinogen to fibrin conversion.\n\n【7】What Is Protein S Deficiency?\n-----------------------------\n\n【8】Protein S are naturally occurring molecules in the blood that aid in the prevention of clotting. It acts as a natural anticoagulant or blood thinner. If these proteins are missing, there is an increased risk of forming deadly blood clots, especially in pregnant women. Protein S deficiency can also be caused by liver or renal illness, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or a lack of vitamin K. Its primary role is to act as a cofactor in the action of activated protein C (APC) on its substrates, activated factor V (FVa), and activated factor VIII (FVIIIa).\n\n【9】What Are the Different Types of Protein S Deficiency?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Protein S insufficiency is classified into three types:\n\n【11】1.  **Type I**\\- The decrease in protein S activity is proportionate to the decrease in protein S level.\n\n【12】2.  **Type II**\\- The levels of the protein's free and bound versions are normal. However, they do not function correctly due to a gene mutation.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Malabsorption Syndrome</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Is factor V Leiden mutation related to any health issues?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I have bad smell in mouth even after gallbladder stone removal.

Protein S deficiency can affect anybody, regardless of gender, who has the genetic abnormality.\n\n【15】What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Protein S Deficiency?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Individuals with protein S deficiency are at risk of developing blood clots, particularly those that originate in veins (venous thromboembolism). It is the veins that transport blood to the heart.\n\n【17】*   A blood clot in the legs or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the most common symptom that may occur.\n\n【18】*   Blood clots formed during pregnancy.\n\n【19】*   Embolism of the lungs (a disorder in which a blood clot blocks one or more arteries in the lungs.).\n\n【20】*   Stroke (damage to the brain caused by a disruption in its blood supply) may occur in a youngster with the severe form of the illness.\n\n【21】*   Thrombosis (blood clots obstructing veins or arteries) of lower extremities.\n\n【22】*   Superficial thrombophlebitis (a condition in which the clotting vein lies just beneath the skin).\n\n【23】*   Redness in the affected area.\n\n【24】*   Purpura fulminans (an acute purpuric rash characterized by microvascular coagulation, resulting in purpuric lesions and skin necrosis).\n\n【25】What Are the Causes of Protein S Deficiency?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Protein S deficiency is caused by a mutation or alteration in the PROS1 gene. This is a hereditary condition, which means the individuals have acquired it from either one or both parents. If individuals inherit a modest protein S deficiency from one parent, they will have a severe protein S deficiency if they have inherited protein S gene mutations from both parents. If these individuals have a PROS1 mutation, each of their offspring has a 50 % chance of inheriting it.\n\n【27】The acquired type of protein S deficiency is more prevalent and can be seen in the following scenarios.\n\n【28】*   Diseases of the liver.\n\n【29】*   Kidney failure.\n\n【30】*   Nephrotic syndrome (kidney condition in which the body excretes an excessive amount of protein in the urine).\n\n【31】*   Chemotherapy (a medication that employs strong chemicals to destroy rapidly developing cells in your body).\n\n【32】*   Infections.\n\n【33】*   Surgery.\n\n【34】*   A deficiency in vitamin K.\n\n【35】*   Birth control pills.\n\n【36】*   Pregnancy.\n\n【37】How to Diagnose Protein S Deficiency?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【38】Identification of distinctive symptoms, a complete patient and family history, a thorough clinical assessment, and a range of specialist testing are used to make a diagnosis of protein S deficiency.\n\n【39】A hereditary type of protein S deficiency can be difficult to diagnose since many other illnesses can temporarily deplete protein S levels in the blood (acquired protein S deficiency).\n\n【40】*   **Blood Tests**\\- These will be performed in order to rule out the presence of protein S enzyme in the blood. This is normally accomplished by drawing blood from a vein.\n\n【41】*   **Physical Exam**\\- This will be carried out to determine the presence of deep vein thrombosis or any other symptoms.\n\n【42】*   **Medical History**\\- A thorough medical history will be gathered to determine whether or not it was acquired.\n\n【43】How to Treat Protein S Deficiency?\n----------------------------------\n\n【44】*   Protein S deficient patients do not have a particular treatment. However, anticoagulant medications are extremely effective in treating and preventing blood clots in people with the most common form of protein S deficiency (due to the inheritance of one abnormal protein S gene). Regardless of the underlying risk factor or genetic aberration that predisposes a patient to have a blood clot, such medicines are often beneficial.\n\n【45】*   If the provider discovers that patients have protein S deficiency but have never had a blood clot, then they are unlikely to require therapy unless specific conditions exist.\n\n【46】*   Heparin, Warfarin, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, and Dabigatran are common anticoagulants. If the physician decides to use Warfarin, they must first provide Heparin to avoid a problem in which there is extensive clotting, particularly in the skin and soft tissues. This is not required with the other anticoagulants. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the blood clot, the medical provider may continue therapy for many months or for the longest time possible.\n\n【47】*   When the individuals have the protein S deficient mutation and have not had a blood clot, the provider will want to keep patients from acquiring one. They may advise patients not to use some medications, such as birth control pills, since they might cause blood clotting. Mostly they are unlikely to require therapy unless specific conditions exist.\n\n【48】What Is a Protein S Measurement?\n--------------------------------\n\n【49】In rare circumstances, protein S deficiency can be inherited. Some people are just born with an anticoagulant deficit. If there is a history of significant blood clots in one or more close family members, or if someone in the family has a known protein S deficiency, the physician may propose testing.\n\n【50】When a blood clot (thrombosis) forms in a vein or artery, the doctor will generally examine the protein S level. This will help them determine the cause of the thrombosis.\n\n【51】Before the test, the doctor will review the medical history and medication usage to determine when it should be performed. The test should not be performed during an active clotting event because a blood clot lowers protein S levels naturally, rendering the test findings incorrect. Patients must also abstain from anticoagulants for at least two weeks prior to testing.\n\n【52】For their protein S measurement, they will need to supply a blood sample. The doctor will inject a needle into one of the veins and take a blood sample in a vial. There may be some discomfort while the needle is placed, as well as some soreness afterward. Serious problems are uncommon.\n\n【53】**Conclusion**\n\n【54】Protein S deficiency is a hereditary thrombophilia that raises the risk of thromboembolism. Diagnosis of inherited protein S deficiency can be challenging, especially in the context of acute thrombosis or anticoagulant therapy. Affected people are more likely to develop blood clots in their legs, which can break off and go to their lungs. Protein S deficiency can occur as a result of acquired conditions such as kidney illness, pregnancy, or the use of oral contraceptives.\n\n【55】The most effective treatment for this condition is anticoagulant therapy. In some cases, individuals may not exhibit any symptoms and hence may not require therapy.\n\n【56】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【57】无关删除-1:<u>*   Protein S Deficiency  \n    https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/protein-s-deficiency/\n*   Protein S Deficiency  \n    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/protein-s-deficiency/\n*   Protein S Deficiency  \n    https://www.stoptheclot.org/congenital-protein-s-and-protein-c-deficiency/\n*   Protein S Deficiency  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544344/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The high-risk factors are high blood pressure, tobacco use, lack of exercise, and a diet high in saturated fat. It is a gradual buildup of plaques in the blood vessels. Atheroma is a fatty substance that blocks blood vessels. A plaque is also called an atheroma, a sticky substance made up of cholesterol, calcium, and fat.\n\n【2】Growth hormone is a natural hormone produced by the pituitary gland in the brain that regulates fat metabolism. Studies suggest that growth hormone helps in preventing early atherosclerosis.\n\n【3】What Is Atherosclerosis?\n------------------------\n\n【4】An atheroma is a fibrofatty tissue built over the blood vessels that supply the heart and is also known as simply plaque or atherosclerotic plaque. These atheromas block the flow of blood, which is dangerous because it ruptures the blood vessel, leading to the formation of a blood clot. This block will take up more space inside the blood vessel, leaving little space for the blood to flow. The fibrofatty tissue is made up of cholesterol, proteins, inflammatory cells, blood cells, and calcium. The substance that hardens the atheroma is calcium. The main cause of atheromas is diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, and a diet rich in trans fat, cholesterol, and saturated fat.\n\n【5】When the plaque gradually builds on the sides of the arteries, there is a thickening due to inflammation that reduces the oxygen and blood supply to the vital organs and extremities. The symptoms of atherosclerosis depend on the type of artery (blood vessel) involved. If a major artery is blocked, it leads to stroke and blood clots.\n\n【6】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【7】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>What does the growth hormone test report of a child with short stature indicate?</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-3:<u>Can we opt growth hormone to increase the height?</u>\n\n【10】Naturopathy Treatment Options for Atherosclerosis\n\n【11】High cholesterol in the blood increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Cholesterol is a natural fatty substance produced by the liver. High cholesterol occurs due to eating too much-saturated fats, being physically inactive, and smoking.\n\n【12】What Is Growth Hormone and Their Role in Fat Metabolism?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The pituitary gland is a small gland in the brain that secretes many hormones that control various bodily functions and metabolism. The pituitary gland is divided into the anterior and posterior lobes. The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland secretes growth hormone. The daily growth hormone output from the pituitary gland is 0.2 to 1 mg daily, with a biological half-life of 20 minutes. The release of growth hormones is controlled by two hypothalamic hormones: Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and Growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH).\n\n【14】The following are the functions of growth hormones:\n\n【15】*   Stimulation of growth of cartilage, bone, and connective tissue.\n\n【16】*   Growth hormone is an anabolic protein that affects the translation of ribosomal attachment, increases the transport of amino acids into the cells, and stimulates red blood cell formation.\n\n【17】*   Growth hormone is considered a diabetogenic hormone because it produces hyperglycemia (high blood glucose). Growth hormone can increase the liver glucose output. It opposes the effects of insulin on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue because there is decreased glucose uptake by the tissues.\n\n【18】*   The growth hormone increases the mobilization of fats from adipose tissues and the circulation of free fatty acids.\n\n【19】*   The growth hormone also increases the hepatic oxidation of fatty acids to ketone bodies.\n\n【20】*   Increases milk production in lactating mothers.\n\n【21】The deficiency of growth hormones in immature individuals leads to stunted growth or dwarfism, characterized by immature faces, small genitalia, delayed skeletal and dental development, and delicate extremities and fatness. Growth hormones are produced from the beginning of birth and reach peak levels around puberty. When there is a pituitary gland problem, the growth hormone is not produced efficiently. Growth hormone production occurs more during birth and gradually declines throughout adulthood. The main reason for growth hormone deficiency in adults is a pituitary gland tumor. People with untreated growth hormone deficiency have high levels of bad cholesterol (low-density cholesterol). Low-density cholesterol is a crucial factor in the formation of atherosclerosis.\n\n【22】How Does Growth Hormone Help in the Prevention of Early Atherosclerosis?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Growth hormone deficiency leads to visceral adiposity (belly fat found deep down the abdominal cavity), lipid abnormalities, high blood pressure (hypertension), insulin resistance (resistance to insulin hormone), glucose intolerance, and cardiac abnormalities. Growth hormone also stimulates protein production, counteracts the insulin in the blood, and helps the body to remove phosphate, electrolytes, water, and sodium. Clinical trials have proved that in people with a growth hormone deficiency, growth hormone treatment has improved functional and morphological cardiac parameters. A deficiency of growth hormones can lead to high cholesterol. Growth hormone helps the body to destroy the lipid molecules and removes them from the blood.\n\n【24】The natural growth hormone is replaced with synthetic growth hormone, also known as recombinant growth hormone (HGH). The injections are found to lower bad cholesterol levels. Studies have shown that after six months of growth hormone treatment, there is a subsequent decrease in fat stores. The growth hormone decreases the fat stores by fat mobilization (the breakdown of stored fat into free fatty acids). It also stimulates the hydrolysis of triglycerides to free fatty acids. It decreases the conversion of fatty acids to triglycerides.\n\n【25】The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the synthetic form of human growth hormone. It is available only in an injectable form and can be bought only on a doctor’s prescription.\n\n【26】**Conclusion:**\n\n【27】Human growth hormone is a very important and powerful hormone that is necessary for many important bodily processes. There is no pill form available for growth hormone replacement. Since growth hormone is essential for fat metabolism, decreased or deficiency in growth hormones in adults can build up low-density cholesterol, which is bad cholesterol. Low-density cholesterol is considered as an important risk factor for atherosclerosis. So healthy lifestyle choices and diet are vital in managing heart disease. Hormone therapy can also help increase muscle mass and reduce body fat.\n\n【28】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【29】无关删除-1:<u>*   Targeting Early Atherosclerosis: A Focus on Oxidative Stress and Inflammation  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6636482/\n*   Treatment with Growth Hormone for Adults with Growth Hormone Deficiency Syndrome: Benefits and Risks  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5877754/\n*   Effects of growth hormone on lipid metabolism in humans  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12914720/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The skeleton is a very important part of the human body. Its functions can be grouped conveniently under the headings- support, protection, movement, muscle attachment, etc.\n\n【2】**Support:**\n\n【3】In land-dwelling vertebrates, rigid skeletal support raises the body from the ground and allows rapid movement. It suspends some of the vital organs, prevents them from crushing each other, and maintains the shape of the body despite vigorous muscular activity.\n\n【4】Situated over the upper part of the ribcage, at the back of the body, are the shoulder blades (scapulae). The collarbones (clavicles) link the scapulae to the breastbone (sternum) and support the shoulders. The upper arm bone which is the humerus bone, fits into a socket in the scapula.\n\n【5】The bones of the arms and shoulder girdle are designed for dexterity, while those of the pelvic girdle and legs are constructed for weight-bearing and walking.\n\n【6】The pelvic girdle also houses and supports the organs of the lower abdomen (liver, kidneys, etc.) It comprises the sacrum, the coccyx, and the two hip bones. Each hipbone is composed of three fused bones - the ilium, the ischium, and the pubis. The ilia are attached to each side of the sacrum, and the two pubic bones are joined at the front of the pelvic girdle. On each side, the ischium unites the ilium with the pubis. The upper leg bone (femur) is socketed into a cavity at the junction of these three bones.\n\n【7】Joined to the strong upper bones of each limb are paired parallel bones - the radius and the ulna in the forearm, the fibula, and the tibia in the lower leg. The wrist and the ankle are composed of several smaller bones: carpals in the wrist and tarsals in the ankle. The framework of the hand is made up of metacarpals, and the foot is composed of metatarsals. The fingers and toes are constructed of bones called phalanges.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【9】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【10】Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy - Causes, Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【11】Pregnancy and Birth\n\n【12】HGH - The Human Growth Regulator\n\n【13】**Protection:**\n\n【14】Some of the delicate and important organs of the body are protected from distortion or injury by several skeletal structures. The 22 bones of the skull (cranium) form a protective vault for the brain and sockets for the eyes, ears, and nose.\n\n【15】Beneath the skull is a total of 34 vertebrae, which make up the backbone and encase the spinal cord. Toward the base of the spine, five vertebrae are fused together to form the sacrum, with the four fused bones of the coccyx beneath them. The 24 curved rib bones are attached to the spine. Out of which, the top 10 rib pairs are attached to the sternum at the front of the body. The ribcage protects the heart, lungs, and the main blood vessels of the body (aorta, vena cava, etc.)\n\n【16】**Movement:**\n\n【17】Movements of the skeleton are made possible by the joints formed wherever two bones meet. The joints that allow the most freedom of movement are those at the shoulder and the hip. Here, a ball at the end of the limb bone fits into a socket on the girdle. At the knee and the elbow, hinge joints permit the limb to bend in one direction only. The elbow also has a pivot joint enabling the arm to twist. Other mobile joints include the ellipsoid joints between the hand’s phalanges and metacarpals. The saddle joint of the thumb enables it to touch each finger in turn.\n\n【18】**Muscle Attachment:**\n\n【19】To produce effective movement of any part of the skeleton, the muscles must be attached securely to it at each end. One end of the muscle must be attached to the part of the skeleton to be moved, while the other end is anchored to a part of the skeleton to be held stationary with respect to the moving part.\n\n【20】Muscles that produce movement usually act across joints in such a way that the bones work as levers with a low mechanical advantage. When a muscle contracts, it exerts tension between its two points of attachment. One of these points remains fixed at the origin, while the other end that moves is the point of insertion of the muscle.\n\n【21】**Formation of Blood Cells:**\n\n【22】Most hollow bones of the human skeleton contain bone marrow. And the marrow towards the two ends of the bone is known as red bone marrow. The red bone marrow produces red blood cells and lymphocytes.\n\n【23】**Storage of Fats and Minerals:**\n\n【24】The bone marrow contained in the middle part of the bone is known as yellow bone marrow. It acts as a storage of fats and minerals such as calcium and phosphorus.\n\n【25】**Respiration:**\n\n【26】The breathing process is another application of the skeletal system. Inhalation occurs when the ribs move upwards and outwards as a result of contraction of the intercostal and diaphragm muscles, and exhalation occurs when the ribs move downwards following the relaxed situation of these muscles.\n\n【27】**Hearing:**\n\n【28】The inner ear has three bones: hammer, anvil, and stirrup. These three bones vibrate when the ear drum receives any sound, creating vibration in the surrounding cochlea, which transmits the signals to the brain.\n\n【29】What Are the Parts of the Skeleton?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【30】The vertebrate skeleton is composed of the axial and the appendicular skeletons.\n\n【31】**Axial Skeleton:** The axial skeleton consists of the skull, the vertebral column, and the rib cage.\n\n【32】The skull consists of the cranium, with a fixed upper jaw (maxilla) and a movable lower jaw (mandible). Skull bones are spongy to reduce their density.\n\n【33】The vertebral column is made up of individual vertebrae separated by intervertebral discs of cushioning pads.\n\n【34】The ribcage (thorax) is composed of 12 pairs of ribs joined at the back of the thoracic vertebrae. The upper ten pairs are joined by cartilage, at the front, of the breastbone (sternum).\n\n【35】**Appendicular Skeleton:** The appendicular skeleton is formed by the pelvic and pectoral girdles and the limbs.\n\n【36】The pectoral or shoulder girdle is the portion of the upper extremities to which the upper limbs are attached. It consists of a pair of clavicles or collar bones and a pair of scapulae or shoulder blades at the back. The scapulae are attached to the thoracic vertebrae by muscles and tendons. The clavicles link the scapulae to the sternum. The upper arm bone (humerus) fits into a socket called the glenoid cavity in the scapula. The bones in the shoulder girdle are designed for dexterity. The connection in the girdle is loose and acts as a shock absorber to dissipate the upthrust received by the hands as they work.\n\n【37】The pelvic girdle is the portion of the lower extremities to which the lower limbs are attached. It is made of the sacrum, the coccyx, and the two hip bones. Each hipbone is made up of three fused bones - the ilium, the ischium, and the pubis. These are firmly connected to the sacrum by strong ligaments. The bones of the pelvic girdle are designed for weight-bearing and movement. It is a strong setup that supports the abdominal organs. The fused structure of the pelvic girdle provides the strength to bear the whole body over it and absorb the upthrust transmitted by the legs during walking or running.\n\n【38】**Conclusion**\n\n【39】The skeleton forms the internal frame with a wide range of functions ranging from protection to hemopoiesis. The bones have a great potential to repair, which has been implemented in certain cases to increase the height of an individual. The bone marrow is one of the important components of the body as it creates the vital cells of the immune system, making the skeletal system responsible for both physical and microbiological protection of the body.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is considered the treatment of last resort for patients who did not have success with drug therapies. It is also used in individuals who have life-threatening psychiatric conditions and those who are suffering from a catatonic state (lack of movement or excessive movements). It is typically indicated for mood disorders, depression, and bipolar disorder. Many individuals experience good improvement in their symptoms after undergoing electric shock treatment.\n\n【2】What Does Shock Therapy Do?\n---------------------------\n\n【3】Nerve cells (neurons) in the brain communicate through electrical signals, which influence brain chemistry, contributing to different moods and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked by electric shock therapy sessions alters that chemistry. Meaning that it triggers the release of certain chemicals (neurotransmitter molecules) that help carry signals between the neurons and thereby influence one’s mental health. Electric shock therapy also stimulates the flow of hormones to reduce symptoms of depression. Fascinatingly, the specific details of how the therapy works remain unknown, despite its proven track record of success.\n\n【4】What Is the Purpose of Electric Shock Therapy?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Several mental health conditions show significant and rapid improvement with electroconvulsive therapy. One may use it to treat:\n\n【6】*   **Severe Cases of Major Depression** - Extreme state of depression accompanied by delusions and detachment from reality, where one may express suicidal ideations and refuse to eat.\n\n【7】*   **Treatment-Resistant Depression** - Where the individual does not positively respond to full course medications or other strategies of cure.\n\n【8】*   **Bipolar Disorder** - In patients where all other therapies for bipolar disorder were unsuccessful.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Conversion Disorder - Causes, Types, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Why am I having fear of talking to people due to difficult childhood?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    How to Diagnose Depression? - A View from a Psychiatrist</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   **Management of Severe Mania Associated With Bipolar Disorder** \\- Where the individual is in an uncontrollably agitated state of euphoria, violence, or hyperactivity from psychosis or substance abuse.

This may be part of certain medical illnesses as well.\n\n【11】*   **Dementia** \\- Associated with agitation and aggression, compromising one’s quality of life which may be hard to control and treat.\n    </u>\n\n【12】*   **Poor Tolerance to Drugs** - Those who have had adverse reactions to medications that leave them unable to continue treatment with regular drugs.\n\n【13】*   **In Pregnancy** - Regular drug therapy may harm the fetus.\n\n【14】How Is Electric Shock Therapy Performed?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【15】*   One may have to undergo a medical evaluation before the therapy, where the doctor reviews the medical history and conducts a full physical examination. The individual’s psychiatric assessment must be complete and unambiguous, and the diagnosis should indicate electroconvulsive therapy. The doctor may order an electrocardiogram (ECG) test and other blood work to deem the individual fit for the procedure.\n\n【16】*   Informed consent is a significant part of the process. Written informed consent should be provided by the patient before the therapy. In cases where the patient is severely ill to decide, the consent will be governed by state law.\n\n【17】*   The majority of the electric shock treatments are managed like outpatient procedures, and the patient is given general anesthesia. While the individual is asleep (under general anesthesia), electrodes deliver mild electrical pulses into the brain. This fires up a large group of nerve cells all at once to cause a briefly controlled seizure. The seizure is monitored throughout the procedure by electroencephalography (EEG), and mostly just one seizure is induced at a time. The electric current given to the brain will be low enough not to harm the patient and high enough to trigger a seizure. The treatment team stays close by monitoring the patient throughout the procedure. To avoid large-scale spasms affecting the rest of the body, doctors give a muscle relaxant to the patient. Probably, the only physical indication of the electricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot. The treatment lasts for about a minute. And most patients can resume normal activities about an hour after each session.\n\n【18】*   Most patients may be concerned about having a seizure while they are unconscious and also, what could happen during a seizure. But with the anesthetic agent, the seizure activity is hardly perceivable. The only way to know one is having a seizure is through the EEG monitor. The patient is awakened soon after the procedure and monitored for a short while, like any other general anesthesia procedure. Within half an hour, they will be discharged from the healthcare facility. Some individuals may need regular recurring ECT treatments to control their condition effectively. Or just have one session of ECT and then continue the rest of the treatment with medication.\n\n【19】What Are the Benefits of Electric Shock Therapy?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Most patients treated with electroshock therapy have two or three sessions per week for several weeks. Some individuals notice an improvement in their symptoms in just one session. But it may take more than one for others. One may still require occasional follow-up sessions for a while or the rest of their life. Interestingly, maintaining the disorders with electric shock therapy works better when paired with medication. Even those who were resistant to the medication before were found to tolerate them well after the therapy.\n\n【21】What Are the Possible Side Effects of Electric Shock Therapy?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Modern electroconvulsive therapy is much safer than it used to be. Yet, some individuals may experience some side effects, such as:\n\n【23】1.  Feeling achy, fatigued, or nauseated right after treatment.\n\n【24】2.  Some have trouble remembering what happened before the session. For example, one may not be able to recollect what they ate last night if asked.\n\n【25】3.  Rarely do some individuals have trouble remembering matters weeks and months before therapy. For the majority, this memory loss improves over time.\n\n【26】What Are Other Brain Stimulation Treatments?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【27】**Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation:**\n\n【28】Transcranial magnetic stimulation is used for treating depression that does not respond to other therapies. It is not as effective as ECT in treating severe illness. Rapidly alternating magnetic fields are used to stimulate specific areas of the brain. Side effects are milder and include muscle twitches, headache, and pain at the site of stimulation.\n\n【29】**Vagus Nerve Stimulation:**\n\n【30】Vagus nerve stimulation is used for treating depression that has not responded to other therapies. It is not considered for acute severe depression as the therapy may take months to develop a response.\n\n【31】**Conclusion:**\n\n【32】Electric shock therapy carries a deep stigma that is leftover from the way it was conducted in the past. In the olden days, an electric shock was given to a patient who was fully awake and conscious. Also, the amount of current used was not properly regulated. This used to cause large-scale whole-body seizures, and the patent often ended up with additional injuries and bruises. Such a history bears little resemblance to the modern electroconvulsive therapy procedure. The persisting misperceptions about ECT often tamper with the treatment's life-changing potential. Electroconvulsive therapy can make a difference in individuals when every other treatment fails. As researchers come to a better understanding of brain function, doctors may likely be able to make electric shock therapy even more effective in the future.\n\n【33】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>*   What is Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)?  \n    https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/ect\n*   Brain Stimulation Services  \n    https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/psychiatry/specialty\\_areas/brain\\_stimulation/services.html\n*   Electroconvulsive Therapy  \n    https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/programs/neuromodulation/electroconvulsive-therapy\n*   Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)  \n    https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/electroconvulsive-therapy-ect/about-ect/\n*   Debunked! 4 myths about electroconvulsive therapy for depression  \n    https://utswmed.org/medblog/electroconvulsive-therapy-depression/\n*   Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)  \n    https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/electroconvulsive-therapy-ect</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is assumed that they are caused by the abnormal cross-reaction between the serum autoantibodies and the retinal antigens. Autoimmune retinopathy has a wide spectrum and consists of various clinical entities with overlapping clinical presentations. The most common clinical manifestation is bilateral, gradually degenerative, rapidly progressive, painless vision deterioration. Autoimmune retinopathy was first reported in the year 1976 by Sawyer et al.\n\n【2】What Are the Types of Autoimmune Retinopathy?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Autoimmune retinopathy can be subdivided into paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy and non-paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy.\n\n【4】*   **Paraneoplastic Autoimmune Retinopathy:** Cancer-associated retinopathy and melanoma-associated retinopathy are included in this category.\n\n【5】*   **Non-paraneoplastic Autoimmune Retinopathy:** It is a type of clinical entity that occurs in the absence of malignancy. It is used as a diagnosis of exclusion.\n\n【6】What Is the Epidemiology of Autoimmune Retinopathy?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Autoimmune retinopathy is a very rare disorder. Of all the clinical phenotypes, non-paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy is the most prevalent autoimmune retinopathy and cancer-associated retinopathy is the most commonly found paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy. Females are more commonly affected than males. The onset of the disorder most commonly occurs in the age group of 50 to 60 years. Other cancers have also been found to be associated with cancer-associated retinopathy such as small-cell carcinoma of the lung, breast cancer, cancer of the uterus, ovarian cancer, and cervical cancer.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【9】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【10】Interferons - First Line Defense of Body Immunity\n\n【11】Importance of Glucose\n\n【12】Double Diabetes- Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\n【13】What Is the Pathogenesis of Autoimmune Retinopathy?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The pathogenesis of the disorder involves the circulation of antiretinal antibodies that are directed against the retinal antigens and attack them. These retinal antigens are retinal proteins with immunologic properties. Recoverin and enolase have been identified as the two main retinal proteins. The antibody that is targeted towards recoverin causes degeneration of the retinal rods and cones by the process of apoptosis. Enolase enzyme is found in the cell membranes of ganglion cells, rods, and cones in the retina. Viral or bacterial infection can act as a triggering agent for this autoimmune reaction.\n\n【15】What Are the Clinical Features of Autoimmune Retinopathy?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】The clinical features of cancer-associated retinopathy and melanoma-associated retinopathy are almost similar because both of them are paraneoplastic disorders.\n\n【17】The main symptoms include:\n\n【18】*   Vision loss is painless and can be permanent.\n\n【19】*   Blind spot (the area where the optic disk is passed by the optic nerve) formation in vision.\n\n【20】*   Photopsia (presence of light flashes in the field of vision).\n\n【21】*   Nyctalopia (a condition characterized by the inability of the individual to see at night due to vitamin A deficiency).\n\n【22】*   Scotomas (partially diminished visual area in the retina).\n\n【23】*   Avoidance of light (photopsia).\n\n【24】*   Lack of contrast sensitivity.\n\n【25】*   Partial color blindness.\n\n【26】*   Reduced night vision.\n\n【27】How Is Autoimmune Retinopathy Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【28】The patient needs to be investigated thoroughly. The diagnosis is quite difficult due to overlapping clinical features with other similar diseases. Ophthalmic examination of the inner surface of the eye (fundus of the eye) is usually carried out. Fundus examination exhibits blood vessel constriction, discoloration of the optic disc, and retinal degeneration. However, the results of the fundus examination are not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of the lesion. An electroretinogram (eye test that is used to see the retinal abnormalities) is usually performed to detect autoimmune retinopathy. An abnormal electroretinogram in response to light and dark adaptations is suggestive of autoimmune retinopathy. The electroretinogram also helps to distinguish between the various types of paraneoplastic retinopathies. If cone responses are seen in the electroretinogram, cancer-associated retinopathy may be diagnosed at an earlier stage. Melanoma-associated retinopathy can be diagnosed if the electroretinogram shows a considerable reduction in b-wave amplitude. Western blotting of the patient’s serum can be carried out to analyze the retinal antibodies to confirm the diagnosis of autoimmune retinopathy.\n\n【29】What Is the Treatment of Autoimmune Retinopathy?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】A multidisciplinary team is crucial for the appropriate treatment and control of the disorder. The possibility of neoplasia can be investigated by an oncologist in cases of cancer-associated neoplasia. A rheumatologist, ophthalmologist, and other specialists are required to work in a well-coordinated manner to treat this rare condition. Immunosuppressive drugs such as Azathioprine, Cyclosporine, Infliximab, and intravenous immunoglobulins are usually suggested by the healthcare professional for the therapy. It usually takes years to treat the condition.\n\n【31】Corticosteroids are also recommended by the doctor to stabilize the disease. Combined therapy is usually preferred to treat the condition. Plasmapheresis (the process of plasma removal from the blood of the patient after withdrawing it) is also considered a treatment modality but this treatment approach is more effective when applied before the visual loss. This technique works by reducing the number of circulating antibodies thereby reducing the damage to the photoreceptors.\n\n【32】Visual field examination along with electroretinography should be repeated every three to six months for follow-up and to monitor the condition of the patient. In cases of malignant tumors, management can be done with the help of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, these procedures do not alter the prognosis of visual signs and symptoms. In addition to immunosuppression therapy, multivitamin supplements with antioxidants such as beta-carotene, lutein, ascorbic acid, and vitamin E can be suggested to reduce retinal degeneration.\n\n【33】What Is the Prognosis of Autoimmune Retinopathy?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】It is difficult to diagnose the condition. So, it is a challenging task to manage the disease. No specific treatment has been established for autoimmune retinopathy till date. So, it is important to seek medical advice at an early stage to prevent irreveresible damage to the retina.\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】Autoimmune retinopathy is an uncommon disease entity in which the immune system of the patient attacks the proteins present in the retina. This can often lead to loss of vision in the affected individual. Since it is very difficult to diagnose the disease because of its clinical similarities to other disorders, it is very important to maintain a high level of a suspicion index to always remain alert while diagnosing the disorder. Early diagnosis and therapeutic management may play a crucial role to decrease the immunological risk of irreversible damage to the patient’s retinal cells in autoimmune retinopathy. A multi-disciplinary team should be approached for thorough evaluation and treatment of the condition.\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>*   American academy of ophthalmology - Diagnosis and Management of Autoimmune Retinopathy  \n    https://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/diagnosis-and-management-of-autoimmune-retinopathy\n*   National library of medicine - Autoimmune Retinopathy  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3946999/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The skin during the winter season appears to be,\n\n【4】*   Scaly.\n\n【5】*   Red.\n\n【6】*   Itchy.\n\n【7】*   Rough-in texture.\n\n【8】*   Raw.\n\n【9】*   Irritated.\n\n【10】*   Cracks.\n\n【11】*   Burning.\n\n【12】*   Feeling tight.\n\n【13】Why Does the Skin Appear Dry During Winter?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Skin becomes dry during winter because of the following factors:-\n\n【15】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【16】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-3:<u>Which product is safe for my skin to look lighter?</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-3:<u>Is it safe to take a prematurely born six month old baby to a hill station during winter?</u>\n\n【19】Please suggest some skin care tips to get a healthy glowing skin.\n\n【20】*   Wind blowing across the face causes the evaporation of moisture in the skin, making it tight and dry.\n*   Depletion of natural oils in the skin due to overwashing or using skincare products causes dryness.\n\n【21】*   Decreasing sun exposure is a source of vitamin D, and sunlight has an anti-inflammatory effect on the skin.\n\n【22】*   Indoor air pollution.\n\n【23】*   Humidity levels.\n\n【24】*   Lifestyle changes.\n\n【25】*   Alcohol intake.\n\n【26】*   There can be genetic reasons as well. Some people have dry skin as they cannot produce filaggrin, a protein that helps hydrate the skin.\n\n【27】How Can One Take Care of the Skin?\n----------------------------------\n\n【28】**1) Stay Hydrated**: During winter, people tend to avoid drinking water. But hydrating the body is essential not only to maintain skin health but also for overall health. It is hard to believe that even in this cold winter, people lose water from their bodies and should load water in to manage it.\n\n【29】**2) Healthy Diet**: The nourishment to the skin should be taken internally and externally. Eating fruits and vegetables would help keep the skin healthy. The omega-3 fatty acid is good for the skin and can be gained by eating cold-water fish and flaxseeds.\n\n【30】**3) Moisturize the Skin**: Moisturizers are essential during the winter season because they form a protective layer on the skin which retains moisture and makes sure the natural oils of the skin are not lost. Use oil-based moisturizers rather than water-based ones to lock the moisture content. In addition, moisturizers have to be applied immediately after a shower and not on dry skin.\n\n【31】Moisturizers that can be used are,\n\n【32】*   Non-clogging oils such as avocado oil, primrose, or almond oil.\n\n【33】*   Lotions contain humectants like glycerine, sorbitol, alpha hydroxy acid, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides.\n\n【34】*   Lotions containing glycerine and petroleum jelly can be used for moisturizing the feet.\n\n【35】*   Moisturizers that are rich in omega-3,6,9 fatty acids and cholesterol.\n*   Creams with niacinamide even the skin tone and improve the barrier function of the skin.\n\n【36】*   Natural moisturizers like coconut oil, olive oil, buttermilk, and cucumber.\n\n【37】*   Others are apple cider vinegar, shea butter, and argan oil.\n\n【38】*   Sandalwood oil can be used on the face.\n\n【39】**4) Apply Sunscreen**: It is not a rule that sunscreen has to be applied only in summer. There is a necessity for sunscreen even in the winter. A broad-spectrum sunscreen can be applied 30 minutes before going out. Sunscreen should be applied not only on the face but also on the hands, legs, and feet, and for lips, lip balm should be applied.\n\n【40】**5) Exfoliate the Skin**: Exfoliate twice or thrice a week. Exfoliation removes the dry, dead skin built and allows the penetration of moisturizers. If a person over-exfoliates, it removes the natural oils from the skin and makes it feel dry and itchy.\n\n【41】Exfoliators that can be used are,\n\n【42】*   Neem.\n\n【43】*   Tulsi.\n\n【44】*   Strawberry.\n\n【45】*   Papaya.\n\n【46】*   Light alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) and beta-hydroxy acid (BHA).\n\n【47】**6) Choose the Right Skin Care Products**: Choose products wisely according to the skin type. For example, using oily lotion on a person with oily skin will clog the pores and lead to a breakout. Avoid the usage of peels, masks, and alcohol-based products. Use cleansing milk or mild foaming cleanser, toner with zero alcohol, and a deeply hydrating mask.\n\n【48】**7) Consistent Skin Care**: Choose better products that hydrate the skin and follow the routine of cleansing, toning, and using moisturizer and sunscreen.\n\n【49】**8) Lukewarm Water Bath**: As hot water can worsen the skin condition, instead of switching to cold water, using lukewarm water will be the best choice.\n\n【50】**9) Reduce the Showering Time and Frequency**: Overwashing the skin can lead to dryness, and also heat in the water dries the natural oil of the skin. Hence, five to ten minutes of shower is more than enough.\n\n【51】**10) Wear Appropriate Clothes**: Wearing the usual clothes that people wear for summer can also make their skin dry and itchy. So clothes have to be swapped according to the season. Wool, rough clothing on direct contact with the skin can cause irritation and itching. So wear cotton or silk clothing directly touching the skin and then pull on a warm sweater.\n\n【52】**11) Wear Gloves**: Our skin is thin on the hands and has fewer oil glands. To keep it moist, wearing gloves is a must to prevent the drying of the skin. But wet gloves should be avoided as they may cause itching, cracking, sores, and eczema. Use leather gloves if woolen gloves are itching.\n\n【53】**12) Vibrating Brushes**: Vibration helps drain the toxins and fluids that cause puffiness of the skin. These vibrating brushes clear the pores on the skin and allow penetration of anti-aging products.\n\n【54】**13) Humidifiers:** They aid in adding moisture to the air and prevent drying of the skin.\n\n【55】What Are the Home Remedies for Glowing Winter Skin?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】*   **Aloe Vera**: It is a great moisturizer and helps in acne control, and reduces wrinkles on the skin.\n\n【57】*   **Honey**: It keeps bacteria away from the skin and boosts the glow of the skin\n\n【58】*   **Yogurt**: It is a natural exfoliator that dissolves dead skin cells.\n\n【59】*   **Buttermilk**: It also acts as an exfoliator and fades away dark spots.\n\n【60】*   **Egg**: The fatty acid and water content in the egg acts as a moisturizer. The egg white tightens the pores on the skin.\n\n【61】*   **Slices of Potato**: It helps in treating dry skin and reducing wrinkles and puffy eyes.\n\n【62】When to Consult a Doctor?\n-------------------------\n\n【63】There are a lot of ways to keep the skin moist and glowing in winter. However, if it does not work and the skin condition worsens, seek help from a specialist. They will analyze the skin type, give a skincare regimen, and advise the person about the skincare products and what to use and what not to use.\n\n【64】What if Dry Skin Is Not Treated?\n--------------------------------\n\n【65】Untreated and dry skin can lead to:\n\n【66】*   **Infections**: Severely dry skin usually has cracks that allow bacteria to enter deep into the skin layers.\n\n【67】*   **Eczema or Atopic Dermatitis**: If people are already prone to eczema, dry skin can lead to rash and cracking.\n\n【68】*   **Itch-Scratch Cycle**: Dry skin can lead to repeated scratching of the affected area. On persistent scratching, the area of the skin becomes thickened and later leads to lichen simplex chronicus.\n\n【69】**Conclusion**:\n\n【70】The lack of nourishment to the skin, both externally and internally, is the cause of dry, itchy, and parched skin. The skin care tips would help one to get rid of the harsh effects of winter and gives a brighter complexion. The healthy and glowing skin people dream of depends on the effort and time they spend to maintain it.\n\n【71】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【72】无关删除-1:<u>*   Winter skin care: Keep your skin in top shape through the cold, dry winter  \n    https://www.reidhealth.org/blog/winter-skin-care-keep-your-skin-in-top-shape-through-the-cold-dry-winter\n*   How to get glowing skin  \n    https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-to-get-glowing-skin\n*   Winter Skin Care Tips: Easy Tips To Keep Your Skin Glowing This Winter  \n    https://www.ndtv.com/food/winter-skin-care-tips-easy-tips-to-keep-your-skin-glowing-this-winter-1980203</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "efd4623c-b07b-4c65-bf9f-a2cb05509919", "title": "Ureterolysis - Kicks off the Block", "text": "【0】Ureterolysis - Kicks off the Block\nWhat Is Ureterolysis?\n---------------------\n\n【1】The ureters carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. However, pressure from a scar or mass of tissue can block one or both of the ureters. This causes urine to build up in the kidneys rather than flow out of the body. Ureterolysis is a procedure that aids in treating this problem. With this surgery, the ureter is released from the tissue pressing on it. The ureter is then shifted to a new position away from the blockage.\n\n【2】The surgery can be done through various small incisions (laparoscopy), or it can be done through one larger incision (open surgery). Laparoscopy cannot be used in all possibilities. In some cases, the surgeon can start the surgery with laparoscopy but then change to open surgery for safety reasons.\n\n【3】**Laparoscopy** - The surgeon creates several small incisions in the abdomen. The scope is positioned through one of the small incisions. This sends images from inside the belly to a video screen. Surgical instruments are placed through the other incisions. The surgeon can use a method called robotic laparoscopy. The robotic system gives a 3-D (3 dimensional) picture of the body. It also aids the surgeon’s hand movements.\n\n【4】**Open Surgery** - One larger incision is made in the belly. The surgeon looks and works through this incision.\n\n【5】What Is the Procedure for the Surgery?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【6】First, inform the surgeon about all the medicines. This includes prescriptions and medicines that include herbs, vitamins, and other supplements. It also includes blood thinners, such as Warfarin, Clopidogrel, or daily Aspirin. One may need to stop taking some or all of them before surgery, as directed by the surgeon.\n\n【7】Following any directions that are given for not eating or drinking before the surgery is necessary. If medications have been prescribed, take them with a small sip of water.\n\n【8】A special liquid or medicine is given to take the day before the surgery. This is to make sure that the colon is empty for the surgery.\n\n【9】**On the Day of Surgery -**\n\n【10】The surgery can take about three to six hours. The hospital can last for one to three nights afterward for recovery.\n\n【11】**Before the Surgery Begins -**\n\n【12】*   An intravenous line is placed in a vein in the arm or hand. This is done to provide fluids and medicines such as antibiotics. It can also include medicine to prevent blood clots.\n\n【13】*   General anesthesia is given before the surgery for a pain-free procedure. This medicine induces sleep throughout surgery. In addition, a tube can be put into the throat to help to breathe.\n\n【14】*   An epidural to help control post-surgery pain is also given. A small tube is placed into the back to deliver painkillers that numb the lower body. A thin catheter is placed into the bladder to drain urine.\n\n【15】**During the Surgery -**\n\n【16】*   One or more incisions are put together to get to the ureters. The number of incisions depends on the mode of surgery being used. The ureter is released from the tissue around it.\n\n【17】*   The reason for the blockage is removed, if possible. This may contain removing scar tissue or a mass that’s pressing on the ureter.\n\n【18】*   The ureter is shifted to a new position that lets it drain better. It is secured in place with stitches (sutures).\n\n【19】*   A thin tube (stent) may be positioned in the ureter as it heals. The stent enables the ureter to widen so urine can flow through it correctly.\n\n【20】*   If required, treatment is also done on the other ureter.\n\n【21】*   When the surgery is accomplished, all tools are removed. All the incisions are closed with stitches or staples. In some cases, surgical strips, glue, or surgical tape are used instead.\n\n【22】*   A small tube (drain) is positioned near the incision. This drains the fluid that tends to build up after the surgery.\n\n【23】**Recovering in the Hospital -**\n\n【24】After the surgery, the patient is taken to a recovery room. There they will be watched while waking up from the anesthesia. The patient may feel sleepy and nauseated. If a breathing tube is used, then the throat may be sore at first. When the patient is ready, he will be taken to the hospital room. While in the hospital:\n\n【25】*   The patient will get medicine to handle pain. Let the physician know if the pain is not controlled.\n\n【26】*   The catheter and drain are possibly removed before returning home. If not, then instructions are given showing how to care for them at home.\n\n【27】**Recovering at Home -**\n\n【28】After the hospital stay, the patient will be released to an adult family member or friend. The patient must have someone stay with them for the next few days to help care for them. Healing time varies for each person. Then, the physician will inform the patient when to return to the normal routine. Until then, following the instructions that have been given is necessary.\n\n【29】*   Take all medications as prescribed.\n\n【30】*   Care for the incisions as advised.\n\n【31】*   Follow the physician's guidelines for showering. Do not take a bath, swim, use a hot tub, or do other things that will cover the incision with water until the physician says.\n\n【32】*   Do not lift anything hefty or do strenuous activities, as directed.\n\n【33】*   Do not drive until the physician says to. When taking medications that cause sleepiness or drowsiness, avoid driving.\n\n【34】*   Walk a periodic time daily. Increase the pace and distance.\n\n【35】*   Do not push to pass stool. If required, take stool softeners as directed by the healthcare provider.\n\n【36】*   Drink plenty of water to prevent urine odor and fluid loss (dehydration). And follow any other diet instructions given by the physician.\n\n【37】*   If stents were placed in the ureters, a feeling or urge to pass urine is more often. There may also be some burning and blood in the urine, which is normal. It will go out once the stents are removed during a follow-up visit.\n\n【38】When to Seek Medical Help?\n--------------------------\n\n【39】Seek medical help right away if any of the following happens -\n\n【40】*   Chest pain.\n\n【41】*   Fever of 100.4° F (38°C) or higher, or as directed by the physician.\n\n【42】*   Hematuria with clots.\n\n【43】*   Symptoms of infection at an incision site (like increased redness or swelling, warmth, worsening pain, or bad-smelling drainage).\n\n【44】*   No urination for four hours or trouble urinating.\n\n【45】*   Pain that cannot be controlled with painkillers.\n\n【46】*   Nausea or vomiting.\n\n【47】*   Leg pain.\n\n【48】*   Swelling or inflammation.\n\n【49】*   Trouble breathing.\n\n【50】What Are the Risks and Possible Complications of Ureterolysis Surgery?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【51】Possible risks of the ureterolysis procedure include -\n\n【52】*   Infection.\n\n【53】*   Bleeding (that can require a blood transfusion).\n\n【54】*   Blood clots.\n\n【55】*   Urine leakage from one or both ureters.\n\n【56】*   Scarring or blockage of one or both ureters.\n\n【57】*   Damage to the bladder, kidney, bowels, or other organs.\n\n【58】*   Risks of anesthesia.\n\n【59】**Conclusion**:\n\n【60】Ureteral obstruction due to idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is an occasional but severe clinical situation. There are open approaches, as well as surgical techniques used to prevent stenosis recurrence. Ureterolysis is the only procedure to relieve ureteral obstruction. The ureter is examined and released from the fibrotic process and then separated to prevent the recurrence of the stenosis. Lately, the development of laparoscopic urology has authorized minimal invasive treatment of many urological problems. The technique of ureterolysis for extrinsic ureteral obstruction can be applied.\n\n【61】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【62】无关删除-1:<u>*   \\[Ureterolysis: technique, indications\\]  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15830549/\n*   Ureterolysis for extrinsic ureteral obstruction: a comparison of laparoscopic and open surgical techniques  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8808882/\n*   Optimization of Ureterolysis During Hysterectomy  \n    https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03123315</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

With the help of X-rays, doctors can suspect diseases in vital organs like the heart and lungs, hard structures like ribs and the spine, and soft tissues like blood vessels. Before taking other scans, medical professionals prefer X-rays as an interpreting diagnostic tool. An X-ray is produced by radiation at a particular frequency.\n\n【2】What Are the Uses of Chest X-Rays?\n----------------------------------\n\n【3】*   **Pleural Effusion** - The pool of fluid collected in the chest cavity is revealed with the help of X-rays. This condition is called pleural effusion.\n\n【4】*   **Cardiomyopathy** \\- The size, shape, and structure of the organs, like the heart and lungs, are observed. Because any alteration in the structure of these organs in the X-rays shows the initial signs of lung or heart disease; for example, cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the heart size is enlarged.\n\n【5】*   **Restrictive Lung Disease** - The location of the lungs in the chest cavity behind the ribs is carefully monitored using X-rays by medical professionals. The constriction or stiffness of the lungs can be determined using X-rays. The condition is called restrictive lung disease.\n\n【6】*   **Aneurysm** - Main arteries like the aorta and pulmonary arteries are important for the blood flow to the organs like the heart and lungs. Any abnormality or inflammation in the blood vessels can be noticed using X-rays. This condition is called an aneurysm.\n\n【7】*   **Fracture in Ribs** - Motorcycle accidents, injuries during paragliding, and mountain climbing can fracture the ribs. These fractures can be interpreted in chest X-rays.\n\n【8】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Lateral Decubitus Chest X-Ray - Indications, Procedure, and Evaluation Criteria</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    My chest x-ray result shows pulmonary hyperaerated, bilateral.

These calcific nodules present over the heart tissue can be identified with chest X-rays.\n\n【10】*   **Hernia** \\- The position of the diaphragm is analyzed using X-rays. If there is a displacement of the diaphragm, it indicates a sign of a hernia.\n\n【11】*   **Tumor** - The abnormal growth of tissues in the airways and lungs is called lung cancer. The tumor is diagnosed using X-rays.\n\n【12】*   **Medical Devices** - The pacemakers are connected to the heart to regulate the heart rate. The patient undergoing dialysis has a flexible tube called a catheter attached to them for distributing the medicines. The position of the medical devices like pacemakers and catheters are reviewed by the medical professionals using chest X-rays after placement.\n\n【13】*   **Surgery** \\- During the insertion of the needle in the thoracentesis procedure or during the drainage of air or fluid with a tube insertion in pneumothorax, X-rays are used to identify the position of the tools during the surgery.\n    </u>\n\n【14】What Are the Limitations of Using a Chest X-Ray?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】*   X-rays must be taken only on the advice of medical professionals. The patient may be exposed to radiation, so take X-rays only if it is essential.\n\n【16】*   Chest X-rays cover only the upper part of the body. Though the radiation of chest X-rays is low, pregnant patients must not be exposed to X-rays because X-rays may affect the development of the fetus.\n\n【17】*   If a series of X-rays are taken to monitor the symptoms, the patient will be continuously exposed to the radiation. It may affect patients with weak immune systems.\n\n【18】*   Continuous exposure to the X-rays may damage the reproductive mechanism because the radiations affect the nature of sperm in males and eggs in females.\n\n【19】What Are the Instructions to Follow During an X-Ray Imaging?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】*   Remove the metallic things like watches and gold ornaments as they remain as a hindrance for the X-rays to pass through the body.\n\n【21】*   The patients are advised to wear a green or blue gown given in the hospital while imaging because this thin gown allows the rays to pass through the hard and soft tissue of the body easily.\n\n【22】*   The patient must wear a protective covering for other structures to avoid exposure. For example, the abdomen can be protected from X-rays using a lead apron.\n\n【23】What Are the Advantages of a Chest X-Ray?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【24】*   It is cost-effective compared to other diagnostic methods like CT (computed tomography) scans and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans.\n\n【25】*   Patients with pacemakers are contraindicated from taking an MRI scan due to the magnetic field. In that case, X-rays can be used.\n\n【26】*   The radiation level of CT scans and MRIs is comparatively higher than the radiation level of X-rays.\n\n【27】*   The patient who has done surgery might have discomfort standing for a longer period. Since X-rays take only three to five minutes, it is a comfortable and quick procedure.\n\n【28】How Is the Chest X-Ray Procedure Performed?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【29】*   A consent form must be signed by the patient before imaging the chest X-rays. Read the complete form and sign it appropriately.\n\n【30】*   There are no restrictions on eating or drinking for imaging chest X-rays. Also, the patient need not stop the blood-thinning medications.\n\n【31】*   Chest X-ray imaging can be performed in a sitting or standing position. The patient is positioned before an X-ray plate.\n\n【32】*   After taking a deep breath, the shoulders must be pushed forward. It is held in the same position until the X-rays are imaged. Listen to the instructions of the operator carefully. The operator will stand behind the wooden wall during imaging.\n\n【33】*   Inform the operator if the patient is unable to hold his breath for a longer period.\n\n【34】*   Standing still is very important during X-ray imaging because motion affects the quality of the image.\n\n【35】*   During imaging of the side angle of the chest, the patient is asked to turn sideways with the hands lifted above the head for a clear image.\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】Chest X-rays are taken before the surgery involving the chest cavity. It is also used to observe the prognosis of the condition after the surgery. So a series of X-rays are taken periodically to monitor the symptoms of the systemic conditions. Chest X-rays are simple procedures that do not require any sedation. No additional care is required after the X-ray imaging.\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>*   The Chest Radiograph  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632825/\n*   Radiation in Healthcare: X-Rays  \n    https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/x-rays.html\n*   Radiation in medicine: Origins, risks and aspirations  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4355517/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Men on one hand consider their sexuality as a jewel of their manhood crown. On the other hand women are forbidden to discuss about their sexuality. It is considered to be their duty and responsibity to fulfil the sexual needs of their male partner. By doing so, their own sexual requirements and problems remain neglected. This is not happening since last few years, but has been a continous problem since the origin of the human race. This article is one step taken towards improvement in the understanding and thus creating awareness about sexual health among females.\n\n【1】**Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (FSIAD)** is a common but least discussed sexual health topic among females. In males inability to experience sexual pleasure while having sexual intercourse or sexual practices and reduced desire for such activities is called Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (MHSDD). Similar to MHSDD, females experience FSIAD the prevalence of which varies from **16-55%** across different regions. FSIAD improves on its own once the emotional and psychological well-being is established. However, with advancing age this problem increases in prevalence due to hormonal changes. This article throws light on Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder, a common but least discussed sexual health topic among females.\n\n【2】How to Diagnose FSIAD?\n----------------------\n\n【3】FSIAD is diagnosed on the following basis:\n\n【4】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【5】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-3:<u>I took I-pill after unprotected sex on the 7th day of my periods.

Why?\n\n【9】*   Absent or reduced sexual interest in sexual activity.\n\n【10】*   Absent or reduced erotic thoughts or fantasies.\n\n【11】*   Absence of or reduced initiation or receptivity to sexual activity.\n\n【12】*   Absent or reduced sexual excitement/pleasure during sexual activity in all or almost all (75–100%) encounters in contexts identified as problematic or, if the problem is generalized, in all contexts.\n\n【13】*   Absent or reduced sexual interest/arousal to sexual/erotic cues.\n\n【14】*   Absent or reduced sensations during sexual activity in all or almost all encounters in contexts identified as problematic or, if the problem is generalized, in all contexts.\n\n【15】At least 3 of the above mentioned criterias should be present to make a diagnosis of FSIAD. It is also associated with painful intercourse, female orgasmic disorder, desire and sexual preferences discrepancies in a couple. Also attention needs to be paid towards assessment of associated mood disturbances, anxiety, physical and sexual abuse, relationship issues, internalization of sexual conflicts.\n\n【16】What Causes FSIAD?\n------------------\n\n【17】Multiple factors are responsible for FSIAD, which include the following:\n\n【18】*   **Biological causes** - thyroid dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, arthritis, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, urogenital/pelvic cancers.\n\n【19】*   **Medications** also result in FSIAD. These include antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), antihypertensives, oral contraceptives, reduced steroid hormone levels. Medications might result in reduced estrogen levels, hence resulting in reduced sexual desire.\n\n【20】*   **Psychological causes** includes major depressive disorder, anxiety, relationship issues, conflict related to body self image, substance abuse, physical/sexual abuse.\n\n【21】*   **Social/environment causes** includes reduced partner sexual interest, partner sexual dysfunction, lower socio-economic status.\n\n【22】How to Treat FSIAD?\n-------------------\n\n【23】Like most of the other sexual disorders, FSIAD is also treatable. Treatment includes the following measures:\n\n【24】**1\\. Pharmacological Measures:**\n\n【25】*   Hormonal replacement is done to **increase the estrogen level**. Either estrogen supplements alone or estrogen in combination with progesterone can be used. It will increase the lubrication, will reduce the vaginal dryness and atrophy thereby reducing the discomfort associated with coitus (sexual intercourse). It is more effective in menopausal cases. Testosterone supplements can also be used.\n\n【26】*   **Flibanserin**, an agonist and antagonist to serotonin receptors can also be used.\n\n【27】*   **Bupropion**, used for SSRIs induced FSIAD.\n\n【28】*   Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5 inhibitors like Sildenafil, Tadalafil, Vardenafil) can also be used.\n\n【29】**2\\. Psychological Measures:**\n\n【30】*   Sensate focus therapy which involves sexual exercises that promote awareness of self and partner's needs.\n\n【31】*   Sexual skill training.\n\n【32】*   Communication skill training.\n\n【33】*   Mindfulness based CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy).\n\n【34】**3\\. Combination of both pharmacological and psychological measures** can also be used in increasing the response rate.\n\n【35】The main aim of these measures is to increase the reinforcing value of sexual activities via increase in arousal, orgasm, pleasure and physical and emotional satisfaction. This also aims at improving the non sexual conditions such as relationship dynamics, stressors, timing and context so as to facilitate the sexual interactions.\n\n【36】To conclude with, FSIAD is a psychological disorder common to be found. It is not a matter to feel shy and hence has to be discussed. Rather females have equal right to seek pleasure as do the males.\n\n【37】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【38】* * *\n\n【39】#### **1.**删除换行**What Can Be the Physiological Causes of Female Sexual Arousal Disorder?**\n\n【40】The physiological causes of FSAD (Female sexual arousal disorder) may include:  \n\\- Damage of the blood vessels in the pelvic region resulting in reduced blood flow.  \n\\- Damage of the nerves in the pelvic area resulting in diminished arousal.  \n\\- General medical conditions like high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus can damage blood vessels.  \n\\- Nursing a baby (lactation).  \n\\- General medical conditions like adrenal gland disorders, thyroid disorders, and removal of the ovaries cause changes in the hormone level.  \n\\- Low levels of sex hormones due to aging.  \n\\- Side effects of medications like antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs, drugs to lower the blood pressure, birth control pills, sedatives, or other hormone-containing pills.\n\n【41】#### **2.**删除换行**What Can Be the Hormonal Causes of Female Sexual Arousal Disorder?**\n\n【42】Sexual problems usually develop when the hormones are in flux, such as after having a baby or during menopause.  \n\\- Low levels of estrogen after menopause can also lead to changes in your genital tissues and sexual responsiveness.  \n\\- A decrease in estrogen level can lead to decreased blood flow to the pelvic region, resulting in less genital sensation and more time to build arousal and reach orgasm.  \n\\- The vaginal lining will become thinner and less elastic, mainly if not sexually active. These factors can lead to painful intercourse, also known as dyspareunia.  \n\\- The body's hormone levels also shift after giving birth and during breastfeeding, leading to vaginal dryness and can affect the desire to have sex.\n\n【43】#### **3.**删除换行**Who Can Get Female Sexual Arousal Disorder?**\n\n【44】Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is the persistent, recurrent problems with sexual response, desire, orgasm, or pain that can cause distress or strain your relationship with your partner.  \n\\- Women with decreased blood flow to the genital area are believed to get FSAD similar to vascular disease in male erectile dysfunction.  \n\\- Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) can occur at any stage of life.  \n\\- Women who have depression or anxiety, heart, blood vessel disease, neurological conditions, gynecological conditions, certain medications, and a history of sexual abuse can get FSAD.\n\n【45】#### **4.**删除换行**How Is Female Sexual Arousal Disorder Diagnosed?**\n\n【46】If you have a minimum of three of the following, you might have FSAD (Female Sexual Arousal Disorder):  \n\\- Less interest in sex.  \n\\- Fewer thoughts related to sex.  \n\\- Reduced start and denying of sex.  \n\\- Little pleasure during sex.  \n\\- Decreased interest in sex.  \n\\- Less genital sensations during sex most of the time.\n\n【47】#### **5.**删除换行**What Are the Factors Associated With Female Sexual Arousal Disorder?**\n\n【48】The factors associated with female sexual arousal disorder are medical health, hormones, medications, and psychological factors, including stress, relationships, comorbid mental illness, and history of sexual abuse.\n\n【49】#### **6.**删除换行**When To Seek Help for Female Sexual Arousal Disorder?**\n\n【50】It is usual for females to have fluctuations in sexual desire in some part of life. However, a total loss of interest in sex, or difficulty responding to stimulation, may indicate female sexual arousal disorder (FSIAD). This condition can be lifelong or may be acquired, which needs medical attention.\n\n【51】#### **7.**删除换行**What Can Be The Signs of Female Sexual Arousal Disorder?**\n\n【52】The signs of female sexual arousal disorder are:  \n\\- Low sexual drive.  \n\\- Orgasmic disorder.  \n\\- Pain during sexual stimulation or vaginal contact.  \n\\- Lesser or no sexual thoughts.  \n\\- Decreased sexual pleasure during sexual activity.  \n\\- Lesser or no arousal in response to visual, written, or verbal cues.  \n\\- Infrequent or no beginning of sexual activity within a relationship.  \n\\- Reduced or no sensations in the genitals.  \n\\- Symptoms lasting for more than six months.  \n\\- Significant distress about the symptoms.  \n\\- Symptoms that are not more accurately explained by a nonsexual mental health disorder, domestic abuse, medication, substance abuse, or another medical condition.  \n\\- Difficulty in achieving orgasm after sufficient sexual arousal and continuous stimulation.\n\n【53】#### **8.**删除换行**How Prevalent Is Female Sexual Interest Arousal Disorder?**\n\n【54】Female sexual interest arousal disorder prevalence is often unknown, although some older women report less distress about experiencing low sexual desire than younger women. About 3.3 percent of participants between the ages of 18 and 44 have female sexual arousal disorder, while 7.5 percent of participants between the ages of 45 and 64 experienced it. The prevalence also varies depending on the age, cultural background, duration of symptoms, and presence of distress.\n\n【55】#### **9.**删除换行**How To Treat Female Sexual Arousal Disorder?**\n\n【56】The effective treatment for sexual dysfunction is often addressing an underlying medical condition or hormonal change.

This medicine is given to adults who suffered from rhythm disorder in the past but now have normal heart rhythms. However, the drug has to be prescribed cautiously as it may increase the chances of death if mishandled. Dronedarone helps maintain a normal heart rhythm and lowers the chances of going to the hospital for atrial fibrillation.\n\n【2】How Does Dronedarone Work?\n--------------------------\n\n【3】Dronedarone is used in patients with a previous history of irregular heartbeats (either persistent atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal) but presently have a normal heartbeat. The drug functions to keep the heartbeat low so that there is no need to go to the hospital due to atrial fibrillation. However, the drug should not be used in cases of permanent atrial fibrillation because it may lead to serious side effects.\n\n【4】**Precautions for Taking Dronedarone:**\n\n【5】**Allergies**: It is essential to tell the doctor about any allergic reactions before starting the drug because Dronedarone may contain some inactive ingredients, which may lead to allergies or other problems.\n\n【6】*   Taking a patient's history for any liver disease or irregular heartbeat is essential as the medicine might have serious side effects in such cases.\n\n【7】*   Dronedarone may affect the heart rhythm by extending the QT prolongation. This may cause fast and irregular heartbeats, which can be fatal. This may lead to symptoms such as dizziness and fainting.\n\n【8】*   Low levels of magnesium and potassium also increase the chance of QT prolongation. This happens due to the consumption of water pills or diuretics. It is important to mention the administration of these drugs to the doctor before starting Dronedarone.\n\n【9】**Warning**:\n\n【10】Dronedarone is not recommended in cases of permanent atrial fibrillation as it may increase the risk of death and cause some severe heart conditions. It is important to consult the doctor if there is an irregular pulse, wheezing, or chest tightness.\n\n【11】**For Patients**:\n\n【12】What Is Atrial Fibrillation?\n----------------------------\n\n【13】Atrial fibrillation is an irregular and generally rapid heart rhythm that can lead to blood clot formation in the heart. It can potentially develop risks of heart stroke, heart failure, and other heart complications. In atrial fibrillation cases, the heart's upper chambers, known as atria, beats irregularly and chaotically. The atria do not sync with the lower chambers, known as ventricles. The episodes of atrial fibrillation may be persistent or it may come and go.\n\n【14】What Are the Symptoms of Atrial Fibrillation?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Generally, people suffering from atrial fibrillation do not notice any symptoms, but if they appear, they are:\n\n【16】*   Chest pain.\n\n【17】*   Fatigue and dizziness.\n\n【18】*   Reduced ability to exercise.\n\n【19】*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【20】*   Weakness and lightheadedness.\n\n【21】What Are the Types of Atrial Fibrillation?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【22】*   **Persistent**: This type of atrial fibrillation is continuous and does not go back to its normal position on its own.\n\n【23】*   **Occasional (Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation)**: The symptoms of atrial fibrillation come and go within a few minutes to hours. Sometimes the episodes may last for around a week and it can be repeated.\n\n【24】*   **Long-Standing Persistent**: This type of fibrillation is continuous and may last up to twelve months.\n\n【25】*   **Permanent**: Atrial fibrillation is permanent, in which the heartbeat cannot be restored. Medications are required to control the heartbeat and prevent clot formation.\n\n【26】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Pimavanserin- Uses, Warnings, and Pharmacology</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u></u>\n\n【27】**Before Taking the Drug:**\n\n【28】**Things to Tell the Doctor Before Taking the Drug:**\n\n【29】Some conditions should be considered before starting the drug Dronedarone.\n\n【30】These are:\n\n【31】*   Severe heart conditions such as AV block, sick sinus syndrome, or in cases of slow heartbeats may lead to fainting.\n\n【32】*   Severe liver diseases may interfere with the metabolism of the drug.\n\n【33】*   If there were lung or liver problems after consumption of a drug called Amiodarone.\n\n【34】*   In case of pregnancy or breastfeeding, it may affect infants' development.\n\n【35】**Contraindications for Dronedarone:**\n\n【36】*   Cases of severe heart failure.\n\n【37】*   If the person is recently hospitalized for severe heart failure symptoms such as chest tightness, shortness of breath, swelling, or rapid weight gain.\n\n【38】*   Cases of atrial fibrillation are permanent. It cannot be changed back to a normal rhythm.\n\n【39】**While Taking the Drug:**\n\n【40】**Doses of Dronedarone:**\n\n【41】The drug is consumed in a quantity of 400 mg in the oral form twice a day with a meal in the morning and evening.\n\n【42】How to Take Dronedarone?\n------------------------\n\n【43】*   All the directions mentioned on the prescription and the label of the medicine should be followed correctly.\n\n【44】*   The drug is generally consumed in the morning and evening meals.\n\n【45】*   Regular follow-up is required every three months to check the heart's rhythm. This helps to figure out whether Dronedarone is needed anymore or not. The drug should not be stopped without the doctor's advice.\n\n【46】*   The pulse should be regulated often to check for any irregular rhythm.\n\n【47】What Happens if a Dose Is Missed?\n---------------------------------\n\n【48】If one dose is missed, the next dose should be taken at the usual time instead of two doses simultaneously. Taking two doses at a time may lead to severe complications in the heart.\n\n【49】**Food to Avoid While Taking Dronedarone:**\n\n【50】Grapefruit may interact with Dronedarone and lead to some side effects. It is thus recommended to avoid the consumption of Dronedarone with grapefruit.\n\n【51】**After Taking the Drug:**\n\n【52】**Side Effects of Dronedarone:**\n\n【53】Dronedarone may lead to some severe side effects such as:\n\n【54】*   Shortness of breath and dry cough.\n\n【55】*   Less or no urination.\n\n【56】*   Heart issues lead to rapid weight gain, swelling, and shortness of breath.\n\n【57】*   Liver problems lead to stomach pain in the upper right of the abdomen, loss of appetite, tiredness, dark urine, and jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin).\n\n【58】*   Fast or pounding heartbeats, shortness of breath, fluttering in the chest, and sudden dizziness.\n\n【59】*   Dronedarone may lead to lower levels of magnesium or potassium, which causes dizziness, numbness or tingling in the limbs, fluttering in the chest, increased urination, or thirst.\n\n【60】Some of the Common Side Effects of Dronedarone are:\n\n【61】*   Feeling of weakness and tiredness.\n\n【62】*   Stomach pain, nausea, indigestion, diarrhea, and vomiting.\n\n【63】*   Redness, itching, and skin rashes.\n\n【64】**Overdose of Dronedarone:**\n\n【65】The overconsumption of Dronedarone leads to either severe breathing issues or passing out. Thus it is advised to take the drug with lots of precautions.\n\n【66】**For the Doctor:**\n\n【67】**Indications:**\n\n【68】Dronedarone is a class three antiarrhythmic drug indicated in cases of irregular rhythm in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common prolonged arrhythmia where the treatment is focused on the prevention of stroke and related symptoms. The irregular rhythm is managed by controlling the rhythm, preventing thromboembolic events, and treating the underlying disease. Dronedarone works similarly to Amiodarone as a multiple channel blocker and controls rhythm and atrial fibrillation.\n\n【69】**Pharmacodynamics:**\n\n【70】Dronedarone helps to restore normal sinus rhythm by preventing ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Dronedarone prolongs the QTc interval by about an average of 10 ms. The drug decreases blood pressure (atrial) and then reduces oxygen consumption. Dronedarone decreases myocardial contractility with no changes in the left ventricular ejection fraction. Dronedarone helps to vasodilate coronary arteries by activating the nitric oxide pathway. It helps reduce the chances of hospitalization due to acute coronary syndrome and decreases the chances of stroke.\n\n【71】Dronedarone has antiadrenergic effects and reduces the alpha-adrenergic blood pressure in response to beta 1, beta 2, and epinephrine. It also inhibits triiodothyronine signals by binding to TR alpha 1 and a little binding to the TR beta 1 receptors. Dronedarone doses must be managed precisely as it may be fatal if overdosed. When compared to Amiodarone, Dronedarone has both faster onset and offset of action with a low tissue accumulation and shorter elimination half-life.\n\n【72】**Mechanism of Action:**\n\n【73】Atrial fibrillation is a common type of arrhythmia caused by abnormal electrical activity in the atria. In atrial fibrillation, the irregular heart rate is tachyarrhythmia (faster heart rate) which can be either paroxysmal (less than seven days) or persistent (lasts longer). Atrial fibrillation may cause turbulent and abnormal blood flow through the heart's chambers. This may lead to decreased effectiveness of the heart to pump the blood and increase the chances of thrombus formation in the atria. This ultimately causes a stroke.\n\n【74】Dronedarone controls the rhythm and helps to achieve heart rate in atrial fibrillation. It decreases the extreme rate of the rise of an action potential in a frequency-dependent and concentrated manner. It is a multi-channel blocker that meets all the criteria of the four Vaughan Williams antiarrhythmic drug classes. Still, the effect of each of these on the drug's antiarrhythmic effect is unknown.\n\n【75】Dronedarone inhibits the rapid sodium currents, non-competitively antagonizes alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors and blocks slow calcium inward currents. More specifically, the drug slows down delayed rectifier potassium current, inward rectifier potassium current, and L - type calcium ion current. Dronedarone decelerates cardiac conduction, increases refractory periods, and extends the action potential and refractory periods.\n\n【76】**Absorption:**\n\n【77】Dronedarone is sufficiently absorbed when administered through oral routes. More than 70 % of absorption takes place in such cases. It is known to display low systemic bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism. When consumed with a high-fat meal, its bioavailability is 15 %, whereas, without a meal, the bioavailability reduces by 4 %. The plasma concentration of Dronedarone and its primary circulating N-debutyl metabolite reaches its peak within three to six hours after administering the drug with a meal. Repeated administration of 400 mg Dronedarone twice daily leads to a stable state within four to eight days of initial treatment.\n\n【78】**Volume of Distribution:**\n\n【79】At the steady state, the volume of distribution ranges from twelve hundred to fourteen hundred liters following intravenous administration.\n\n【80】**Protein Binding of Dronedarone:**\n\n【81】The plasma protein binding of Dronedarone and its N-debutyl metabolite is 99.7 % and 98.5 %, respectively. Both of the elements bind with albumin and are not able to saturate.\n\n【82】**Metabolism:**\n\n【83】Predominantly, Dronedarone undergoes CYP3A-mediated hepatic metabolism. Initially, Dronedarone involves N-debutylation to form N-debutyl Dronedarone which retains 1 of 10 to 1 of 3 of the pharmacological activity of the primary parent compound. N-debutyl Dronedarone metabolizes phenol-dronedarone by dealkylation and propanoic acid dronedarone by oxidative deamination. CYP2D6 can also metabolize Dronedarone to form benzofuran-hydroxyl Dronedarone. Some of the other metabolites include C-dealkyl-dronedarone and dibutylamine-hydroxyl Dronedarone.\n\n【84】**Route of Elimination:**\n\n【85】In cases of oral administration, about 84 % of the labeled dose is excreted in the stool, and almost 6 % is excreted in urine as metabolites. The elimination half-life ranges from 13 hours to 19 hours.\n\n【86】**Toxicity:**\n\n【87】In oral studies, Dronedarone shows potential toxicity in humans in acute overdose situations. However, monitoring the patient's cardiac rhythm and blood pressure is important. If there are any symptoms, supportive treatment should be started.\n\n【88】**Drug Interactions:**\n\n【89】*   **Benzodiazepine**: The metabolism of Benzodiazepine can be reduced when it is combined with Dronedarone.\n\n【90】*   **Abemaciclib**: The serum concentration of Abemaciclib increases when combined with Dronedarone.\n\n【91】*   **Acebutolo**: Dronedarone increases acebutolol's bradycardic (decrease in heart rate) activities.\n\n【92】*   **Aceclofenac**: The chances and severity of existing hypertension increase when Dronedarone is combined with Aceclofenac.\n\n【93】*   **Alprazolam**: This drug's metabolism decreases when combined with Dronedarone.\n\n【94】*   **Azithromycin**: The QTc prolongation can be increased when Azithromycin is combined with Dronedarone.\n\n【95】*   **Cetirizine**: The QTc prolongation gets severe when Dronedarone is combined with Cetirizine.\n\n【96】*   **Ciprofloxacin**: It reduces the metabolism of Dronedarone when combined together.\n\n【97】*   **Dexamethasone**: The metabolism of Dronedarone increases when it interacts with the drug Dexamethasone.\n\n【98】**Food Interactions of Dronedarone:**\n\n【99】*   Consumption of grapefruit and its products should be avoided while taking Dronedarone as it increases the concentrations of the drug by three times.\n\n【100】*   The herb St. John's Wort should be avoided as it increases the serum concentration of Dronedarone by inducing CYP3A4.\n\n【101】*   It is recommended to take the drug with foods rich in fat as it helps to increase drug absorption.\n\n【102】**Clinical Trials of Dronedarone:**\n\n【103】**Trial Done to Prevent Hospitalization or Death of Cases With Atrial Fibrillation (ATHENA):**\n\n【104】**Objective of the Trial:** To evaluate the efficacy of Dronedarone in preventing hospitalization or, in severe cases, death of an individual suffering from atrial fibrillation/ atrial flutter.\n\n【105】**Detailed Description of the Trial**: This is a multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group trial that helps to evaluate the effects of Dronedarone compared to placebo in the ratio 1:1 for a minimum duration of treatment of 12 months and followed by a mean duration of 1.75 years of follow-up. Patients included in the study suffered from atrial fibrillation/ flutter or if there is sinus rhythm due to conversion, which occurred either spontaneously or following a procedure such as electro cardioversion or administration of an antiarrhythmic drug. After the randomization trials, all the patients are followed up until the expected study date ends. The last case of atrial fibrillation included in the study will be followed for a year. The follow-up visits are scheduled in a pattern of 7 days, then after 14 days, after a month, and after three months for every three months intervals until the duration of the study ends. At every follow-up visit, the patient is asked about any occurrence of hospitalization or other events since the last follow-up. The study is monitored by DMC (Independent data monitoring committee) for safety, efficacy, and tolerability.\n\n【106】**European Trial of Dronedarone in Moderate to Severe Congestive Heart Failure (ANDROMEDA):**\n\n【107】**Description**: This study assessed Dronedarone's tolerability, safety, and efficacy versus placebo in patients suffering from congestive heart failure (CHF) and left ventricular dysfunction (LVD). The trial was randomized with 653 participants. No results were posted for the trial.\n\n【108】**Dronedarone in Pregnancy**: The medication should not be used in pregnancy as it can harm the development of the fetus in the womb. It is important to mention to the doctor about pregnancy before starting the drug.\n\n【109】**Dronedarone and Breastfeeding**: It is unknown whether the drug is present in breast milk, but it is recommended not to breastfeed while consuming the drug.\n\n【110】**Dronedarone and Older Patients**: Older age groups may display sensitivity to several drugs and may have allergies. It is important to state the presence of any allergies in older patients before taking the drug Dronedarone.\n\n【111】**Advantages of Dronedarone Over Other Antiarrhythmics**: The drug Dronedarone is a new antiarrhythmic and has fewer adverse effects than other antiarrhythmics such as Amiodarone. It reduces the chances of hospitalization compared to Amiodarone.\n\n【112】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【113】无关删除-1:<u>*   Dronedarone  \n    https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Dronedarone\n*   Dronedarone  \n    https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.109.858027\n*   Dronedarone  \n    https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00696631\n*   Dronedarone (Oral Route)  \n    https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/dronedarone-oral-route/precautions/drg-20073151\n*   Dronedarone  \n    https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00174785</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It affects about five percent of people with psoriatic arthritis. This condition causes progressive destruction of the bones and results in severe bone loss, problems related to movements, and joint deformation. It is typically seen in the toes, wrists, and fingers. This occurs due to severe joint and bone damage that causes the fingers to collapse and resembles the opening of opera glasses or a telescope. The bones dissolve, and the soft tissues cannot support the fingers, resulting in a telescoping appearance.\n\n【2】What Is Arthritis Mutilans?\n---------------------------\n\n【3】Arthritis mutilans are also called pencil-in-cup deformity because of their peculiar radiographic appearance. It is characterized by the destruction of the joints and bones, leading to deformities and a significant functional impairment. This condition can develop alone but is also seen in individuals with psoriatic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. However, the rate of developing this condition in rheumatoid arthritis patients is lower than that of psoriatic arthritis patients.\n\n【4】Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis are long-lasting autoimmune diseases that cause inflammation and pain in the joints, leading to damage and deformity. Disability caused by both these conditions impacts the quality of life.\n\n【5】What Are the Causes of Arthritis Mutilans?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The exact cause of arthritis mutilans is not fully understood, but it is believed to be associated with certain factors, which includes\n\n【7】*   **Autoimmune Disorders:** Disorders like psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are long-lasting autoimmune diseases that affect the skin and joints.\n\n【8】    *   Psoriatic Arthritis affects some individuals with psoriasis, a skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches. It is a complex disease found in various body parts, including the skin, joints, and nails.\n\n【9】    *   Rheumatoid Arthritis is a type of arthritis that causes inflammation and pain in the joints, leading to damage and deformity.\n\n【10】删除1:<u>        Related Topics\n\n【11】        * * *\n\n【12】        Arthritis with Common Variable Immunodeficiency\n\n【13】        Gonococcal Arthritis - Bacterial Inflammation of the Joints\n\n【14】        Patellofemoral Arthritis - Causes, Pathophysiology, and More\n\n【15】*   **Genetic Factors:** Genetic mutations affect the cartilage and bone. Psoriatic arthritis patients with the HLA-B27 gene have a higher chance of developing this condition.\n\n【16】*   **Joint Injury Due to Trauma:** Injuries at psoriatic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis site can develop arthritis mutilans.\n    </u>\n\n【17】What Are the Symptoms of Arthritis Mutilans?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The symptoms of arthritis mutilans include:\n\n【19】*   **Pain:** The affected joints may be painful, especially during movements and physical activity.\n\n【20】*   **Wearing Out of Joints and Bones:** It is seen in hands and feet. These changes occur due to inflammation over the affected area.\n\n【21】*   **Joint Disability:** Difficulty in moving, bending, or straightening the joints.\n\n【22】*   **Swelling:** The joints may become swollen and tender due to inflammation.\n\n【23】*   **Stiffness Due to Bone Fusion:** Ankylosis or fusion of bones within the joint creates stiffness and results in limited mobility. The affected joints may feel stiff, especially after periods of inactivity.\n\n【24】*   **Deformities:** The shape of fingers and toes may become distorted and appear twisted.\n\n【25】*   **Restricted Joint Mobility:** Joint mobility can become severely limited, making daily activities such as writing, typing, or even walking difficult.\n\n【26】*   **Skin Changes:** The affected joints will become shorter, forming loose skin in those areas. The skin over the affected joints may appear tight, wrinkled, and shiny.\n\n【27】How Can Arthritis Mutilans Be Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【28】Arthritis mutilans can be diagnosed with the help of the following steps.\n\n【29】*   **Physical Examination:** A doctor will examine the affected joints for signs of pain, swelling, and deformities.\n\n【30】*   **Imaging Tests:** X-rays or other imaging tests, such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan or CT (computed tomography) scan, may be used to confirm the diagnosis of arthritis mutilans and assess the extent of joint destruction and bone resorption.\n\n【31】*   **Blood Tests:** Blood tests may be used to check for underlying autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, or to rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. The blood tests are listed below:\n\n【32】    *   **Rheumatoid Factor (RF) Test:** A test that measures the presence of rheumatoid factor, an antibody commonly found in people with rheumatoid arthritis. High levels of RF indicates an autoimmune disorder , but it can also be present in other conditions.\n\n【33】    *   **Anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (anti-CCP) Test:** A test that measures the presence of antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides, which are proteins found in the joint. A positive anti-CCP test is highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【34】    *   **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) Test:** A test that measures the rate at which red blood cells settle to the bottom of a test tube. An elevated ESR can indicate inflammation, which is a common symptom of arthritis.\n\n【35】    *   **C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Test:** A test that measures the level of CRP, a protein produced in response to inflammation. An elevated CRP level can indicate inflammation in the body, which may be associated with arthritis.\n\n【36】Sometimes, a biopsy of the affected joint may be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the type and severity of joint damage.\n\n【37】What Is the Treatment for Arthritis Mutilans?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Treatment for arthritis mutilans mainly involves a combination of medications and therapies to control pain and inflammation, slow the progression of joint damage, and restore joint function and mobility. The treatment options for arthritis mutilans include the following.\n\n【39】*   **Medications:** NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), such as Methotrexate, may be prescribed to reduce pain and inflammation and slow the progression of joint damage. TNF (tumor necrosis factor) inhibitors like Etanercept can be used to treat psoriatic arthritis.\n\n【40】*   **Physical Therapy:** Physical exercises can improve joint mobility and function and help the patient maintain their independence and quality of life.\n\n【41】*   **Assistive Devices:** Braces, splints, canes, or other assistive devices may be recommended to help support the affected joints and reduce the risk of injury.\n\n【42】*   **Joint Injections:** Corticosteroid injections into the affected joints may be recommended to provide temporary relief from pain and inflammation.\n\n【43】*   **Joint Surgery:** Surgery like joint fusion may be performed to correct deformities and to improve function. Surgery to replace damaged joints with artificial joints is usually done in severe cases.\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】Arthritis mutilans is a rarely seen form of arthritis. Early diagnosis and proper treatment can slow the progression of joint damage and improve symptoms. Working closely with a rheumatologist or other specialist is important to develop an appropriate treatment plan for patients with this condition. In addition, a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques, may also help to improve overall health and reduce the symptoms of arthritis mutilans to a certain extent.\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>*   Delayed Diagnosis of Psoriatic Arthritis Mutilans due to Arthritis Prior to Skin Lesion  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6247716/\n*   Arthritis mutilans  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23430715/\n*   Psoriatic Arthritis  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547710/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This can further complicate the already existing issue for the patient. There are a number of complications a patient may face due to different causes. Prompt recognition and treatment will help improve the quality of living of the already compromised individual. But before the complications can be discussed, one has to understand what a stoma is.\n\n【2】What Is Stoma?\n--------------\n\n【3】A stoma is a surgical opening a doctor makes in the abdomen if a patient cannot have a natural bowel movement. The surgeon will attach the end of the colon to the stoma; bowel movements will exit the body through the stoma and are collected in a pouch that has to be emptied. The conditions requiring a stoma are:\n\n【4】*   Cancer.\n\n【5】*   Crohn’s disease.\n\n【6】*   Birth defects.\n\n【7】*   Injury to the colon.\n\n【8】*   A bowel blockage or tear.\n\n【9】*   Pouches in the colon are called diverticulitis.\n\n【10】What Are the Problems a Stoma Patients Encounter?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】A patient with a stoma may face local problems and subsequent systemic disorders, such as:\n\n【12】*   Inadequate blood supply (ischemia).\n\n【13】*   Infection- this site can become a site for infection by pathogens.\n\n【14】*   Fistula\\- an undesired passage between the bowel and the skin.\n\n【15】*   Prolapse of the bowel out into the skin.\n\n【16】*   Leaking of the bowel into the skin causes irritation and erosion.\n\n【17】*   The most common complication related to stoma is skin problems.\n\n【18】What Are Skin Problems Related to Stoma?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【19】*   Irritant dermatitis.\n\n【20】*   Infectious dermatitis.\n\n【21】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Kidney Diseases and Their Dermatological Manifestations</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    What causes blisters on the lip?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Stomach pain and headache after four days of loose motion.

The skin infection is more likely if the patient is generally immuno-compromised.\n\n【29】*   Bacterial Infections Include:\n\n【30】*   Secondary infection in the surgical site.\n\n【31】*   Impetigo.\n\n【32】*   Bacterial folliculitis or boils.\n\n【33】*   Cellulitis.\n\n【34】It is confirmed by swabs.\n\n【35】*   Viral Infections Include:\n\n【36】*   Viral warts.\n\n【37】*   Molluscum contagiosum.\n\n【38】*   Herpes simplex.\n\n【39】*   Fungal Infections Include:\n\n【40】*   Candidiasis or thrush.\n\n【41】*   Dermatophyte infection.\n\n【42】*   Malassezia.\n\n【43】It is confirmed by skin scrapings.\n\n【44】**2\\. Inflammatory Skin Disease:** If the stoma is leaking or because of an underlying skin condition, the skin around the stoma may become inflamed papules, or ulceration may form. Papules due to viral warts, cancer, and Crohn’s disease; ulceration may arise due to trauma. Periodic pouch changes can lead to mechanical trauma. The skin may develop rashes around the stoma.\n\n【45】*   **Irritant Contact Dermatitis**: Irritant dermatitis may develop due to mechanical trauma due to ill-fitting appliances. This might cause mechanical stripping due to frequent friction leading to epidermal damage. Common causes include:\n\n【46】*   Frequent contact of skin to bowel content or urine.\n\n【47】*   The skin was stripped by the removal of the appliance.\n\n【48】*   Certain cleaners or bleaches.\n\n【49】*   Constant friction from the appliance.\n\n【50】*   Humidity.\n\n【51】*   Pre-existing skin conditions such as eczema.\n\n【52】Irritant contact dermatitis may appear as red papules (small bumps) or plaques (patches) and scaling. It is usually sore and itchy. It might affect the entire area or appear as a crescent shape below the appliance.\n\n【53】*   **Allergic Contact Dermatitis:** The appearance of allergic dermatitis is similar to that of contact dermatitis; its occurrence is, however, less common. But allergic dermatitis will affect the entire area in contact with the appliance and even spread to wider areas.\n\n【54】Allergies may be caused due to the material of the appliance or the pouch, such as acrylic resin, fragrance, parabens, or cleansing agents and deodorizers. Patch tests must be done to identify the allergens and avoid them.\n\n【55】**3\\. Psoriasis:** It occurs in patients who either are already suffering from psoriasis or have a genetic predisposition to it. The mechanical stripping of skin while removal of the pouch may trigger psoriasis. It presents as sharply defined plaques or patches of scaly red skin. That extends beyond the stoma. It is frequently associated with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【56】**4\\. Pyoderma Gangrenosum:** It presents as painful ulcers. The ulcers may be bluish, undermined, and with ill-defined edges. The skin surrounding the ulcer may be red and swollen. It may be caused by mechanical trauma due to the pouch, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease may have a predisposition to it.\n\n【57】**5\\. Seborrhoeic Dermatitis:** It is similar to dermatitis in appearance to irritant dermatitis or psoriasis. It presents as scaling and rashes.\n\n【58】**6\\. Folliculitis:** Hair follicles may cause irritation and, thereby, inflammation. It may resemble candidiasis and presents as a red pus-filled area.\n\n【59】**7\\. Granulomas:** Lump-like lesions in the skin are called granulomas. It may occur near the stoma due to\n\n【60】*   Poor healing.\n\n【61】*   Infection.\n\n【62】*   Stomal skin morphs into bowel tissue.\n\n【63】*   Crohn’s disease.\n\n【64】**8\\. Color Changes:** The skin color around the stoma may change due to inflammation.\n\n【65】*   **Red or Pink**\\- Due to the formation of new blood vessels.\n\n【66】*   **Brown Color**\\- Due to inflammatory pigmentation, it may fade eventually.\n\n【67】*   **Other Colors**\\- This may be due to urinary deposits.\n\n【68】How to Treat Skin Conditions?\n-----------------------------\n\n【69】*   **Infections:** Proper cleaning with antiseptic can prevent infection. Antibiotics may be required to treat severe infections.\n\n【70】*   **Dermatitis:**\n\n【71】1\\. Improving the fit of the appliance.\n\n【72】2\\. Hydrocolloid dressing under the pouch.\n\n【73】3\\. Antiperspirant to avoid moisture from sweat.\n\n【74】4\\. Topical steroids.\n\n【75】*   **Sucralfate**: This may be used on erosions.\n\n【76】*   **Psoriasis:** Treatment of psoriasis includes steroids.\n\n【77】*   **Topical:** Tacrolimus\n\n【78】*   **Systemic:** Ciclosporin, Minocycline, Dapsone.\n\n【79】*   **Folliculitis:** Antibacterial powder may help reduce incidence.\n\n【80】How Topical Steroids Can Help Improve the Conditions?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【81】**Topical steroids:** Used under the bag to treat and prevent inflammatory conditions such as dermatitis, psoriasis, and pyoderma gangrenosum. It should be applied once daily for three to four weeks.\n\n【82】How to Prevent Skin Problems In Stoma Patients?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【83】*   The patient must be made aware of the potential skin problems, and adequate care should be taken to prevent them from arising.\n\n【84】*   Keep the area clean and dry.\n\n【85】*   Use a skin seal or barrier; this prevents moisture.\n\n【86】*   Periodically changing the pouch.\n\n【87】**Conclusion:**\n\n【88】Stoma patients are individuals with pre-existing systemic disorders. The patients often require pouches for the collection and removal of bowel waste as a result of the treatment for their systemic conditions. For this reason, prevention of local and systemic complications that may arise due to the stoma bag is important in improving their quality of life.\n\n【89】Skin problems due to stomas can be significantly reduced or prevented by educating them about the potential complications of the same. Proper cleaning, prevention of mechanical trauma, and use of topical steroids can be used to prevent and treat the conditions.\n\n【90】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【91】无关删除-1:<u>*   Peristomal Dermatology  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2780183/\n*   Skin problems in stoma patients  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20465716/\n*   Skin problems from stomas  \n    https://dermnetnz.org/topics/skin-problems-from-stomas</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection affects around 14,000,000 people annually, with a lifetime infection risk of more than 80 %. The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) virus member of the papillomavirus family. The small double-stranded circular DNA virus, the human papillomavirus (HPV), has a genome of about 8000 base pairs. The only tissue in which the human papillomavirus (HPV) replicates is the basal cells of the stratified epithelium.\n\n【2】**What Are the Types Of Human Papillomavirus?**\n\n【3】More than 200 related viruses, most through vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse, are collectively referred to as papillomavirus (HPV). There are two sexually transmitted HPV types: low risk and high risk.\n\n【4】*   **Low-Risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV)**\\- This causes no illness; however, some varieties of the virus can result in warts around the genitalia, anus, mouth, or neck.\n\n【5】*   **High-Risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV)**\\- High-risk HPVs can bring on numerous cancers. About 14 HPV varieties, including HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68, are considered high-risk. The majority of HPV-related malignancies are caused by two of these, HPV16 and HPV18.\n\n【6】What Is the Incidence of Human Papillomavirus?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【7】*   Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is widespread: within a few months to a few years of engaging in sexual activity, almost anyone who is sexually active contracts HPV.\n\n【8】*   These infections have a high-risk HPV type in about half of the cases.\n\n【9】*   Men and women can contract human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and malignancies brought on by the virus.\n\n【10】*   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 36,000 new HPV cases are responsible for around five percent of all malignant; thus, an estimated 570,000 women and 60,000 men develop HPV-related cancer each year.\n\n【11】How Can the Human Papillomavirus Lead to Cervical Cancer?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】*   Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignancies and the leading cause of cancer-related fatalities.\n\n【13】*   When high-risk HPV infects cells, it obstructs the methods by which these cells communicate with one another, leading to excessive cell proliferation.\n\n【14】*   The immune system typically recognizes and suppresses these contaminated cells.\n\n【15】*   In some instances, the infected cells persist and expand further, eventually forming a cluster of precancerous cells that, if left untreated, can develop into cancer.\n\n【16】*   According to studies, HPV-infected cervical cells can take between 10 and 20 years—or even longer—to develop into a malignant tumor.\n\n【17】**Does the Human Papillomavirus Always Lead to Cancer?**\n\n【18】*   Most HPV infections do not result in cancer; usually, the immune system prevents human papillomavirus (HPV) infections from leading to cancer.\n\n【19】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Are black spots on the penis due to an infection caused by human papillomavirus (HPV)?</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Link Between HPV Infection and Oral Cancer</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Operated for cervical cancer.

Long-term infections with high-risk HPV can lead to cancer in various areas of the body, such as the cervix, oropharynx, tongue, soft palate, and throat. HPV affects squamous cells lining the inner surfaces of these organs. As a result, the vast majority of HPV-related cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Cancers caused by HPV include:\n\n【23】**Cervical Cancer:**\n\n【24】*   HPV is responsible for nearly all cervical malignancies.\n\n【25】*   Routine screening can prevent the precancerous cells before they become malignant.\n\n【26】**Cancers of the Oropharynx:**\n\n【27】*   Most of the malignancies of the throat (the tonsils or the back of the tongue) are caused by HPV.\n\n【28】*   Each year, new cases rise, and oropharyngeal malignancies are now the most frequent HPV-related malignancy.\n\n【29】**Anal Cancer:**\n\n【30】*   HPV is responsible for more than 90 % of anal cancers.\n\n【31】*   Women are twice as likely as men.\n\n【32】**Penile Cancer:**\n\n【33】*   HPV causes most penile malignancies (over 60 %), a rare type of cancer.\n\n【34】**Vulvar Cancer:**\n\n【35】*   HPV is responsible for 70 % of vulvar malignancies.\n\n【36】How Does Human Papillomavirus Spread?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【37】The infection is easily transmitted between sexual partners. HPV is easily transmitted between sexual partners through any intimate skin-to-skin contact, including:\n\n【38】1.  Vaginal-penile intercourse.\n\n【39】2.  Penile-anal sex.\n\n【40】3.  Penile-oral sex.\n\n【41】4.  Vaginal-oral sex.\n\n【42】5.  The use of sex toys or other objects.\n\n【43】**Is Human Papillomavirus Infection Associated With Symptoms of Cervical Cancer?**\n\n【44】In most cases, high-risk HPV infection does not result in symptoms.\n\n【45】*   The precancerous cell alterations caused by a chronic HPV infection at the cervix seldom elicit symptoms. Thus, regular cervical cancer screening is critical.\n\n【46】*   Some of the symptoms may be itching or bleeding.\n\n【47】*   In addition, if an HPV infection progresses to cancer, it may cause symptoms such as bleeding, discomfort, or swollen glands.\n\n【48】What Are the Risk Factors of HPV Infections in Cervical Cancer?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】*   Various factors raise the likelihood of high-risk HPV infection in precancerous cervical cells. These consist of a particularly aggressive HPV type, such as HPV 16 or HPV 18.\n\n【50】*   Smoking tobacco can harm the body's defense against HPV.\n\n【51】*   A compromised immune system or medications that suppress the immune system may also be a risk factor for HPV infections.\n\n【52】How Can Cervical Cancer by Human Papillomavirus Infections Be Prevented?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】**Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccines:**\n\n【54】*   These vaccines can prevent cancer and infections, averting many genital warts and malignancies associated with HPV.\n\n【55】*   HPV vaccination offers significant protection against new HPV infections.\n\n【56】*   However, it is only for prevention; it does not treat disease once it has occurred.\n\n【57】*   It is predicted that HPV immunization can prevent up to 90 % of HPV-related malignancies.\n\n【58】**Condoms and Dental Dams:**\n\n【59】*   Using condoms and dental dams during oral or penile sexual intercourse can reduce the likelihood of HPV transmission but does not entirely prevent it.\n\n【60】Who Should Be Vaccinated Against Human Papillomavirus?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】*   HPV vaccination is suggested for young people up to the age of 26.\n\n【62】*   The HPV vaccine series is advised for males and females since both might acquire malignancies of the mouth and throat, anal cancers, and genital warts.\n\n【63】*   Cervical cancer is also a concern for women, while penile cancer is a risk for men.\n\n【64】*   Vaccination can also help to limit the spread of HPV, which causes cancer.\n\n【65】**Can the Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Be Administered at an Older Age?**\n\n【66】*   Adults between 27 and 45 who have not received vaccinations can obtain the vaccine.\n\n【67】*   Adults in this age range benefit less from the vaccine because they have already been exposed to HPV.\n\n【68】*   As a result, immunization is not usually recommended for people of this age.\n\n【69】*   However, this vaccine can provide immunity against any new HPV infection; thus, older people can benefit from it.\n\n【70】How Is Human Papillomavirus Testing Done?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【71】**Cervical Cancer Screening:**\n\n【72】*   Cervical cancer screening tests are conducted to detect high-risk HPV in cervical cells.\n\n【73】*   Cervical cancer screening aims to detect precancerous cell alterations before they develop into cancer and when therapy can prevent cancer.\n\n【74】*   Cervical cancer screening is an essential aspect of routine health care for women and homosexual males with cervixes.\n\n【75】**The Pap Smear Test:**\n\n【76】*   This test is conducted for all cervical cell alterations caused by high-risk HPV.\n\n【77】*   Cervical cancer is currently the only HPV-related cancer for which FDA-approved screening tests are available.\n\n【78】What Is the Treatment for Human Papillomavirus Infection in Cervical Cancer?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【79】The cure for high-risk HPV infection is not yet established; however, the human papillomavirus infection can be treated.\n\n【80】Treatment options for genital warts and precancerous vaginal, vulvar, penile, and anal lesions include:\n\n【81】1.  Topical medications.\n\n【82】2.  Surgical removal.\n\n【83】3.  Cryosurgery.\n\n【84】4.  Laser therapy.\n\n【85】5.  The loop electrosurgical excision treatment (LEEP) - It is a technique to remove abnormal tissue.\n\n【86】**Conclusion:**\n\n【87】Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cervical cancer is a common illness globally. With the development of HPV vaccines, it has become possible to eliminate this cancer. They have an excellent safety profile and are known for their strong efficacy. Herd protection ensures that HPV-related lesions will decline in vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Furthermore, it is critical to stress that immunization may not be a substitute for screening. In actuality, routine cervical cancer screenings should be performed on both vaccinated and non-vaccinated women.

The condition is life-threatening as it interferes with the baby's normal intestinal function and feeding. Intestinal atresia usually affects the intestines but can cause obstruction or atresia in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the symptoms, occurrence, diagnosis, and treatment of jejunoileal atresia mainly depend upon the infected site. The condition is prevalent in females and males but can occur only in one in every 1500 live births.\n\n【2】What Are the Symptoms of Jejunoileal Atresia?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The symptoms are jejunoileal atresia are as follows:\n\n【4】*   Abdominal swelling.\n\n【5】*   Difficulty in feeding.\n\n【6】*   Reduced bowel movement.\n\n【7】*   Vomiting bile fluid.\n\n【8】What Are the Types of Jejunoileal Atresia?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The different types of jejunoileal atresia are as follows:\n\n【10】*   **Intestinal Atresia Type I** - In this type of atresia, a web-like membrane is formed inside the intestine when the baby is developing in the uterus. The condition causes blockage in the intestine by the membrane formation, but the intestines' length remains unaffected.\n\n【11】*   **Intestinal Atresia Type II** - In this case, the length of the intestine is regular. Still, the dilated section develops a blind end connected to the smaller segment of the intestine via scar tissue.\n\n【12】*   **Intestinal Atresia Type III** - In this type, a flaw or defect in the intestinal blood supply separates the two bling ends. The condition significantly reduces the length of the small intestine, which further causes short-gut syndrome or long-term nutritional deficiencies.\n\n【13】*   **Intestinal Atresia Type IV** - In this type, the intestine length is significantly reduced due to multiple blockages in the intestinal sections.\n\n【14】What Are the Causes of Jejunoileal Atresia?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Jejunooileal atresia occurs due to the following reasons:\n\n【16】*   An inherited genetic defect such as familial multiple intestinal atresias.\n\n【17】*   Vascular accidents cause the insufficient blood supply to the developing fetus’s intestine. This defect causes loss of functionality due to ischemia in the different segments of the small intestine.\n\n【18】*   Some researchers have also linked cocaine and cigarette smoking during pregnancy to jejunoileal atresia.\n\n【19】How Is Jejunoileal Atresia Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【20】Jejunoileal Artesia is diagnosed in the following ways:\n\n【21】**1\\. Prenatal Diagnosis** - This type of diagnosis is done mainly during the third trimester of the pregnancy with the help of prenatal ultrasound. Prenatal diagnosis of a mother is performed due to the high risk of developing congenital disabilities in newborns with intestinal atresia to eliminate the following conditions:\n\n【22】*   Esophageal atresia.\n\n【23】*   Congenital heart diseases.\n\n【24】*   Down syndrome.\n\n【25】*   Annular pancreas (pancreas does not form properly due to a congenital disability).\n\n【26】*   Genitourinary malformations.\n\n【27】*   Bowel rotational abnormalities.\n\n【28】**2\\. Postnatal Diagnosis** - This is the diagnosis done after the birth of a baby. Newborns with jejunoileal atresia vomit frequently; therefore, some specific diagnostic procedures rule out congenital disabilities. These include:\n\n【29】*   **Lower Gastrointestinal (GI) X-Ray** - It helps to investigate the small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. In the procedure, a radio-opaque contrast media is administered through the rectum to form a thin lining around the intestine. This helps in the clear view of the internal body structures with minute details of obstruction and strictures.\n\n【30】*   **Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) X-Ray** - The diagnosis helps to investigate the duodenum and pylorus by using barium as a contrast medium, which is given through the mouth for a clear view of the structures inside the body.\n\n【31】*   **Abdominal X-Ray** - This helps to take images of the internal structure of the newborn’s abdomen for diagnosis.\n\n【32】*   **Echocardiogram (ECG)** - It helps to detect any congenital heart defects in the newborn. In babies, jejunoileal or intestinal atresia conditions can be fatal, leading to complications such as congenital heart defects.\n\n【33】*   **Abdominal Ultrasound** - This non-invasion diagnostic procedure uses sound waves to view the functionality of the internal organs. Abdominal ultrasound or USG detects the abnormalities in the abdomen related to jejunoileal atresia symptoms.\n\n【34】How Is Jejunoileal Atresia Treated?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【35】Jejunoileal atresia does not have any prenatal treatment options available. The doctor can treat the condition in newborns only with surgical intervention after birth. The surgery depends upon the location and nature of the jejunoileal atresia or blockage. Thus, the treatment is carried out in the following ways:\n\n【36】**1\\. Stabilization of the Baby**\n\n【37】*   A nasogastric tube is inserted into the stomach through the nose to empty the accumulated gases and stomach contents under negative pressure to prevent aspiration and vomiting in the baby.\n\n【38】*   Intravenous nutritional supply is provided to the newborn.\n\n【39】*   Also, some blood tests and X-ray procedures are done during this pre-surgical phase of the treatment procedure.\n\n【40】**2\\. Surgery**\n\n【41】*   The surgery is mainly laparoscopic or open surgery. In a laparoscopic procedure, multiple small incisions are given along the intestine to insert instruments and a camera. While in open surgery, a single large incision is made in the abdomen, and the affected part of the intestine is removed. Then, the ends are sutured again to maintain continuity.\n\n【42】*   The surgery is performed under general anesthesia to avoid discomfort or pain for the baby.\n\n【43】*   Sometimes, a doctor creates an opening or a stoma in the abdomen if the intestines take longer to heal. The stoma helps to collect the feces temporarily in the colostomy bag until it passes through the anus.\n\n【44】**3\\. Post-Surgical Care** - The baby’s stay can be up to one to three weeks post-surgery to monitor the vitals continuously. Also, the nutritional supply is continued with a nasogastric tube unless the baby starts taking food through the oral cavity or mouth. Post-surgical follow-ups are scheduled after discharge to assess a baby's general well-being and growth parameters.\n\n【45】What Is the Differential Diagnosis for Jejunoileal Atresia?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】*   Internal hernia.\n\n【47】*   Colonic atresia.\n\n【48】*   Meconium ileus.\n\n【49】*   Congenital small left colon syndrome.\n\n【50】*   Intestinal malrotation with midgut volvulus.\n\n【51】*   Hirschsprung disease.\n\n【52】What Are the Complications Associated With Jejunoileal Atresia?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】*   Postoperative sepsis can occur in 5 % to 8 % of cases.\n\n【54】*   An anatomic leak occurs in 5 % to 7 % of cases.\n\n【55】*   Short bowel syndrome (SBS) occurs due to feeding abnormalities, prolonged hospital stays, and increased infection rates.\n\n【56】*   Adhesive bowel syndrome.\n\n【57】**Conclusion**\n\n【58】Jejunoileal atresia is a rare condition of intestinal obstruction in newborns, which can be fatal in some cases if not detected initially. However, advanced surgical techniques, nutritional support, pediatric anesthesia, intensive care units, and post-operative care for neonates have increased the survival rates in newborns with intestinal atresia.\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【60】无关删除-1:<u>*   Ileal Atresia  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557400/\n*   Jejunoileal Atresia: Factors Affecting the Outcome and Long-term Sequelae  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3761993/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It is a condition where the body is unable to process glucose properly, which can lead to high blood sugar levels. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 420 million people worldwide have diabetes.\n\n【2】What Is Diabetes?\n-----------------\n\n【3】Diabetes is a persistent medical condition characterized by impaired processing of blood sugar (glucose) within the body. When we eat food, our body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, facilitates the absorption of glucose by cells, enabling its utilization as an energy source or storage for future needs.\n\n【4】In those with diabetes, the body either generates inadequate insulin or fails to properly use the insulin that is generated. As a result, blood glucose levels rise as glucose builds up in the system.\n\n【5】What Are the Types of Diabetes?\n-------------------------------\n\n【6】The two main types of diabestes are type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\n【7】*   **Type 1 diabetes:** In type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune reaction occurs where the body's own immune system targets and destroys the pancreatic cells responsible for producing insulin.\n\n【8】*   **Type 2 diabetes:** It is a more prevalent condition that arises when the body either develops resistance to insulin or fails to produce an adequate amount to fulfill its requirements.\n\n【9】What Are the Symptoms of Diabetes?\n----------------------------------\n\n【10】The symptoms of diabetes can include:\n\n【11】*   Frequent urination.\n\n【12】*   Excessive thirst.\n\n【13】*   Fatigue.\n\n【14】*   Blurred vision.\n\n【15】*   Slow wound healing.\n\n【16】Diabetes can result in a number of serious illnesses if it is not appropriately treated, including:\n\n【17】*   Heart disease.\n\n【18】*   Stroke.\n\n【19】*   Kidney damage.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Balanitis - Types, Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Complications</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Diabetes and its Possible Prevention</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    Modern Advancements in Diabetes Technology</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n*   Nerve damage.\n\n【21】*   Blindness.\n    </u>\n\n【22】How Can Diabetes be Managed?\n----------------------------\n\n【23】1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A nutritious diet, frequent exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight are all lifestyle modifications that can help control blood sugar levels.\n\n【24】2\\. **Medications**: To help manage blood sugar levels several different types of medications include:\n\n【25】*   Insulin.\n\n【26】*   Oral medications.\n\n【27】*   Injectable medications.\n\n【28】3\\. **Blood Sugar Monitoring:** Monitoring blood sugar levels regularly can help people with diabetes keep track of their glucose levels and modify their treatment plan as necessary.\n\n【29】4\\. **Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM):** CGM devices are wearable devices that continuously monitor blood sugar levels and provide real-time feedback to the wearer.\n\n【30】5\\. **Insulin Pumps**: Insulin pumps are small devices that deliver insulin to the body through a catheter that is inserted under the skin.\n\n【31】What Are Diabetes Patches?\n--------------------------\n\n【32】Diabetes patches are a type of wearable medical device that is designed to help manage diabetes. There are two main types of diabetes patches: continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) patches and insulin patches.\n\n【33】1\\. **Continuous Glucose Monitoring Patch:**\n\n【34】Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a medical technology that measures glucose levels in real-time using a tiny sensor implanted under the skin. In comparison to conventional fingerstick testing, Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems are intended to provide more frequent and precise results. This technological development can help people with diabetes monitor and manage their blood sugar levels more effectively.\n\n【35】**Working:**\n\n【36】*   The CGM patch contains a tiny sensor that is inserted into the skin and measures the glucose levels in the interstitial fluid.\n\n【37】*   A sensor and a transmitter are what make up the CGM system. The receiver, which might be a smartphone, a special device, or a smartwatch, receives the glucose data wirelessly from the transmitter.\n\n【38】*   The sensor measures the glucose levels every few minutes and sends the data to the receiver in real-time.\n\n【39】*   This allows people with diabetes to track their glucose levels throughout the day and identify trends and patterns in their glucose levels.\n\n【40】*   The CGM patch can also alert the user if their glucose levels are too high or too low, helping them take action to prevent dangerous fluctuations in blood sugar levels.\n\n【41】*   Some CGM patches also have advanced features, such as alarms that can alert the user if their glucose levels are rapidly changing or if they are at risk of hypoglycemia.\n\n【42】*   Some CGM patches also allow the user to set target glucose levels and can automatically adjust insulin dosages to maintain these levels.\n\n【43】**Features:**\n\n【44】*   **Real-time Glucose Monitoring:** CGM patches provide continuous, real-time glucose monitoring, allowing wearers to see how their glucose levels change in response to food, exercise, and other factors.\n\n【45】*   **Alerts:** Some CGM patches can provide alerts when glucose levels are too high or too low, helping wearers take action to avoid hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.\n\n【46】*   **Data Storage:** CGM patches can store glucose data over time, allowing wearers to track patterns and trends in their glucose levels.\n\n【47】*   **Customization:** CGM patches can be customized to suit the wearer's individual needs and preferences, such as setting target glucose levels and adjusting alert settings.\n\n【48】**Requirements for Usage:**\n\n【49】Certain prerequisites should be met prior to using CGM patches.\n\n【50】*   **Regular Calibration:** To guarantee accuracy, CGM patches must be calibrated using conventional fingerstick tests at least twice per day.\n\n【51】*   **Sensor Replacement:** CGM patches need to have the sensor replaced every few days or weeks, depending on the specific device.\n\n【52】*   **Skin Preparation:** The skin where the sensor will be inserted needs to be cleaned and prepped before insertion to ensure accurate readings.\n\n【53】*   **Device Compatibility:** Some CGM patches may require specific devices or software to access the data.\n\n【54】CGM patches are suitable for individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who require insulin, as well as some individuals with gestational diabetes. However, CGM patches may not be suitable for everyone, including those with certain skin conditions or who are unable to calibrate the device regularly.\n\n【55】**Benefits:**\n\n【56】*   **Improved Glucose Control:** CGM patches help people with diabetes better manage their blood sugar levels, leading to improved glucose control and a reduced risk of complications.\n\n【57】*   **Enhanced Convenience:** By eliminating the need for regular finger stick tests, CGM patches make glucose monitoring easier and less invasive.\n\n【58】*   **Improved Quality of Life:** CGM patches can provide individuals with diabetes a greater sense of control over their condition, potentially reducing the stress and anxiety associated with managing blood sugar levels.\n\n【59】**Limitations:**\n\n【60】*   **Cost:** CGM patches can be pricey, and not all insurance providers pay for their purchase.\n\n【61】*   **Discomfort:** Some people may find the sensor insertion process uncomfortable or painful.\n\n【62】*   **Inaccuracy:** CGM patches may not always give correct readings, especially when there are fast fluctuations in blood sugar or when it is very low or very high.\n\n【63】*   **False Alarms:** Some CGM patches may issue false alerts or warn users without a need, which can cause confusion or worry in the user.\n\n【64】**2\\. Insulin Patch:**\n\n【65】Insulin patches are a type of wearable medical device that delivers insulin to the body through the skin. They are designed to help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar levels by providing a more convenient and less invasive method of insulin delivery than traditional injections.\n\n【66】The innermost layer of skin is punctured by a tiny microneedle array used in CGM patches in order to deliver insulin to the subcutaneous tissue beneath. The insulin is then absorbed into the bloodstream, where it can help regulate blood sugar levels.\n\n【67】**Features:**\n\n【68】*   **Non-Invasive**: Insulin patches eliminate the need for injections, which can be painful and inconvenient for people with diabetes.\n\n【69】*   **Continuous Delivery**: Insulin patches can provide continuous delivery of insulin, which can help keep blood sugar levels more stable than traditional injections.\n\n【70】*   **Programmable:** Insulin patches can be set up to administer a certain amount of insulin at a certain time, simplifying blood sugar management.\n\n【71】*   **Customizable:** Insulin patches can be customized to suit the wearer's individual needs and preferences, such as adjusting the rate of insulin delivery or setting specific dosages.\n\n【72】**Benefits:**\n\n【73】*   Pain-free.\n\n【74】*   Continuous delivery of insulin.\n\n【75】*   Convenience.\n\n【76】*   Low risk of infection.\n\n【77】**Limitations:**\n\n【78】*   Limited availability.\n\n【79】*   Limited dosing options.\n\n【80】*   Skin irritation.\n\n【81】*   Limited effectiveness.\n\n【82】**Conclusion**\n\n【83】In conclusion, diabetes patches such as CGM and insulin patches offer convenient and potentially effective alternatives to traditional treatments for diabetes.\n\n【84】By utilizing CGM patches that provide real-time glucose monitoring, individuals with diabetes can enhance their ability to regulate blood sugar levels and reduce the likelihood of complications. Insulin patches provide painless, continuous insulin delivery, but some people may have difficulty finding and using them.\n\n【85】Overall, it is crucial to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of diabetic patches with a healthcare professional to decide if they're a good choice for a person's particular needs and circumstances.\n\n【86】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【87】无关删除-1:<u>*   Glucose-responsive insulin patch for the regulation of blood glucose  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32015407/\n*   Glucose-Responsive Microneedle Patches for Diabetes Treatment  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6313291/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

There are so many solutions to treat erectile dysfunction problems that have been proven effective and reliable. Among the most popular ones, penile vibratory stimulation is considered safe. It is claimed to help men last longer and become harder during sex. The procedure is usually performed by a urologist but can be treated by other physicians who are specially trained in performing it.\n\n【2】What Is Penile Vibratory Stimulation?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【3】Penile vibratory stimulation (PVS) is a medical treatment for erectile dysfunction. It uses low-frequency vibration to stimulate the penis, which increases blood flow to the penis and helps to maintain an erection. This can be done using a vibrating toy, vibrating underwear, or even by using a cell phone. PVS is often used as a way to increase pleasure during sex or as a way to help overcome premature ejaculation. It can also be used to increase the intensity of an orgasm.\n\n【4】Penile vibratory stimulation is typically used with other treatments for erectile dysfunction, such as oral medications or penile injections. Penile vibratory stimulation is a relatively new treatment for erectile dysfunction, and more research is needed to determine its long-term effectiveness. However, it is a promising treatment option for many men with erectile dysfunction.\n\n【5】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【7】Erectile Dysfunction in Diabetic Population\n\n【8】Erectile Dysfunction - Causes, Myths, and Facts\n\n【9】Is erectile dysfunction related to my thyroid disease?\n\n【10】How is Penile Vibratory Stimulation Done?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【11】Penile vibratory stimulation is a procedure in which a vibrating device is used to stimulate the penis. PVS is generally performed with the patient lying down. A lubricant is applied to the penis. The vibrating device is then placed on the penis. The patient may be asked to hold the device in place. The procedure is typically done for 15 to 20 minutes. The vibrator is turned on and off at different speeds and intensities to produce different effects.\n\n【12】What Are the Risks Associated With Penile Vibratory Stimulation?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Penile vibratory stimulation is commonly used to elicit ejaculation in men with spinal cord injury (SCI). It is thought that vibratory stimulation can increase blood flow to the penis, which may stimulate an erection and facilitate orgasm. For men with spinal cord injury, it can be helpful to use vibratory stimulation to help them achieve an erection and ejaculate. This procedure is also helpful for men with a stroke or brain injury.\n\n【14】Some of the risks of penile vibratory stimulation are:\n\n【15】*   It may be painful for the men and their partners if they have a phobia about pain or if it hurts too much for the individual to enjoy sex. This could make intimacy difficult because both partners might be too distracted by their discomfort. Before starting, one should discuss this matter so that both parties are comfortable with what will happen during treatment sessions.\n\n【16】*   If spinal cord injury affects one side of the body more than another, then this could lead to different sensations being felt across those areas. This could result in feelings like pain without any real cause, so always check before deciding whether something feels wrong.\n\n【17】What Are the Benefits of Penile Vibratory Stimulation?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Penile vibratory stimulation is a treatment option for men with erectile dysfunction (ED). This therapy uses a device that applies vibration to the penis, which helps to stimulate blood flow and promote an erection. PVS is a non-invasive and safe treatment option effective in some men with erectile dysfunction. There are several potential benefits of using PVS to treat ED, which include:\n\n【19】*   **Improve Erectile Dysfunction:** PVS has improved erectile function in some men. This may be because PVS increases blood flow to the penis, which can help to preserve erectile function.\n\n【20】*   **Non-invasive:** PVS is a non-invasive treatment option, meaning no surgery or other invasiveness is involved. This can make PVS an attractive option for men who are not interested in or are not candidates for other erectile dysfunction treatments, such as surgery or oral medications.\n\n【21】*   **Safe:** PVS is a safe treatment option with few side effects. The side effect of penile vibratory stimulation is numbness or tingling.\n\n【22】Discussing with the doctor is important to learn about the potential benefits and risks.\n\n【23】When to See a Doctor?\n---------------------\n\n【24】There are a few instances when to see a doctor for penile vibratory stimulation. If there is erectile dysfunction, pain in the penis, or a history of penile trauma, consultation with a doctor is necessary. Additionally, if any other medical conditions may be affected by penile vibratory stimulation, speaking with a doctor before starting any new treatments is necessary.\n\n【25】What Has to Be Expected in Penile Vibratory Stimulation?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Penile vibratory stimulation is typically done with a handheld device applied to the penis. The vibration can be adjusted to the patient’s needs and tolerances. Treatment sessions usually last 30 minutes, and most men must undergo multiple sessions before seeing results. Also, there are a few potential side effects to be aware of. Side effects, such as pain, bruising, and numbness. Patients should discuss potential side effects with their doctor before undergoing the procedure. Penile vibratory stimulation is a promising treatment option for men with erectile dysfunction.\n\n【27】**Conclusion:**\n\n【28】Penile vibratory stimulation is a simple and effective way to treat erectile dysfunction. It is also a good choice for men who want an alternative to pills or injections.

The test is of utmost importance in blood transfusion or blood donation cases. This test is also carried out to see the presence of the Rh factor on the surface of red blood cells. Blood typing is based on the presence of certain proteins called antigens on the surface of red blood cells. The blood group (blood type) depends on the blood group passed down from your parents to you. Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian scientist, discovered the blood groups in 1901.\n\n【2】What Are the Blood Types?\n-------------------------\n\n【3】Blood typing is usually done according to the ABO blood typing system. The four major categories of blood are:\n\n【4】*   **Type A-** It has got A antigen.\n\n【5】*   **Type B-** It has got B antigen.\n\n【6】*   **Type AB-** It has got both A and B antigens.\n\n【7】*   **Type O-** It has got neither A nor B antigens.\n\n【8】It is important to know your blood type. Receiving a blood sample incompatible with your blood group might cause a dangerous immune reaction. Blood types are further categorized by Rh (Rhesus) factor:\n\n【9】*   **Rh-Positive:** People having Rh-positive blood group consist of Rh antigens on the surface of erythrocytes. These people can receive blood both from Rh-positive and Rh-negative blood group people.\n\n【10】*   **Rh-Negative:** People having Rh-negative blood groups lack Rh antigens. Therefore, these people can receive only Rh-negative blood.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>无关删除-4:<u>    Related Topics</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    * * *</u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    </u>\n无关删除-4:<u>    I have visible blood in the urine after exercise.

Together, there are eight possible blood types:\n\n【13】*   O-positive blood group.\n\n【14】*   O-negative blood group.\n\n【15】*   A-positive blood group.\n\n【16】*   A-negative blood group.\n\n【17】*   B-positive blood group.\n\n【18】*   B-negative blood group.\n\n【19】*   AB-positive blood group.\n\n【20】*   AB-negative blood group.\n\n【21】Why Is Blood Typing Important?\n------------------------------\n\n【22】Blood typing is carried out before the process of blood transfusion or donation of blood. Blood typing is a safe, quick, and easy way to ensure that the patient receives the right blood group during surgery or after an accidental injury.\n\n【23】If the blood donated is incompatible with the patient’s blood group, it can trigger an unlikely immune response, platelet clumping, or blood agglutination, which can also be life-threatening.\n\n【24】In pregnant women, blood typing is of utmost importance. Suppose the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive. In that case, Rh incompatibility occurs where the antibodies from the mother may damage the fetus's red blood cells via the bloodstream. In such cases, a drug called RhoGAM is given to the mother to prevent this event.\n\n【25】What Are the Risks of Blood Typing?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【26】The blood is withdrawn from the person to evaluate it for blood typing. This procedure can pose minimal risk to the person like:\n\n【27】*   Hematoma formation (bleeding under the skin).\n\n【28】*   Dizziness.\n\n【29】*   Infection at the site of injection.\n\n【30】*   Profuse bleeding.\n\n【31】How to Prepare for a Blood Typing Test?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【32】There is no special preparation required for blood typing. Hydrate yourself well with enough water. Have fruits and fresh juice in case you feel dizzy. Also, it is always better to accompany someone to the hospital.\n\n【33】How Is the Blood Typing Test Performed?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【34】The blood typing test can be performed at a hospital or a pathological laboratory. The skin at the puncture site needs to be disinfected with an antiseptic before the test to prevent infection. A band will be wrapped around the arm by the operator to make the veins more prominent. A needle is inserted to draw the blood sample from the arm. Once the blood is withdrawn, a bandage will be placed over the injection site. A lab technician will mix the blood sample with the antibodies to determine the blood type. This mixing will trigger a reaction in type A and type B blood by the antibodies. The technician will then see how the antibodies react with the blood type.\n\n【35】If the blood cells are clumped together when mixed with antibodies against blood group A, the person has blood type A. The blood sample is then also combined with an anti-Rh serum. If there is a clumping of blood cells in response to the anti-Rh serum, it is suggestive of an Rh-positive blood group in an individual.\n\n【36】Based on the results obtained, the healthcare provider can determine the type of blood that can be safely received by the patient:\n\n【37】*   If a person has type A blood, he can only receive blood from people having type A and O blood.\n\n【38】*   If he has type B blood, he can receive blood from people having type B and O blood.\n\n【39】*   If the patient has type AB blood, he will be able to receive blood from people having blood types A, B, AB, and O.\n\n【40】*   If the person has type O blood, he can only receive blood type O.\n\n【41】*   If the person is Rh+, he can receive either Rh+ or Rh- blood.\n\n【42】*   If he is Rh-, he can only receive Rh- type blood.\n\n【43】What Is the Difference Between Blood Typing and Cross-Matching?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Many other antigens are present besides A, B, and Rh. The minor ones are not detected during the process of blood typing. If left undetected, an immune reaction may trigger while receiving certain blood, even if the A, B, and Rh antigens are matched. Therefore, blood typing is the test used to determine the blood type and Rh factor of a blood sample. Cross-matching involves identifying the best donor for a patient before surgery or blood transfusion.\n\n【45】**Conclusion**\n\n【46】Blood typing is a method to identify the blood type of a person. Blood typing is a very important test that should be done before performing any surgery or blood transfusion process. This test helps prevent any dangerous reaction during surgery that can be fatal at times.\n\n【47】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【48】无关删除-1:<u>*   Red Cross Blood Society  \n    https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-types.html\n*   NHS  \n    https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-groups/\n*   Wikipedia  \n    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood\\_type</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Cigarette smoking is the main causative agent, although other exposures like air pollution, occupation, and biomass fuel are increasingly being recognized as important causative agents.\n\n【2】COPD is characterized by persistent symptoms punctuated by episodes of worsening symptoms beyond day-to-day variability, known as exacerbations. It is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current therapies alleviate symptoms and reduce exacerbations but have little or no effect on disease progression. They follow a one-size-fits-all approach to the disease. However, a greater understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms in COPD has led to advances in targeted biologic therapies for specific cytokines or their receptors. The success of such approaches is predicated on the selection of a patient group in which the intervention will be both safe and effective, and the therapy will be affordable.\n\n【3】What Happens in COPD?\n---------------------\n\n【4】The pathophysiology of COPD comprises the following events:\n\n【5】*   **Airway Inflammation -** Smoking, together with other pollutants, pathogens, and in some cases, allergens, insult the lung, promoting airway inflammation and damage in a susceptible host.\n\n【6】The inflammatory profile in COPD is typically associated with increased CD8-positive T cells (mediators of adaptive immunity and are cytotoxic in nature) and neutrophils. In a few COPD patients, the inflammation is caused due to eosinophils. The cause of eosinophilic inflammation is unknown, but eosinophils have been found in the sputum, broncho-alveolar lavage, and during exacerbations.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】Asthma-COPD Overlap - Effectiveness of Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonists\n\n【10】Conventional Non-platinum Cancer Chemotherapy - The Neurological Complications\n\n【11】Adjuvant Pembrolizumab in Renal Cell Carcinoma - An Overview\n\n【12】*   **Airway Re-modelling -** Airway remodeling refers to structural changes that occur in small and large airways. Remodeling changes that occur in COPD include disruption and loss of cilia (filaments that remove the microbes and debris out of the airways), squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium (benign changes in the squamous epithelium), goblet cell hyperplasia (increase in the number of goblet cells), mucous gland enlargement, bronchiolar smooth muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy (increase in the number and size of bronchiolar smooth muscles, which secrete inflammatory mediators), airway wall fibrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration.\n\n【13】Small airways are the major site of airway obstruction in COPD. Airway obstruction in COPD is due to a combination of remodeling and the accumulation of inflammatory exudates within the airway lumen.\n\n【14】Epithelial changes observed in COPD include small airway squamous metaplasia, which increases with increasing COPD severity. These squamous cells express increased interleukin (IL-1ꞵ), which induces fibrotic response along with activation of the transforming growth factor (TGF- β). TGF- β is a potent fibrogenic factor, and its activation correlates with disease severity and small airway thickening in COPD.\n\n【15】*   **Lung Damage -** The inflammatory infiltrates, along with the fibrosis and airway thickening, leads to emphysema, which in turn leads to the activation of neutrophils. These neutrophils release neutrophil elastase, a proteinase that can destroy elastin (an essential part of the extracellular matrix of the lung).\n\n【16】Apart from this, macrophages and neutrophils are also found in abundance in the COPD airways, and they release elastolytic proteinases, which, when activated, will lead to the degradation of the extracellular matrix.\n\n【17】What Are the Biologics in COPD?\n-------------------------------\n\n【18】The two standard drugs used in the management of COPD are bronchodilators and anti-inflammatories. However, the recent advancement in molecular biology has furthered the understanding of inflammatory pathways in the pathogenesis of COPD and led to the development of targeted therapies in the form of biologics.\n\n【19】According to the World Health Organization (WHO), biologics are a heterogeneous group of drugs that include growth factors, vaccines, antibodies, immunomodulators, human plasma, and blood, all of which target specific genotypes of protein receptors. The various biologics used in the management of COPD are:\n\n【20】*   **Omalizumab -** Omalizumab is the first monoclonal antibody cleared for the management of COPD and asthma. Monoclonal antibodies are artificially created proteins that act like human antibodies in the immune system. Omalizumab targets IgE (immunoglobulin E) - an antibody responsible for causing hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n【21】In COPD, the inhaled allergens stimulate the production of IgE by B-lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The binding of the IgE to the allergen induces the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine or leukotrienes, leading to the bronchoconstriction seen in COPD exacerbations.\n\n【22】Omalizumab binds to the IgE, which inhibits the binding of the IgE to the allergen, thereby limiting the degree of release of the inflammatory mediators.\n\n【23】*   **Mepolizumab -** Mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to target IL-5, which is a cytokine that regulates the proliferation, maturation, migration, and effector functions of eosinophils. Several studies have shown that Mepolizumab can significantly reduce eosinophil-induced exacerbations compared to a placebo. Other biologics that also target IL-5 are Reslizumab and Benralizumab.\n\n【24】*   **Dupilumab -** It is a monoclonal antibody that targets IL-4, which plays an important role in regulating antibody production and the development of effector T-cell (a type of white blood cell) responses.\n\n【25】Dupilimab inhibits the receptors of IL-4, prevents exacerbations, and improves lung function in patients receiving long-acting beta-agonists (for COPD and asthma) and inhaled steroids.\n\n【26】*   **Lebrikizumab And Tralokinumab -** Both are monoclonal antibodies that target IL-3 - a protein that functionally activates neutrophils, macrophages, and other immune cells, all of which promote inflammation. These drugs have initially yielded benefits with respect to airway function but are still being studied further in regard to their application in COPD.\n\n【27】*   **Tezepelumab (AMG-157) -** It targets thymic stromal lipoprotein, which is a relatively novel target for COPD. It is an epithelial-derived cytokine that drives allergic inflammatory responses by activating dendritic cells (a specialized immune cell that presents antigens to other immune cells) and mast cells (a white blood cell rich in histamine and heparin).\n\n【28】Tezepelumab lowers the rates of exacerbation by binding to the thymic stromal lipoprotein.\n\n【29】*   **Brodalumab -** It is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to IL-17- a cytokine that plays an important role in the immunologic responses seen in COPD and asthma. IL-17 receptor activation leads to the secretion of inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-ɑ) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, both of which ultimately lead to neutrophil recruitment.\n\n【30】Brodalumab binds to the IL-17 receptor and inhibits the activation of inflammatory mediators.\n\n【31】Apart from the biologics mentioned above, a couple of biologics that are still being researched are Navarixin and Imatinib.\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】Biologics in the treatment of COPD have mixed responses, mainly because most of them target neutrophil-mediated inflammation. This is not effective in patients in whom the inflammation is mediated by eosinophils. However, new drugs are emerging that target this pathway. A combination that targets both pathways will improve the outcome.\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【35】无关删除-1:<u>*   Biologic therapies  \n    https://copdx.org.au/copd-x-plan/o-optimise-function/o4-inhaled-combination-therapy/o4-3-biologic-therapies/\n*   Biologics and Potential for Immune Modulation in Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease  \n    https://journal.copdfoundation.org/jcopdf/id/1386/Journal-Club-Biologics-and-Potential-for-Immune-Modulation-in-Chronic-Obstructive-Lung-Disease\n*   Biologics and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29729941/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Children infected with this disease typically have a high-grade fever followed by the development of a rash that does not itch or hurt. It is caused by a human herpes virus 6 or, occasionally, human herpes virus 7 that spreads from one to another. Roseola infantum is usually not a severe problem. However, it is a clinically diagnosed, self-limited illness that needs symptomatic treatment.\n\n【2】Who Can Get Roseola Infantum?\n-----------------------------\n\n【3】Anyone can get roseola infantum, but the virus mainly affects children between six months and three years. They are at particular risk of acquiring the disease because they lack antibodies against many viruses. Newborns are well protected by antibodies developed by their mothers during pregnancy. But this immunity diminishes with time. As a result, the roseola infantum infection most frequently occurs in the spring and fall.\n\n【4】What Causes Roseola Infantum?\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】Because roseola infantum is usually caused by a human herpes virus 6, it is sometimes known as the sixth disease. Less frequently, it can occur due to the human herpesvirus 7. However, unlike other childhood viral illnesses and chicken pox that transmit rapidly, roseola infantum rarely results in a communitywide outbreak.\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Roseola Infantum?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Symptoms can take about nine to ten days to develop after exposure to an infected person or may not appear. It is also possible to get infected with roseola but not show any sign of it. The symptoms may include:\n\n【8】*   **Fever** - A high-grade fever (often above 103 degrees Fahrenheit or 39.5 degrees Celcius) is often the first sign of illness. The fever may last from three to seven days.\n\n【9】*   **Rash** - Once the fever goes away, a rash often appears on the stomach that may spread to the back, neck, arms, belly, legs, and face. The rash is made of flat, pink, or red spots or patches that are not itchy or painful. The rash can disappear after a few hours or days but may be noticeable for one to two days.\n\n【10】*   **Seizures** - A febrile seizure or a seizure due to on quick rise in body temperature may occur. However, this type of seizure is rarely harmful. However, one should seek emergency care if one believes their child has had a seizure.\n\n【11】*   Children with roseola may also experience flu-like symptoms, such as:\n\n【12】    *   Sore throat.\n\n【13】    *   Runny nose.\n\n【14】    *   Slight cough.\n\n【15】    *   Diarrhea.\n\n【16】    *   Swollen lymph nodes.\n\n【17】**Is Roseola Infantum Contagious?**\n\n【18】Roseola infantum is no longer contagious after the fever goes away for 24 hours, even if the rash is still there. However, roseola is contagious and can spread from one person to another via saliva or other respiratory droplets when a person infected with roseola coughs, sneezes, or talks.\n\n【19】How Is Roseola Infantum Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------\n\n【20】Usually, no laboratory tests are necessary to diagnose roseola. Instead, diagnosis is based on telltale symptoms, such as a high fever followed by a rash. Sometimes the doctor may order a blood test to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【21】How Is Roseola Infantum Treated?\n--------------------------------\n\n【22】There is no specific treatment for roseola. The symptoms generally clear up naturally in about a week as the virus runs its course. To reduce the fever, the healthcare provider may recommend over-the-counter medications for infants or children, such as Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen. Treatment is unnecessary for rash because it does not itch or cause pain. However, people with weakened immune systems may require antiviral medications like Ganciclovir. Take precautions when giving Aspirin to children or teenagers. Although Aspirin is approved in children above age 3, children and teenagers recovering from flu-like symptoms or chicken pox should never take it. This is because Aspirin has been related to Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe disorder, in such children.\n\n【23】**Lifestyle and Home Remedies:**\n\n【24】After the fever subsides, the child often feels better soon. Roseola infantum rash is painless and disappears in one to three days. No creams or ointments are needed. To treat the child's fever at home, the health care professional may recommend:\n\n【25】*   Take plenty of rest. Let the child take proper rest in bed until the fever goes away.\n\n【26】*   Take plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration, such as water, lemon soda, an electrolyte rehydration solution, clear broth, and sports drinks.\n\n【27】*   Give the child a lukewarm sponge bath or apply a cool, wet cloth to the forehead to soothe the fever.\n\n【28】How Is Roseola Infantum Prevented?\n----------------------------------\n\n【29】There is no vaccine or antiviral therapy to prevent roseola infantum. However, maintaining good hygiene is the most effective way to not spread the virus. To lower infection risk, the following tips may help:\n\n【30】*   First, avoid coming in close contact with people infected.\n\n【31】*   Make a habit of coughing and sneezing into the tissue or crook of an elbow.\n\n【32】*   Wash hands frequently and use hand sanitizers.\n\n【33】**What Is the Prognosis or Outlook For People With Roseola Infantum?**\n\n【34】Roseola infantum has an excellent prognosis. Most children recover from roseola infantum without any long-term health problems. However, immuno-compromised children, due to an organ transplant, cancers, and autoimmune are less resistant to viruses. So, they will likely get roseola complications, including pneumonia or encephalitis. Once infected, children acquire immunity to the virus, so they are unlikely to get the disease again. In addition, about 10 to 15 percent of children with roseola infantum experience febrile seizures due to a sudden rise in body temperature. The seizure typically lasts less than 15 minutes. These seizures are usually not harmful and are not a sign of epilepsy.\n\n【35】**Conclusion:**\n\n【36】Roseola infantum is a common self-limited childhood illness that rarely causes serious health problems. Symptoms usually improve with over-the-counter medications and simple home-based treatment. However, one should contact a healthcare professional if the child has a febrile seizure, even though these seizures are not a sign of epilepsy and are harmless. Unfortunately, the child may unknowingly infect others by the time symptoms appear. Therefore, once the child falls ill with the virus, take the proper hygiene measures to stop the spread of the virus.\n\n【37】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>*   Roseola infantum  \n    https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/roseola-infantum\n*   Roseola infantum  \n    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448190/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "03b6b5d5-4b94-48d5-bfd4-eca6bd0d1576", "title": "Bariatric or Weight-Loss Surgery - Introduction, Types, and Complications", "text": "【0】Bariatric or Weight-Loss Surgery - Introduction, Types, and Complications\n**What Is Bariatric Surgery?**\n------------------------------\n\n【1】Bariatric surgery is a procedure done to reduce food intake in obese individuals to allow them to lose weight. Body mass index (BMI) determines whether a person is obese. If a person’s BMI is over 30, they are classed as obese. The recovery time varies depending on the patient, but it usually takes months to resume normal daily activities after the surgery. Most patients have to follow a liquid diet, introducing solid food gradually. This surgery helps a person lose weight and lowers the risk of heart problems, diabetes, stroke, etc. associated with obesity.\n\n【2】**How Does Bariatric Surgery Help in Weight Loss?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Bariatric surgery helps in weight loss in the following two ways:\n\n【4】It physically limits the amount of food that the stomach can contain. This, in turn, limits the intake of calories.\n\n【5】The food we eat gets absorbed into the body from the small intestine. This surgery also bypasses part of the small intestine, which reduces the number of calories absorbed.\n\n【6】**What Are the Common Types of Bariatric Surgery Performed?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The common types of bariatric surgery are:\n\n【8】*   Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.\n*   Sleeve gastrectomy.\n*   Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding.\n*   Duodenal switch with biliopancreatic diversion.\n\n【9】The most commonly used procedure amongst these is gastric bypass. Here, the digestive system past the stomach is re-routed to suppress hunger and makes the individual feel full. During the gastric band procedure, an inflatable band is placed around the stomach's upper portion, making the stomach smaller. Therefore, people eat less and feel full after undergoing this procedure. In sleeve gastrectomy, 80 % of the stomach is removed, limiting the food a person can eat at a time.\n\n【10】**What is Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass?**\n\n【11】It is otherwise called gastric bypass, the most common type of surgery to achieve weight loss.\n\n【12】**Procedure -** Here, a small stomach pouch of around 30 ml is created by separating the top portion of the stomach from the rest, and the upper portion of the small intestine is also divided. After dividing the stomach and small intestine, the small stomach pouch is connected to the lower divided end of the small intestine. In the end, the small intestine's top portion is connected further down to the small intestine's lower end, allowing the stomach acids and digestive enzymes to mix with the passing food.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【15】Please suggest the best remedy for back pain.\n\n【16】I am facing mild jaundice and loose motions after bariatric surgery. Please help.\n\n【17】Metabolic Syndrome\n\n【18】The small stomach pouch that is created holds less food, and as a part of the small intestine is bypassed, fewer nutrients and calories get absorbed by the body. The surgery also changes the hormones in the gut, which promotes satiety, suppresses hunger, and reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\n【19】**Advantages:**\n\n【20】*   Long-term weight loss of up to 60 % to 80 % of excess weight.\n*   It increases metabolism.\n*   It restricts the amount of food intake.\n*   The person feels full, and his appetite reduces.\n*   Helps manage blood sugar levels in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes.\n*   Most people can maintain more than 50 % weight loss in the long run.\n\n【21】**Disadvantages:**\n\n【22】*   A complicated surgery than the other options.\n*   It can cause long-term vitamin and mineral deficiencies.\n*   It takes longer for the patients to recover.\n*   It requires the patients to restrict their diet to certain foods and take vitamins or minerals lifelong.\n\n【23】**What Is Sleeve GastrectomySurgery?**\n\n【24】It is otherwise called laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. In this procedure, around 80 % of the stomach is removed.\n\n【25】**Procedure -** As almost 80 % of the stomach is removed, the remaining portion of the stomach is small, tubular, and looks like a banana. It almost works similarly to gastric bypass. The new and small stomach holds very little food, so the patient eats less. Like gastric bypass, this also affects the gut hormone, resulting in satiety, blood sugar control, and less hunger. This procedure also helps type 2 diabetes patients manage blood glucose levels independent of weight loss.\n\n【26】**Advantages:**\n\n【27】*   It restricts the amount of food intake.\n*   Weight loss can be achieved rapidly.\n*   It does not require bypassing the food passage.\n*   Patients can go home within a couple of days of surgery.\n*   The changes in gut hormones suppress hunger, reduce appetite, and improve satiety.\n\n【28】**Disadvantages:**\n\n【29】*   It is non-reversible.\n*   It might cause vitamin deficiencies.\n*   The complications are more compared to the adjustable gastric band.\n\n【30】**What is Adjustable Gastric Band Surgery?**\n\n【31】This procedure is otherwise called the band. Here, an inflatable band is placed around the upper portion of the stomach, which creates and separates a small portion of the stomach above the band from the rest of the stomach.\n\n【32】**Procedure -** The distance between the band and stomach opening can be adjusted, determining the size of the stomach pouch. The smaller the distance, the lesser will be the food intake. If the stomach pouch is small, eating a small amount of food will make the person feel full. This size of the stomach opening can be easily adjusted by injecting sterile saline and is adjusted slowly over time. In this procedure, normal digestion and absorption are not affected. It does not alter the gut hormones. Thus, it is not useful in controlling blood sugar levels. It only reduces the amount of food a person can consume.\n\n【33】**Advantages:**\n\n【34】*   It can help lose 40 % to 50 % of excess weight.\n*   The patient can go home in less than a day after the procedure.\n*   It reduces calories by reducing the amount of food the stomach can hold.\n*   It has the lowest complications and mortality rate compared to all other bariatric procedures.\n*   There is no need to cut a part of the stomach or reroute the small intestine.\n*   The band can be removed and adjusted when needed.\n*   It does not cause vitamin or mineral deficiencies.\n\n【35】**Disadvantages:**\n\n【36】*   Weight loss achieved is slower than that by other procedures.\n*   In some patients, the band slips or results in its erosion into the stomach.\n*   Some patients fail to lose 50 % of excess weight.\n*   The band, a foreign device, has to be in the body throughout.\n*   Most patients need a second operation.\n*   If the patient overeats, it can dilate the esophagus.\n*   It requires the patients to stick to a strict diet.\n\n【37】**What Is Duodenal Switch With Biliopancreatic Diversion?**\n\n【38】In this procedure, a small tubular stomach pouch is made by cutting a large portion of the stomach, similar to sleeve gastrectomy. And then, a portion of the small intestine is bypassed. This is considered the most effective way to control blood sugar levels.\n\n【39】**Procedure -** After sleeve gastrectomy is done, that is, a large portion of the stomach cut to make the remaining stomach look like a small tubular structure or a banana, and the first part of the small intestine (duodenum) is connected to a segment of the last portion of the small intestine. This is then connected to the outlet of the new small tubular stomach. This allows the patient's food to pass through the small stomach and reach directly to the last portion of the small intestine.\n\n【40】The gastric juices and enzymes in the small intestine are also carried to its distal end, where the food is digested and broken down. As the food is not digested until it reaches far down the small intestine, the amount of calories and nutrients absorbed is far less. And as the stomach size is small, the patient eats less. As the food route is altered, it alters the gut hormones, reducing hunger, increased satiety, and blood sugar control.\n\n【41】**Advantages:**\n\n【42】*   It results in almost 60 % to 70 % of excess weight loss and is the most effective among all the other weight-loss surgeries.\n*   The patient eventually eats almost normal meals.\n*   The amount of fat absorbed reduces to 70 %.\n*   It is most effective in controlling blood glucose in diabetic patients.\n\n【43】**Disadvantages:**\n\n【44】*   It is the most effective procedure, but it can also result in the highest rates of complications and death.\n*   The patients take longer to recover.\n*   It results in lifelong vitamin and mineral deficiencies.\n\n【45】**What Are the Complications of Bariatric Surgery?**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】Some of the common complications include:\n\n【47】*   Patients have abdominal pain, diarrhea, and acid reflux after eating.\n\n【48】*   They eat a very limited amount of food throughout their life.\n\n【49】*   It can result in severe mineral and nutritional deficiencies.\n\n【50】*   Post-operative bleeding.\n\n【51】*   Infection in the incisions.\n\n【52】*   Formation of blood clots in the deep veins.\n\n【53】*   Ascites (collection of fluid and pus in the abdominal cavity), if the surgeon accidentally punctures the intestine or stomach.\n\n【54】*   Intestinal obstruction.\n\n【55】Always talk to a doctor before deciding on getting any of the above-mentioned surgeries. Make sure you are aware of all the risks that are associated with it.\n\n【56】**Conclusion:**\n\n【57】The weight after bariatric surgery depends on the individual and the type of surgery performed. Most people may regain some weight over time. However, the amount is often small compared to the initial weight. Achieving weight goals depends on not only surgery but also lifestyle.\n\n【58】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【59】* * *\n\n【60】#### **1.**删除换行**What Is Bariatric Surgery?**\n\n【61】Bariatric surgeries are done to reduce weight by reducing the size of the stomach. This procedure helps reduce the food intake of people who are obese, thereby helping them lose weight. Reducing weight in obese people can lead to better outcomes, like lowering the risk of diabetes, stroke, and heart problems.\n\n【62】#### **2.**删除换行**What Are the Advantages of Bariatric Surgery?**\n\n【63】Bariatric surgery helps obese individuals lose weight. The size of the stomach is reduced in this surgery, thereby reducing the food intake, which eventually leads to weight loss. There will be long-term weight loss of up to 60 to 80 percent of excess weight. It also helps boost the metabolism and helps reduce appetite.\n\n【64】#### **3.**删除换行**How Can Bariatric Surgery Be Classified?**\n\n【65】The four types of bariatric surgery include:  \n\\- Sleeve gastrectomy (a major portion of the stomach is vertically resected and a tube-shaped remnant is left in the lesser curvature).  \n\\- Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (a gastric pouch is connected with the small intestine bypassing the duodenum, stomach, and proximal part of the jejunum).  \n\\- Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (in the upper part of the stomach, a band is placed to create a small pouch that can hold food).  \n\\- Duodenal switch with biliopancreatic diversion (80 percent of the stomach is removed and a small tube-shaped portion of the stomach is left).  \nOut of these, the most common type of surgery is a gastric bypass. In sleeve gastrectomy, about 80 percent of the stomach is removed.\n\n【66】#### **4.**删除换行**Is Bariatric Surgery Considered Safe?**\n\n【67】Bariatric surgeries have been found to be the safest procedure for weight loss in obese patients. However, the risks of surgery are still there. Some complications that can occur during or after surgery include blood clots, internal bleeding, and infection.\n\n【68】#### **5.**删除换行**What Is the Success Rate for Bariatric Surgery?**\n\n【69】With sleeve gastrectomy, about 80 percent of the stomach is removed, thereby limiting food intake. As a result, there will be a long-term weight loss of up to 60 to 80 percent of body weight. Most people will be able to maintain more than 50 percent weight loss in the long run.\n\n【70】#### **6.**删除换行**What Is the Duration of Bariatric Surgery?**\n\n【71】The duration of bariatric surgery can take from one to two hours approximately. This can vary between different surgical techniques and also in different hospitals. Patients will attain recovery within three to four weeks.\n\n【72】#### **7.**删除换行**What Is the Weight Range for Undergoing Bariatric Surgery?**\n\n【73】People with a body mass index of 35 or higher are considered suitable for this surgery. Individuals with a BMI ranging from 30 to 35, along with conditions like heart disease, diabetes, severe sleep apnea, and indicated for weight loss surgery, can also undergo this procedure.\n\n【74】#### **8.**删除换行**Which Is Considered the Best Long-Term Bariatric Surgery?**\n\n【75】Gastric sleeve surgery is the most common type and has a high success rate. It is also considered a safe procedure. With sleeve gastrectomy, about 80 percent of the stomach is removed, and weight loss can be maintained.\n\n【76】#### **9.**删除换行**How to Lose Weight the Best Way?**\n\n【77】Losing weight can be done naturally by altering certain habits and including a few lifestyle changes. Some tips for natural weight loss are:  \n\\- Eating a healthy balanced meal without skipping any meal.  \n\\- Reduce intake of processed foods.  \n\\- Avoid junk foods.  \n\\- Sleep eight hours a day.  \n\\- Exercise regularly.  \n\\- Stay active and hydrated throughout the day.\n\n【78】#### **10.**删除换行**Is Bariatric Surgery Everlasting?**\n\n【79】The bariatric surgical procedure is permanent and cannot be reversed. It can help the individual to maintain weight for up to ten years. However, weight loss from bariatric surgeries is not permanent unless the individual follows some lifestyle modifications to maintain weight. However, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass operations are risky but reversible.\n\n【80】#### **11.**删除换行**Are Weight Loss Surgeries Healthy?**\n\n【81】Surgery should not be considered when there is a natural way to lose weight. Bariatric surgeries have some potential disadvantages, like vitamin deficiencies and decreased appetite. There can be surgical complications during procedures like this.\n\n【82】#### **12.**删除换行**What Foods Are Weight-Loss Friendly?**\n\n【83】Eating the right portion of food only when hungry can help in weight loss. Overeating or skipping meals are two extremes that can influence the weight loss journey. Some of the foods that can help maintain weight are:  \n\\- Whole eggs.  \n\\- Leafy green vegetables.  \n\\- Chicken breast.  \n\\- Tuna.  \n\\- Beans and legumes.  \n\\- Nuts.\n\n【84】#### **13.**删除换行**What Is the Recovery Period for Bariatric Surgery?**\n\n【85】The hospital stay after surgery can be from two to three days for most individuals.

{"seq_id": "852462cb-241e-493b-af63-03001af2ca9a", "title": "Erectile Dysfunction in Diabetic Population", "text": "【0】Erectile Dysfunction in Diabetic Population\nWhy Is Erectile Dysfunction Common in People With Diabetes?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【1】People with diabetes are at a higher risk (three times more likely) of developing erectile dysfunction (ED) than non-diabetic people. At least half the diabetics develop erectile dysfunction, and the risk increases with age. ED is the most neglected complication of diabetes, which is prevalent among the general population between 40 to 70 years. Improved techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of erectile dysfunction have given males with diabetes some confidence in managing this prevalent and emotionally disturbing complication. Erectile dysfunction is commonly seen in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【2】Why Does Erectile Dysfunction Happen?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【3】Erectile dysfunction is when the person cannot achieve or maintain an erection adequate to have intercourse. It is common in people with diabetes. People with diabetes are not only at a higher risk (three times more likely compared to nondiabetic people) of developing erectile dysfunction compared to nondiabetic people, but they also develop it at an earlier age (preceded by at least 10 to 15 years). At least half the diabetic people develop erectile dysfunction, and the risk correspondingly increases with age.\n\n【4】How Does Erection Happen Normally in the First Place?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Understanding this will help you understand the \"why\" of erectile dysfunction in diabetes mellitus.\n\n【6】The penis, in its normal and more common physiological state, remains flaccid. The other physiological state for this organ is the erection. The fluctuation between these two states results due to the activity of muscle cells in the corpora cavernosa. The contraction of the muscles leads to the flaccid state, and the relaxation of the same muscles leads to the erect state. The erection occurs by the release of chemical messengers like nitric oxide, acetylcholine, etc. This relaxation of the smooth muscles leads to an increase in blood flow to the penis. The arterial supply increases due to the arteriolar dilatation.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>无关删除-2:<u>Related Topics</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-3:<u>* * *</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-3:<u>I have no desire for sex.Is it because I use tobacco?</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-3:<u>I have fear of ED since I turned 50. Is my condition worrisome?</u>\n\n【11】My penis is not erecting properly. Please advice ayurvedic treatment.\n\n【12】On the other hand, venous compression leads to the reduced outflow of blood from the penis in the venous system. This causes a rise in the pressure within the urethra in the penis and may lead to the change of the physiological position from the dependent (or flaccid) state to the full erection phase. Some other muscles also help the erection allowing the rigid erection phase.\n\n【13】Therefore, to shatter another common myth, neither the age nor race of a person nor the size of the penis in the dependent (flaccid) state affect or predict the erectile length of the penis. So, why is this article shattering this myth here? Because many diabetic males are overly concerned about the length of the erect penis and wrongly call a shorter length of the penis as erectile dysfunction.\n\n【14】Why Does Diabetes Mellitus Lead to Impotence?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【15】A longer duration of diabetes mellitus, poor control of sugar, older population, and patients with diabetic neuropathy are at a higher risk of developing erectile dysfunction. These factors also cause erectile dysfunction to be more severe as compared to that in the non-diabetic population. Such patients also report a lower response to medicines. Therefore, both the impairment and the reduced quality of life are higher in the diabetic population.\n\n【16】The Mechanism of Erectile Dysfunction in People Who Suffer from Diabetes Mellitus:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】1\\. It is a neuropathic process - diabetic neuropathy involves both autonomic as well as somatic nerves. These nerves are the ones that are largely responsible for penile erection. Nitric oxide (also known as an endothelium-derived relaxing factor) is a signaling molecule (or a chemical, biological messenger) in the body that is supplied through the nerve. The cell lining of the blood vessels all over the body uses nitric oxide to allow vasodilatation and increase blood flow. When the nerves are affected, this messenger is reduced, and the usual regular relaxation of the corporal smooth muscle does not happen. This relaxation of the corporal muscle is the main reason behind the occurrence of a penile erection. Since the release mechanism of nitric oxide is impaired due to nerve damage, an erection does not happen.\n\n【18】2\\. It is also a vascular problem - diabetic vascular dysfunction occurs due to lipid deposition in the blood vessels (also known as atherosclerosis). This leads to a reduction of the diameter of the vessel wall lumen where the lipids are deposited. The decrease in the lumen wall reduces the blood flowing in the blood vessels (and therefore to the penis). Thus, an erection is not achieved. This vascular damage also affects the release of nitric oxide (whose need is already explained above).\n\n【19】3\\. It is a hormonal problem (other than diabetes mellitus) - there is a lower testosterone level in diabetic men because of its effect on the 'master endocrine gland,' the pituitary. This reduces the reproductive functioning and sexual desire amongst diabetic men.\n\n【20】4\\. It has a large psychological component in many patients - Depression, a common psychiatric condition, is much more commonly seen in diabetic men. This, coupled with other factors described above, aggravate erectile dysfunction further. Erectile dysfunction itself increases mental stress, which affects personal relationships, sexual life, and quality of life. This further propagates depression.\n\n【21】How to Tell If Erectile Dysfunction Is Due to Psychological Cause or a Disease?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Patients with a psychological cause usually report a sudden onset of erectile dysfunction. It occurs in specific situations and usually does not bother them when they masturbate. Often, spontaneous erections do occur. It usually signifies a relationship problem, a significant life event or problem causing anxiety or depression, or fear.\n\n【23】These features are not observed if one has erectile dysfunction due to a disease like diabetes mellitus. Often, these patients complain of associated pain in the penis.\n\n【24】**Conclusion:**\n\n【25】Proper treatment of diabetes mellitus, regular screening for low testosterone, and early detection of erectile dysfunction can improve these people's health and quality of life. An erectile dysfunction prescription can be obtained online in a telemedicine platform or through an in-person consultation. early detection is crucial for better results.\n\n【26】### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n【27】* * *\n\n【28】#### **1.**删除换行**Does Diabetes Cause Erection Problems?**\n\n【29】Diabetes is a debilitating disease that, left uncontrolled, can cause extensive vascular damage and neuropathies (nerve damage). Erection, which is a vascular response to neural stimuli, can be affected by diabetes. Diabetic men are likely to have three times the difficulty in having or maintaining an erection.\n\n【30】#### **2.**删除换行**What Is the Remedy for Erectile Dysfunction in Diabetic Patients?**\n\n【31】Erectile dysfunction is common in diabetic males, but it can be managed. To successfully treat the dysfunction, the individual must first focus on controlling the blood sugar levels through medication, weight management, diet control, lifestyle choices, and overall mental and physical well-being. Medications like Sildenafil, Tadalafil, Vardenafil, or Avanafilcan make it easier to get and maintain an erection.\n\n【32】#### **3.**删除换行**Is It Possible to Reverse Diabetic Erectile Dysfunction?**\n\n【33】Erectile dysfunction borne out of uncontrolled diabetes can be managed to some extent, making it easier for individuals with erections. However, any existing vascular damage and neuropathies cannot be reversed. The best way to prevent worsening is to manage the diabetic levels via a strict anti-diabetic protocol and erectile dysfunction medications.\n\n【34】#### **4.**删除换行**Do All Diabetics Have Erectile Dysfunction?**\n\n【35】According to estimates, 35 % to 75 % of diabetic men will acquire some degree of erectile dysfunction. Diabetic men develop this problem around 10 to 15 years earlier than their non-diabetic peers. According to a study, 90 % of men complaining of erectile dysfunction had diabetes or at least one diabetic risk factor.\n\n【36】#### **5.**删除换行**How Safe Is Viagra in Diabetic Patients?**\n\n【37】Originally conceived as an antihypertensive and cardioprotective drug, Viagra (or, Sildenafil) has been a boon for men with erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil is an effective and safe drug for erectile dysfunction in diabetic males, potentially increasing successful intercourses by about 6 % to 49 %.\n\n【38】#### **6.**删除换行**What Is the Effect of Metformin on Erection?**\n\n【39】Metformin is an oral hyperglycemic drug used to treat type-2 diabetes. As with any medication, Metformin carries its own set of side effects like reduction in testosterone levels and sex drive, which induces low testosterone-induced erectile dysfunction in diabetic males. Diabetes-induced peripheral neuropathy, vascular damage, and Metformin use can significantly affect the sex life of diabetic males.\n\n【40】#### **7.**删除换行**Why Is Viagra Ineffective in Diabetics?**\n\n【41】Around 50 % of erectile dysfunction males with type-1 diabetes and 60 % of type-2 diabetes reported improved conditions. However, the drug stops working in some patients mainly due to diabetic neuropathy and vascular damage that makes Viagra unable to increase blood flow to the penis.\n\n【42】#### **8.**删除换行**Does Too Much Sugar Intake Cause Erectile Dysfunction?**\n\n【43】Too much sugar intake, once in a while, would cause no harm to erection capabilities. However, regular high-sugar and high-fat diets can decrease testosterone levels and sex drives and induce erectile dysfunction. A long-term unhealthy diet can cause diabetes which is responsible for most erectile dysfunction cases due to nerve and vessel damage.\n\n【44】#### **9.**删除换行**Can Exercise Help With Erectile Dysfunction?**\n\n【45】Along with medications, exercise can help people with erectile dysfunction. Individuals who participated in moderate to high-intensity exercises at least four times a week, each session of at least 40 minutes, reported the best results. Overall, weekly exercises of 160 minutes for six months reportedly decrease erection problems in males and aid in diabetes management.\n\n【46】#### **10.**删除换行**How Can a Woman Help Her Husband With Erectile Dysfunction?**\n\n【47】Men with erectile issues often suffer low self-esteem and avoid discussing the problem, even with their wives. Women would be aware of their husband's issues and can initiate destigmatization with a conversation regarding the same, which is the first step of management. Some of the steps that the women might take are:  \n\\- Find the right time to talk.  \n\\- Discuss the concern and confront the issues.  \n\\- Reassure him that he is not alone.  \n\\- Educate one’s own self about the condition and possible treatment options.  \n\\- Offer to accompany him for a specialist visit.  \n\\- Guide and help through lifestyle choices and changes.  \n\\- Express affection in other ways.  \n\\- Be creative and adventurous in intimate activitie\n\n【48】#### **11.**删除换行**Which Exercises Can Help With Erectile Dysfunction?**\n\n【49】Exercise, especially aerobic and ones involving the pelvis, has been reported to improve erections in diabetic males. Some aerobic exercises to help with erectile dysfunction are cycling, spin classes, boxing, rowing, running, and skipping. Exercises involving the pelvis, also known as Kegels (pelvic floor exercises), include floor lying on back squeezes, floor lying in side squeezes and sitting in a chair squeezes. Pilates exercises like knee fallouts, supine floor raises, and pelvic curls also help with the problem.\n\n【50】#### **12.**删除换行**Can Viagra Increase Blood Sugar Levels?**\n\n【51】On the contrary, Viagra reportedly increases insulin sensitivity by about 20 %, which translates to improved sugar intake by the muscle cells, thereby decreasing blood glucose levels. Hence, Viagra can help reduce risks in prediabetic individuals and help manage erectile and hyperglycemic conditions in diabetics.\n\n【52】#### **13.**删除换行**Is It Okay to Take Viagra With Metformin?**\n\n【53】Metformin creates erectile dysfunction conditions, while Viagra helps treat the same. However, no inter-drug interaction was found between the said drugs. In a very small group of men, it was found that Metformin increased the effectiveness of Sildenafil (Viagra).\n\n【54】#### **14.**删除换行**Is It Possible for Diabetics to Increase Testosterone Levels?**\n\n【55】High-intensity exercises and strength training can increase testosterone levels. Aerobic exercise, pelvic exercises, and pilates improve erectile problems and increase insulin sensitivity. Hence, regular workout helps with diabetes, weight management, stress management, diabetes risk factors, erectile dysfunction, and testosterone levels.\n\n【56】#### **15.**删除换行**What Does Erectile Dysfunction Feel Like?**\n\n【57】Erectile dysfunction affects not only sexual health but also mental health. Individuals have low self-esteem, low self-confidence, lack of sexual drive, and self-doubt, avoid intimacy with their partner, and feel guilty and embarrassed. Due to low testosterone, individuals also report high fatigue, muscle weakness, and loss of body hair.\n\n【58】无关删除-1:<u>Article Resources</u>\n\n【59】无关删除-1:<u>*   Erectile dysfunction and diabetes  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12643124/\n*   Erectile dysfunction in diabetes mellitus: A review  \n    https://www.journalofdiabetology.org/article.asp?issn=2078-7685;year=2020;volume=11;issue=1;spage=1;epage=7;aulast=Jumani\n*   Erectile dysfunction in young men with type 1 diabetes  \n    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27654032/</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "icliniq_article", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
