【41】Boostrix Polio \[Canadian product\]: Additional contraindications: History of transient thrombocytopenia following an earlier immunization against diphtheria and/or tetanus

【42】Warnings/Precautions

【43】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【44】• Anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions: Immediate treatment (including epinephrine 1 mg/mL) for anaphylactoid and/or hypersensitivity reactions should be available during vaccine use (ACIP \[Kroger 2023\]). Boostrix-Polio and Infanrix-IPV \[Canadian products\] labeling recommend monitoring for hypersensitivity reactions for 30 minutes after administration.

【45】• Arthus-type hypersensitivity: Patients with a history of severe local reaction (Arthus-type) following a previous diphtheria toxoid or tetanus toxoid containing vaccine dose should not be given further routine or emergency doses of Td unless ≥10 years since most recent dose, even if using for wound management with wounds that are not clean or minor; these patients generally have high serum antitoxin levels (CDC/ACIP \[Liang 2018\]).

【46】• Reactions from previous pertussis vaccination: Carefully consider use in patients with history of any of the following effects from previous administration of a pertussis-containing vaccine: Fever ≥40.5°C  within 48 hours of unknown cause; seizures with or without fever occurring within 3 days; persistent, inconsolable crying episodes lasting ≥3 hours and occurring within 48 hours; collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) occurring within 48 hours (CDC/ACIP \[Liang 2018\]). Use is contraindicated in patients who have had encephalopathy within 7 days of a previous pertussis-containing vaccine.

【47】• Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration: Vaccine administration that is too high on the upper arm may cause shoulder injury (eg, shoulder bursitis or tendinopathy) resulting in shoulder pain and reduced range of motion following injection. Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration .

【48】• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP \[Kroger 2023\]).

【49】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【50】• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Postpone administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP \[Kroger 2023\]).

【51】• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with a history of bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP \[Kroger 2023\]).

【52】• Guillain-Barré syndrome: Use with caution if Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred within 6 weeks of prior tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine (CDC/ACIP \[Liang 2018\]).

【53】• Neurologic disorders: Use with caution in patients with progressive neurologic disease including infantile spasms, uncontrolled seizure, or a progressive encephalopathy, or conditions predisposing to seizures. ACIP guidelines recommend deferring immunization until health status can be assessed and condition stabilized (CDC/ACIP \[Liang 2018\]).

【54】**_Concurrent drug therapy issues:_**

【55】• Anticoagulant therapy: Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration (ACIP \[Kroger 2023\]).

【56】• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP and the NACI recommend simultaneous administration (ie, >1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or nonlive) for which a person is eligible at a single visit, unless contraindications exist. The use of combination vaccines is generally preferred over separate injections, taking into consideration provider assessment, patient preference, and adverse events. When using combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest minimum age for any individual component; the minimum interval between dosing is the greatest minimum interval between any individual components. The ACIP prefers each dose of a specific vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible; however, vaccination should not be deferred because a specific brand name is unavailable (ACIP \[Kroger 2023\]).

【57】**_Special populations:_**

【58】• Adults: Safety and efficacy of Kinrix, Quadracel, and Infanrix IPV \[Canadian product\] have not been established for use in adults.

【59】• Altered immunocompetence: Postpone vaccination during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy \[including high-dose corticosteroids\]) if appropriate; may have a reduced response to vaccination. In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age-appropriate vaccines. Nonlive vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression when feasible; nonlive vaccines administered during chemotherapy should be readministered after immune competence is regained (ACIP \[Kroger 2023\]; IDSA \[Rubin 2014\].

【60】• Pediatric: If Kinrix is inadvertently administered to children for an earlier dose in the series, it may be counted as a valid dose, provided the minimum interval requirements were met (CDC 57 2008).

【61】**_Dosage form specific issues:_**

【62】• Aluminum: Product may contain aluminum.

【63】• Neomycin: Product may contain neomycin.

【64】• Polymyxin B: Product may contain polymyxin B.

【65】• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals . Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 . See manufacturer's labeling.

【66】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【67】• Antipyretics: According to the manufacturer, antipyretics may be considered at the time of and for 24 hours following vaccination to patients at high risk for seizures to reduce the possibility of postvaccination fever. However, antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP \[Kroger 2023\]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen to prevent fever prior to vaccination decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).

【68】• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval (ACIP \[Kroger 2023\]).

【89】Additional Information

【90】Quadracel (DTaP-IPV) contains the same pertussis antigens as Daptacel (DTaP), Pentacel (DTaP-IPV-Hib), and Vaxelis (DTaP-HepB-IPV-Hib). Pentacel, Quadracel, and Vaxelis contain twice the amount of detoxified pertussis toxin (PT) and 4 times the amount of filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) as compared to Daptacel; however, they may still be used as part of a mixed series; see manufacturer labeling for details.

【91】Administration: Pediatric

【92】Shake well; do not use unless a homogeneous, turbid, white suspension forms; administer IM the deltoid muscle of the upper arm; not for IV or SUBQ administration. Do not mix with other vaccines or injections; separate needles and syringes should be used for each injection . Use proper injection technique in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration . To prevent syncope-related injuries, adolescents should be vaccinated while seated or lying down . US law requires that the date of administration, the vaccine manufacturer, lot number of vaccine, Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) edition date and date it was provided, and the administering person's name, title, and address be recorded.

【93】For patients at risk of hemorrhage following intramuscular injection, the vaccine should be administered intramuscularly if, in the opinion of the physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk, the vaccine can be administered by this route with reasonable safety. If the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, intramuscular vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered. A fine needle  should be used for the vaccination and firm pressure on the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The patient should be instructed concerning the risk of hematoma from the injection. Patients on anticoagulant therapy should be considered to have the same bleeding risks and treated as those with clotting factor disorders .

【94】Administration: Adult

【140】Pregnancy Considerations

【141】Kinrix and Quadracel are not approved for use in patients >7 years of age.

【142】Adacel-Polio and Boostrix Polio \[Canadian products\] are approved for use during pregnancy to provide passive immunization against pertussis in infants. Based on available data, adverse maternal or fetal outcomes have not been observed following maternal vaccination (most exposures occurred during the third trimester). Vaccination should be done during third trimester or as recommended by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization guidelines.

【143】Monitoring Parameters

【144】Observe for hypersensitivity and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP \[Kroger 2023\]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.

【145】Mechanism of Action

【146】Promotes active immunity to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and poliovirus (types 1, 2 and 3) by inducing production of specific antibodies and antitoxins.

【147】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【148】Onset of action: Immune response observed to all components ~1 month following vaccination

【149】Duration: Immunity against diphtheria, tetanus, and polio persists for 10 or more years after a complete primary immunizing series was given. Periodic tetanus and diphtheria booster doses help maintain specific antitoxin levels above 0.01 antitoxin units/mL for each antigen. More recently, a level of 0.1 to 0.2 units/mL or more has been considered protective. Protection against pertussis from DTaP in children persists approximately 4 to 6 years.
