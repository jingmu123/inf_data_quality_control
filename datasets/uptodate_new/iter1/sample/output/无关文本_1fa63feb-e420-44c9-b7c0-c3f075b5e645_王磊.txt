【10】Anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy; prevention

【11】**Anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy; prevention:** Limited data available:

【12】**Note:** The International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group (IGHG) has determined that it is reasonable for pediatric patients who will receive a cumulative doxorubicin dose of ≥250 mg/m 2 or equivalent anthracycline dose to receive dexrazoxane with each anthracycline dose. In patients receiving higher doses of anthracyclines the benefits of dexrazoxane treatment probably outweigh the risks of developing secondary malignancies . Refer to individual protocols for when dexrazoxane is indicated and for dosing.

【13】Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: Dose is dependent on anthracycline dose: 10:1 dose ratio of dexrazoxane:doxorubicin (eg, 300 mg/m 2 dexrazoxane:30 mg/m 2 doxorubicin) . Based on experience in adults and using isotoxic doxorubicin equivalent doses, the following dexrazoxane dosing ratios (dexrazoxane:anthracycline) for additional anthracyclines has been suggested: for daunorubicin 5 to 10:1 dose ratio, mitoxantrone 40:1 dose ratio, and idarubicin 50:1 dose ratio . **Note:** Cardiac monitoring should continue during dexrazoxane therapy; anthracycline/dexrazoxane should be discontinued in patients who develop a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction or clinical congestive heart failure.

【14】**Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:** Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.

【15】Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric

【16】**Altered kidney function:**

【17】Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: **Note:** There are no pediatric-specific dosage adjustments in the manufacturer's labeling; however, based on adult information and some pediatric centers, the following has been recommended :

【18】CrCl ≥40 mL/minute: No dosage adjustment necessary.

【19】CrCl <40 mL/minute: Reduce dose to 50% of the usual dose, using a 5:1 dexrazoxane:doxorubicin ratio (eg, dexrazoxane 150 mg/m 2 :doxorubicin 30 mg/m 2 ).

【20】Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Pediatric

【21】Data in pediatric patients is insufficient to provide recommendations; refer to protocol if available. Experience in adult patients suggests when doxorubicin dosage is reduced due to hyperbilirubinemia, a proportional reduction in dexrazoxane dosage is recommended (to maintain a 10:1 ratio of dexrazoxane:doxorubicin).

【22】Dosing: Adult

【23】Prevention of doxorubicin cardiomyopathy

【24】**Prevention of doxorubicin cardiomyopathy:** **IV:** A 10:1 ratio of dexrazoxane:doxorubicin (dexrazoxane 500 mg/m 2 :doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 ). Do not administer doxorubicin before dexrazoxane. Doxorubicin must be administered within 30 minutes of the completion of the dexrazoxane infusion.

【25】Treatment of anthracycline extravasation

【26】**Treatment of anthracycline extravasation:** **IV:** 1,000 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 2 (maximum dose: 2,000 mg/day), followed by 500 mg/m 2 on day 3 (maximum dose: 1,000 mg/day); begin treatment as soon as possible, within 6 hours of extravasation.

【27】**Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:** Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.

【28】Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Adult

【29】CrCl ≥40 mL/minute: No dosage adjustment necessary.

【30】CrCl <40 mL/minute:

【31】Prevention of cardiomyopathy: Reduce dose to 50% of the usual dose, using a 5:1 dexrazoxane:doxorubicin ratio (eg, dexrazoxane 250 mg/m 2 :doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 )

【32】Anthracycline extravasation: Reduce dose to 50% of the usual dose; monitor for signs of hematologic toxicity.

【33】Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Adult

【34】**Prevention of cardiomyopathy:** Since doxorubicin dosage is reduced in hyperbilirubinemia, a proportional reduction in dexrazoxane dosage is recommended (to maintain a 10:1 ratio of dexrazoxane:doxorubicin)

【35】**Anthracycline extravasation:** Use in patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended; monitor liver function tests prior to each dose in patients with known hepatic function disorders; hepatic dysfunction (transaminase and bilirubin elevations) may occur, particularly with doses above 1,000 mg/m 2 .

【75】Zinecard, generic products: Use with chemotherapy regimens that do not contain an anthracycline.

【76】_Canadian labeling:_ Additional contraindications (not in the US labeling): Known hypersensitivity to dexrazoxane or any component of the formulation; use as a chemotherapeutic agent.

【77】Warnings/Precautions

【78】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【79】• Bone marrow suppression: Dexrazoxane may cause mild myelosuppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia); myelosuppression may be additive with concurrently administered chemotherapeutic agents. Neutropenic fever has been reported.

【80】• Cardioprotection: Dexrazoxane does not completely eliminate the risk of anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity; carefully monitor cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction \[LVEF\]) prior to and periodically during treatment, and assess the benefits of continued therapy versus risks of potentially irreversible cardiac damage. The American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for prevention and monitoring of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of adult cancers indicate that dexrazoxane may be considered to prevent cardiotoxicity in patients planning to receive high-dose anthracyclines (eg, doxorubicin ≥250 mg/m 2 or epirubicin ≥600 mg/m 2 ).

【81】• Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin reactions, bronchospasm, respiratory distress, hypotension, and loss of consciousness have been reported. Use with caution. Carefully consider prior to use in patients with a previous allergy to dexrazoxane products.

【82】• Secondary malignancies: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have been reported in pediatric patients and some adult patients receiving dexrazoxane in combination with chemotherapy. The International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group (IGHG) has determined that it is reasonable for pediatric patients who will receive a cumulative doxorubicin dose of ≥250 mg/m 2 or equivalent anthracycline dose to receive dexrazoxane with each anthracycline dose. In patients receiving higher doses of anthracyclines, the benefits of dexrazoxane treatment probably outweigh the risks of developing secondary malignancies (IGHG \[de Baat 2022\]).

【83】• Tumor response: When used for cardiomyopathy prevention in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, dexrazoxane should only be used in patients who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of ≥300 mg/m 2 and are continuing treatment with doxorubicin. Dexrazoxane may interfere with the antitumor effect of chemotherapy when given concurrently at chemotherapy initiation. In a study of patients with metastatic breast cancer who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) with or without dexrazoxane beginning at cycle 1, patients who received dexrazoxane experienced a lower response rate and shorter time to progression (compared to patients who did not receive dexrazoxane beginning at cycle 1).

【84】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【85】• Administration (extravasation): Do not use DMSO in patients receiving dexrazoxane for anthracycline extravasation; may diminish dexrazoxane efficacy. Dexrazoxane is not effective against the effects of vesicants other than anthracyclines; if other vesicants (eg, vinca alkaloids, mitomycin) were also infused through the same extravasated IV access, consider extravasation management for those agents as well.

【86】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【87】Secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) have been reported with dexrazoxane and razoxane (racemic mixture of which dexrazoxane is the S\[+\] enantiomer) use; a multicenter review of pediatric trials reported the incidence of SMN to be very rare; a single case was reported out of 533 pediatric patients evaluated throughout 5-year follow-up (Vrooman 2011). A long-term follow-up study followed survivors from 6 different doxorubicin-containing pediatric protocols, 5 of which randomized patients to doxorubicin treatment with or without dexrazoxane; the study included 1,308 patients, of which 784 received dexrazoxane for a median follow-up of 18.6 years. Results showed that dexrazoxane treatment did not adversely affect long-term mortality, event-free survival, or secondary malignancy when compared to patients that did not receive dexrazoxane (Chow 2022).

【114】Dexrazoxane generic formulation (Eugia): Administer by slow IV push or rapid drip infusion

【115】Treatment of anthracycline extravasation: Remove cooling (dry cold compresses) for at least 15 minutes before dexrazoxane infusion to allow sufficient blood flow to extravasation site. Administer dexrazoxane IV over 1 to 2 hours into a large vein in an extremity/area other than the extravasation site; administer solution at room temperature. Begin infusion as soon as possible, within 6 hours of extravasation and continue withholding cooling during infusion . Day 2 and 3 dexrazoxane doses should be administered at approximately the same time (±3 hours) as the dose on day 1. Dexrazoxane is for IV administration only; not for local infiltration into extravasation. Do not use DMSO in combination with dexrazoxane; may lessen efficacy.

【116】General extravasation management : Stop vesicant infusion immediately and disconnect IV line (leave needle/cannula in place); gently aspirate extravasated solution from the IV line (do **NOT** flush the line); remove needle/cannula; elevate extremity. Apply dry cold compresses for 20 minutes 4 times daily for 1 to 2 days (withhold cooling for at least 15 minutes before and during dexrazoxane infusion).

【117】Hazardous Drugs Handling Considerations

【118】Hazardous agent (NIOSH 2016 \[group 2\]).

【119】Use appropriate precautions for receiving, handling, storage, preparation, dispensing, transporting, administration, and disposal. Follow NIOSH and USP 800 recommendations **and** institution-specific policies/procedures for appropriate containment strategy .

【120】**Note:** Facilities may perform risk assessment of some hazardous drugs to determine if appropriate for alternative handling and containment strategies (USP-NF 2020). Refer to institution-specific handling policies/procedures.

【121】Storage/Stability

【122】**Note:** Preparation and storage are product, diluent, and/or indication specific; refer to individual product labeling for further details. Discard unused solutions.

Management: Avoid coadministration of ropeginterferon alfa-2b and other myelosuppressive agents. If this combination cannot be avoided, monitor patients for excessive myelosuppressive effects. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【152】Reproductive Considerations

【153】Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use in patients who could become pregnant. Patients who could become pregnant should use highly effective contraception to prevent pregnancy during treatment and for 6 months after the last dexrazoxane dose. Patients with partners who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy and for 3 months after the last dexrazoxane dose.

【154】Pregnancy Considerations

【155】Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animal reproduction studies, dexrazoxane may cause fetal harm if administered during pregnancy.

【156】Monitoring Parameters

【157】CBC with differential (frequent); liver function; serum creatinine; cardiac function (for adults: repeat monitoring at 400 mg/m 2 , 500 mg/m 2 , and with every 50 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin thereafter; refer to individual protocol for pediatric cardiac assessment recommendations); monitor site of extravasation.

【158】Mechanism of Action

【159】Dexrazoxane is a derivative of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); a potent intracellular chelating agent. As a cardioprotectant, dexrazoxane appears to be converted intracellularly to a ring-opened chelating agent that interferes with iron-mediated oxygen free radical generation thought to be responsible, in part, for anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. In the management of anthracycline extravasation, dexrazoxane may act by reversibly inhibiting topoisomerase II, protecting tissue from anthracycline cytotoxicity, thereby decreasing tissue damage.

【160】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【162】Protein binding: None

【163】Metabolism: Hydrolyzed by dihydropyrimidine aminohydrolase and dihydroorotase

【164】Half-life elimination: 2.1 to 2.5 hours

【165】Excretion: Urine 

【166】Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【167】Altered kidney function: Clearance is reduced in patients with renal function impairment. The mean AUC was 2-fold higher in patients with moderate (CrCl 30 to 50 mL/minute) to severe (CrCl <30 mL/minute) renal impairment.
