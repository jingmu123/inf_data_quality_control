【79】**Osteoporosis, prevention (off-label use):** Adults ≥50 years of age: **Oral:** 800 to 1,000 units/day  is recommended, through dietary sources and/or supplementation if needed .

【80】Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency

【81】**Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency (off-label use):**

【82】**Note:** The optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D  level has not been established; generally, deficiency is defined as 25(OH)D levels <12 ng/mL (<30 nmol/L), and insufficiency is defined as 25(OH)D levels 12 to <20 ng/mL  . Therefore, some experts suggest a target range of 20 to 40 ng/mL  for most patients . Individualize dose based on patient-specific factors (eg, presence of malabsorption, liver disease, kidney disease) and target 25(OH)D level and ensure adequate calcium intake during therapy . The following recommendations are based primarily on expert opinion and clinical experience:

【83】**Prevention:**

【84】**Oral:** 600 to 1,000 units  once daily .

【85】**Treatment:**

【86】_Initial dosing:_

【87】**High-dose therapy:** May be preferred in patients with a serum 25(OH)D level <12 ng/mL (<30 nmol/L) or who are symptomatic (eg, bone fracture/pain, muscle weakness), **or** in patients with concomitant hypocalcemia .

【88】**Oral:** 50,000 units .

【89】**Low-dose therapy:** May be preferred in patients with a serum 25(OH)D level 12 to <20 ng/mL  without symptoms or concomitant hypocalcemia .

【90】**Oral:** 800 to 1,000 units  once daily for ~3 to 4 months; may adjust dose if needed every 3 to 4 months based on 25(OH)D level. Some experts suggest modest dose increases (eg, to 2,000 units \[50 mcg\] once daily) if serum 25(OH)D levels have substantially increased but remain below target or switching to high-dose therapy if serum 25(OH)D levels remain substantially below target .

【91】_Maintenance dosing:_ **Oral:** Once target 25(OH)D level is achieved, continue at a maintenance dose of 600 to 2,000 units  once daily .

【92】**Special populations (eg, obesity, patients on medications known to affect vitamin D metabolism, malabsorption, gastrectomy):** Higher doses or longer durations may be necessary for adequate replacement. In patients with malabsorption when target 25(OH)D levels cannot be maintained with cholecalciferol, consider switching to hydroxylated vitamin D metabolites (eg, calcitriol) .

【93】**Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:** Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.

【94】Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Adult

【95】The renal dosing recommendations are based upon the best available evidence and clinical expertise. Senior Editorial Team: Bruce Mueller, PharmD, FCCP, FASN, FNKF; Jason A. Roberts, PhD, BPharm (Hons), B App Sc, FSHP, FISAC; Michael Heung, MD, MS.

【96】**Note:** In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) G3a to G5D, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommend correcting vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency with treatment strategies recommended for patients without kidney impairment. In patients with CKD G4 to G5 with severe and progressive hyperparathyroidism despite correction of modifiable factors (eg, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency), calcitriol or vitamin D analogs are suggested .

【97】**Altered kidney function:** No dosage adjustment necessary for any degree of kidney dysfunction (primarily excreted in feces) .

【98】**Hemodialysis, intermittent (thrice weekly):** Unlikely to be significantly dialyzed (large V d ): No supplemental dose or dosage adjustment necessary .

【99】**Peritoneal dialysis:** Unlikely to be significantly dialyzed (large V d ): No dosage adjustment necessary .

【100】**CRRT:** No dosage adjustment necessary .

【101】**PIRRT (eg, sustained, low-efficiency diafiltration):** No dosage adjustment necessary .

【102】Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Adult

【103】There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling.

【104】Adverse Reactions

【105】No adverse reactions listed in the manufacturer's labeling.

【106】Contraindications

【107】US labeling: OTC labeling: Replesta products only: When used for self-medication, do not use if you have hypercalcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, hypervitaminosis D, Williams syndrome, or are pregnant.

【108】Canadian labeling: Hypersensitivity to vitamin D, vitamin D analogues and derivatives, or any component of the formulation, hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, severe kidney impairment, malabsorption syndrome, abnormal sensitivity to toxic effects of vitamin D, sarcoidosis, or hypervitaminosis D. **Note:** Contraindications may vary by product; also refer to manufacturer's labeling.

【109】Warnings/Precautions

【110】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【111】• Vitamin D toxicity: May occur with excessive doses; symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, constipation, dehydration, fatigue, irritability, confusion, weakness and/or weight loss. Effects of vitamin D can last ≥2 months after therapy is discontinued.

【112】**_Disease related concerns:_**

【113】• Hyperphosphatemia: Normal serum phosphorous concentrations must be maintained in patients treated for hyperphosphatemia to prevent metastatic calcification.

【114】**_Dosage form specific issues:_**

【115】• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension and cardiovascular collapse ; some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.

【116】• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals . Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 . See manufacturer's labeling.

【117】• Propylene glycol: Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; large amounts are potentially toxic and have been associated hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures and respiratory depression; use caution . See manufacturer's labeling.

【118】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【119】Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; in neonates large amounts of propylene glycol delivered orally, intravenously (eg, >3,000 mg/day), or topically have been associated with potentially fatal toxicities which can include metabolic acidosis, seizures, renal failure, and CNS depression; toxicities have also been reported in children and adults including hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures and respiratory depression; use caution .

For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program by clicking on the “Launch drug interactions program” link above.

【211】**Note:** Interacting drugs may **not be individually listed below** if they are part of a group interaction (eg, individual drugs within “CYP3A4 Inducers \[Strong\]” are NOT listed). For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program

【212】Bile Acid Sequestrants: May decrease the serum concentration of Vitamin D Analogs. More specifically, bile acid sequestrants may impair absorption of Vitamin D Analogs. Management: Avoid concomitant administration of vitamin D analogs and bile acid sequestrants (eg, cholestyramine). Separate administration of these agents by several hours to minimize the potential risk of interaction. Monitor plasma calcium concentrations. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【213】Calcium Salts: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Vitamin D Analogs. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【214】Cardiac Glycosides: Vitamin D Analogs may enhance the arrhythmogenic effect of Cardiac Glycosides. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【215】Danazol: May enhance the hypercalcemic effect of Vitamin D Analogs. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【216】Erdafitinib: Serum Phosphate Level-Altering Agents may diminish the therapeutic effect of Erdafitinib. Management: Avoid coadministration of serum phosphate level-altering agents with erdafitinib before initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels (Days 14 to 21). _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【217】Mineral Oil: May decrease the serum concentration of Vitamin D Analogs. More specifically, mineral oil may interfere with the absorption of Vitamin D Analogs. Management: Avoid concomitant, oral administration of mineral oil and vitamin D analogs. Consider separating the administration of these agents by several hours to minimize the risk of interaction. Monitor plasma calcium concentrations. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【218】Multivitamins/Fluoride (with ADE): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Vitamin D Analogs. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【219】Multivitamins/Minerals (with ADEK, Folate, Iron): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Vitamin D Analogs. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【220】Orlistat: May decrease the absorption of Vitamins (Fat Soluble). Management: Administer oral fat soluble vitamins at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after the administration of orlistat. Avoid concomitant administration due to the risk of impaired vitamin absorption. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【221】Thiazide and Thiazide-Like Diuretics: May enhance the hypercalcemic effect of Vitamin D Analogs. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【222】Vitamin D Analogs: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of other Vitamin D Analogs. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【223】Dietary Considerations

【224】Vitamin D is found in egg yolks, fatty fish, fortified milk, fortified cereal, and infant formulas; it is also produced by exposure to sunlight (IOM 2011).

【225】**Dietary Reference Intake for Vitamin D (IOM 2011):**

【226】0 to 12 months: Adequate intake: 10 mcg/day 

【227】1 to 70 years: RDA: 15 mcg/day 

【228】\>70 years: RDA: 20 mcg/day 

【229】Pregnancy/Lactating: RDA: 15 mcg/day 

【230】Pregnancy Considerations

【231】The cholecalciferol metabolite, 25(OH)D, crosses the placenta; maternal serum concentrations correlate with fetal concentrations at birth .

【232】Adequate maternal vitamin D is required for fetal growth and development (Misra 2008). Vitamin D deficiency in a pregnant woman may lead to a vitamin D deficiency in the neonate . Serum 25(OH)D concentrations should be measured in pregnant women considered to be at increased risk of deficiency (ACOG 2011). The amount of vitamin D contained in prenatal vitamins may not be adequate to treat a deficiency during pregnancy; although larger doses may be needed, current guidelines recommend a total of 1,000 to 2,000 units/day  until more safety data is available (ACOG 2011). In women not at risk for deficiency, doses larger than the RDA should be avoided during pregnancy .

【233】Monitoring Parameters

【234】Children at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency (chronic fat malabsorption, chronic antiseizure medication use) require serum 25(OH)D, PTH, and bone-mineral status to evaluate. If vitamin D supplement is required, then 25(OH)D levels should be repeated at 3-month intervals until normal. PTH and bone mineral-status should be monitored every 6 months until normal.

【235】Chronic kidney disease: Monitor serum 25(OH)D, corrected total calcium and phosphorus levels 1 month following initiation of therapy, every 3 months during therapy and with any Vitamin D dose change; alkaline phosphatase, BUN

【236】Vitamin D status may be determined by serum 25(OH)D levels (Misra 2008):

【237】Severe deficiency: ≤5 ng/mL (SI: ≤12.5 nmol/L)

【238】Deficiency: 15 ng/mL (SI: 37.4 nmol/L)

【239】Insufficiency: 15 to 20 ng/mL (SI: 37.4 to 49.9 nmol/L)

【240】Sufficiency: 20 to 100 ng/mL (SI: 49.9 to 249.6 nmol/L)\*

【241】Excess: >100 ng/mL (SI: >249.6 nmol/L)\*\*

【242】Intoxication: 150 ng/mL (SI: 374.4 nmol/L)

【243】\*Based on adult data a level of >32 ng/mL (>79.9 nmol/L) is desirable

【244】\*\*Arbitrary designation

【245】Target serum 25(OH)D: >30 ng/mL (SI: >74.9 nmol/L)

【246】Mechanism of Action

【247】Cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3 ) is a provitamin. The active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), stimulates calcium and phosphate absorption from the small intestine, promotes secretion of calcium from bone to blood; promotes renal tubule phosphate resorption (IOM 2011)

【248】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【249】Absorption: Absorbed in the small intestine; fat soluble; requires bile (IOM 2011).

【250】Distribution: V d /F: Adult: 237 L (Benaboud 2012).

【251】Metabolism: Inactive until hydroxylated hepatically to 25-hydroxyvitamin D \[25(OH)D; calcifediol\] then renally to the active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) (IOM 2011).

【252】Half-life, circulating: 25(OH)D: 2 to 3 weeks; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D: ~4 hours.

【253】Excretion: Feces (IOM 2011).
