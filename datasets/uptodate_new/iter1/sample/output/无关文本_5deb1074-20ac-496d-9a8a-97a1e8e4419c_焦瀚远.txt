【44】Warnings/Precautions

【45】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【46】• Arrhythmias: Serious arrhythmias have occurred rarely with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products; use caution in patients at increased risk for arrhythmias (eg, recent MI, unstable angina, cardiomyopathy, history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, heart failure); consider baseline and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk for serious arrhythmias.

【47】• Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities: May cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, particularly in patients at increased risk (eg, renal impairment, concomitant mediations that alter electrolyte balance). Any preexisting electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected prior to use and patients should be adequately hydrated before, during, and after use.

【48】• GI effects: Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, including cases of ischemic colitis. Use caution when interpreting colonoscopy results in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

【49】• Seizures: Seizures associated with electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hyponatremia, hypokalemia hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality have occurred. Use with caution in patients with a history of seizures, underlying electrolyte disturbances, in patients at increased risk for seizures (eg, concomitant medications that lower seizure threshold, withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines), or patients with hyponatremia (known or suspected).

【50】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【51】• Gout: May cause transient increases in uric acid and may precipitate an acute flare; use caution in patients with gout.

【52】• Impaired gag reflex: Use with caution in patients with impaired gag reflex and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration; observe these patients during administration.

【53】• Renal impairment: Use caution in patients with renal impairment or using concomitant medications that may affect renal function; may increase risk of renal injury. Adequate hydration is particularly important in these patients. Consider baseline and post-colonoscopy electrolyte, creatinine, and BUN levels.

【54】• Ulcerative colitis: Use with caution in patients with severe, active ulcerative colitis.

【55】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【56】• Appropriate use: Evaluate patients with symptoms of bowel obstruction/perforation (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or distension) prior to use. Each bottle must be diluted with water prior to use; inadvertent administration of undiluted solution may increase the risk of nausea, vomiting, and fluid/electrolyte abnormalities.
