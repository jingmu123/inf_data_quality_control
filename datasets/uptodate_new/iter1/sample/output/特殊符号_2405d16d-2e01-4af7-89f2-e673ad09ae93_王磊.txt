QT-prolonging Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Highest Risk) may increase the serum concentration of Fexinidazole. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【178】QT-prolonging Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Moderate Risk): May enhance the QTc-prolonging effect of Fexinidazole. QT-prolonging Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Moderate Risk) may decrease serum concentrations of the active metabolite(s) of Fexinidazole. Management: Consider alternatives to this combination. If combined, monitor for QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. Patients with additional risk factors for QT prolongation may be at even higher risk. Also monitor for reduced fexinidazole efficacy. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【179】Ramosetron: CYP1A2 Inhibitors (Moderate) may increase the serum concentration of Ramosetron. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【180】Rasagiline: CYP1A2 Inhibitors (Moderate) may increase the serum concentration of Rasagiline. Management: Limit rasagiline dose to 0.5 mg once daily in patients taking moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【181】ROPINIRole: CYP1A2 Inhibitors (Moderate) may increase the serum concentration of ROPINIRole. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【182】ROPivacaine: CYP1A2 Inhibitors (Moderate) may increase the serum concentration of ROPivacaine. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【183】Sertindole: May enhance the QTc-prolonging effect of QT-prolonging Agents (Moderate Risk). _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【184】Tasimelteon: CYP1A2 Inhibitors (Moderate) may increase the serum concentration of Tasimelteon. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【185】Theophylline Derivatives: CYP1A2 Inhibitors (Moderate) may increase the serum concentration of Theophylline Derivatives. Management: Consider avoidance of this combination. If coadministration is necessary, monitor for increased theophylline serum concentrations and toxicities when combined. Theophylline dose reductions will likely be required. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【186】Thioridazine: QT-prolonging Agents (Moderate Risk) may enhance the QTc-prolonging effect of Thioridazine. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【187】Food Interactions

【188】Following administration with food, the AUC of fexinidazole and its active metabolites was approximately 4- to 5-fold higher compared to the fasted state. Management: Administer during or immediately after the main meal of the day.

【189】Pregnancy Considerations

【190】Adverse events were observed in animal reproduction studies with doses that were also maternally toxic.

【191】Treatment of human African trypanosomiasis during pregnancy is recommended. Fexinidazole can be given after the first trimester to reduce the risk of fetal transmission of the disease, and to prevent maternal death in patients with moderate or severe disease (WHO 2019).

【192】Breastfeeding Considerations

【193】It is not known if fexinidazole is present in breast milk.

【194】According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and the benefits of treatment to the mother. However, breastfeeding may continue when fexinidazole is used for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis in lactating patients (WHO 2019).

【195】Dietary Considerations

【196】Food: Take during or immediately after the main meal of the day.

【197】Ethanol: Avoid use of ethanol during treatment and for at least 48 hours after therapy discontinuation.

【198】Monitoring Parameters

【199】Electrolytes, leukocyte count, and LFTs at baseline and during therapy clinically as indicated; mood changes and development or worsening of psychiatric symptoms (consider increased monitoring, including hospitalization during treatment period, when using in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders); signs or symptoms of infection in patients with neutropenia.

【200】Mechanism of Action

【201】Fexinidazole is a nitroimidazole derivative that is thought to be trypanocidal via bioactivation by parasite nitroreductase enzymes to generate reactive amines and damage DNA and proteins.

【202】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【203】Absorption: Rapid; administration with food increases AUC 4- to 5-fold relative to administration in fasted state.

【204】Distribution: V d : 3,222 ± 1,199 L.

【205】Protein binding: Fexinidazole: 98%; fexinidazole sulfoxide: 41%; fexinidazole sulfone: 57%.

【206】Metabolism: Hepatic via CYP-450; fexinidazole is extensively metabolized to active metabolites fexinidazole sulfoxide and fexinidazole sulfone.

【207】Half-life elimination: Fexinidazole: 15 ± 6 hours; fexinidazole sulfoxide: 16 ± 6 hours; fexinidazole sulfone: 23 ± 4 hours.

【208】Excretion: Urine (<3.2%; as metabolites).王磊
