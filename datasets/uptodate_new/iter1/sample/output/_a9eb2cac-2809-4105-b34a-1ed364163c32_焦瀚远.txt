Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this page.

【1】What is hip replacement? 

【2】This is surgery to replace part or all of a person's hip joint with artificial or "prosthetic" parts.

【3】The hip joint is a type of joint called a "ball and socket" joint. It's called this because the top of the thigh bone is ball shaped and fits into part of the pelvic bones . Normally, a person's hip joint can move smoothly in many directions.

【4】When a person has problems with their hip joint, the hip can be painful, stiff, and have trouble moving normally. Different conditions can cause problems with the hip joint, such as:

【5】 Osteoarthritis – This is the most common type of arthritis and often comes with age.

【6】 Other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis

【7】 Hip problems that people are born with or get during childhood

【8】 Hip injuries

【9】Hip replacement is a treatment that can reduce hip pain and improve the way the hip moves.

【10】When is hip replacement recommended? 

【11】Hip problems from arthritis can be treated with hip replacement right away. But doctors often suggest trying other treatments first, such as:

【12】 Weight loss

【13】 Medicines taken by mouth

【14】 Medicines given as a shot into the hip

【15】 Physical therapy

【16】 Devices such as canes or walkers

【17】If these treatments do not help enough, then doctors might suggest hip replacement.

【18】One reason doctors suggest trying other treatments first, especially for younger people, is that a replacement hip joint can wear out over time. Hip replacements usually last at least 15 years, and most last longer. How long a replacement joint lasts depends on different things, such as how active the person is.

【19】What happens during hip replacement surgery? 

【20】Hip replacement surgery happens in an operating room in a hospital. You will get "anesthesia" medicines to make you sleep and to numb your body. Then, your doctor will make a cut on your outer hip and thigh. They will replace your hip joint with an artificial hip joint, called a "prosthesis." A prosthesis can be made out of plastic, metal, or ceramic .

【21】After surgery, most people stay in the hospital for 2 to 4 days. While you are in the hospital, you will get:

【22】 Medicines to treat your pain

【23】 Antibiotic medicines to prevent infections

【24】 Medicines to prevent blood clots in the legs

【25】 Special boots or stockings to prevent blood clots in the legs

【26】 Physical therapy – Most people can stand and walk (with help) within 1 day after surgery. The physical therapist will teach you exercises to make the muscles around your hip stronger. They will work with you on bending, walking, and climbing stairs so you can move normally.

【27】Where do I go after I leave the hospital? 

【28】Many people go straight home. But some people stay in a nursing home or rehabilitation facility for a short time to get stronger before going home. Wherever you go, it is important to do your exercises and get physical therapy.

【29】When will I be able to do my usual activities again? 

【30】Most people can do their usual activities again within 3 to 6 months. Your doctor or nurse will tell you if there are any activities you should avoid.

【31】What problems can happen after hip replacement? 

【32】People can have different problems from hip replacement, but serious problems are uncommon. Problems from hip replacement can happen:

【33】 During hip replacement – For example, a bone can break, or nerves or blood vessels can be damaged.

【34】 Right after hip replacement – People can get an infection or blood clots in the legs. Also, the thigh bone or prosthesis can pop out of place.

【35】 Years after hip replacement – The hip joint can become loose and pop out of place, become stiff, or wear out.

【36】How do I know if hip replacement is right for me? 

【37】To help you decide, talk with your doctor or nurse. Ask them:

【38】 What are the benefits of hip replacement?

【39】 What are the downsides of hip replacement?

【40】 Are there other options besides hip replacement?

【41】 What happens if I do not have hip replacement?
