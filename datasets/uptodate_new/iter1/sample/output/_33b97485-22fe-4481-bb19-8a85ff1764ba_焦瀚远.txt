【73】_Grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated hepatitis:_ Withhold ICI; initiate corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg or equivalent) . Based on data from a retrospective cohort study in patients with grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated hepatitis, initial treatment with methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day demonstrated similar time to ALT normalization (compared with higher methylprednisolone doses), while reducing the potential for corticosteroid-related complications .

【74】Dosing: Obesity: Adult

【75】_American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for appropriate systemic therapy dosing in adults with cancer_ _with a BMI ≥30 kg/m 2_ _:_ The dosing in the FDA-approved prescribing information should be followed in all patients, regardless of obesity status. If a patient with a BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 experiences high-grade toxicity from systemic anticancer therapy, the same dosage modification recommendations should be followed for all patients, regardless of obesity status .

【76】Dosing: Adjustment for Toxicity: Adult

【77】**Note:** No dose reduction for durvalumab is recommended. Other concomitant combination anticancer therapies may also require treatment interruption, dosage reduction, and/or discontinuation.

【78】**Immune-mediated adverse reactions (general information):** Withhold durvalumab for severe (grade 3) immune-mediated adverse reactions. Permanently discontinue durvalumab for life-threatening (grade 4) immune-mediated adverse reactions, recurrent severe (grade 3) immune-mediated reactions that require systemic immunosuppressive treatment, or inability to reduce corticosteroid dose to prednisone ≤10 mg/day (or equivalent) within 12 weeks of initiating corticosteroids. In general, if durvalumab treatment interruption or discontinuation is required, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy  until improvement to ≤ grade 1; upon improvement to ≤ grade 1, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants if immune-mediated adverse reaction is not controlled with systemic corticosteroid therapy. Systemic corticosteroids may not be necessary for certain adverse reactions. Hormone replacement therapy may be required for endocrinopathies (if clinically indicated). See table for additional dosage modification guidance.

【79】**_Additional management_** **_recommendations:_** Consider withholding checkpoint inhibitor therapy for most grade 2 toxicities and resume when symptoms and/or lab values resolve to ≤ grade 1; systemic corticosteroids (initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day prednisone \[or equivalent\]) may be administered if indicated for grade 2 toxicities . Refer to guideline for further information regarding management of immune-mediated adverse reactions associated with checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

【130】Warnings/Precautions

【131】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【132】• Adverse reactions (immune-mediated): PD-1/PD-L1 blockers (including durvalumab) remove immune response inhibition, thus potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions may occur in any organ system or tissue. Reactions generally occur during treatment (may occur at any time after durvalumab initiation); reactions may also occur after durvalumab discontinuation. Early identification and management of immune-mediated reactions are necessary to ensure safe use of durvalumab. If suspected immune-mediated reactions occur, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative causes (including infection). Medically manage immune-mediated adverse reactions promptly and refer for specialty consultation as appropriate.

【133】• Dermatologic toxicity: Durvalumab may cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions (including grade 3 events) occurred with durvalumab. Immune-mediated dermatologic reactions were treated with systemic corticosteroids, and reactions resolved in over half of patients. Immune-mediated rash and dermatitis have also occurred with durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab, including grade 3 and 4 events.

【134】• Endocrinopathies: Durvalumab is associated with immune-mediated endocrinopathies.

【135】\- _Adrenal insufficiency:_ Adrenal insufficiency (primary or secondary) may occur. Grade 3 events have been reported (rare). Systemic corticosteroids were administered for adrenal insufficiency; most patients remained on corticosteroid therapy. Withhold or permanently discontinue durvalumab for adrenal insufficiency, depending on the severity. Adrenal insufficiency was also observed (rarely) with durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab, including grade 3 cases.

【136】\- _Diabetes mellitus:_ Type 1 diabetes mellitus has occurred (which may present with diabetic ketoacidosis), including rare grade 3 events. Long-term insulin therapy has been required in some cases. Hyperglycemia was observed with durvalumab when used in combination with tremelimumab.

【137】\- _Hypophysitis:_ Durvalumab has been associated with immune-mediated hypophysitis, which may present with acute mass effect symptoms, including headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis may lead to hypopituitarism. Grade 3 hypophysitis/hypopituitarism occurred rarely; systemic corticosteroids were administered. Hypophysitis/hypopituitarism was also observed (rarely) with durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab.

【138】_\- Thyroid disorders:_ Immune-mediated thyroid disorders have occurred. Depending on severity, immune-mediated thyroid disorders may require treatment interruption or permanent discontinuation. Systemic corticosteroids were required in one-third of patients with hyperthyroidism. Resolution occurred in the majority of patients with hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism has occurred, including grade 3 cases. Hypothyroidism usually required endocrine therapy. Hypothyroidism may follow hyperthyroidism. Systemic corticosteroids were necessary in some patients, and a majority of patients required long-term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Thyroiditis may present with or without endocrinopathy. Thyroiditis occurred rarely and did not result in permanent discontinuation of durvalumab. Systemic corticosteroids or endocrine therapy were required in some patients. Thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism have also been observed with durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab.

【139】• GI adverse effects: Immune-mediated colitis has occurred with durvalumab, including grade 3 or higher cases. Diarrhea is the primary colitis symptom. Systemic corticosteroids were administered for immune-mediated colitis; the majority of patients with colitis experienced resolution. Some patients required other immunosuppressants (rarely) to manage colitis. Cytomegalovirus infection or reactivation has been observed in patients with corticosteroid-refractory, immune-mediated colitis. Pancreatitis (including increased serum amylase and lipase levels), gastritis, and duodenitis have also been reported. Colitis has also been reported with durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab (including grade 3 colitis); intestinal perforation, large intestine perforation, and pancreatitis have been observed with durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab.

【140】• Hepatotoxicity: Immune-mediated hepatitis has occurred with durvalumab, including grade 3 and fatal cases. Systemic corticosteroids were used to manage immune-mediated hepatitis; resolution occurred in over half of patients. Mycophenolate (in combination with corticosteroids) was used to manage hepatitis rarely. Immune-mediated hepatitis has also been observed with durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab, including grade 3, grade 4, and fatal cases.

【141】• Infusion reactions: Infusion reactions have been observed with durvalumab, including when used in combination with tremelimumab; severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions have occurred.

【142】• Nephrotoxicity: Immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction has occurred (rarely), including grade 3 cases. Nephritis was treated with systemic corticosteroids and resolved in most patients. Nephritis has also been reported with durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab (including grade 3 nephritis).

【143】• Ocular toxicity: Immune-mediated uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities may occur with durvalumab. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Differing grades of visual impairment (including blindness) may occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome.

【144】• Pulmonary toxicities: Immune-mediated pneumonitis has been observed (both in patients who did or did not receive prior radiation), including grade 3 and 4 and fatal cases. Pneumonitis incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis was managed with systemic corticosteroids in the majority of cases and resolved in approximately half of the affected patients. The frequency and severity of immune-mediated pneumonitis in patients who did not receive definitive chemoradiation prior to durvalumab were similar whether durvalumab was administered as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. Pneumonitis has also been observed with durvalumab when used in combination with tremelimumab, including grade 3 and fatal cases.

【145】• Other immune-mediated toxicities: Other clinically relevant immune-mediated disorders have been observed rarely with durvalumab (or other anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies) and may affect any organ system (may be fatal), including myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis, meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy, myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae including renal failure), arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic, hypoparathyroidism, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, and other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.

【146】_**Disease-related concerns:**_

【147】• Hematopoietic stem cell transplant: Fatal and other serious complications may occur in patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) before or after treatment with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody. Transplant-related complications may include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute or chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) after reduced-intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (with no identified infectious etiology). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between durvalumab and HSCT. Manage early signs/symptoms of transplant-related complications promptly. Assess the risks/benefits of treatment with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody prior to or after an allogenic HSCT.

【148】• Myasthenia gravis: Checkpoint inhibitors may worsen or precipitate new myasthenia gravis (MG), especially within the first 16 weeks of treatment; use with caution. Patients with well-controlled MG may be considered for checkpoint inhibitor therapy if MG treatment is maintained (or reinitiated in patients whose MG is in remission), combination therapy (eg, anti–CTLA-4 with anti–PD-a/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies) is avoided, and respiratory and bulbar function are closely followed. In patients who develop overt MG during checkpoint inhibitor therapy, early aggressive treatment with plasma exchange or IVIG in combination with high-dose corticosteroids may be required (AAN \[Narayanaswami 2021\]).

【198】Drug Interactions  

【199】**Note** : Interacting drugs may **not be individually listed below** if they are part of a group interaction (eg, individual drugs within “CYP3A4 Inducers \[Strong\]” are NOT listed). For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program by clicking on the “Launch drug interactions program” link above.

【200】Acetaminophen: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (Anti-PD-1, -PD-L1, and -CTLA4 Therapies). _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【201】Antibiotics: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (Anti-PD-1, -PD-L1, and -CTLA4 Therapies). _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【202】Corticosteroids (Systemic): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (Anti-PD-1, -PD-L1, and -CTLA4 Therapies). Management: Carefully consider the need for corticosteroids, at doses of a prednisone-equivalent of 10 mg or more per day, during the initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Use of corticosteroids to treat immune related adverse events is still recommended _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【208】Reproductive Considerations

【209】Verify pregnancy status prior to durvalumab treatment initiation in patients who could become pregnant. Patients who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy and for 3 months after the last durvalumab dose.

【210】Pregnancy Considerations

【211】Durvalumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1). Human IgG crosses the placenta. Fetal exposure is dependent upon the IgG subclass, maternal serum concentrations, placental integrity, newborn birth weight, and GA, generally increasing as pregnancy progresses. The lowest exposure would be expected during the period of organogenesis and the highest during the third trimester .

【212】Based on the mechanism of action, in utero exposure to durvalumab may disrupt maternal tolerance to the fetus, increasing the risk of abortion or stillbirth. Based on animal data, maternal use of PD-L1 inhibitor may also result in immune mediated disorders in the newborn.

【213】The European Society for Medical Oncology has published guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of cancer during pregnancy. The guidelines recommend referral to a facility with expertise in cancer during pregnancy and encourage a multidisciplinary team (obstetrician, neonatologist, oncology team) approach.

【214】Breastfeeding Considerations

【215】It is not known if durvalumab is present in breast milk.

【216】Durvalumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG 1 ). Human IgG is present in breast milk; concentrations are dependent upon IgG subclass and postpartum age (Anderson 2021). Due to the potential for adverse events in a breastfed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer during therapy or for 3 months after the last durvalumab dose.

【217】Monitoring Parameters

【218】Monitor liver function; renal (creatinine); thyroid function tests (at baseline, periodically during treatment); blood glucose (for hyperglycemia). Verify pregnancy status prior to durvalumab initiation in patients who could become pregnant. Monitor closely for clinical signs/symptoms of immune-mediated adverse reactions, including adrenal insufficiency, colitis/diarrhea (consider initiating or repeating infectious workup in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis to exclude alternative causes), dermatologic toxicity, diabetes/hyperglycemia, hepatitis/hepatotoxicity, hypophysitis or hypopituitarism, pneumonitis, ocular toxicity, and thyroid disorders. Monitor for signs/symptoms of infusion reactions. If received/receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplant, monitor closely for early signs/symptoms of transplant-related complications.

【219】The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management provisional clinical opinion recommends HBV screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.

【220】Cardiovascular monitoring: Comprehensive assessment prior to treatment including a history and physical examination, screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking. Obtain baseline ECG, natriuretic peptides, and troponins in all patients; obtain a baseline echocardiogram in high-risk patients; consider serial ECGs and cardiac troponins prior to doses 2, 3, and 4, and if normal, reduce to every 3 doses until completion of therapy; cardiovascular risk assessment every 6 to 12 months in high-risk patients who require long-term therapy (>12 months therapy, consider cardiovascular risk assessment every 6 to 12 months in all patients requiring long-term therapy). Refer to a cardiologist when clinically indicated.

【221】Additional suggested monitoring:

【222】Prior to therapy: CBC with differential, serum chemistries, creatine kinase; comprehensive clinical assessment including performance status, weight, body mass index, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation; consider chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and CT scan; assess history of autoimmune conditions, organ-specific disease, endocrinopathies, neuropathy, and infectious disease; assess bowel habits, respiratory symptoms, skin (for rash), arthralgias, and neurologic symptoms.

【223】During therapy: Assess blood pressure, weight, heart rate, and oxygen saturation; assess for infections, screen for hyperglycemia/diabetes (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss); eye exam (including intraocular pressure after 6 weeks), CBC with differential, serum chemistries, and creatine kinase; monitor bone mineral density (with long-term therapy).

【224】Mechanism of Action

【225】Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody which blocks programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) binding to PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1); PD-L1 blockade leads to increased T-cell activation, allowing T-cells to kill tumor cells (Massard 2016). PD-L1 is an immune check point protein expressed on tumor cells and tumor infiltrating cells and down regulates anti-tumor t-cell function by binding to PD-1 and B7.1; blocking PD-1 and B7.1 interactions restores antitumor t-cell function .

【226】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【227】**Note:** The steady state AUC, C trough , and C max in patients who received 1,500 mg once every 4 weeks are 6% higher, 19% lower, and 55% higher (respectively) compared to those who received 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks. Based on pharmacokinetic modeling data and safety exposure relationships, there are no anticipated clinically meaningful differences in efficacy and safety for 1,500 mg once-every-4-weeks doses compared to 10 mg/kg once-every-2-weeks doses in patients weighing >30 kg.
