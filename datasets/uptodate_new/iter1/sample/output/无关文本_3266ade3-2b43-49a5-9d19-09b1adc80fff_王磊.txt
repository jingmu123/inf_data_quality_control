【39】Warnings/Precautions

【40】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【41】• CNS depression: May cause CNS depression, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks that require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving).

【42】• Hepatotoxicity: Rare, serious (including fatal) idiosyncratic and unpredictable hepatocellular toxicity has been reported with use. Discontinue immediately if early signs/symptoms of hepatic toxicity arise (eg, fever, rash, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, jaundice). Also discontinue if elevated liver enzymes (eg, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) develop.

【43】• Hypersensitivity reaction: Use caution in patients with known allergies or a history of allergic reactions to drugs; if sensitivity (itching, redness, urticaria) occurs, discontinue therapy.

【44】**_Dosage form specific issues:_**

【45】• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity ("gasping syndrome") in neonates; the "gasping syndrome" consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension and cardiovascular collapse ; some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.

【69】Medication Safety Issues

【70】Older Adult: High-Risk Medication:

【71】Beers Criteria: Chlorzoxazone is identified in the Beers Criteria as a potentially inappropriate medication to be avoided in patients 65 years and older (independent of diagnosis or condition) because most muscle relaxants are poorly tolerated by older adults because of anticholinergic effects caused by some muscle relaxants, risk of sedation, and an increased risk of fracture. In addition, efficacy is questionable at doses tolerated by geriatric patients (Beers Criteria \[AGS 2023\]).
