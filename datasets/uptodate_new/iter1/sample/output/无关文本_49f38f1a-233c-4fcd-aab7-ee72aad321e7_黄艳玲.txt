【0】Patient education: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation – Discharge instructions (The Basics)
Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this page.

【1】What are discharge instructions? 

【2】Discharge instructions are information about how to take care of yourself after getting medical care for a health problem.

【3】What is transcatheter aortic valve implantation? 

【4】The aortic valve is 1 of the 4 valves in the heart . "Transcatheter aortic valve implantation" ("TAVI") is a procedure to replace the aortic valve. It is also sometimes called "transcatheter aortic valve replacement" ("TAVR").

【5】TAVI is a "minimally invasive" procedure. With TAVI, the doctor uses smaller cuts (or "incisions") to reach the blood vessels that lead to the aortic valve. TAVI places a new valve inside of the damaged one. You might be able to return to normal activities sooner than if you had open heart surgery.

【6】How do I care for myself at home? 

【7】Most people can go home after a TAVI. Others go to a rehabilitation facility. You might need someone to stay with you for a time after you go home.

【8】Ask the doctor or nurse what you should do when you go home. Make sure that you understand exactly what you need to do to care for yourself. Ask questions if there is anything you do not understand.

【9】You should also:

【10】 Take all of your medicines as instructed.

【11】 Take care of your incisions – You might have stitches, skin staples, surgical glue, or a special skin tape on your incisions. Your doctor or nurse will tell you:

【12】• When and how to change the dressings

【13】• When you can take a shower or bath

【14】• When to get your stitches or staples removed, if needed

【15】 Always wash your hands before and after you touch your incision or bandage.

【16】 Put pressure on your incision if it starts to bleed. Lie down and hold pressure until the bleeding stops.

【17】 Follow your doctor's instructions about lifting heavy objects. The doctor or nurse will also tell you when you can go back to your normal activities, including driving, work, exercise, and having sex.

【18】What follow-up care do I need? 

【19】The doctor will want to see you again after your procedure to check on your progress. Go to these appointments.

【20】If you have stitches or staples, you will need to have them taken out. Your doctor will usually want to do this in 1 to 2 weeks. Some stitches absorb on their own and do not need to be removed. If the doctor used skin glue or skin tape, it will fall off on its own. Do not pick at it or try to remove it yourself.

【21】When should I call the doctor?
