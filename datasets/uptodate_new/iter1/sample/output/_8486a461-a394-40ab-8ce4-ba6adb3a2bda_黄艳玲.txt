【3】Therapeutic Category

【4】*   Antidote, Neuromuscular Blocking Agent ;
*   Cholinergic Agent ;
*   Diagnostic Agent, Myasthenia Gravis

【5】Dosing: Neonatal

【6】**Note:** Enlon is no longer available in the US.

【7】Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis

【8】**Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis:** Limited data available: **Note:** Usually administered IV; if not possible, IM or SubQ may be used; however, the results are variable and it may take longer for reaction . Atropine should be available at bedside during the testing for the rare case in which severe bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, or hypotension develops. Edrophonium is not the ideal agent in neonates due to its brief effects which make objective assessment difficult; there is also an increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias associated with this drug when given to neonates .

【41】Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis

【42】**Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis:**

【43】**Note:** Methods vary in regards to the initial and repeat doses. However, all regimens utilize a maximum cumulative dose of 10 mg and emphasize that the incremental administration is to help avoid excessive muscarinic side effects. Atropine should be available at the bedside during the testing for the rare case in which severe bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, or hypotension develops. The following edrophonium dosing strategies have been described: IV:

【44】2 mg; if after 90 seconds there is _definite_ improvement, then test is considered positive and may be terminated. If symptoms recur, then may administer another 2 mg dose. If there is _no definite_ improvement with the initial dose, then may administer 3 mg and observe patient for an additional 90 seconds; if test not positive, then may administer the remaining 5 mg and observe patient for 3 to 5 more minutes .

【45】**Or**

【46】1 mg (test dose); if after 60 seconds there are no adverse effects, then administer 3 mg. If after 60 seconds there is no improvement, then administer an additional 3 mg; after an additional 60 seconds, repeat a 3 mg dose if necessary for a total dose of 10 mg .

【47】Manufacturer’s labeling: Dosing in the prescribing information may not reflect current clinical practice.

【48】_IV:_ 2 mg test dose administered over 15 to 30 seconds; if no cholinergic reaction occurs after 45 seconds then administer 8 mg. If cholinergic reaction occurs after initial test dose, stop testing; test dose may be repeated after 30 minutes

【49】_IM:_ 10 mg; if cholinergic reaction occurs, administer 2 mg 30 minutes later to rule out false-negative reaction.

【50】Evaluation of treatment requirements in myasthenia gravis

【51】**Evaluation of treatment requirements in myasthenia gravis:** **IV:** 1 to 2 mg given 1 hour after oral dose of anticholinesterase; response will be myasthenic in undertreated patients, adequate in the controlled patient, and cholinergic in the overtreated patient; adjust as appropriate.

【52】Differentiation of cholinergic from myasthenic crisis

【53】**Differentiation of cholinergic from myasthenic crisis:** **IV:** 1 mg; may repeat after 1 minute. **Note:** Intubation and controlled ventilation may be required if patient has cholinergic crisis.

【54】Reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents

【55】**Reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents: Note:** Atropine should be administered with edrophonium (or glycopyrrolate administered several minutes prior to edrophonium) to diminish the cholinergic effects, especially bradycardia .

【56】**IV:** Usual dose: 0.5 to 1 mg/kg .

【57】Manufacturer’s labeling: **IV:** Dosing in the prescribing information may not reflect current clinical practice. 10 mg over 30 to 45 seconds; may repeat as necessary up to a maximum cumulative dose of 40 mg.

【58】Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Adult

【59】There are no dosage adjustments provided in manufacturer's labeling.

【60】Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Adult

【61】There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling.

【75】Warnings/Precautions

【76】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【77】• Cholinergic crisis: Overdosage can cause cholinergic crisis, which may be fatal. Atropine should always be readily available as an antagonist and for treatment of cholinergic reactions.

【78】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【79】• Arrhythmias: Use with caution in patients with cardiac arrhythmias (eg, bradyarrhythmias) due to cholinergic effects.

【80】• Asthma: Use with caution in patients with bronchial asthma due to potential bronchoconstriction and/or increased secretions.

【81】• Myasthenia gravis: Avoid use as an agent to reverse non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade in patients with myasthenia gravis; may exacerbate muscular weakness.

【82】**_Concurrent drug therapy issues:_**

【83】• Drug/drug interactions: Potentially significant interactions may exist, requiring dose or frequency adjustment, additional monitoring, and/or selection of alternative therapy. Consult Drug Interactions database for more detailed information.

【84】**_Dosage form specific issues:_**

【85】• Sodium sulfite: Products may contain sodium sulfite.

【86】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【87】Edrophonium is not recommended for use in infants; its effect is too brief for objective assessment and may have an increased risk of acute cardiac arrhythmias in infants, especially neonates (Kliegman 2015).
