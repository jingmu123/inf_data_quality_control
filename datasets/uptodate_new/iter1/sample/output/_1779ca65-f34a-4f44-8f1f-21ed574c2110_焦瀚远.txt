For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program by clicking on the “Launch drug interactions program” link above.

【63】Almagate: May decrease the absorption of Taurursodiol. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【64】Aluminum Hydroxide: May decrease the absorption of Taurursodiol. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【65】BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates (Clinically Relevant with Inhibitors): Taurursodiol may increase the serum concentration of BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates (Clinically Relevant with Inhibitors). _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【66】Benperidol: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Urea Cycle Disorder Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【67】Bile Acid Sequestrants: May decrease the absorption of Taurursodiol. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【82】Pregnancy Considerations

【83】Adverse events were observed in some animal reproduction studies.

【84】Breastfeeding Considerations

【85】It is not known if sodium phenylbutyrate, taurursodiol, or their metabolites are present in breast milk.

【86】According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and the benefits of treatment to the mother.

【87】Dietary Considerations

【88】Administer before a snack or meal. Product contains dextrates, sodium, sorbitol, and sucralose.

【89】Mechanism of Action

【90】The mechanism by which the decline of physical function is decreased in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is unknown. The combination of sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol reduces neuronal cell death in vitro.

【91】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【92】Absorption: Sodium phenylbutyrate: Rapid; administration with a high-fat meal results in C max decreased by 76% and AUC decreased by 54%.

【93】Protein binding: Sodium phenylbutyrate: 82%; taurursodiol: 98%.

【94】Metabolism: Hepatic (saturable); sodium phenylbutyrate is metabolized by β-oxidation in the liver and kidney to phenylacetate, which is rapidly conjugated with glutamine via acetylation to form phenylacetylglutamine; taurursodiol undergoes enterohepatic recirculation and is deconjugated to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) by intestinal microflora, which is reconjugated in the liver with glycine or taurine (glycoursodeoxycholic acid \[GUDCA\] and taurursodiol, respectively).

【95】Half-life elimination: Phenylbutyrate: 0.46 hours; phenylacetate: 0.81 hours; taurursodiol: 4.34 hours.

【96】Time to peak: Median: Phenylbutyrate: 0.5 hours; taurursodiol: 4.5 hours.

【97】Excretion: Urine (~80% to 100% as phenylacetylglutamine \[metabolite of sodium phenylbutyrate\]).焦瀚远
