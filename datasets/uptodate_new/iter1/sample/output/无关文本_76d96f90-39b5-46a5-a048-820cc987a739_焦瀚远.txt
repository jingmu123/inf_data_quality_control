【228】**Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT):** There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling; however, some experts suggest no dosage adjustment or supplemental doses are necessary .

【229】Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Pediatric

【230】Azithromycin is predominantly hepatically eliminated; however, there is no dosage adjustment provided in the manufacturer's labeling. Use with caution due to potential for hepatotoxicity (rare); discontinue immediately for signs or symptoms of hepatitis.

【231】Adverse Reactions (Significant): Considerations

【232】Altered cardiac conduction

【233】Azithromycin is associated with altered cardiac conduction, including **prolonged QT interval on ECG**  and polymorphic **ventricular tachycardia** . May be associated with increased cardiac risk and/or death; however, data are conflicting .

【234】_Mechanism:_ Inhibits the delayed rectifier potassium channel, which is encoded by the human ether-à-go-go related gene 1 (hERG1) with much less affinity than erythromycin, causing prolonging of the action potential of cardiac myocytes, prolonging the QT interval .

【235】_Onset:_ Variable; altered cardiac conduction reported to occur within minutes after the administration of the first dose up to 7 days after initiation .

【236】_Risk factors:_

【237】• Females 

【238】• Older patients 

【239】• Heart disease 

【240】• High baseline cardiovascular disease risk 

【241】• History of drug-induced torsades de pointes 

【242】• Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) 

【243】• Baseline QTc interval prolongation (eg, >500 msec) or lengthening of the QTc by ≥60 milliseconds 

【244】• Coadministration of medications that prolong the QT interval or drug interactions that increase serum drug concentrations of QT prolonging medications 

【245】• Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia 

【246】• Bradycardia 

【247】Clostridioides difficile infection

【248】_Clostridioides difficile_ infection (CDI) has been reported with azithromycin, including **_Clostridioides difficile_ associated diarrhea** and **_Clostridioides difficile_ colitis** .

【249】_Onset_ : Variable; may start on the first day of antibiotic therapy or up to 3 months postantibiotic .

【250】_Risk factors:_

【251】• Antibiotic exposure (highest risk factor) .

【252】• Type of antibiotic (azithromycin considered moderate risk) 

【253】• Long durations in a hospital or other healthcare setting (recent or current) 

【254】• Older adults 

【255】• Immunocompromised conditions 

【256】• A serious underlying condition 

【257】• GI surgery/manipulation 

【258】• Antiulcer medications (eg, proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers) 

【259】• Chemotherapy 

【260】Drug-induced liver injury

【261】Azithromycin is associated with drug-induced liver injury, including **cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular hepatitis,** and mixed cholestatic/hepatocellular hepatitis **.** Most patients fully recover; however, severe cutaneous reactions, chronic liver injury, and serious complications leading to death or liver transplantation may occur .

【262】_Mechanism_ : Non-dose-related; not fully understood. An in vitro study was unable to predict if the mechanism was related to bile acid transporter inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunction, or oxidative stress and concluded that hepatotoxicity could be caused by a mechanism that was not evaluated or could be due to unknown metabolite effects . May be related to hypersensitivity .

【263】_Onset_ : Intermediate; typically occurs within 1 to 3 weeks after initiation 

【264】_Risk factors_ :

【265】• Underlying chronic liver disease 

【266】• Hypersensitivity to azithromycin; cross-reactivity among macrolides may occur 

【267】Hypersensitivity reactions (delayed)

【268】Delayed hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with azithromycin, ranging from maculopapular **skin rash** and fixed drug eruption to severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). SCARs include **acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis** , **drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms** , **Stevens-Johnson syndrome** and **toxic epidermal necrolysis** . Azithromycin has also been associated with development of a maculopapular rash in patients with concurrent infectious mononucleosis .

【269】_Mechanism_ : Non-dose-related; immunologic; delayed hypersensitivity reactions, including SCARs, involve a T-cell mediated drug-specific immune response . The mechanism for the development of a nonspecific rash in patients with infectious mononucleosis may be a transient virus-mediated immune alteration that leads to the development of a reversible hypersensitivity reaction .

【270】_Onset_ : Variable; type IV reactions are delayed hypersensitivity reactions that typically occur days to weeks after drug exposure but may occur more rapidly (usually within 1 to 4 days) upon reexposure .

【271】_Risk factors_ :

【272】• Limited information regarding cross-reactivity among macrolides 

【273】Hypersensitivity reactions (immediate)

【274】Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including **angioedema** , **urticaria** and **anaphylaxis** , have been reported with azithromycin .

【275】_Mechanism_ : Non-dose-related; immunologic. Although IgE has not been identified in relationship to immediate hypersensitivity reactions to azithromycin, most immediate hypersensitivity reactions are IgE-mediated, with specific antibodies formed against a drug allergen following initial exposure .

【276】_Onset_ : Rapid; generally occurs within 1 hour of administration but may occur up to 6 hours after exposure .

【277】_Risk factors_ :

【278】• Limited information regarding cross-reactivity among macrolides 

【279】Ototoxicity

【280】Azithromycin is associated with ototoxicity, including **hearing loss** and **tinnitus** . Ototoxicity usually manifests in bilateral symmetrical hearing loss of 40 to 50 dB. In most cases, ototoxicity is reversible and resolves within 1 to 5 weeks after discontinuation . Irreversible hearing loss has been reported, albeit rarely .

【281】_Mechanism_ : Dose- and time-related; linked to cumulative doses of azithromycin. Azithromycin may exert temporary ototoxic effects on outer hair cells via reversible reduction in transient evoked otoacoustic emissions .

【282】_Onset_ : Varied; reported cases of tinnitus have occurred as early as 24 hours; however, the majority of hearing loss cases have occurred with prolonged durations of therapy (ie, ≥4 weeks) .

【283】_Risk factors:_

【284】• Generally greater with higher doses (ie, 500 to 600 mg) 

【285】• Prolonged durations of therapy (ie, ≥4 weeks) 

【286】• Serum azithromycin levels of ≥0.8 +/- 0.4 µg/mL

【319】Warnings/Precautions

【320】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【321】• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal superinfection.

【322】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【323】• Bronchiolitis obliterans: When studied to prevent bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in patients with hematologic malignancy who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, rates of cancer relapse and mortality were increased among patients receiving long-term azithromycin, leading to early trial termination .

【324】• Gonorrhea/syphilis: May mask or delay symptoms of incubating gonorrhea or syphilis, so appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed prior to initiating a treatment regimen.

【325】• Myasthenia gravis: Use with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis; exacerbation and new onset of symptoms have occurred.

【326】**_Special populations:_**

【327】• Infants: Use of azithromycin in neonates and infants <6 weeks of age has been associated with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS); the strongest association occurred with exposure during the first 2 weeks of life; observe for nonbilious vomiting or irritability with feeding (Eberly 2015). The risks and benefits of azithromycin use should be carefully considered in neonates; some experts recommend avoidance except for in the treatment of pertussis or _C. trachomatis_ pneumonia; specific risk-benefit ratio should be considered before use for _Ureaplasma_ spp. eradication (Meyers 2020).

【511】Pregnancy Considerations

【512】Azithromycin crosses the placenta and is present in amniotic fluid .

【513】Outcome data following maternal use of azithromycin during pregnancy are available .

【514】Some pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin may be altered during pregnancy . High concentrations of azithromycin are sustained in the myometrium and adipose tissue when given as a single dose prior to cesarean delivery . Following a single dose in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes, azithromycin amniotic fluid concentrations may fall below the MIC for common pathogens within 7 days (Boelig 2021).

【515】Azithromycin may be used as part of a combination regimen in the management of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes; regimens include azithromycin in combination with IV ampicillin followed by oral amoxicillin (ACOG 2020). Azithromycin may be used as an alternative or adjunctive prophylactic antibiotic in patients undergoing unplanned cesarean delivery (ACOG 2018b). Azithromycin is recommended for the treatment of several infections, including chlamydia, and granuloma inguinale, and prophylaxis of _Mycobacterium avium_ complex in select pregnant patients (consult current guidelines) (CDC \[Workowski 2021\]; HHS \[OI adult\] 2023). Azithromycin may also be used in certain situations prior to vaginal delivery in patients at high risk for endocarditis (ACOG 2018a; ACOG 2018b). Azithromycin may be useful for lymphogranuloma venereum during pregnancy; however, dosing and duration of therapy have not been specifically studied in pregnant patients. The treatment of cervicitis in pregnancy is the same as nonpregnant patients (CDC \[Workowski 2021\]).

【516】Azithromycin is used as an alternative treatment of Lyme disease. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus is not well documented; it is unclear if infection increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. When treatment for Lyme disease in pregnancy is needed, the indications and dosing of azithromycin are the same as in nonpregnant patients .

【517】Breastfeeding Considerations

【518】Azithromycin is present in breast milk.

【519】Following administration of oral azithromycin 2 g as a single dose to 20 women during labor, azithromycin was measurable in breast milk for up to 28 days; adverse events were not observed in the breastfed infants (Salman 2015). In a different study, one woman was given oral azithromycin as a 1 g loading dose followed in 48 hours by azithromycin 500 mg for 3 days; milk concentrations increased over time and reached a peak 30 hours after the last oral dose (Kelsey 1994). In a third study, the median half-life in breast milk was 15.6 hours (Sutton 2015).

【520】Decreased appetite, diarrhea, rash, and somnolence have been reported in nursing infants exposed to macrolide antibiotics (Goldstein 2009). In general, antibiotics that are present in breast milk may cause non-dose-related modification of bowel flora. Monitor infants for GI disturbances (WHO 2002). In addition, an increased risk for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) may be present in infants who are exposed to macrolides via breast milk, especially during the first 2 weeks of life (Lund 2014); however, data are conflicting (Goldstein 2009). According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother.

【521】The CDC's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines state that azithromycin is one of the recommended agents for the treatment of granuloma inguinale in lactating patients (CDC \[Workowski 2021\]).

【522】Dietary Considerations

【523】Some products may contain sodium and/or sucrose.

【524】Oral suspension may be administered with or without food.

【525】Tablet may be administered with food to decrease GI effects.

【526】Monitoring Parameters

【527】LFTs, symptoms of hepatitis (malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal colic, fever), CBC with differential, audiogram with prolonged use, ECG for QTc prolongation (ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA \[Daley 2020\]).

【528】Mechanism of Action

【557】IV: Single dose, 500 mg: AUC 24 : 8.03 ± 0.86 mg•hour/L.

【558】_Postantibiotic effect:_ Gram-positive/gram-negative respiratory pathogens: ~2 to 4 hours, varies based on organism .

【559】_Parameters associated with toxicity:_ Serum azithromycin levels of ≥0.8 ± 0.4 mg/L have been associated with ototoxicity (Brown 1997).
