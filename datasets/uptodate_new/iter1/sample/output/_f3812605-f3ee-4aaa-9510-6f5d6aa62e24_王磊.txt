Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this page.

【1】What is heart block? 

【2】Heart block is a condition that affects the electrical system that controls the heartbeat. Mild types of heart block can cause the heart to beat more slowly than normal or to skip beats. More serious types can cause the heart to stop beating. Without emergency treatment, serious heart block can be fatal.

【3】What causes heart block? 

【4】Heart block happens when the electrical signals that tell the heart to beat either get slowed down or stopped. Most people with heart block get it from a disease, surgery, or medicine. In rare cases, people are born with heart block.

【5】What are the symptoms of heart block? 

【6】The symptoms depend on the type of heart block a person has. There are 3 types of heart block:

【7】 **First-degree** – This is the mildest type of heart block. People with this type usually have no symptoms.

【8】 **Second-degree** – This type is more serious than first-degree. Most people with second-degree block have no symptoms. When symptoms do happen, they include:

【9】• Fainting

【10】• Feeling dizzy

【11】• Feeling tired

【12】• Trouble breathing

【13】• Chest pain

【14】 **Third-degree** – This is the most serious type of heart block. Nearly all people with this type of heart block have symptoms. It can cause the same symptoms as second-degree, but they can be more severe. In some cases, third-degree heart block can be life-threatening.

【15】Is there a test for heart block? 

【16】. Your doctor or nurse will probably do a test called an electrocardiogram ("ECG"). This test measures the electrical activity in your heart .

【17】You might also need other tests to see if another condition is causing your slow heartbeat.

【18】Should I see a doctor or nurse? 

【19】If you have trouble breathing or have chest pain that lasts for more than a few minutes, **call for an ambulance** (in the US and Canada, **call 9-1-1** ).

【20】If you do not have these problems, but you often notice your heart beating slowly or skipping beats, talk to your doctor or nurse.

【21】How is heart block treated? 

【22】The treatment depends on the type of heart block you have:

【23】 Most people who have first-degree heart block do not need treatment.

【24】 Some people who have second-degree heart block, and most people with third-degree heart block, need a pacemaker. A pacemaker is a device that goes under the skin near your heart . It sends electrical signals to the heart that help it beat at a normal rate.
