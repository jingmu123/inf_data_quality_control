【3】ALERT: US Boxed Warning

【4】Risks from concomitant use with opioids:

【5】Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

【6】Abuse, misuse, and addiction:

【7】The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction.

【8】Dependence and withdrawal reactions:

【9】The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage.

【14】Dosing: Adult

【15】**Dosage guidance:**

【16】**Safety:** Reduce dose or avoid use in patients receiving opioids or with significant chronic disease (eg, respiratory compromise). Avoid use in patients with a history of substance use, misuse of medications, or depression (Craske 2022).

【17】Dental preprocedure oral sedation

【18】**Dental preprocedure oral sedation (off-label use):** 0.25 mg 1 hour before procedure; 0.125 mg used for elderly patients or patients sensitive to sedative effects (Dionne 2006).

【19】Insomnia, sleep onset

【20】**Insomnia, sleep onset (alternative agent):**

【21】**Note:** Due to risk of next day impairment, dependence, and habituation, benzodiazepines should be reserved for patients in whom alternative, safer therapies for insomnia have failed (Neubauer 2021). When used, limit long-term use (>4 weeks) to cases for which nonpharmacologic treatments are not available or not effective and benefits are felt to outweigh risks (ACP \[Qaseem 2016\]; ESRS \[Riemann 2017\]).

【22】**Oral:** Initial: 0.125 to 0.25 mg once daily at bedtime, as needed; may increase daily dose to 0.5 mg at bedtime, if needed, based on response and tolerability.

【23】**Discontinuation of therapy:** Reduce by 0.125 mg every 1 to 2 weeks until lowest available dose is reached, then discontinue. Patients on long-term therapy or in whom discontinuation has previously failed may benefit from a slower taper in conjunction with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (Bélanger 2009).

【72】Warnings/Precautions

【73】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【74】• Amnesia: Benzodiazepines have been associated with anterograde amnesia (Nelson 1999). Traveler's amnesia (if taken to induce sleep while traveling) due to insufficient time for sleep prior to awakening and initiating activity has also been reported.

【75】• CNS depression: May cause CNS depression, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks which require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving).

【76】• Hypersensitivity reactions: Reports of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with triazolam. Patients who develop angioedema should not be rechallenged with triazolam.

【77】• Paradoxical reactions: Paradoxical reactions, including hyperactive or aggressive behavior, have been reported with benzodiazepines; risk may be increased in adolescent/pediatric patients, geriatric patients, or patients with a history of alcohol use disorder or psychiatric/personality disorders (Mancuso 2004).

【78】• Sleep-related activities: Hazardous sleep-related activities such as sleep-driving, cooking and eating food, and making phone calls while asleep have been noted with benzodiazepines (Dolder 2008).

【79】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【80】• Depression: Avoid use in patients with depression because of concerns about worsening mood symptoms, particularly if suicidal risk may be present, except for acute or emergency situations (eg, acute agitation, status epilepticus) (Craske 2022).

【81】• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism.

【82】• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.

【83】• Respiratory disease: Reduce dose or avoid use in patients with respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sleep apnea. Benzodiazepines may cause significant respiratory depression.

【84】• Sleep apnea: Benzodiazepines can suppress respiratory drive in patients with obstructive sleep apnea; use caution when prescribing for insomnia in this population (Webster 2020).

【85】**_Special populations:_**

【86】• Debilitated patients: Use with caution in debilitated patients; potential for oversedation, impaired coordination, and dizziness with use.

【87】• Older adult: Older adult patients experience greater sedation and increased psychomotor impairment (Greenblatt 1991). Older adult patients may be at an increased risk of death with use; risk has been found highest within the first 4 months of use in older adult dementia patients .

【88】• Fall risk: Use with extreme caution in patients who are at risk of falls; benzodiazepines have been associated with falls and traumatic injury (Nelson 1999).

【89】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【90】• Abuse, misuse, and substance use disorder: Counsel patients at increased risk on proper use and monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and substance use disorder. Institute early treatment or refer patients in whom substance use disorder is suspected. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required.

【91】• Appropriate use: Does not have analgesic, antidepressant, or antipsychotic properties. Should be used only after evaluation of potential causes of sleep disturbance. Failure of sleep disturbance to resolve after 7 to 10 days may indicate psychiatric or medical illness. Use for >21 days requires complete reevaluation of patient. A worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new abnormalities of thought or behavior may represent unrecognized psychiatric or medical illness and requires immediate and careful evaluation. Prescription should be written for a maximum of 7 to 10 days and should not be prescribed in quantities exceeding a 1-month supply. Use lowest effective dose; adverse reactions of triazolam are dose related.

【92】• Dependence and withdrawal reactions: Some patients may develop a protracted withdrawal syndrome lasting >12 months; may be difficult to differentiate withdrawal symptoms from reemergence or continuation of symptoms for which benzodiazepines were prescribed. Flumazenil may cause withdrawal in patients receiving long-term benzodiazepine therapy.

【93】• Rebound insomnia: Following withdrawal of therapy, transient insomnia may recur accompanied by other reactions including restlessness, anxiety, and mood changes (Bélanger 2009).

【94】• Tolerance: Triazolam is a short half-life benzodiazepine. Duration of action after a single dose is determined by redistribution rather than metabolism. Tolerance develops to the hypnotic effects (Vinkers 2012). Chronic use of this agent may increase the perioperative benzodiazepine dose needed to achieve desired effect.

【95】• Withdrawal: A longer sleep-onset latency and increased awakenings during sleep may occur for 1 to 2 days following the discontinuation of GABA-mediated (GABAergic) medications. A more severe withdrawal syndrome may rarely occur following abrupt discontinuation or large decreases in dose after sustained use (>10 days), and is characterized by new-onset agitation, ataxia, depersonalization, dizziness, dysphoria, fatigue, headache, hypersensitivity to stimuli, irritability, muscle cramps or pain, nausea, sweating, twitching, vomiting, and weakness. This withdrawal syndrome generally resolves within weeks or upon re-initiation of the GABAergic medication. Intermittent dosing may reduce the risk of withdrawal symptoms (BAP \[Wilson 2019\]). Use caution when reducing dose or withdrawing therapy; decrease slowly and monitor for withdrawal symptoms.

Management: Reduce the Intermezzo brand sublingual zolpidem adult dose to 1.75 mg for men who are also receiving other CNS depressants. No such dose change is recommended for women. Avoid use with other CNS depressants at bedtime; avoid use with alcohol. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【226】Zuranolone: May enhance the CNS depressant effect of CNS Depressants. Management: Consider alternatives to the use of zuranolone with other CNS depressants or alcohol. If combined, consider a zuranolone dose reduction and monitor patients closely for increased CNS depressant effects. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【227】Food Interactions

【228】Benzodiazepine serum concentrations may be increased by grapefruit juice. Management: Limit or avoid grapefruit juice (Sugimoto 2006).

【229】Pregnancy Considerations

【230】A case report describes placental transfer of triazolam following a maternal overdose (>20 triazolam 0.125 mg tablets) (Sakai 1996).

【231】In utero exposure to benzodiazepines has the potential to cause harm to the fetus. Teratogenic effects have been observed in some studies; however, a clear association has not been reported and additional data are needed . Exposure to a benzodiazepine late in pregnancy may cause neonatal sedation (hypotonia, lethargy, respiratory depression) and/or symptoms of neonatal withdrawal (feeding difficulties, hyperreflexia, inconsolable crying, irritability, restlessness, tremors). Data related to long-term effects on neurodevelopment are inconclusive . Newborns exposed to triazolam in utero should be monitored for feeding problems, respiratory depression, sedation, and withdrawal.

【232】Treatment for insomnia in pregnant patients should be individualized. Untreated insomnia may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Although recommendations vary, nonpharmacologic therapy is preferred as an initial treatment of insomnia during pregnancy (BAP \[McAllister-Williams 2017\]; BAP \[Wilson 2019\]; Palagini 2022).

【233】Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes following exposure to triazolam is ongoing. Health care providers are encouraged to enroll patients exposed to triazolam during pregnancy in the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications .

【234】Breastfeeding Considerations

【235】It is not known if triazolam is present in breast milk.

【236】Drowsiness, lethargy, or weight loss in breastfed infants have been observed in case reports following maternal use of some benzodiazepines (Iqbal 2002).

【237】Breastfeeding during benzodiazepine therapy is not recommended due to the potential for drowsiness in the breastfeeding infant (Larsen 2015). According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and the benefits of treatment to the mother. Infants exposed to triazolam via breast milk should be monitored for respiratory depression, sedation, withdrawal, or feeding problems. Breastfeeding patients may express and discard milk during therapy and for 28 hours after the last triazolam dose to minimize possible exposure to the infant.

【238】Monitoring Parameters

【239】Respiratory rate.

【240】Mechanism of Action

【241】Short-acting benzodiazepine (Griffin 2013). Binds to stereospecific benzodiazepine receptors on the postsynaptic GABA neuron at several sites within the central nervous system, including the limbic system and reticular formation. Enhancement of the inhibitory effect of GABA on neuronal excitability results by increased neuronal membrane permeability to chloride ions. This shift in chloride ions results in hyperpolarization  and stabilization. Benzodiazepine receptors and effects appear to be linked to the GABA-A receptors. Benzodiazepines do not bind to GABA-B receptors (Vinkers 2012).

【242】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【243】Onset of action: Hypnotic: 15 to 30 minutes (Pakes 1981)

【244】Duration of action:

【245】Classified as a short-acting benzodiazepine; classification based on benzodiazepines with half-life 1 to 12 hours (Griffin 2013).

【246】Indication-specific duration:

【247】Hypnotic: 6 to 7 hours

【248】Distribution: V d : 0.6 to 1.7 L/kg (Pakes 1981)

【249】Protein binding: 89% (Pakes 1981)

【250】Metabolism: Extensively hepatic; hydroxylation via CYP3A4 (initial step in metabolism) with subsequent glucuronide conjugation to 6 metabolites, including a short-acting active metabolite, alpha-hydroxytriazolam (Pakes 1981)

【251】Half-life elimination: 1.5 to 5.5 hours

【252】Time to peak: Oral: Within 2 hours

【253】Excretion: Urine (~80% as metabolites; small amounts as unchanged drug)

【254】Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【255】Older adult: C max and AUC are increased; clearance is decreased (Greenblatt 1991)
