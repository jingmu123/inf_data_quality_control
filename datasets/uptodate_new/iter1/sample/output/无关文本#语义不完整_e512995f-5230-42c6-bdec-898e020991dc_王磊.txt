【9】Dosing: Adult

【10】**Dosage guidance:**

【11】**Clinical considerations:** Avoid coadministration with other antisecretory agents due to decreased acid-inhibitory effects. If another antisecretory agent is needed, allow a sufficient time interval between administration (ie, morning rabeprazole and bedtime H 2 RA) .

【12】Aspiration prophylaxis in patients undergoing anesthesia

【13】**Aspiration prophylaxis in patients undergoing anesthesia (off-label use):**

【14】**Note:** May be considered in patients at high risk for aspiration .

【15】**Oral:** 20 mg given the night before surgery and 20 mg given the morning of surgery .

【16】Barrett esophagus

【17】**Barrett esophagus (off-label use):**

【18】**Oral:** 20 mg once daily; may increase the dose to 20 to 40 mg twice daily if needed to eliminate gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms or heal reflux esophagitis. Long-term maintenance therapy is recommended .

【19】Dyspepsia, functional

【20】**Dyspepsia, functional (off-label use):**

【21】**Note:** For patients who test negative for _H. pylori_ infection or have persistent symptoms following _H. pylori_ eradication .

【22】**Oral:** 20 mg once daily for up to 8 weeks ; can be continued for a longer duration in patients with symptom improvement. Some experts recommend attempting to discontinue every 6 to 12 months to minimize the long-term risk of therapy .

【23】Eosinophilic esophagitis

【24】**Eosinophilic esophagitis (off-label use): Oral:** 20 mg twice daily for an 8-week trial . Once 8-week trial is complete and remission is achieved, the dose may be gradually lowered to an individualized maintenance level . Some experts initiate with 20 mg once daily and increase to twice-daily dosing after 4 weeks if symptoms fail to improve .

【25】Gastroesophageal reflux disease

【26】**Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD):**

【27】_Initial therapy:_

【28】_**Mild/intermittent disease (<2 episodes/week) and no evidence of erosive esophagitis:**_

【29】**Note:** Some experts reserve proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for patients who have residual acid reflux symptoms despite twice-daily H 2 RA .

【30】**Oral:** 20 mg once daily. Where available, may start with 10 mg once daily and increase to 20 mg once daily after 4 to 8 weeks, if necessary. Discontinue once asymptomatic for 8 weeks .

【31】_**Severe and/or frequent symptoms (≥2 episodes/week), and/or erosive esophagitis:**_

【32】**Oral:** 20 mg once daily; once symptoms are controlled, continue for at least 8 weeks . Subsequently, patients without erosive esophagitis or Barrett esophagus can taper to the lowest dose necessary to control symptoms (and/or switch to an H 2 RA blocker), then discontinue acid suppression once asymptomatic. Patients with erosive esophagitis or Barrett esophagus should continue long-term maintenance therapy with 20 mg once daily .

【33】_Residual symptoms despite 20 mg once daily therapy:_

【34】**Note:** Referral to a specialist is recommended.

【35】**Oral:** Options include splitting the dose to 10 mg twice daily, increasing the dose to 20 mg twice daily, or switching to another PPI .

【36】_Helicobacter pylori_ eradication

【37】**_Helicobacter pylori_ eradication:**

【38】**Oral:** 20 or 40 mg twice daily as part of an appropriate combination regimen with antibiotics. Dose depends on selected regimen .

【39】Hypersecretory conditions

【40】**Hypersecretory conditions (including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome): Oral:** Initial: 60 mg once daily. If needed, may titrate upward early in therapy, using divided doses as appropriate; once acid output has been controlled, gradual dose reductions are usually possible; continue as long as clinically indicated . Doses as high as 100 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily have been used.

【41】NSAID-induced ulcers, primary prevention

【42】**NSAID (including aspirin)-induced ulcers, primary prevention (off-label use):**

【43】**Note:** For select patients at moderate or high risk for GI toxicity. These include patients with a history of GI ulcer, on dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor), on concurrent anticoagulant therapy, or with multiple additional risk factors (eg, corticosteroid use, high nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug \[NSAID\] dose, _H. pylori_ infection) . For patients on dual antiplatelet therapy, some experts reserve prophylaxis for those with additional risk factors . If present, _H. pylori_ infection should be treated first .

【44】**Oral:** 20 mg once daily for the duration of high-risk NSAID use. Where available, may consider 10 mg once daily .

【45】Peptic ulcer disease, treatment and secondary prevention

【46】**Peptic ulcer disease, treatment and secondary prevention:**

【47】**Note:** For patients on NSAIDs (including aspirin), the NSAID should be discontinued, if possible . If present, _H. pylori_ infection should be treated first; uncomplicated _H. pylori_ –associated ulcers may not need PPI treatment beyond that included in the eradication regimen .

【48】_Uncomplicated ulcer:_ **Oral:** 20 mg once daily. Duration depends on the size, location, and cause of ulcer and ranges from 4 to 8 weeks. In patients with refractory or recurrent disease, may increase the dose to 20 mg twice daily .

【49】_Complicated ulcer (perforation, penetration, or gastric outlet obstruction) (off-label use):_ **Oral:** 20 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily. Duration depends on the location and etiology of ulcer .

【50】_Bleeding ulcer:_

【51】Initial therapy: **Note:** Optimal pre-endoscopic PPI therapy is uncertain. Some experts suggest initiating therapy with a high-dose IV PPI using continuous or intermittent dosing in patients with suspected active upper GI bleed prior to endoscopy . Following endoscopy, for patients with high-risk stigmata of recent bleeding (eg, active bleed, visible vessel, adherent clot), a continuous infusion of an IV PPI for at least 72 hours before transitioning to an oral PPI is recommended . Patients without high-risk stigmata of recent bleeding can be switched to an oral PPI immediately after endoscopy .

【52】Patients with high-risk stigmata of recent bleeding on endoscopy (following IV PPI therapy): **Oral:** 20 mg twice daily to complete 14 days of twice-daily PPI therapy, followed by 20 mg once daily .

【53】Patients with no high-risk stigmata of recent bleeding on endoscopy: **Oral:** 20 mg once daily .

【54】Duration: The total duration of treatment depends on size, location, and cause of the ulcer and ranges from 4 to 12 weeks .

【55】_Maintenance therapy/secondary prevention (off-label use):_

【56】**Note:** For select high-risk patients (eg, idiopathic ulcers, frequently recurrent ulcers, need for continued NSAID use).

【57】**Oral:** 20 mg once daily for 12 to 24 weeks or as long as the NSAID is used ; where available, may consider 5 or 10 mg once daily .

【58】**Discontinuation of therapy:** **Oral:** In patients who have received continuous therapy for >6 months, some experts gradually taper therapy until discontinuation to avoid worsening or rebound GERD symptoms. There is no single agreed upon discontinuation strategy. If the patient is receiving 20 mg once or twice daily, some experts decrease the dose by 50% every week. For patients receiving twice-daily dosing, the first dose reduction can be achieved by decreasing to once-daily AM dosing. Once patients are on the lowest dose for 1 week, discontinue therapy . An alternative strategy is to decrease the dose by 50% over 2 weeks to 4 weeks, then discontinue. If the patient is already on the lowest possible dose, alternate day therapy may be considered . In addition, as-needed therapy with an H 2 RA or an antacid can be used during the taper .

【59】**Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:** Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.

【60】Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Adult

【61】No dosage adjustment necessary.

【65】Dosing: Older Adult

【66】Refer to adult dosing. Avoid scheduled use for >8 weeks unless given for high-risk patients (eg, oral corticosteroid or chronic NSAID use), patients with erosive esophagitis, Barrett esophagitis, a pathological hypersecretory condition, or if the patient has demonstrated a need for maintenance therapy (eg, failure of drug discontinuation trial or failure of H 2 blockers) .

【67】Dosing: Pediatric

【68】Gastroesophageal reflux disease, symptomatic

【69】**Gastroesophageal reflux disease, symptomatic:** **Note:** Guidelines recommend a 4- to 8-week treatment course; if improvement seen after 4 to 8 weeks, consider possible wean; if no response after 4 to 8 weeks, reevaluate diagnosis and consider referral to pediatric GI specialist .

【70】Infants: Limited data available: Oral: Sprinkle capsules: 5 to 10 mg once daily; dosing based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which randomized patients aged 1 to 11 months (n=268) with symptomatic GERD to 10 mg, 5 mg, or placebo (n=88, n=90, n=90, respectively); the study found no difference in the degree of improvement with rabeprazole (at any dose) compared to those receiving placebo .

【71】Children ≤11 years: Oral: Sprinkle capsules:

【72】<15 kg: 5 mg once daily; if inadequate response may increase to 10 mg once daily.

【78】6 to <10 kg: Oral: 10 mg twice daily.

【79】10 to <30 kg: Oral: 15 mg twice daily.

【80】≥30 kg: Oral: 20 mg twice daily.

【81】**Discontinuation of therapy:** Oral: Based on experience in adults, some experts recommend a step-down approach in order to avoid worsening or rebound symptoms. One recommendation is to decrease the dose by 50% over 2 to 4 weeks. If the patient is already on the lowest possible dose, alternate day therapy may be considered. If symptoms worsen during treatment or after discontinuation, patient should be reevaluated .

【82】**Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:** Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.

【116】Warnings/Precautions

【117】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【118】• Atrophic gastritis: Long-term omeprazole therapy has caused atrophic gastritis (by biopsy); this may also occur with rabeprazole.

【119】• Carcinoma: No reports of adenomatoid, dysplastic or neoplastic changes of enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in the gastric mucosa have occurred.

【120】• _Clostridioides difficile_ \-associated diarrhea (CDAD): Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase risk of CDAD, especially in hospitalized patients; consider CDAD diagnosis in patients with persistent diarrhea that does not improve. Use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate for the condition being treated.

【121】• Cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus: Has been reported as new onset or exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease; most cases were cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), most commonly, subacute CLE (occurring within weeks to years after continuous therapy). Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less common (typically occurs within days to years after initiating treatment) and occurred primarily in young adults up to the elderly. Discontinue therapy if signs or symptoms of CLE or SLE occur and refer to specialist for evaluation; most patients improve 4 to 12 weeks after discontinuation of rabeprazole.

【122】• Dermatologic reactions: Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported.

【123】• Fractures: Increased incidence of osteoporosis-related bone fractures of the hip, spine, or wrist may occur with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Patients on high-dose (multiple daily doses) or long-term therapy (≥1 year) should be monitored. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, use vitamin D and calcium supplementation, and follow appropriate guidelines to reduce risk of fractures in patients at risk.

【124】• Fundic gland polyps: Use of PPIs increases risk of fundic gland polyps, especially with long term use (>1 year). May occur without symptoms but nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain may occur; gastrointestinal bleeding and/or anemia may occur with ulcerated polyps. Diagnosis of polyps may also increase risk for small intestinal blockage. Use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate for the condition being treated.

【125】• Gastrointestinal infection (eg, _Salmonella_ , _Campylobacter_ ): Use of proton pump inhibitors may increase risk of these infections.

【126】• Hypomagnesemia: Reported rarely, usually with prolonged PPI use of ≥3 months (most cases >1 year of therapy). May be symptomatic or asymptomatic; severe cases may cause tetany, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypomagnesemia may lead to or exacerbate hypocalcemia in patients at risk (eg, hypoparathyroidism). Hypomagnesemia may also lead to hypokalemia. Hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia may be corrected by magnesium/calcium supplementation, although discontinuation of rabeprazole may be necessary.

【127】• Tubulointerstitial nephritis: Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs; may occur at any time during therapy. Patients may present with symptomatic hypersensitivity reaction to nonspecific symptoms of impaired renal function (eg, anorexia, malaise, nausea); may be diagnosed with biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (eg, fever, rash, arthralgia). Discontinue and evaluate patients if acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is suspected.

【128】• Vitamin B 12 deficiency: Prolonged treatment (>3 years) may lead to vitamin B 12 malabsorption and subsequent vitamin B 12 deficiency. The magnitude of the deficiency is dose-related and the association is stronger in females and those younger in age (<30 years of age); prevalence is decreased after discontinuation of therapy (Lam 2013).

【129】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【130】• Gastric malignancy: Relief of symptoms does not preclude the presence of a gastric malignancy.

【131】• Hepatic impairment: Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment; if treatment is necessary monitor for adverse reactions.

【132】**_Concurrent drug therapy issues:_**

【133】• Clopidogrel: PPIs may diminish the therapeutic effect of clopidogrel, thought to be due to reduced formation of the active metabolite of clopidogrel. The manufacturer of clopidogrel recommends either avoidance of both omeprazole (even when scheduled 12 hours apart) and esomeprazole or use of a PPI with comparatively less effect on the active metabolite of clopidogrel. Avoidance of rabeprazole appears prudent due to potent _in vitro_ CYP2C19 inhibition (Li 2004) and lack of sufficient comparative _in vivo_ studies with other PPIs. In contrast to these warnings, others have recommended the continued use of PPIs, regardless of the degree of inhibition, in patients with a history of GI bleeding or multiple risk factors for GI bleeding who are also receiving clopidogrel since no evidence has established clinically meaningful differences in outcome; however, a clinically significant interaction cannot be excluded in those who are poor metabolizers of clopidogrel .

【134】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【135】• Appropriate use: _Helicobacter pylori_ eradication: Short-term combination therapy (≤7 days) has been associated with a higher incidence of treatment failure. The American College of Gastroenterology recommends 10 to 14 days of therapy (triple or quadruple) for eradication of _H. pylori_ (Chey 2017).

【136】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【137】Use of gastric acid inhibitors, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H 2 blockers, has been associated with an increased risk for development of acute gastroenteritis and community-acquired pneumonia in pediatric patients 4 to 36 months of age (Canani 2006). Routine use in preterm infants is not recommended (AAP \[Eichenwald 2018\]).

【138】Gastric acid suppression medications have been associated with an increase in _Clostridioides difficile_ infection (CDI) and recurrent CDI in pediatric patients (Nylund 2014). In a retrospective, observational, case control study of pediatric patients 1 to 18 years old who were hospitalized for diarrhea and abdominal pain, the use of PPIs was significantly higher in patients who tested positive for _C. difficile_ compared to patients who tested negative for _C. difficile_  (Turco 2010). Consider CDI diagnosis in patients with persistent diarrhea that does not improve. Use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate for the condition being treated.

【139】A large retrospective cohort study reviewed records for patients with a low baseline risk for fractures who were initiated on acid suppression therapy in the first year of life and evaluated the fracture risk in the first 5 years of life; a total of 97,286 patients were prescribed acid suppression therapy; 73% were prescribed H 2 blockers, 9% were prescribed PPIs, and 18% were prescribed both. H 2 blocker use alone was not associated with an increased fracture hazard; however, PPI use was associated with a 21% increase and use of PPI plus H 2 blocker was associated with a 30% increase. Longer duration of therapy and earlier age at initiation seemed to also increase the fracture hazard. Study findings do not establish a causal relationship between PPI use and fractures. If acid suppression therapy is necessary in the first year of life, limiting therapy to a single drug and limiting the duration should be considered (Malchodi 2019). A second large cohort study reviewed records for 115,933 children <18 years initiated on a PPI. PPI initiation was associated with a statistically significant 11% relative increase in risk of any fracture in patients ≥6 years. The increased risk also seemed to be more pronounced with a longer cumulative duration of PPI use (Wang 2020).
