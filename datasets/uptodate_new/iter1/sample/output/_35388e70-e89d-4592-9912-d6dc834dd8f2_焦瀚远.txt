【15】Adverse Reactions

【16】The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.

【17】1% to 10%: Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reaction 

【18】<1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Contact dermatitis (Pichichero 2011)

【19】Contraindications

【20】Hypersensitivity to bacitracin or any component of the formulation

【21】Warnings/Precautions

【22】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【23】• Bacterial overgrowth: Prolonged use or use in absence of infectious presence may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, particularly fungi; if new infection develops, initiate appropriate therapy.

【24】• Blurred vision: May cause blurred vision, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks that require clear vision (eg, operating machinery or driving).

【25】• Hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis: Use with caution in patients who have been previously exposed to bacitracin; contact dermatitis (Pichichero 2011) has been reported and may take several days of use to develop. Discontinue use if signs of an allergic sensitization reaction are noted, including itching, swelling, and conjunctival erythema.

【26】**_Special populations:_**

【27】• Contact lens wearers: Contact lenses should not be worn during treatment.

【28】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【29】• Appropriate use: Should not be used in deep seated ocular infections or if infection is likely to become systemic. Patients who do not respond to topical ophthalmic bacitracin treatment following 10 days of use should be reevaluated to ascertain appropriateness of continued antibiotic use.

【30】Dosage Forms Considerations

【41】Administration: Adult

【42】Ophthalmic: For topical ophthalmic use only; do not inject into the eye. Avoid contamination of ointment during application. Avoid excess ointment application. Patients should be instructed on proper administration of eye ointments. Do not touch the tip of the applicator to any part of the eye or surrounding adjacent areas.

【43】Blepharitis: After carefully removing all scales and crusts, apply thin film uniformly over lid margins.

【44】Superficial infections of the conjunctiva and/or cornea: Apply thin ¼ inch strip directly into conjunctival sac.

【45】Administration: Pediatric

【46】Ophthalmic: For topical ophthalmic use only; apply directly to conjunctival sac; avoid gross contamination of ointment during application. For blepharitis: After carefully removing all scales and crusts, apply uniformly over lid margins.

【47】Use: Labeled Indications

【48】**Ocular infections:** Treatment of blepharitis and associated bacterial overgrowth; treatment of superficial ocular infections involving the conjunctiva or cornea due to susceptible organisms

【49】Medication Safety Issues

【50】Sound-alike/look-alike issues:

【51】Bacitracin may be confused with Bactrim, Bactroban

【52】Metabolism/Transport Effects

【53】None known.

【54】Drug Interactions  

【55】There are no known significant interactions.

【56】Pregnancy Considerations

【57】Bacitracin is not absorbed systemically following ophthalmic administration (Robert 2001). If ophthalmic agents are needed during pregnancy, the minimum effective dose should be used in combination with punctal occlusion to decrease potential exposure to the fetus (Samples 1988).

【58】Breastfeeding Considerations

【59】Bacitracin is not absorbed systemically following ophthalmic administration (Robert 2001).

【60】Mechanism of Action

【61】A cyclic peptide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by preventing transfer of mucopeptides into the growing cell wall. Bacitracin is bacteriostatic in nature, but may be bactericidal depending on the antibiotic concentration and the susceptibility of the organism. The antibacterial spectrum is primarily gram positive with activity against staphylococci (including some penicillin G resistant strains), streptococci, anaerobic cocci, Clostridia, Corynebacterium, gonococci, meningococci, and fusobacteria. Other susceptible organisms include _Treponema pallidum_ , _Treponema_ _vincentii_ , and _Actinomyces israelii_ . Development of bacitracin resistance is rare; however, resistance to _Staphylococcus aureus_ has been reported (Suzuki 2011).
