【161】Warnings/Precautions

【162】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【163】• Anaphylaxis: Has been reported with amphotericin B-containing drugs; facilities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be available during administration due to the possibility of anaphylactic reaction. If severe respiratory distress occurs, the infusion should be immediately discontinued; during the initial dosing, the drug should be administered under close clinical observation.

【164】• Infusion reactions: Acute reactions (including fever and chills) may occur 1-2 hours after starting an intravenous infusion. These reactions are usually more common with the first few doses and generally diminish with subsequent doses. Infusion has been rarely associated with hypotension, bronchospasm, arrhythmias, and shock.

【165】**_**Disease-related concerns** :_**

【166】• Heart failure: In a scientific statement from the American Heart Association, amphotericin has been determined to be an agent that may cause direct myocardial toxicity (magnitude: moderate/major) (AHA \[Page 2016\]).

【167】**_Concurrent drug therapy issues:_**

【168】• Antineoplastics: Concurrent use with antineoplastic agents may enhance the potential for renal toxicity, bronchospasm or hypotension; use with caution.

【169】• Nephrotoxic drugs: Concurrent use of amphotericin B with other nephrotoxic drugs may enhance the potential for drug-induced renal toxicity.

【170】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【171】• Leukocyte transfusions: Acute pulmonary toxicity has been reported in patients receiving leukocyte transfusions and amphotericin B; amphotericin B lipid complex and concurrent leukocyte transfusions are not recommended.

【184】Suspension, Intravenous:

【185】Abelcet: 5 mg/mL 

【186】Additional Information

【187】The lipid portion of amphotericin B lipid complex formulation contains 0.045 kcal per 5 mg; for patients receiving parenteral nutrition, adjustment to the amount of lipids may be necessary (Sacks 1997).

【188】Administration: Pediatric

【189】To minimize infusion-related immediate reactions, may premedicate with the following 30 to 60 minutes prior to administration: Acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and/or hydrocortisone. If the patient experiences rigors during the infusion, meperidine may be administered. Adequate hydration and pre-infusion administration of NS may reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity during amphotericin B treatment .

【190】Parenteral: IV: Must be diluted prior to administration. Flush line with D5W prior to infusion. Gently shake the IV container of diluted drug to ensure that contents are thoroughly mixed, then administer at a rate of 2.5 mg/kg/hour (over 2 hours for 5 mg/kg/dose). **Do not use an in-line filter during administration.** If infusion time exceeds 2 hours, mix the contents by gently rotating the infusion bag every 2 hours.

【191】Administration: Adult

【192】**IV:** To minimize infusion-related immediate reactions, premedicate with the following 30 to 60 minutes prior to administration: Acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and/ **or** hydrocortisone. If the patient experiences rigors during the infusion, meperidine may be administered .

【193】Administer at an infusion rate of 2.5 mg/kg/hour (eg, over 2 hours for 5 mg/kg). May prolong infusion over >2 hours if necessary to reduce infusion-related reaction . Invert infusion container several times prior to administration and every 2 hours during infusion if it exceeds 2 hours. **Do not use an in-line filter during administration.** Flush line with dextrose; normal saline may cause precipitate.

【194】Pre-infusion administration of 1 L of NS may reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity during amphotericin B treatment .

【195】Storage/Stability

【196】Intact vials should be stored at 2°C to 8°C ; do not freeze. Protect intact vials from exposure to light. Solutions in D5W for infusion are stable for 48 hours under refrigeration and for an additional 6 hours at room temperature.

【197】Use

【198】Treatment of invasive fungal infections in patients who are refractory to or intolerant of conventional amphotericin B therapy (FDA approved in pediatric patients \[age not specified\] and adults).

【199】Medication Safety Issues

【200】High alert medication:

【201】The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) includes this medication among its list of drug classes (liposomal forms with conventional counterparts) which have a heightened risk of causing significant patient harm when used in error (High-Alert Medications in Acute Care Settings).

【202】Other safety concerns:

【203】Lipid-based amphotericin formulations (Abelcet) may be confused with conventional formulations (Fungizone) or with other lipid-based amphotericin formulations (amphotericin B liposomal \[AmBisome\]; amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate complex \[Amphotec\])

【204】Large overdoses have occurred when conventional formulations were dispensed inadvertently for lipid-based products. Single daily doses of conventional amphotericin formulation never exceed 1.5 mg/kg.

【239】Molsidomine: May enhance the hypotensive effect of Blood Pressure Lowering Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【240】Naftopidil: May enhance the hypotensive effect of Blood Pressure Lowering Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【241】Nicergoline: May enhance the hypotensive effect of Blood Pressure Lowering Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【242】Nicorandil: May enhance the hypotensive effect of Blood Pressure Lowering Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【243】Nitroprusside: Blood Pressure Lowering Agents may enhance the hypotensive effect of Nitroprusside. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【244】Obinutuzumab: May enhance the hypotensive effect of Blood Pressure Lowering Agents. Management: Consider temporarily withholding blood pressure lowering medications beginning 12 hours prior to obinutuzumab infusion and continuing until 1 hour after the end of the infusion. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【245】Pentoxifylline: May enhance the hypotensive effect of Blood Pressure Lowering Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【246】Pholcodine: Blood Pressure Lowering Agents may enhance the hypotensive effect of Pholcodine. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【247】Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors: May enhance the hypotensive effect of Blood Pressure Lowering Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【248】Prostacyclin Analogues: May enhance the hypotensive effect of Blood Pressure Lowering Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【249】Quinagolide: May enhance the hypotensive effect of Blood Pressure Lowering Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【250】Saccharomyces boulardii: Antifungal Agents (Systemic and Oral \[Non-Absorbable\]) may diminish the therapeutic effect of Saccharomyces boulardii. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【251】Silodosin: May enhance the hypotensive effect of Blood Pressure Lowering Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【252】Tacrolimus (Systemic): Amphotericin B may enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Tacrolimus (Systemic). _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【253】Vancomycin: May enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Amphotericin B. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【254】Dietary Considerations

【255】If on parenteral nutrition, may need to adjust the amount of lipid infused. The lipid portion of amphotericin B (lipid complex) formulation contains 0.045 kcal per 5 mg (Sacks 1997).

【256】Pregnancy Considerations

【257】Amphotericin crosses the placenta and enters the fetal circulation. Amphotericin B is recommended for the treatment of serious, systemic fungal diseases in pregnant women, refer to current guidelines .

【258】Monitoring Parameters

【259】Serum creatinine, BUN, liver function tests, serum electrolytes (especially potassium and magnesium), CBC, vital signs, fluid balance, and urine output. Monitor for infusion-related reactions.

【260】Mechanism of Action

【261】Binds to ergosterol altering cell membrane permeability in susceptible fungi and causing leakage of cell components with subsequent cell death. Proposed mechanism suggests that amphotericin causes an oxidation-dependent stimulation of macrophages.

【262】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【263】**Note:** Exhibits nonlinear kinetics; volume of distribution and clearance from blood increases with increasing dose.

【264】Distribution: High tissue concentration found in the liver, spleen, and lung ; V d : Increases with higher doses (likely reflects increased uptake by tissues); 131 L/kg with 5 mg/kg/day

【265】Half-life elimination: 173 hours following multiple doses

【266】Excretion: 0.9% of dose excreted in urine over 24 hours; effects of hepatic and renal impairment on drug disposition are unknown王磊
