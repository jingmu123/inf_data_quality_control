【3】ALERT: US Boxed Warning

【4】Risks from concomitant use with opioids (injection, oral):

【5】Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

【6】Abuse, misuse, and addiction (injection, oral):

【7】The use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing lorazepam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction.

【8】Dependence and withdrawal reactions:

【9】Injection: The continued use of benzodiazepines for several days to weeks may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Although lorazepam injection is indicated only for intermittent use, if used more frequently than recommended, abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of lorazepam injection may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. For patients using lorazepam injection more frequently than recommended, to reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue lorazepam injection.

【10】Oral: The continued use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of lorazepam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue lorazepam or reduce the dosage.

【17】Dosing: Neonatal

【18】Iatrogenic benzodiazepine dependency, weaning after prolonged midazolam infusion

【19】**Iatrogenic benzodiazepine dependency, weaning after prolonged (≥5 days) midazolam infusion:** Limited data available; optimal regimen not established. Lorazepam dose and taper schedule must be individualized and will depend upon patient's previous midazolam infusion rate, length of time on benzodiazepines, and severity of withdrawal. Use of Withdrawal Assessment Tool (WAT-1) has been recommended to monitor for iatrogenic withdrawal symptoms .

【20】Term neonates: Oral, IV: No standard dose exists; one published approach bases lorazepam dose on current midazolam infusion rate and calculates dose by multiplying the midazolam infusion rate by 0.833; lorazepam doses are administered every 4 hours and once stabilized  are weaned by 10% to 20% of the original dose every 24 to 48 hours based on patient's risk level for withdrawal; monitor using WAT-1 scale and adjust accordingly; refer to institutional protocol if available .

【21】Sedation

【22】**Sedation:** Limited data available: Preterm and term neonates: IV: 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg/dose every 4 to 6 hours as needed .

【23】Seizures, acute treatment

【24】**Seizures, acute treatment:** Limited data available:

【25】Preterm and term neonates: IV: 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg/dose administered by slow IV over 1 to 5 minutes . In a small study (n=7; weight range: 1.4 to 4.14 kg), lorazepam was administered at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg; if there was no response or only a partial response was seen 15 minutes after the dose, the dose was repeated; up to a total of 3 doses were allowed; maximum total dose: 0.15 mg/kg .

【26】Dosing: Pediatric

【27】Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, anticipatory

【28】**Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, anticipatory:** Limited data available: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Oral: 0.04 to 0.08 mg/kg/dose; maximum dose: 2 mg/dose; administer a dose the night before chemotherapy and again the next day prior to chemotherapy administration .

【31】Anxiety, acute

【32】**Anxiety, acute:**

【33】Infants and Children <12 years: Limited data available: Oral, IV: Usual: 0.05 mg/kg/dose (maximum dose: 2 mg/dose) every 4 to 8 hours; range: 0.02 to 0.1 mg/kg/dose .

【34】Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: Oral: 0.25 to 2 mg/dose 2 or 3 times daily; maximum dose: 2 mg/dose .

【35】Sedation; procedural

【36】**Sedation; procedural:** Limited data available: Children and Adolescents: Oral: Usual: 0.05 mg/kg; range reported in literature: 0.02 to 0.09 mg/kg . **Note:** In adults, the maximum dose is 4 mg/dose.

【37】Status epilepticus

【38】**Status epilepticus:** Limited data available:

【39】IV: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: 0.1 mg/kg slow IV; may repeat dose once in 5 to 10 minutes; maximum dose: 4 mg/dose .

【40】Intranasal: **Note:** Lorazepam is not the preferred agent for intranasal administration, guidelines recommend midazolam as the preferred agent .

【41】Infants, Children, and Adolescents: 0.1 mg/kg/dose; maximum dose: 5 mg/dose .

【42】**Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:** Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.

【43】Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric

【44】Oral: Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling; however, some clinicians recommend no dosage adjustments are necessary .

【45】IV: No dosage adjustment necessary for acute doses; use repeated doses with caution; may increase the risk of propylene glycol toxicity. Monitor closely if using for prolonged periods of time or at high doses. In adults, the osmolar gap has been shown to be a surrogate marker for propylene glycol accumulation .

【46】Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Pediatric

【47】Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: No dosage adjustment necessary. For severe hepatic disease, use with caution; benzodiazepines may worsen hepatic encephalopathy.

【48】Dosing: Adult

【49】**Dosage guidance:**

【50】**Safety:** Reduce dose or avoid use in patients receiving opioids or with significant chronic disease (eg, respiratory compromise). Avoid use in patients with a history of substance use, misuse of medications, or depression, except for acute or emergency situations (eg, acute agitation, status epilepticus) .

【51】Akathisia, antipsychotic induced

【52】**Akathisia, antipsychotic induced (alternative agent) (off-label use):** **Oral (immediate release):** Initial: 0.5 to 1 mg twice daily; may increase dose based on response and tolerability up to 6 mg/day, in divided doses .

【53】Anxiety

【54】**Anxiety:**

【55】**Anxiety and agitation, acute/severe (monotherapy or adjunctive therapy): IM, IV, Oral (immediate release):** 0.5 to 2 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed up to 10 mg/day; adjust dose based on response and tolerability. In severely agitated inpatients, some experts recommend doses up to 4 mg and repeat IM or IV doses as frequently as 10 to 30 minutes; may give alone or in combination with an antipsychotic .

【56】**Anxiety disorders (adjunctive therapy or monotherapy) (alternative agent): Note:** Generally used short-term for symptom relief until preferred therapy (eg, serotonin reuptake inhibitor) is effective (eg, 4 to 6 weeks followed by tapering). Long-term low-dose (eg, 0.5 mg/day) therapy may be considered in select patients, when preferred treatments are ineffective or poorly tolerated . Use with caution in patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); benzodiazepines may cause cognitive changes .

【57】_Immediate release:_ **Oral:** Initial: 0.5 to 1 mg 2 to 3 times daily; although most patients will experience relief with this dose, may increase daily dose gradually based on response and tolerability in increments of 1 mg every 2 to 3 days up to 6 mg/day in 2 to 4 divided doses; some patients may require doses up to 10 mg/day for optimal response. Some experts recommend a lower initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg once to twice daily .

【58】_Extended release 24-hour capsules:_ **Oral:** Initial: Determine stable daily dose using IR tablets in 3 divided doses. Maintenance: May convert to extended release at the total daily dose of immediate release; administer once daily in the morning. **Note:** For dosage adjustments, discontinue extended release and switch to immediate release.

【59】**Advanced cancer and/or palliative care: IM, IV, Oral (immediate release):** 0.25 to 2 mg every 3 to 6 hours as needed . **Note:** The injectable solution may be administered rectally or subcutaneously, and the tablet and oral solution may be administered sublingually at the same doses when other routes are unavailable .

【60】**Performance- or phobia-related anxiety (monotherapy or adjunctive therapy)** : **Note** : Provide a test dose, at the same dose to be used for treatment, in advance of the stimulus to ensure tolerability .

【61】**Oral (immediate release):** 0.5 to 2 mg once 30 to 60 minutes before the stimulus .

【62】**Procedural anxiety (premedication):**

【63】**Oral (immediate release), Sublingual** (off-label use): 0.5 to 2 mg once 30 to 90 minutes before procedure; if needed due to incomplete response, may repeat the dose (usually at 50% of the initial dose) after 30 to 60 minutes .

【64】**IV:** 1 to 4 mg **or** 0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg (maximum single dose: 4 mg) once 5 to 20 minutes before procedure; if needed based on incomplete response and/or duration of procedure, may repeat the dose (usually at 50% of the initial dose) after ≥5 minutes .

【65】Catatonia

【66】**Catatonia (off-label use):**

【67】_Diagnosis:_ **Note:** Partial, temporary relief of signs following administration is consistent with the diagnosis; a negative response does not rule out catatonia .

【68】**IV** (preferred): 1 to 2 mg once; if no response in 5 to 10 minutes, repeat dose once .

【69】**IM:** 1 to 2 mg once; may administer up to 2 additional doses at 3-hour intervals if needed .

【70】**Oral (immediate release), Sublingual:** 2 mg once; may administer up to 2 additional doses at 3-hour intervals if needed .

【71】_Treatment:_ **Note:** For patients with malignant catatonia, if rapid resolution is necessary or lorazepam treatment fails, consider electroconvulsive therapy .

【72】**IM, IV, Oral (immediate release):** Initial: 1 to 2 mg 3 times daily; IV preferred for initial dosing with switch to oral as patient improves. May increase dose based on response and tolerability in increments of 3 mg every 1 to 2 days to a usual dose of 6 to 24 mg/day . Doses up to 30 mg/day have been reported . For patients at risk of cardiorespiratory compromise or oversedation, some experts recommend initiating with 0.5 mg 3 times daily .

【73】_Duration of treatment:_ Remission is usually achieved in 4 to 10 days; maintenance therapy at the effective dose is usually continued for 3 to 6 months to maintain recovery, although longer courses may be needed .

【74】Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, prevention and treatment

【75】**Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, prevention and treatment (adjunctive therapy) (off-label use):**

【76】_Anticipatory or breakthrough nausea/vomiting, as an adjunct to conventional antiemetics:_ **Oral (immediate release), IV, Sublingual:** 0.5 to 1 mg every 6 hours as needed; doses up to 2 mg have been described .

【77】Intoxication

【78】**Intoxication: Cocaine, methamphetamine, and other sympathomimetics (off-label use):** Based on limited data: **IV:** 2 to 4 mg every 3 to 10 minutes as needed for agitation, sedation, seizures, hypertension, and tachycardia until desired symptom control achieved. Large cumulative doses may be required for some patients; monitor for respiratory depression and hypotension . **Note:** Initiating treatment at 1 mg may be adequate in patients who are only mildly or moderately intoxicated, but doses should be repeated or increased as needed. Consider IM administration if IV access is not possible; however, effects will be delayed .

【79】Mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU, sedation

【80】**Mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU, sedation (alternative agent) (off-label use):** **Note:** Used as part of a multimodal strategy. In general, nonbenzodiazepine sedation is preferred due to risk of prolonged sedation and delirium with continuous benzodiazepine use. Titrate to light level of sedation (eg, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale 0 to −2) or clinical effect (eg, ventilator dyssynchrony). Intermittent as-needed therapy is preferred to avoid drug accumulation and prolonged sedation associated with continuous infusions . Continuous infusions are not recommended for use in most ICU patients due to propylene glycol (PG) accumulation and subsequent complications (osmol gap metabolic acidosis, kidney failure); monitor PG accumulation with osmol gap; nonbenzodiazepine or midazolam continuous infusions are generally preferred .

【81】_Intermittent (preferred):_

【82】Non–weight-based dosing: **IV:** Initial dose: 1 to 4 mg; Maintenance: 1 to 4 mg every 2 to 6 hours as needed .

【83】Weight-based dosing: **IV:** Initial dose: 0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg (maximum single dose: 4 mg); Maintenance: 0.02 to 0.06 mg/kg every 2 to 6 hours as needed (maximum single dose: 4 mg) .

【84】_Continuous infusion:_ **IV:** 0.5 to 10 mg/hour **or** 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg/hour continuous infusion (maximum dose: 10 mg/hour) .

【85】Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

【86】**Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (adjunctive therapy) (off-label use)** :

【87】**Note:** Following withdrawal of causative agent while continuing supportive care, use for moderate to severe muscle rigidity with elevated creatine kinase. May also use for any patient experiencing agitation .

【88】**IM, IV:** 0.5 to 2 mg every 4 to 6 hours until symptom resolution; use higher doses (eg, 1 to 2 mg) for management of muscle rigidity .

【89】Seizures

【90】**Seizures: Note:** If IV access is not available, IM lorazepam is not recommended due to erratic absorption and a slow time to peak drug levels. May consider sublingual or subcutaneous lorazepam or IM midazolam .

【91】**Acute active seizures (non-status epilepticus) (off-label use): IV:** 4 mg given at a maximum rate of 2 mg/minute; may repeat at 3 to 5 minutes if seizures continue .

【92】**Status epilepticus:** **IV:** 4 mg given at a maximum rate of 2 mg/minute; may repeat at 3 to 5 minutes if seizures continue; a nonbenzodiazepine antiseizure agent should follow to prevent seizure recurrence, even if seizures have ceased .

【93】Serotonin syndrome

【94】**Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity) (off-label use):** **IV:** 2 to 4 mg IV every 8 to 10 minutes based upon patient response .

【95】Substance withdrawal

【96】**Substance withdrawal:**

【97】**Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (alternative agent) **(off-label use)** : Note:** Withdrawal will progress at different rates in some patients; flexibility in dosing and duration is warranted . Regimens vary and depend on withdrawal history, degree of current withdrawal symptoms, blood alcohol concentration, and whether the patient is treated inpatient or in the ambulatory setting. Many facilities only treat alcohol withdrawal in the ambulatory setting if Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised scale (CIWA-Ar) score is ≤15 and there is no history of withdrawal seizures or delirium tremens . Although longer-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in general, shorter-acting benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may be preferable in patients with impaired liver function . The following are 2 suggested regimens.

【98】_Symptom-triggered regimen:_

【99】**Note:** Some experts recommend symptom-triggered regimens for patients with CIWA-Ar >15 .

【100】**Oral (immediate release), IV:** 2 to 4 mg as needed per institution-specific protocol until appropriate sedation achieved; dose and frequency determined by withdrawal symptom severity using a validated severity-assessment scale such as the CIWA-Ar .

【101】_Fixed-dose regimen:_

【102】**Note:** Some experts recommend fixed-dose regimens for patients at risk for mild withdrawal (CIWA-Ar ≤15), particularly in an ambulatory setting where CIWA-Ar scores cannot be reliably administered . Hold doses for excessive sedation .

【103】Days 1 through 3: **Oral (immediate release), IV** **:** 2 mg 3 times daily .

【104】Day 4: **Oral (immediate release), IV:** 2 mg twice daily, then discontinue lorazepam .

【105】Breakthrough symptoms: **Oral (immediate release), IV:** May administer additional 1 or 2 mg doses as needed to treat breakthrough symptoms throughout the taper .

【106】**Opioid withdrawal (autonomic instability and agitation) (adjunctive therapy) (alternative agent)** **(off-label use)** **:** Based on limited data: **IV:** 1 to 2 mg every 10 minutes until hemodynamically stable and adequate sedation .

【107】Vertigo, acute episodes

【108】**Vertigo, acute episodes (alternative agent) (off-label use):**

【109】**Note:** Reserve use for symptomatic relief of episodes lasting several hours to days (maximum duration: 3 days); chronic use may impede adaptation and recovery .

【110】**IM, IV, Oral (immediate release):** 0.5 to 2 mg every 4 to 12 hours as needed for up to 48 to 72 hours .

【111】**Discontinuation of therapy:** Unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal, gradually taper to detect reemerging symptoms and minimize rebound and withdrawal symptoms in patients receiving therapy ≥4 weeks or as appropriate based on patient-specific factors .

【112】**Low or moderate dose, no concerns for benzodiazepine use disorder:** Taper total daily dose by 20% to 25% every week based on response and tolerability (taper increments will be limited by available dosage forms) .

【113】**Extended or high-dose therapy, or suspected benzodiazepine use disorder:** Taper total daily dose by approximately 25% every 1 to 2 weeks based on response, tolerability, and individual patient factors (taper increments will be limited by available dosage forms) . Reduce dose more rapidly in the beginning, and slow the dose reduction as the taper progresses because earlier stages of withdrawal are easier to tolerate . The optimal duration and taper increment will vary; up to 6 months may be necessary for some patients on higher doses, and a taper rate of 50% every week may be tolerated in some patients . For benzodiazepines with half-lives significantly <24 hours, including lorazepam, consider substituting an equivalent dose of a long-acting benzodiazepine to allow for a more gradual reduction in drug serum concentrations .

【114】**Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:** Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.

【115】Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Adult

【116】The renal dosing recommendations are based upon the best available evidence and clinical expertise. Senior Editorial Team: Bruce Mueller, PharmD, FCCP, FASN, FNKF; Jason A Roberts, PhD, BPharm (Hons), B App Sc, FSHP, FISAC; Michael Heung, MD, MS.

【117】**Altered kidney function:** Mild to severe impairment:

【118】**Oral:** No dosage adjustment necessary .

【119】**Parenteral:** No dosage adjustment necessary for acute doses ; use repeated doses with caution; may increase the risk of propylene glycol toxicity. Monitor osmol gap closely as a surrogate marker for propylene glycol accumulation, especially if using for prolonged periods of time or at high doses .

【120】**Hemodialysis, intermittent (thrice weekly):** Not significantly dialyzed : **Oral, Parenteral:** No supplemental dose or dosage adjustment necessary; use repeated parenteral doses with caution; monitor osmol gap closely as a surrogate marker for propylene glycol accumulation, especially if using for prolonged periods of time or at high doses .

【121】**Peritoneal dialysis:** Unlikely to be dialyzed (highly protein bound): **Oral, Parenteral:** No dosage adjustment necessary ; use repeated parenteral doses with caution; monitor osmol gap closely as a surrogate marker for propylene glycol accumulation, especially if using for prolonged periods of time or at high doses .

【122】**CRRT:** Not significantly dialyzed : **Oral, Parenteral:** No dosage adjustment necessary ; use repeated intravenous doses with caution; monitor osmol gap closely as a surrogate marker for propylene glycol accumulation, especially if using for prolonged periods of time or at high doses .

【123】**PIRRT (eg, sustained, low-efficiency diafiltration):** Unlikely to be dialyzed (highly protein bound): **Oral, Parenteral:** No dosage adjustment necessary ; use repeated parenteral doses with caution; monitor osmol gap closely as a surrogate marker for propylene glycol accumulation, especially if using for prolonged periods of time or at high doses .

【124】Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Adult

【125】The hepatic dosing recommendations are based up on the best available evidence and clinical expertise. Senior Editorial Team: Matt Harris, PharmD, MHS, BCPS, FAST Jeong Park, PharmD, MS, BCTXP, FCCP, FAST, Arun Jesudian, MD, Sasan Sakiani, MD.

【126】**Note:** Lorazepam metabolism is not altered in patients with cirrhosis ; however, the elimination half-life is prolonged due to increased volume of distribution secondary to decreased protein binding . First time hepatic encephalopathy events may be precipitated by benzodiazepine use in benzodiazepine-naive patients with cirrhosis; occurrence was observed primarily between 3 to 10 days of benzodiazepine use in one study, potentially due to drug accumulation .

【127】**Hepatic impairment prior to treatment initiation:**

【128】**_Initial or dose titration in patients with preexisting liver cirrhosis:_**

【129】**Parenteral: Note:** Avoid use or use with caution in patients with known hepatic encephalopathy .

【130】**Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A:**

【131】_Intermittent dosing:_ No dosage adjustment necessary .

【132】_Continuous infusion:_ Use should generally be avoided and only if benefits outweigh the risks .

【133】**Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B and C:**

【134】_Intermittent dosing:_ No dosage adjustment necessary; however, extending the dosing interval (eg, increasing from every 6 hours to every 12 hours) should be considered when prolonged (>3 days) use is anticipated .

【135】_Continuous infusion:_ Use should generally be avoided and only if benefits outweigh the risks .

【136】**Oral: Note:** ER formulation should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment .

【137】**Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A:** No dosage adjustment necessary .

【138】**Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B and C:** **Note:** Use of a shorter acting benzodiazepine (eg, oxazepam) should be considered .

【139】_Initial:_ Reduce to at least 50% of usual recommended dose and extend dosing interval (eg, if the usual dosing interval is every 6 hours, then extend to every 12 hours) to avoid lorazepam accumulation; gradually titrate based on response and tolerability to the lowest effective dose and frequency. For patients experiencing new onset hepatic encephalopathy, consider dose taper to discontinuation. Avoid use or use with caution in patients with known hepatic encephalopathy .

【140】Adverse Reactions (Significant): Considerations

【141】Anterograde amnesia

【142】Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, can impair explicit memory and produce short-term **anterograde amnesia** (ie, memory of information or events after drug administration). Retrograde amnesia (ie, events or information prior to drug administration) is unaffected. However, the magnitude of the amnesic effect from benzodiazepines differs among the various agents, depending on their pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, route of administration, and dose. Anterograde amnesia is associated with higher doses, IV administration, and benzodiazepines with faster absorption and higher potency. . Lorazepam has also been reported to produce an atypical effect on implicit memory, disrupt performance on explicit memory tasks, and impair focused attention .

【143】_Mechanism:_ Dose-related. Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, bind to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor, subsequently increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening and producing GABA’s inhibitory effect throughout the CNS. The GABA-A receptor complex is composed of five subunits, each with multiple isoforms. Each receptor complex contains a benzodiazepine-binding site, which is classified into several types, based on the alpha subunit isoforms and clinical effects related to each type. The BZ1 receptor type, containing the alfa1 subunit isoform, is highly concentrated in the cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum, and is responsible for benzodiazepine-associated anterograde amnesia .

【144】_Onset:_ Rapid

【145】IV administration **:** Following a single dose of IV lorazepam, a delayed onset of amnesic action of 15 to 30 minutes has been observed, with a duration between 4 to 8 hours. The onset latency is also dose-related, with shorter onset for higher lorazepam doses (ie, 15 minutes after 4 mg) and a longer onset for lower doses (ie, 30 minutes after 2 mg) .

【146】_Risk factors:_

【147】• Specific benzodiazepine: Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, with a short half-life, rapid onset, and administered IV versus oral, are associated with a high propensity for amnesic effects. However, midazolam is considered to have superior amnestic properties when compared to lorazepam .

【148】• Higher doses 

【149】CNS effects

【150】Lorazepam can cause significant **drowsiness** and **sedated state;** patients also report having "slowed down thinking" . In addition, lorazepam has been shown to cause psychomotor impairment by increasing reaction time and decreasing reaction accuracy. Benzodiazepines, in general, are associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls (particularly in older adults) . Tolerance usually develops to the sedative effects .

【151】_Mechanism:_ Dose-related ; benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, bind to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor, subsequently increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening and producing GABA’s inhibitory effect throughout the CNS. Benzodiazepine-associated sedation are mediated by the alpha 1-containing GABA-A receptors .

【152】_Onset_ : Rapid

【153】_•_ IV administration: Sedative effects: Due to relatively low lipid solubility, onset of sedation is delayed at 15 to 20 minutes, and may require up to 30 minutes .

【154】_•_ Oral administration: Sedative effects: 20 to 30 minutes .

【155】_Risk factors:_

【156】• Older adults (cognitive effects) 

【157】• Higher doses

【158】• Route of administration (IV administration is associated with a higher risk of sedation versus oral)

【159】Neurodevelopmental effects in children

【160】Animal studies have shown that prolonged or repeated exposure to medications for anesthesia or sedation cause adverse effects on brain maturation resulting in changes in behavior and learning. Some human studies have also suggested similar effects, including epidemiological studies in humans that have observed various cognitive and behavioral problems, including neurodevelopmental delay (and related diagnoses), learning disabilities, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, data are limited, inconclusive, and further studies are needed to fully characterize findings. Based on the potential risk, the FDA warned in 2016 that in neonates, children <3 years, or patients in the third trimester of pregnancy (ie, times of rapid brain growth and synaptogenesis) undergoing repeated or lengthy exposure to sedatives or anesthetics during surgery/procedures/critical illness, there may be detrimental effects on the child's or fetus’ brain development which may lead to various cognitive and behavioral problems. Relatively short exposure (<3 hours) to sedatives or anesthetics during surgery or procedures is unlikely to adversely affect brain development .

【161】_Mechanism:_ Unknown; in juvenile animal studies, drugs that potentiate gamma-aminobutyric acid activity and/or block N-methyl-D aspartate receptors for >3 hours demonstrated widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss along with alteration in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis .

【162】_Risk factors:_

【163】• Neonates, children <3 years, or pregnant patients during their third trimester undergoing procedures lasting >3 hours or multiple procedures 

【164】Paradoxical reactions

【165】**Paradoxical reactions** , sometimes referred to as disinhibitory reactions or behavioral disinhibition, have been reported in children, adults, and older adults with benzodiazepine use, particularly in those with risk factors. Reactions are relatively uncommon and have been characterized in a number of ways, including increased talkativeness, excitement, restlessness, hyperactivity, sleep disturbances **,** hostility, rage, agitation, and/or **aggressive behavior** . In children, paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines, particularly midazolam, have been most commonly described as agitation, restlessness, inconsolable crying, screaming, disorientation, and/or excitement .

【166】_Mechanism:_ Dose-related (potentially, although may also be idiosyncratic); exact mechanism is unclear due to limited evidence . One hypothesis has suggested that increased GABAergic activity in the brain from benzodiazepines causes a decrease in the restraining influence of the frontal cortex, thereby causing excitement, hostility, and rage. An additional proposed mechanism is that benzodiazepines can reduce serotonergic neurotransmission, subsequently causing aggressive behavior. Another mechanism is that in select patients with genetic variations in GABA-A receptors, there is decreased GABA transmission with benzodiazepines which results in neuronal overexcitation manifested clinically as a paradoxical reaction .

【167】_Onset_ : Rapid; in case reports involving lorazepam, paradoxical reactions occurred within several hours to 24 hours after the first dose; reactions subsided within 24 to 48 hours of discontinuation 

【168】_Risk factors:_

【169】Benzodiazepines, in general:

【170】Age related (extremes of age):

【171】• Children 

【172】• Older adults 

【173】Disease or condition related:

【174】• Past history of aggressive behavior or violence 

【175】• Alcoholism or history of alcohol use 

【176】• Psychiatric or personality disorders, including affective disorder 

【177】• Dementia 

【178】Patient related:

【179】• Genetic predisposition (potential risk factor) (ie, variability in the density of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptors throughout the brain, a persistence of a juvenile pattern of benzodiazepine response in adulthood, or multiple allelic forms of the receptors with varying affinities for benzodiazepines have all been suggested as potentially playing a role) 

【180】Other potential risk factors: **Note** : Not established risk factors since evidence is limited 

【181】• Higher doses (likely a risk, but not firmly established) 

【182】• Parenteral benzodiazepine administration (potential risk) 

【183】• Specific benzodiazepines (potential risk): Benzodiazepines with a short half-life and/or those considered to have higher potency (eg, alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam, triazolam) compared to lower potency benzodiazepines are believed to increase the risk 

【184】Propylene glycol toxicity

【185】Propylene glycol, a solvent used in many pharmaceutical preparations, is found in parenteral lorazepam. High doses, continuous use, and/or prolonged use of IV lorazepam can cause propylene glycol accumulation and subsequent toxicity in adults and children, especially low birth-weight infants and those with hepatic or kidney insufficiency . Propylene glycol accumulation and toxicity is primarily manifested as hyperosmolar metabolic acidosis (ie, a high anion gap metabolic acidosis with elevated osmol gap) and toxicity is associated with acute kidney injury, intravascular hemolysis, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, mental status changes, and CNS depression . The osmol gap is correlated with serum propylene glycol concentrations and can be used as a surrogate marker to monitor for propylene glycol accumulation and potential toxicity . Pediatric patients do accumulate propylene glycol but less often display laboratory abnormalities compared to adults .

【186】_Mechanism:_ Dose-related; propylene glycol is oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenase to lactaldehyde, which is metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to lactic acid. The accumulation of lactic acid results in metabolic acidosis, but is usually well tolerated. Lactate in this scenario is not generated from any underlying pathology. The lactate is oxidized to pyruvate and then is metabolized by the normal carbohydrate processes.

【187】_Onset_ : Rapid; propylene glycol accumulation, as evidenced by a hyperosmolar anion gap metabolic acidosis, has been observed as early as 48 hours following high-dose continuous infusions (mean lorazepam dose: 8.1 mg/kg; mean infusion rate: 0.16 mg/kg/hour) .

【188】_Risk factors:_

【189】_•_ Duration: Continuous infusions >48 hours in adults 

【190】_•_ Dose:

【191】\- Neonates: Large amounts of propylene glycol orally, IV (eg, >3,000 mg/day), or topically 

【192】\- Adult: High continuous doses of IV lorazepam (doses exceeding recommended adult dosage range of 0.1 mg/kg/hour in critically ill patients) 

【193】• Kidney dysfunction (propylene glycol is excreted unchanged in the urine) 

【194】• Hepatic dysfunction 

【195】• Concomitant medications also containing propylene glycol (eg, diazepam, esmolol, nitroglycerin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) 

【196】• Impaired alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme system (eg, young children) 

【197】• Concomitant disulfiram or metronidazole 

【198】• Alcohol use disorder 

【199】• Pregnancy 

【200】• Propylene glycol concentrations exceeding 25 mg/dL. **Note** : Serum propylene glycol concentrations are difficult to obtain in most clinical settings and test turnaround time is slow; osmol gap is recommended as a surrogate marker .

【201】• In the absence of other osmotic agents (eg, alcohols), an osmol gap of ≥10 was predictive of elevated propylene glycol concentrations; values of ≥12 suggest propylene glycol toxicity .

【202】• Critically ill neonates, especially those weighing <5 kg 

【203】Withdrawal syndrome

【204】Therapeutic use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, is associated with a **withdrawal syndrome** in children and adults **,** particularly following abrupt or overly rapid discontinuation. Benzodiazepine-associated withdrawal symptoms can include new withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms, both of which are typically transient, short-lasting, and reversible. A persistent post-withdrawal disorder, which can be long-lasting, severe, and potentially irreversible, has also been described. In general, withdrawal symptoms are typically mild and characterized as anxiety, panic attacks, restlessness, insomnia and other sleep disturbances, irritability, poor concentration, confusion, nausea/vomiting, weight loss, tremor, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and muscle pain/stiffness. Severe symptoms such as seizure and psychosis may also rarely occur following abrupt discontinuation. Severe withdrawal may be fatal. Data are limited on persistent post-withdrawal disorders, but cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, sensory disturbances (eg, tinnitus, paresthesia, skin sensations), motor disturbances (eg, muscle pain, weakness, spasms), and GI disturbances have been described . There are also rare case reports of new-onset mania occurring after abrupt withdrawal of chronic lorazepam . Severity, onset, and duration of any benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome varies based on several factors, such as specific benzodiazepine administered (and its half -life), dose, and duration of use. However, in general, new withdrawal symptoms typically resolve within 2 to 4 weeks and rebound symptoms may last 3 weeks, but persistent post-withdrawal symptoms may last >6 weeks and take 6 to 12 months to completely resolve, and in some cases, persist for years. .

【205】_Mechanism:_ Withdrawal; exact mechanisms are complex and unclear, but chronic exposure to benzodiazepines alters GABAergic neurotransmission (up/down regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid \[GABA\]-A receptor subunits) and rapid or abrupt withdrawal results in underactivity of inhibitory GABA functions subsequently increasing excitatory nervous activity and likely contributing to symptoms associated with withdrawal . A role of glutamate receptors, including N-methyl-D aspartate (NMDA)-, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-receptors, and metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors, has also been suggested. In mice and rat studies, antagonists for glutamate receptors have shown the ability to potently suppress the withdrawal signs caused by chronic benzodiazepine administration .

【206】_Onset:_ Varied; onset of symptoms usually occurs within the first day following abrupt withdrawal of lorazepam and any other short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepines. Long-acting benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam) are associated with an initial onset of withdrawal symptoms 5 days following abrupt discontinuation . In general, persistent post-withdrawal disorder associated with psychotropic medications (eg, benzodiazepines) have an onset ranging from 24 hours to 6 weeks following a decrease, discontinuation, or switch .

【207】_Risk factors:_

【208】Benzodiazepines, in general:

【209】• Abrupt discontinuation (rather than gradual dosage reduction) of a benzodiazepine used long-term 

【210】• Higher doses 

【211】• Chronic dosing (ie, intermittent dosing may reduce the risk of withdrawal symptoms) .

【212】• Long treatment durations 

【213】• Withdrawal-associated seizure: Predisposed patients (eg, brain damage, alcohol abuse, history of seizure, or those receiving agents that lower the seizure threshold) 

【214】• Specific benzodiazepine: High-potency benzodiazepines with short and intermediate half-lives, such as lorazepam, are more frequently associated with withdrawal symptoms; benzodiazepines with a short and intermediate half-life have a higher risk for rebound, withdrawal reactions, and dependence compared to long-acting agents

【267】Warnings/Precautions

【268】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【269】• Sleep-related activities: Hazardous sleep-related activities, such as sleep-driving, cooking and eating food, and making phone calls while asleep, have been noted with benzodiazepines (Dolder 2008).

【270】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【271】• Depression: Avoid use in patients with depression because of concerns about worsening mood symptoms, particularly if suicidal risk may be present, except for acute or emergency situations (eg, acute agitation, status epilepticus) (Craske 2022).

【272】• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, insufficiency, and/or encephalopathy. Dose adjustment (lower doses) may be needed. May worsen hepatic encephalopathy.

【273】• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.

【274】• Respiratory disease: Reduce dose or avoid use in patients with respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sleep apnea. Benzodiazepines may cause significant respiratory depression.

【275】**_Concurrent drug therapy issues:_**

【276】• Concomitant use with opioids: In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of lorazepam than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking lorazepam, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

【277】• Flumazenil: Flumazenil may cause withdrawal in patients receiving long-term benzodiazepine therapy.

【278】**_Special populations:_**

【279】• Debilitated patients: Use with caution in debilitated patients; initial doses should be at the lower end of dosing range.

【280】• Older adult patients: Older adult patients may be at an increased risk of death with use; risk has been found highest within the first 4 months of use in older adult dementia patients .

【281】• Fall risk: Use with extreme caution in patients who are at risk of falls; benzodiazepines have been associated with falls and traumatic injury (Nelson 1999).

【282】**_Dosage form specific issues:_**

【283】• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP \["Inactive" 1997\]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein-binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.

【284】• Polyethylene glycol: Parenteral formulation may contain polyethylene glycol. May be associated with toxicity in high-dose and/or longer-term therapy.

【285】• Tartrazine: Some formulations may contain tartrazine (FD&C Yellow No. 5), which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in susceptible individuals, particularly those who also have aspirin sensitivity.

【286】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【287】• Abuse, misuse, and substance use disorder: Counsel patients at increased risk on proper use and monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and substance use disorder. Institute early treatment or refer patients in whom substance use disorder is suspected. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required.

【288】• Appropriate use: Does not have analgesic, antidepressant, or antipsychotic properties. Status epilepticus should not be treated with injectable benzodiazepines alone; requires close observation and management and possibly ventilatory support. When used as a component of preanesthesia, monitor for heavy sedation and airway obstruction; equipment necessary to maintain airway and ventilatory support should be available.

【289】• Tolerance: Lorazepam is a short half-life benzodiazepine. Duration of action after a single dose is determined by redistribution rather than metabolism. Tolerance develops to the sedative, hypnotic, and antiseizure effects. It does not develop to the anxiolytic effects (Vinkers 2012). Chronic use of this agent may increase the perioperative benzodiazepine dose needed to achieve desired effect.

【290】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【291】Use with caution in neonates, especially in preterm infants; several cases of neurotoxicity and myoclonus (rhythmic myoclonic jerking) have been reported.

【292】Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol.

【392】Older Adult: High-Risk Medication:

【393】Beers Criteria: Lorazepam is identified in the Beers Criteria as a potentially inappropriate medication to be avoided in patients 65 years and older because of risk of abuse, misuse, physical dependence, and addiction. In addition, older adults have increased risk of impaired cognition, delirium, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle accidents with benzodiazepine use. However, benzodiazepines may be appropriate in the elderly when used for seizure disorders, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, benzodiazepine or ethanol withdrawal, severe generalized anxiety disorder, or periprocedural anesthesia (Beers Criteria \[AGS 2023\]).

【394】Lorazepam is identified in the Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria as a potentially inappropriate medication in older adults (≥65 years of age) with a history of recurrent falls due to an increased risk of falls. Use of benzodiazepines is not recommended for ≥4 weeks; limit insomnia treatment to <2 weeks. In addition, some disease states of concern include dementia and respiratory failure (acute or chronic) (O’Mahony 2023).

【395】Administration issues:

【396】Injection dosage form contains propylene glycol. Monitor for toxicity when administering continuous or high-dose lorazepam infusions.

【474】Reproductive Considerations

【475】Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use. Pregnancy testing is recommended before treating acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms (ASAM 2020).

【476】Therapy for anxiety should be individualized (BAP \[McAllister-Williams 2017\]); avoid the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety disorders in patients planning to become pregnant (Larsen 2015).

【477】Pregnancy Considerations

【478】Lorazepam and its metabolite cross the human placenta .

【479】In utero exposure to benzodiazepines has the potential to cause harm to the fetus. Teratogenic effects have been observed in some studies; however, a clear association has not been reported and additional data are needed . Exposure to a benzodiazepine late in pregnancy may cause neonatal sedation (hypotonia, lethargy, respiratory depression) and/or symptoms of neonatal withdrawal (feeding difficulties, hyperreflexia, inconsolable crying, irritability, restlessness, tremors). Data related to long-term effects on neurodevelopment are inconclusive . Newborns exposed to lorazepam in utero should be monitored for feeding problems, respiratory depression, sedation, and withdrawal.

【480】Due to pregnancy-induced physiologic changes, some pharmacokinetic properties of lorazepam may be altered, resulting in an increased apparent V d , increased apparent oral clearance, and decreased elimination half-life (Papini 2006). Elimination of lorazepam in the newborn infant is slow; following in utero exposure, term infants may excrete lorazepam for up to 8 days (Whitelaw 1981).

【481】Treatment for alcohol withdrawal may be considered for pregnant patients with at least moderate symptoms (CIWA-Ar scores ≥10) (ASAM 2020). The short-term use of a long-acting benzodiazepine may be used in pregnant patients requiring treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms (WHO 2014); however, the use of shorter-acting benzodiazepines is preferred in patients at risk for preterm delivery or when treatment is needed during the third trimester (ASAM 2020). Although recommendations vary by guideline, the use of a benzodiazepine other than lorazepam may be preferred during pregnancy (BAP \[McAllister-Williams 2017\]; SOGC \[Graves 2020\]; WFSBP/IAWMH \[Thibaut 2019\]). Monitor newborns for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in addition to benzodiazepine intoxication (ASAM 2020).

【482】Therapy for anxiety during pregnancy should be individualized. Untreated or inadequately treated psychiatric illness may lead to poor adherence to prenatal care and adverse pregnancy outcomes (ACOG 2008). Benzodiazepines are not preferred when pharmacologic treatment for anxiety disorders is needed during pregnancy, (BAP \[McAllister-Williams 2017\]; Larsen 2015) and when a benzodiazepine is needed, the use of lorazepam is not preferred. If possible, avoid scheduled doses of benzodiazepines in the month prior to delivery to reduce the risk of withdrawal symptoms in the newborn (Larsen 2015).

【483】Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes following exposure to lorazepam is ongoing. Health care providers are encouraged to enroll patients exposed to lorazepam during pregnancy in the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications .

【484】Monitoring Parameters

【485】Respiratory rate, blood pressure, heart rate.

【486】Long-term therapy: CBC with differential, liver function tests.

【487】High dose or continuous IV use: Clinical signs of propylene glycol toxicity, including serum creatinine, BUN, serum lactate, osmol gap.

【488】Mechanism of Action

【489】Short-to-intermediate-acting benzodiazepine (based on half-life) (Griffin 2013). Binds to stereospecific benzodiazepine receptors on the postsynaptic GABA neuron at several sites within the central nervous system, including the limbic system, reticular formation. Enhancement of the inhibitory effect of GABA on neuronal excitability results by increased neuronal membrane permeability to chloride ions. This shift in chloride ions results in hyperpolarization  and stabilization. Benzodiazepine receptors and effects appear to be linked to the GABA-A receptors. Benzodiazepines do not bind to GABA-B receptors.
