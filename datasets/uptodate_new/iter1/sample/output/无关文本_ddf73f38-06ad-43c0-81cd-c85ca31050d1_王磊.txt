【0】Patient education: Neutrophil count (The Basics)
Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this page.

【1】What is a neutrophil count? 

【2】This is a blood test that shows how many neutrophils a person has. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell. They help the immune system, or infection-fighting system, work the way it should.

【3】 If you have **too many** neutrophils, there are several possible causes. These include bacterial infection, inflammation, certain medicines, and some blood cancers. Smoking, stress, and heavy exercise can also cause high neutrophils.

【4】 If you have **too few** neutrophils, there are many possible causes. These include some infections and problems related to the immune system or bone marrow. Some medicines can also cause low neutrophils, including chemotherapy to treat cancer.

【5】Many other things can cause a high or low neutrophil count, too.

【6】A neutrophil count is done as part of a "white blood cell differential" or "complete blood count with differential." This is a test that looks at other parts of the blood, too.

【7】Why might I get a neutrophil count? 

【8】Your doctor might order this test:

【9】 As part of a routine checkup

【10】 To see if your neutrophil count is changing over time

【11】 If you have symptoms of a health problem that could cause a high or low neutrophil count

【12】How do I prepare for a neutrophil count? 

【13】For this test, you need to get a "blood draw." Your doctor or nurse will tell you where to go for this.

【14】It might help to wear a short-sleeve shirt to your blood draw appointment. This makes it easier for the person drawing your blood to get to your arm.

【15】What happens during a blood draw? 

【16】For the blood draw, a needle is used to take a small amount of blood from your arm . Collecting the blood only takes a few minutes. The blood is then tested in a lab.

【17】Tell the person who takes your blood:

【18】 If you take "blood thinner" medicines or if you have a bleeding problem – They will make sure that your bleeding is under control before you leave.

【19】 If you have a latex allergy – Some of the supplies used for blood draws might contain latex.

【20】 If you have a preferred arm to use

【21】Getting blood taken does not usually cause problems. You might have a little soreness or bruising where the needle went in.

【22】What do my results mean? 

【23】Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to expect your results, and will contact you with the results. Or if you use an online "patient portal," you might get an alert there when your results are ready.

【24】If your neutrophil count is abnormal, your doctor or nurse will talk to you about what to do next. They might need to do more tests to figure out what the cause is.

【25】If you do have a health problem, your doctor will work with you to come up with a plan for treatment.
