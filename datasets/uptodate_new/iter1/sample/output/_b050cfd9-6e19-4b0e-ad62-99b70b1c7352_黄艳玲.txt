【40】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【41】Gentian Violet can cause ulceration of mucous membranes in neonates and young infants. Case reports in infants using 1% or 2% gentian violet suggest that application for as little as 4 days may lead to ulceration, which can be masked by the purple staining. Mechanism for ulceration is unclear; it may be related to alcohol content or direct irritating effect of gentian violet. Close monitoring is recommended; some experts suggest limiting the use of gentian violet to once or twice daily and only using for a short period of time . Some products may contain alcohol (up to 10%); use caution when using on infants and children.
