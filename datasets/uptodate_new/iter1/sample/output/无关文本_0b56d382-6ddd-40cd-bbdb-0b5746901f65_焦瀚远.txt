【60】Warnings/Precautions

【61】_**Concerns related to adverse effects:**_

【62】• Differentiation syndrome: Patients treated with gilteritinib have experienced symptoms of differentiation syndrome (rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells), which can be fatal or life-threatening if not treated. Concomitant acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis has been observed in some cases. The onset of differentiation syndrome (with or without concomitant leukocytosis) ranged from 1 to 82 days after gilteritinib initiation; the majority of patients who experienced this syndrome recovered after treatment or therapy interruption. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, administer dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours (or equivalent oral/IV corticosteroid) and monitor hemodynamics until improvement. Administer corticosteroids for a minimum of 3 days; once symptoms resolve, taper corticosteroid. Differentiation syndrome symptoms may recur if corticosteroids are discontinued early. If severe signs/symptoms of differentiation syndrome continue for more than 48 hours after corticosteroid initiation, interrupt gilteritinib therapy until symptoms are no longer severe.

【63】• Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been observed.

【64】• Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis has been reported. Evaluate for signs/symptoms of pancreatitis. May require therapy interruption and dosage reduction.

【65】• Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported rarely. Symptoms included seizure and altered mental status, and have resolved after gilteritinib discontinuation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred diagnostic brain imaging; discontinue gilteritinib in patients who develop confirmed PRES.

【66】• QTc interval prolongation: Prolonged cardiac ventricular repolarization (QT interval) has been reported with gilteritinib. A small percentage of patients in a clinical trial were found to have a QTc interval >500 msec; some patients had an increase from baseline >60 msec. Obtain an ECG prior to therapy initiation, on days 8 and 15 of cycle 1, and prior to the start of the next 2 subsequent treatment cycles. Hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia may increase the risk for QTc interval prolongation; correct electrolyte abnormalities prior to (and during) gilteritinib therapy. QTc interval prolongation may require therapy interruption and dosage reduction.

【147】Reproductive Considerations

【148】Pregnancy status should be evaluated within 7 days prior to starting therapy in females of reproductive potential. Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last gilteritinib dose. Males with female partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 4 months after the last gilteritinib dose.

【149】Pregnancy Considerations

【150】Based on the mechanism of action and information from animal reproductions studies, gilteritinib may cause fetal harm following maternal use during pregnancy.

【151】Breastfeeding Considerations

【152】It is not known if gilteritinib is present in breast milk.

【153】Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer during therapy and for at least 2 months after the last gilteritinib dose.

【154】Monitoring Parameters

【155】Blood counts and serum chemistries (including creatine phosphokinase) prior to therapy initiation, at least once weekly for the first month, once every other week for the second month, and once monthly thereafter; ECG prior to therapy initiation, on days 8 and 15 of cycle 1, and prior to the start of the next 2 subsequent cycles. Pregnancy test (within 7 days prior to starting gilteritinib treatment in females of reproductive potential). Monitor for signs/symptoms of differentiation syndrome, pancreatitis, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Monitor adherence.

【156】The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management provisional clinical opinion recommends HBV screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.

【157】Mechanism of Action

【158】Gilteritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which inhibits multiple tyrosine kinases, such as FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 receptor signaling and proliferation in cells expressing FLT3 (including FLT3-ITD), tyrosine kinase domain mutations (TKD) FLT3-D835Y and FLT3-ITD-D835Y; it induces apoptosis in FLT3-ITD-expressing leukemia cells.

【159】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【160】Onset: Inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation: Rapid (within 24 hours after the initial dose)

【161】Distribution: Central: 1,092 L; Peripheral: 1,100 L

【162】Protein binding: ~94% to human plasma proteins

【163】Metabolism: Primarily hepatic via CYP3A4; primary human metabolites include M17 (formed via N-dealkylation and oxidation), M16 and M10 (both formed via N-dealkylation), none of which exceed 10% of overall parent exposure

【164】Half-life elimination: 113 hours

【165】Time to peak: ~4 to 6 hours

【166】Excretion: Feces: 64.5%; Urine: 16.4% as unchanged drug and metabolites
