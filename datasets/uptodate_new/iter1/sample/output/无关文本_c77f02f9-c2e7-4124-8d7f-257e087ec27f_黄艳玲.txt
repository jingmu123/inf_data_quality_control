【59】Warnings/Precautions

【60】_**Concerns related to adverse effects:**_

【61】• Cardiac effects: An increased the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, has been reported with another Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor when used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (not an approved use for momelotinib). Consider individual patient benefits versus cardiovascular risks prior to initiating or continuing momelotinib, particularly in patients with current (or history of) smoking or with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be aware of symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur.

【62】• Hematologic toxicity: Momelotinib may cause thrombocytopenia and neutropenia; new or worsening thrombocytopenia (platelets <50,000/mm 3 ) was observed in one-fifth of patients who received momelotinib. Some patients treated with momelotinib had baseline platelets <50,000/mm 3 . Severe neutropenia (ANC <500/mm 3 ) was observed in a small percentage of patients.

【63】• Hepatotoxicity: Cases of reversible drug-induced liver injury have been observed with momelotinib. Overall, new or worsening ALT and AST elevations (all grades) occurred in nearly one-fourth of patients and grade 3 and 4 transaminase elevations occurred in a small percentage of patients. Grade 1 or 2, new or worsening total bilirubin elevations have occurred. The median time to onset of any grade transaminase elevation was 2 months, with most cases occurring within 4 months.

【64】• Infections: Serious infections (eg, bacterial and viral, including COVID-19) have occurred with momelotinib, including fatal cases. Infections of any grade occurred in over one-third of patients. Hepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA titer) increases (with or without associated ALT or AST elevations) have been reported with JAK inhibitors (including momelotinib) in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The effect of momelotinib on viral replication in chronic HBV infection is unknown. If HBsAg and/or anti-HBc antibody is positive, consider a hepatology consultation regarding monitoring for reactivation versus prophylactic hepatitis B therapy.

【65】• Secondary malignancies: An increased risk of lymphoma and other malignancies (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) has been demonstrated with another JAK inhibitor when used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (not an approved use for momelotinib). Smoking (current or past history) increased the risk for malignancy. Consider the benefits versus individual patient risks prior to initiating or continuing momelotinib, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated nonmelanoma skin cancer) or who develop a malignancy, and patients who are current or past smokers.

【66】• Thrombosis: The risk for thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and arterial thrombosis, was increased with another JAK inhibitor when used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (not an approved use for momelotinib).

【170】Vaccines (Non-Live/Inactivated/Non-Replicating): Immunosuppressants (Miscellaneous Oncologic Agents) may diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Non-Live/Inactivated/Non-Replicating). Management: Give non-live/inactivated/non-replicating vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of immunosuppressants when possible. Patients vaccinated less than 14 days before or during therapy should be revaccinated at least 3 after therapy is complete. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【171】Voclosporin: May increase the serum concentration of OATP1B1/1B3 (SLCO1B1/1B3) Substrates (Clinically Relevant with Inhibitors). _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【172】Yellow Fever Vaccine: Immunosuppressants (Miscellaneous Oncologic Agents) may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Yellow Fever Vaccine. Specifically, the risk of vaccine-associated infection may be increased. Immunosuppressants (Miscellaneous Oncologic Agents) may diminish the therapeutic effect of Yellow Fever Vaccine. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【173】Reproductive Considerations

【174】Patients who could become pregnant should use highly effective contraception during therapy and for at least 1 week after the last momelotinib dose.

【175】Pregnancy Considerations

【176】Based on data from animal reproduction studies, in utero exposure to momelotinib may cause fetal harm.

【177】Breastfeeding Considerations

【178】It is not known if momelotinib is present in breast milk.

【179】Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer during therapy and for at least 1 week after the last momelotinib dose.

【180】Monitoring Parameters

【181】CBC with differential (baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated); hepatic function tests (baseline, every month for 6 months during treatment, then periodically as clinically indicated). Monitor for signs/symptoms of infection, cardiovascular adverse events, thrombosis, and secondary malignancies. Monitor adherence.

【182】The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management provisional clinical opinion recommends HBV screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.

【183】Momelotinib HBV monitoring: Assess hepatitis B serologies (prior to treatment initiation in patients with hepatitis B virus infection; if HBsAg and/or anti-HBc antibody is positive, consider a hepatology consultation regarding monitoring for reactivation versus prophylactic hepatitis B therapy). Monitor for signs/symptoms of hepatitis B infection (including reactivation).

【184】Mechanism of Action

【185】Momelotinib inhibits wild type Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2), and selectively inhibits activin A receptor type 1 (ACVR1). In addition to inhibiting wild type JAK1 and JAK2, momelotinib also inhibits mutant JAK2 V617F , all of which contribute to cytokine and growth factor signaling necessary for hematopoiesis and immune function. ACVR1 inhibition reduces circulating hepcidin, an iron hematopoiesis regulator, which increases availability of iron for erythropoiesis and increased RBC production . Myelofibrosis is associated with constitutive activation and dysregulated JAK signaling which contributes to inflammation and hyperactivation of ACVR1. JAK signaling recruits and activates signal transducers and activation of transcription (STAT) proteins, resulting in nuclear localization and subsequent gene transcription regulation.

【186】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【187】Onset: Maximal inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation occurred 2 hours after dosing.

【188】Duration: Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation persisted for ≥6 hours after dosing. A sustained reduction in circulating hepcidin was observed for the 24-week treatment period.

【189】Distribution: V dss : 984 L.

【190】Protein binding: ~91% (healthy volunteers).

【191】Metabolism: Momelotinib is extensively metabolized via multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP3A4 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , and CYP1A2 . M21 is an active human metabolite (formed by CYP followed by aldehyde oxidase metabolism of momelotinib) with ~40% of the pharmacologic activity of momelotinib.

【192】Half-life elimination: Momelotinib and M21 (active metabolite): 4 to 8 hours.

【193】Time to peak: 2 hours.

【194】Excretion: Feces: 69% ; urine: 28% (<1% as unchanged drug; ~12% as the active metabolite M21).

【195】Clearance: 103 L/hour.

【196】Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【197】Hepatic function impairment: Momelotinib C max and AUC are increased by 13% and 97%, respectively, in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Turcotte-Pugh class C); the M21 (active) metabolite C max and AUC are decreased by 76% and 48%, respectively, in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Turcotte-Pugh class C).黄艳玲
