【51】Warnings/Precautions

【52】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【53】• Bleaching effects: Benzoyl peroxide may bleach hair, colored fabric, or carpeting.

【54】• Diarrhea: Systemic absorption may occur after topical use of clindamycin. _C. difficile_ \-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported and have been observed >2 months postantibiotic treatment. Use of parenteral and systemic clindamycin has resulted in severe colitis (including fatalities). Discontinue drug if significant diarrhea, abdominal cramps, or passage of blood and mucus occurs.

【55】• Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis and allergic reactions have been reported, may occur within minutes to a day or longer, and differ from local skin irritation.

【56】• Skin irritation: Use concomitant topical acne therapy with caution; cumulative irritancy may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents.

【57】**_Concurrent drug therapy issues:_**

【58】• Sulfone products: Concomitant use of benzoyl peroxide with sulfone products (eg, dapsone, sulfacetamide) may cause temporary discoloration (yellow/orange) of facial hair and skin. Application of products at separate times during the day or washing off benzoyl peroxide prior to application of other products may avoid skin discoloration (Dubina 2009).

【59】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【60】• Appropriate use: For external use only; not for vaginal or ophthalmic use. Avoid contact with mucous membranes. Inform patients to use skin protection and minimize prolonged exposure to sun and avoid tanning beds or sun lamps.

【106】Drug Interactions  

【107】**Note** : Interacting drugs may **not be individually listed below** if they are part of a group interaction (eg, individual drugs within “CYP3A4 Inducers \[Strong\]” are NOT listed). For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program by clicking on the “Launch drug interactions program” link above.

【108】Aminolevulinic Acid (Systemic): Photosensitizing Agents may enhance the photosensitizing effect of Aminolevulinic Acid (Systemic). _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【109】Aminolevulinic Acid (Topical): Photosensitizing Agents may enhance the photosensitizing effect of Aminolevulinic Acid (Topical). _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【110】Dapsone (Topical): Benzoyl Peroxide may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Dapsone (Topical). Specifically, the use of these agents in combination may cause skin and facial hair to temporarily turn a tan or yellow/orange color. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【111】Erythromycin (Systemic): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Clindamycin (Topical). Management: Consider avoiding the concomitant use of systemic erythromycin and topical clindamycin when treating acne vulgaris. This recommendation does not appear to apply to intravaginal use of clindamycin for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【112】Erythromycin (Topical): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Clindamycin (Topical). Management: Consider avoiding use of topical erythromycin and topical clindamycin at the same application site when treating acne vulgaris. This recommendation does not appear to apply to intravaginal use of clindamycin for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【113】Methoxsalen (Systemic): Photosensitizing Agents may enhance the photosensitizing effect of Methoxsalen (Systemic). _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【114】Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents: Clindamycin (Topical) may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking effect of Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【115】Porfimer: Photosensitizing Agents may enhance the photosensitizing effect of Porfimer. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【116】Verteporfin: Photosensitizing Agents may enhance the photosensitizing effect of Verteporfin. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【117】Pregnancy Considerations

【118】Topical therapy is preferred for the treatment of acne during pregnancy. The combination of topical clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide is recommended for mild to moderate inflammatory acne in pregnant women (Chien 2016).

【119】Breastfeeding Considerations

【120】It is not known if clindamycin or benzoyl peroxide are present in breast milk following topical administration.

【121】According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and the benefits of treatment to the mother. Avoid direct infant contact with treated skin.

【122】Mechanism of Action

【123】Benzoyl peroxide: Releases free-radical oxygen, which oxidizes bacterial proteins in the sebaceous follicles, decreasing the number of anaerobic bacteria and decreasing irritating-type free fatty acids.

【124】Clindamycin: Reversibly binds to 50S ribosomal subunits preventing peptide bond formation thus inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis; bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending on drug concentration, infection site, and organism.
