【182】Pregnancy Considerations

【183】Uncontrolled asthma is associated with adverse events in pregnancy (increased risk of perinatal mortality, preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight infants, cesarean delivery, and the development of gestational diabetes). Poorly controlled asthma or asthma exacerbations may have a greater fetal/maternal risk than what is associated with appropriately used asthma medications. Maternal treatment improves pregnancy outcomes by reducing the risk of some adverse events (eg, preterm birth, gestational diabetes) (ERS/TSANZ \[Middleton 2020\]; GINA 2023).

【184】Although data related to tiotropium use in pregnancy are limited, use is likely acceptable. Maternal asthma symptoms should be monitored monthly during pregnancy (ERS/TSANZ \[Middleton 2020\]).

【185】Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes associated with asthma and the medications used to treat asthma in pregnancy is ongoing. Health care providers are encouraged to enroll exposed pregnant patients in the MotherToBaby Pregnancy Studies conducted by the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists . Patients may also enroll themselves.

【186】Monitoring Parameters

【187】FEV 1 , peak flow (or other pulmonary function studies); anticholinergic adverse reactions (patients with CrCl <60 mL/minute).

【188】Mechanism of Action

【189】Competitively and reversibly inhibits the action of acetylcholine at type 3 muscarinic (M 3 ) receptors in bronchial smooth muscle causing bronchodilation

【190】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【191】Absorption: Poorly absorbed from GI tract, systemic absorption may occur from lung

【192】Distribution: V d : 32 L/kg

【193】Protein binding: 72%

【194】Metabolism: Hepatic (minimal), via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4

【195】Bioavailability: Following inhalation, 19.5% (dry powder inhaler) or ~33% (soft-mist inhaler); Oral solution: 2% to 3%

【196】Half-life elimination:

【197】Dry powder inhaler: COPD: ~25 hours

【198】Soft-mist inhaler: Asthma: 44 hours; COPD: 25 hours
