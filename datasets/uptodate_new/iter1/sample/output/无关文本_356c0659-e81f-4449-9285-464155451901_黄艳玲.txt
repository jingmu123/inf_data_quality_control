【0】Patient education: Finger fracture (The Basics)
Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this page.

【1】What is a finger fracture? 

【2】A "fracture" is another word for a broken bone. The finger bones are also called the "phalanges" .

【3】There are different types of fractures, depending on which bone breaks and how it breaks. When a bone breaks, it might crack, break all of the way through, or shatter.

【4】Fractured fingers can happen if a finger is hit, twisted, or bent too far.

【5】What are the symptoms of a finger fracture? 

【6】Symptoms depend on which bone breaks and the kind of break it is. Common symptoms can include:

【7】 Pain, swelling, or bruising over the area

【8】 Finger looks bent in an abnormal position or is not the usual shape

【9】 Not being able to bend or move the finger

【10】 Trouble making a fist or grasping things with the fingers

【11】 Numbness in the area of the broken bone

【12】Is there a test for a finger fracture? 

【13】. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms, do an exam, and do an X-ray. They might do other imaging tests, such as a CT, MRI, or ultrasound. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.

【14】How are finger fractures treated? 

【15】Treatment depends, in part, on the type of finger fracture you have and how severe it is. The goal of treatment is to have the ends of the broken bone line up with each other so that the bone can heal.

【16】If the ends of the broken bone are already in line with each other, finger fractures are usually treated with a splint, "buddy taping," or both. Buddy taping involves taping your injured finger to the finger next to it .

【17】If the ends of your broken bone are not in line with each other, the doctor will need to line them up:

【18】 Sometimes, the doctor can move the bone to the correct position without doing surgery, and then put a splint on or buddy tape your fingers. This is called "closed fracture reduction."

【19】 A severe finger fracture, in which a joint is damaged or the bones do not stay in position, is treated with surgery. During surgery, the doctor puts the finger bone back in position. To do this, they can use screws, pins, rods, or plates to fix the bones inside the finger. This is called "open fracture reduction."

【20】How long do finger fractures take to heal? 

【21】Most finger fractures take weeks to months to heal, depending on the type of fracture. The doctor or nurse will talk to you about when to return to things like work, sports, or other activities.

【22】Healing time also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal much more quickly than older adults or adults with other medical problems.

【23】How do I care for myself at home? 

【24】To care for yourself or your child at home:

【25】 Follow the doctor's instructions for wearing the splint or buddy taping the finger. This supports and protects the bone as it heals.

【26】 Follow instructions for limiting activity and movement until the bone is healed. The doctor or nurse will tell you what activities are safe to do.

【27】 Prop the injured hand on pillows, keeping it above the level of the heart. This might help lessen pain and swelling.

【28】 The doctor might recommend an over-the-counter pain medicine. These include acetaminophen (sample brand name: Tylenol), ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (sample brand name: Aleve).

【29】 Some people get a prescription for stronger pain medicines to take for a short time. Follow the instructions for taking these medicines.

【30】 Ice can help with pain and swelling:

【31】• Put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the injured area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin.

【32】• Use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after your injury. Some people find it helpful to ice longer, even up to 2 days after their injury.

【33】 Eat a healthy diet that includes plenty of calcium, vitamin D, and protein .

【34】 If you smoke, try to quit. Broken bones take longer to heal if you smoke.

【35】 You might need to work with a physical therapist (exercise expert) after your fracture heals. The physical therapist will show you exercises and stretches to strengthen the hand and finger muscles and keep them from getting stiff.

【36】When should I call the doctor? 

【37】Call for advice if:

【38】 There is less feeling or movement in your fingers.

【39】 The finger becomes swollen or starts to hurt more.

【40】 The splint becomes too tight and uncomfortable.

【41】 The fingers are numb or tingly, or turn pale, blue, or gray.
