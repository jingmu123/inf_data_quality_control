【11】**Myasthenia gravis, treatment:** _Canadian labeling:_

【12】**Oral:** Initial: 15 mg administered 3 times daily. Usual daily dose: 150 mg/day in divided doses; interval between doses should be adjusted per patient response with larger doses provided at times of most fatigue. Usual daily dosage range: 15 to 375 mg/day.

【13】Reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade after surgery

【14】**Reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade after surgery:**

【15】**Note** **:** An anticholinergic agent (atropine or glycopyrrolate) should be given intravenously prior to (if patient is bradycardic) or in conjunction with neostigmine (to prevent bradycardia and GI symptoms). Avoid use or use with caution in patients with certain neuromuscular diseases (eg, myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy); other agents may be preferred (eg, sugammadex); if neostigmine is used, reduced dosing may be required with titration based on train-of-four (TOF) monitoring . TOF monitoring should be used to determine time of neostigmine initiation and need for additional doses. Dosing may vary depending on patient specific factors (eg, depth of paralysis, type of anesthesia, organ dysfunction, age, acid-base status) . Refer to institutional protocols and policies.

【16】_Usual dose:_ **IV:** 0.02 to 0.07 mg/kg; generally achieves a TOF twitch ratio of 90% within 10 to 20 minutes of administration; maximum total dose: 0.07 mg/kg or 5 mg (whichever is less) .

【17】_Dose selection based on TOF count at end of surgery_ :

【18】TOF count 1 or no TOF response: Delay reversal until TOF count ≥2.

【19】TOF count 2 or 3: 0.07 mg/kg; allow at least 15 to 30 minutes before tracheal extubation.

【20】TOF count 4 with observable fade: 0.04 to 0.05 mg/kg; allow at least 10 to 15 minutes before tracheal extubation.

【21】TOF count 4 with no observable fade: 0.02 mg/kg.

【22】Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction

【23】**Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie syndrome) (off-label use): Note:** Continuous cardiac monitoring with clinical assessment for 30 minutes after administration. Atropine should be available at the bedside if bradyarrhythmia occurs .

【42】Myasthenia gravis

【43】**Myasthenia gravis:** Limited data available:

【44】_Diagnosis:_ **Note:** Pretreatment with atropine is recommended, and atropine should be available. IV fluids also recommended. Children <2 years: IM: 0.04 mg/kg once; if results equivocal or negative, may be repeated once in 4 hours. Typical dose is 0.5 to 1.5 mg 

【45】_Treatment:_ **Note:** Dosage requirements are variable; dosage should be individualized: Children and Adolescents:

【46】Oral: 0.3 to 2 mg/kg/day in divided doses 

【47】IM, IV, SubQ: 0.01 to 0.04 mg/kg every 2 to 6 hours 

【48】Reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade after surgery

【49】**Reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade after surgery:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV:

【50】Manufacturer labeling: Bloxiverz: **Note:** An anticholinergic agent (atropine or glycopyrrolate) should be given prior to or in conjunction with neostigmine; in the presence of bradycardia, administer the anticholinergic prior to neostigmine. Peripheral nerve stimulation delivering train-of-four (TOF) stimulus must also be used to determine time of neostigmine initiation and need for additional doses.

【51】_Usual dose:_ 0.03 to 0.07 mg/kg generally achieves a TOF twitch ratio of 90% within 10 to 20 minutes of administration; maximum total dose: 0.07 mg/kg or 5 mg (whichever is less)

【52】_Dose selection guide:_

【53】The 0.03 mg/kg dose is recommended for reversal of NMBAs with shorter half-lives (eg, rocuronium); or when the first twitch response to the TOF stimulus is substantially >10% of baseline or when a second twitch is present.

【54】The 0.07 mg/kg dose is recommended for NMBAs with longer half-lives (eg, vecuronium, pancuronium); or when the first twitch response is relatively weak (ie, not substantially >10% of baseline); or rapid recovery is needed.

【80】Warnings/Precautions

【81】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【82】• Cardiovascular effects: Bradycardia, hypotension, and dysrhythmias may occur, particularly with IV use; risk may be increased in patients with certain cardiovascular conditions (eg, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute coronary syndrome). Risk may also be increased in patients with myasthenia gravis. When IV neostigmine is administered for the reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agents, atropine or glycopyrrolate should be administered concurrently or prior to neostigmine to lessen the risk of bradycardia.

【83】• Cholinergic crisis: Overdosage may result in cholinergic crisis, characterized by extreme muscle weakness and potentially fatal respiratory paralysis. Cholinergic crisis should be distinguished from myasthenic crisis, which is also characterized by extreme muscle weakness, but would require radically different treatment.

【84】• Hypersensitivity reactions: Symptoms of hypersensitivity have included anaphylaxis, angioedema, bradycardia, bronchospasm, erythema multiforme, facial swelling, flushing, generalized rash, hypotension, peripheral edema, pyrexia, and urticaria. Have atropine and epinephrine ready to treat hypersensitivity reactions.

【85】• Neuromuscular effects: Large doses of IV neostigmine administered for the reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agents when neuromuscular blockade is minimal can result in neuromuscular dysfunction. Reduce dose if recovery from neuromuscular blockade is nearly complete.

【86】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【87】• Asthma: Use with caution in patients with asthma.

【88】• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, or recent acute coronary syndrome.

【89】• Hyperthyroidism: Use with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism.

【90】• Megacolon/GI dysfunction: Large oral doses should be avoided with megacolon or decreased GI motility. Neostigmine may accumulate; toxicity may result when motility is restored.

【91】• Neuromuscular diseases: For reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade, avoid use or use with caution in patients with certain neuromuscular diseases (eg, myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy); other agents may be preferred (eg, sugammadex); if used, reduced dosing may be required with titration based on train-of-four monitoring . Adequate facilities should be available for cardiopulmonary resuscitation when testing and adjusting dose for myasthenia gravis.

【92】• Peptic ulcer disease: Use with caution in patients with peptic ulcer disease.

【93】• Seizure disorder: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy.

【94】• Vagotonia: Use with caution in patients with vagotonia.

【95】**_Special populations:_**

【96】• Pediatric: When used IV for the reversal of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, pediatric and adult dosing is similar. However, recovery may be more rapid and risk of complications may be greater in infants and small children. Monitor closely.

【97】• Older adult: Use with caution and monitor for a longer period. Elderly patients experience slower spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular blocking agents.

【180】It is not known if neostigmine is present in breast milk.

【181】According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and the benefits of treatment to the mother.

【182】Monitoring Parameters

【183】ECG, blood pressure, and heart rate especially with IV use; train-of-four monitoring; consult individual institutional policies and procedures.

【184】Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (off-label use): Keep patient supine upon administration. Patient should receive continuous ECG monitoring with clinical assessment for 30 minutes after administration (Saunders 2005).

【185】Mechanism of Action
