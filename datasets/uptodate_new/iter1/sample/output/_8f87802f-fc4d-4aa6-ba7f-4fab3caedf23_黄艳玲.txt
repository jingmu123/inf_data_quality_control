【66】Warnings/Precautions

【67】_**Concerns related to adverse effects:**_

【68】• Dermatologic toxicity: Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens Johnson syndrome (which may be severe, life-threatening, or fatal) may occur rarely. Signs/symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions include target lesions, worsening skin reactions, skin blistering/peeling, painful sores in the mouth, nose, throat, or genital area, fever/flu-like symptoms, and/or swollen lymph nodes.

【69】• Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage occurred in over one-half of patients with cervical cancer who received tisotumab vedotin. The most common hemorrhagic adverse reaction (all grades) was epistaxis. Grade 3 hemorrhage occurred in a small percentage of patients. The median time to onset of hemorrhage was 0.3 months (range: up to 10.4 months). Of the patients who experienced hemorrhage, a majority had complete resolution and some experienced partial resolution (defined as a decrease in severity by one or more grades from the worst grade) at last follow-up.

【70】• Ocular toxicity: Tisotumab vedotin may cause severe ocular adverse reactions, including conjunctivitis, keratopathy (keratitis, punctate keratitis, and ulcerative keratitis), and dry eye (increased lacrimation, eye pain, eye discharge, pruritus, irritation, and foreign body sensation) which may lead to changes in vision and/or corneal ulceration. Ocular adverse reactions occurred in over half of patients with cervical cancer treated with tisotumab vedotin in clinical studies. The most common ocular adverse reactions were conjunctivitis, dry eye, keratopathy, and blepharitis. Grade 3 ocular adverse reactions occurred in a small percentage of patients, including cases of severe ulcerative keratitis, ulcerative keratitis (including one with perforation requiring corneal transplantation), conjunctival ulcer, corneal erosion, conjunctival erosion, and symblepharon. The median time to onset of the first ocular adverse reaction was 1.2 months (range: up to 17.1 months). Of the patients who experienced ocular events, over half experienced complete resolution and nearly one-third experienced partial improvement (defined as a decrease in severity by one or more grades from the worst grade) at last follow-up. Some patients required permanent discontinuation of tisotumab vedotin due to ocular adverse events. Delayed ocular adverse events (eg, ulcerative keratitis, keratitis, punctate keratitis, corneal erosion, blepharitis, conjunctival hyperemia, conjunctival scar, and conjunctivitis and xerophthalmia) have also been reported more than 30 days after discontinuation of therapy.

【71】• Peripheral neuropathy: Peripheral neuropathy occurred in over one-third of patients with cervical cancer who received tisotumab vedotin; grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was reported. Peripheral neuropathy adverse reactions included peripheral sensory neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, muscular weakness, and peripheral motor neuropathy. A case of Guillain-Barre syndrome developed in a patient with a different tumor type (not cervical cancer) who received tisotumab vedotin at the recommended dose. The median time to onset of peripheral neuropathy was 2.4 months (range: up to ~11 months). Of the patients who developed peripheral neuropathy, some patients experienced complete resolution or partial improvement (defined as a decrease in severity by one or more grades from the worst grade) at last follow-up.

【72】• Pulmonary toxicity: Severe, life-threatening, or fatal pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with antibody drug conjugates containing vedotin, including tisotumab vedotin. Among patients with cervical cancer treated who received tisotumab vedotin, a small percentage experienced pneumonitis, including a fatal case. Pulmonary symptoms indicative of pneumonitis may include hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams.

【73】_**Special populations:**_

【74】• Older age: Patients ≥65 years of age experienced a higher incidence of ≥ grade 3 adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions (compared to patients <65 years of age).

【108】Efgartigimod Alfa: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Fc Receptor-Binding Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【109】Fexinidazole: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors). _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【110】Fusidic Acid (Systemic): May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors). Management: Consider avoiding this combination if possible. If required, monitor patients closely for increased adverse effects of the CYP3A4 substrate. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【111】Rozanolixizumab: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Fc Receptor-Binding Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【112】Reproductive Considerations

【113】Verify pregnancy status prior to treatment initiation.

【114】Patients who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy and for 2 months after the last tisotumab vedotin dose. Patients with partners who could become pregnant should also use effective contraception during therapy and for 4 months after the last dose of tisotumab vedotin.

【115】Pregnancy Considerations

【116】Based on the mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, in utero exposure to tisotumab vedotin may cause fetal harm.

【117】Breastfeeding Considerations

【118】It is not known if tisotumab vedotin is present in breast milk.

【119】Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer during therapy and for 3 weeks after the last tisotumab vedotin dose.

【120】Monitoring Parameters

【121】Ophthalmic exam (including visual acuity, slit lamp exam of the anterior segment of the eye, and assessment of normal eye movement, as well as ocular signs/symptoms including dry or irritated eyes, eye secretions or blurry vision) at baseline, prior to every cycle for the first nine cycles, and as clinically indicated. Verify pregnancy status prior to treatment initiation (in patients who could become pregnant). Monitor patients for signs/symptoms of hemorrhage, neuropathy (eg, paresthesia, tingling or a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, muscle weakness, or dysesthesia), ocular toxicity, cutaneous adverse reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and/or target lesions, worsening skin reactions, skin blistering/peeling, painful sores in the mouth, nose, throat, or genital area, fever/flu-like symptoms, and/or swollen lymph nodes), and for pulmonary symptoms indicative of pneumonitis (eg, hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams); exclude infectious, neoplastic, and other causes for pulmonary symptoms via appropriate investigations.

【122】The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management provisional clinical opinion recommends HBV screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.

【123】Mechanism of Action

【124】Tisotumab vedotin is a tissue factor (TF)-directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of an anti-TF IgG1-kappa antibody conjugated to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), via a protease-cleavable valine-citrulline linker. The antibody is directed against cell surface TF, which is the primary initiator of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade. Tisotumab vedotin’s anticancer activity is likely due to the ADC binding to TF expressing cancer cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-TF complex, and release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage. MMAE disrupts the microtubule network of actively dividing cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Tisotumab vedotin also mediates antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

【125】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【126】Duration: Median duration of response: 8.3 months.

【127】Distribution: Tisotumab vedotin: V dss : 7.83 L.

【128】Protein binding: Microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE): 68% to 82%.

【129】Metabolism: Tisotumab vedotin is expected to undergo catabolism to small peptides, amino acids, unconjugated MMAE, and unconjugated MMAE-related metabolites; tisotumab vedotin releases unconjugated MMAE via proteolytic cleavage, and unconjugated MMAE is primarily metabolized via CYP3A4.

【130】Half-life elimination: Tisotumab vedotin: ~4 days; unconjugated MMAE: ~2.5 days.

【131】Time to peak: Tisotumab vedotin: Near the end of the infusion; unconjugated MMAE: 2 to 3 days after the tisotumab vedotin dose.

【132】Excretion: Clearance: Tisotumab vedotin: 1.54 L/day; unconjugated MMAE: ~46 L/day.

【133】Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【134】Hepatic function impairment: Although there were no clinically significant differences in tisotumab vedotin exposure, unconjugated microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E exposures were 37% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST or bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN), compared to patients with normal hepatic function.黄艳玲
