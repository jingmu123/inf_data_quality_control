【3】ALERT: US Boxed Warning

【4】Toxicity:

【5】The risk of severe neurotoxic reactions is sharply increased in patients with impaired renal function or prerenal azotemia. These include disturbances of vestibular and cochlear function, optic nerve dysfunction, peripheral neuritis, arachnoiditis, and encephalopathy. The incidence of clinically detectable, irreversible vestibular damage is particularly high in patients treated with streptomycin.

【6】Renal function should be monitored carefully; patients with renal impairment and/or nitrogen retention should receive reduced doses. The peak serum concentration in individuals with kidney damage should not exceed 20 to 25 mcg/mL.

【7】The concurrent or sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs with streptomycin, including neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, cephaloridine, paromomycin, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, tobramycin, and cyclosporine should be avoided.

【8】The neurotoxicity of streptomycin can result in respiratory paralysis from neuromuscular blockage, especially when the drug is given soon after the use of anesthesia or muscle relaxants.

【9】The administration of streptomycin in parenteral form should be reserved for patients where adequate laboratory and audiometric testing facilities are available during therapy.

【119】Warnings/Precautions

【120】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【121】• Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis: **\[US Boxed Warning\]: May cause neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis; especially when given soon after anesthesia or muscle relaxants.**

【122】• Neurotoxicity: **\[US Boxed Warning\]: May cause neurotoxicity, including disturbances of vestibular and cochlear function, optic nerve dysfunction, peripheral neuritis, arachnoiditis, and encephalopathy;** usual risk factors include pre-existing renal impairment, concomitant neuro-/nephrotoxic medications. Ototoxicity is proportional to the amount of drug given and the duration of treatment. Tinnitus or vertigo may be indications of vestibular injury and impending bilateral irreversible damage. Baseline and periodic caloric stimulation and audiometric tests are recommended with prolonged therapy. Discontinue treatment if signs of ototoxicity occur.

【123】• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including _C. difficile_ \-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed >2 months postantibiotic treatment.

【124】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【125】• Hearing impairment: Use with caution in patients with pre-existing vertigo, tinnitus, or hearing loss.

【126】• Neuromuscular disorders: Use with caution in patients with neuromuscular disorders, including myasthenia gravis.

【127】• Renal impairment: **\[US Boxed Warning\]: May cause nephrotoxicity.** Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; dose adjustment necessary in patients with renal impairment and/or nitrogen retention. Monitor renal function closely; peak serum concentrations should not surpass 20 to 25 mcg/mL in patients with renal impairment.

【128】**_Special populations:_**

【129】• Patients with genomic variants in _MT-RNR1_ : Carriers of certain variants in the _MT-RNR1_ gene (eg, m.1555A>G) may be at increased risk for aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity, including potentially significant hearing loss that may be irreversible, even when serum levels are within the normal range.

【130】**_Concurrent drug therapy issues:_**

【131】• Neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs: **\[US Boxed Warning\]: Avoid concomitant or sequential use with other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs (eg, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, paromomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, tobramycin, cyclosporine).**

【132】**_Dosage form specific issues:_**

【133】• Sulfite sensitivity: Some formulations may contain sodium metabisulfite; may cause allergic reactions including anaphylaxis or asthma exacerbations (some life-threatening) in susceptible patients.

【134】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【135】• Appropriate use: **\[US Boxed Warning\]: Parenteral form should be used only where appropriate audiometric and laboratory testing facilities are available.** IM injections should be administered in a large muscle well within the body to avoid peripheral nerve damage and local skin reactions.

【206】Typhoid Vaccine: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Typhoid Vaccine. Only the live attenuated Ty21a strain is affected. Management: Avoid use of live attenuated typhoid vaccine (Ty21a) in patients being treated with systemic antibacterial agents. Postpone vaccination until 3 days after cessation of antibiotics and avoid starting antibiotics within 3 days of last vaccine dose. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【207】Vancomycin: May enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Aminoglycosides. Vancomycin may enhance the neurotoxic effect of Aminoglycosides. Management: Consider avoiding coadministration of aminoglycosides and vancomycin unless clinically indicated. If coadministered, monitor closely for signs of nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【208】Reproductive Considerations

【209】Evaluate pregnancy status prior to treatment of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in patients who could become pregnant. Patients who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during treatment for multidrug resistant tuberculosis (Esmail 2018).

【210】Pregnancy Considerations

【211】Streptomycin crosses the placenta.

【212】Streptomycin may cause fetal harm if administered to a pregnant patient. There are multiple reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy.

【213】Streptomycin is approved for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). TB disease (active TB) is associated with adverse fetal outcomes including intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, preterm birth, and perinatal death  as well as adverse maternal outcomes, including increased risks for anemia and cesarean delivery. Placental transmission may rarely occur with active maternal disease (Miele 2020). The treatment of multidrug resistant TB in pregnant patients should be individualized; evidence to support a specific regimen is not available (ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA \[Nahid 2019\]; WHO 2020). When second-line agents are needed for the treatment of multidrug resistant TB during pregnancy, aminoglycosides should be avoided when alternative agents are effective (ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA \[Nahid 2019\]). Streptomycin is not the preferred agent when an aminoglycoside is required for the treatment of TB during pregnancy (HHS \[OI adult 2019\]).

【214】Untreated plague ( _Yersinia pestis_ ) infection in pregnant patients may result in hemorrhage (including postpartum hemorrhage), maternal and fetal death, preterm birth, and stillbirth. Limited data suggest maternal-fetal transmission of _Y. pestis_ can occur if not treated. Pregnant patients should be treated for _Y. pestis;_ parenteral antibiotics are preferred for initial treatment when otherwise appropriate. Streptomycin is an alternative aminoglycoside recommended for use (in combination with a fluroquinolone) for treating pregnant patients with bubonic, pharyngeal, pneumonic, or septicemic plague (CDC \[Nelson 2021\]).

【215】Monitoring Parameters

【216】Baseline and periodic hearing tests (audiograms), clinical assessment for vertigo and tinnitus, BUN, SCr, serum electrolytes, fluid balance and urine output (at least monthly or more frequently if adverse effects occur); serum drug concentrations should be monitored in all patients (ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA \[Nahid 2019\]).

【217】**Note:** Data are limited with respect to streptomycin target concentrations, and sampling times and target concentrations provided reflect general practice. Patient-specific factors, including type and site of infection, goals of therapy, severity of illness, clinical status, fluid status, and kidney function should be considered when determining patient-specific therapeutic monitoring plans and targets. For treatment of gram-negative bacteria, outcomes are predicted by serum concentrations and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the infecting organism; efficacy has been associated with peak:MIC ratios of >12 (Schaaf 2015). With aminoglycoside therapy, nephrotoxicity is associated with elevated trough concentrations .

【218】_General bacterial infection:_ Targets: Peak: 20 to 30 mg/L; Trough: <5 mg/L (Edson 1991).

【219】_Mycobacterial disease:_ **Note** : Exact pharmacokinetic/dynamic targets are unknown for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and other mycobacteria.

【220】Peak target (C max ): 35 to 45 mg/L for once-daily therapy and 65 to 80 mg/L for twice-weekly therapy. These targets are for the end of the infusion for IV therapy or 1 hour post injection for IM therapy; generally obtain sample later (eg, 2 hours after start of IV infusion) to allow for distribution and then back-extrapolate to true C max . Lower peak concentrations of 20 to 35 mg/L for non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease have also been suggested (BTS \[Haworth 2017\]; CFF/ECFS \[Floto 2016\]).

【221】Trough target: <5 to 10 mg/L (BTS \[Haworth 2017\]; CFF/ECFS \[Floto 2016\]).

【222】Mechanism of Action

【223】Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding directly to the 30S ribosomal subunits causing faulty peptide sequence to form in the protein chain

【224】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【225】Absorption: Oral: Poorly absorbed; IM: Well absorbed.

【226】Distribution: Distributes into most body tissues and fluids except the brain; small amounts enter the cerebrospinal fluid only with inflamed meninges.

【238】Excretion: Urine ; small amount  excreted in bile, saliva, sweat, and tears.

【239】Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【240】Anti-infective considerations:

【241】_Parameters associated with efficacy:_ Gram-negative bacilli: Concentration dependent; associated with C max (peak)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), goal: ≥8 to 10  **or** AUC 24 /MIC, goal: 30 to 50 (mild/moderate infection, patients who are immunocompetent) or 80 to 100 (severe infection) .

【242】Expected drug exposure in normal renal function:

【243】C max (peak): Adults:

【244】IV: 14 mg/kg (range: 11 to 25 mg/kg) : 43.6 mg/L (range: 9 to 107 mg/L) (Zhu 2001).

【245】IM: 18 mg/kg (range: 10 to 23 mg/kg): 42.6 mg/L (range: 2.9 to 85.2 mg/L) (Zhu 2001).

【246】IM: 1 g: 25 to 50 mg/L (manufacturer's labeling).

【247】AUC 24 : Adults:

【248】IV: 14 mg/kg (range: 11 to 25 mg/kg) : 284 mg•hour/L (range: 124 to 680 mg•hour/L) (Zhu 2001).

【249】IM: 18 mg/kg (range: 10 to 23 mg/kg): 264 mg•hour/L (range: 175 to 343 mg•hour/L) (Zhu 2001).

【250】_Parameters associated with toxicity:_ Nephrotoxicity is associated with high C min (trough) aminoglycoside concentrations leading to renal accumulation .

【251】_Postantibiotic effect:_ Bacterial killing continues after streptomycin concentration falls below the MIC of targeted pathogen and varies significantly based on the organism, duration of antimicrobial exposure, streptomycin concentration, and concomitant antimicrobial therapy:

【252】_E. faecalis/E. faecium_ (alone or in combination with ampicillin or vancomycin): ~0 to 2 hours .

【253】_Mycobacterium tuberculosis:_ 32.2 hours (range: 0.7 to 60.2 hours) (Chan 2001).
