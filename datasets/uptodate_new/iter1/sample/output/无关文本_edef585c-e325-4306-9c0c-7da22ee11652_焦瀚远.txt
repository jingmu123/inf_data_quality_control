【57】Warnings/Precautions

【58】_**Concerns related to adverse effects:**_

【59】• GI toxicity: Immune-mediated colitis has occurred, including severe and acute-onset cases requiring hospitalization and/or surgery. The onset of symptoms (eg, new or persistent diarrhea, other GI symptoms) ranged from a few weeks to years. Systemic corticosteroids were required in the majority of patients with colitis.

【60】• Immunoglobulin reduction: Decrease in immunoglobulin levels may occur with use. Obtain quantitative serum immunoglobulins prior to therapy initiation; consult immunology experts prior to initiation for patients with low serum immunoglobulins. Monitor quantitative serum immunoglobulins during treatment, especially in patients with opportunistic or recurrent infections, and after discontinuation of therapy until B-cell repletion.

【61】• Infection: Serious, including life-threatening or fatal, bacterial viral, parasitic, and fungal infections may occur during and/or following therapy. Assess for infections prior to treatment initiation, and screen for latent infections (eg, hepatitis, tuberculosis) in high-risk populations or in countries with a high tuberculosis burden. For patients who screen positive for latent infections, consult infectious disease or other specialists (eg, liver specialists) regarding treatment options before initiating therapy (AAN \[Farez 2019\]). In clinical studies, a slightly higher incidence of infections was reported in patients receiving ocrelizumab, compared to patients receiving the comparator drug or placebo. Over half of patients who received ocrelizumab experienced one or more infections. In multiple sclerosis patients, ocrelizumab is associated with an increased risk for respiratory tract infections (upper and lower), skin infections, and herpes-related infections, although was not associated with an increased risk of serious infections. Respiratory tract infections were predominantly mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis.

【62】\- Hepatitis B reactivation: Screen for hepatitis B virus in all patients (HBsAg and anti-HBc measurements) prior to treatment initiation. Postmarketing reports of hepatitis B reactivation in MS patients treated with ocrelizumab have been reported. Fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death caused by HBV reactivation have occurred in patients treated with other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.

【63】\- Herpes infection: In clinical studies, herpes infections (herpes zoster, herpes simplex, oral herpes, genital herpes, and herpes virus infection) were reported more frequently in patients who received ocrelizumab compared to patients who received comparator drug and oral herpes was reported more frequently with ocrelizumab than with placebo. Infections were predominantly mild to moderate in severity. Serious (some life-threatening) cases of herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus, including CNS infections (eg, encephalitis, meningitis), intraocular infections, and disseminated skin and soft tissue infections, have been reported. Serious herpes virus infections may occur at any time during treatment.

【64】• Infusion reactions: Ocrelizumab may cause infusion reactions; symptoms include pruritus, rash, urticaria, erythema, bronchospasm, throat irritation, oropharyngeal pain, dyspnea, pharyngeal or laryngeal edema, flushing, hypotension, pyrexia, fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, tachycardia, and anaphylaxis. The incidence of infusion reactions in patients who received methylprednisolone (or an equivalent steroid) and potentially other pre-medication to reduce the risk of infusion reactions prior to each infusion was 34% to 40% in multiple sclerosis studies; the highest incidence was with the first infusion. There were no fatal infusion reactions, although serious infusion reactions occurred (rarely), some reactions required hospitalization. Monitor for infusion reactions during the infusion and for at least one hour after the end of the infusion. Infusion reactions can occur up to 24 hours after the infusion. Administer premedications (methylprednisolone \[or equivalent\] and an antihistamine, with or without acetaminophen) to reduce the frequency and severity of infusion reactions. Depending on the severity of the reaction, infusion reaction may require infusion interruption, decreased infusion rate, or discontinuation; may also require symptomatic supportive management.

【65】• Malignancy: Ocrelizumab may be associated with an increased risk of malignancy. Malignancies (including breast cancer) occurred more frequently in ocrelizumab-treated patients in clinical studies. Breast cancer occurred in 0.8% of females who received ocrelizumab and none of the females who received the comparator drug or placebo. Patients should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines.

【66】• Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported. PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus and usually leads to death or severe disability. PML typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised; however, patients who developed PML while taking ocrelizumab had no identifiable systemic medical condition resulting in immunosuppression, were not taking any concomitant immunomodulatory or immunosuppressant medications, and had not previously been treated with natalizumab. Symptoms progress over days to weeks and may include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, vision disturbances, and mental status changes. Cases of PML have been diagnosed based on MRI findings and the detection of JC virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid without specific PML signs/symptoms. Monitoring with brain MRI for signs that may be consistent with PML may be beneficial and allow for an early diagnosis of PML.

【67】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【68】• Appropriate use: Ocrelizumab has not been studied in combination with other MS therapies. When initiating ocrelizumab after an immunosuppressive therapy or initiating an immunosuppressive following ocrelizumab therapy, consider the potential for increased immunosuppressive effects.

【69】• Immunizations: Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 weeks and non-live vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to treatment initiation. Avoid live-attenuated or live vaccines during treatment or after discontinuation until B-cell repletion; consider using live-attenuated vaccines only if risk of infection is high and non-live vaccines are unavailable (AAN \[Farez 2019\]). Non-live vaccines may be administered; however, consideration should be given to evaluating the immune response. Prior to administration of live-attenuated or live vaccinations in infants exposed to ocrelizumab in utero, confirm recovery of B-cell counts.

【151】Reproductive Considerations

【152】Patients who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy and for 6 months after the last ocrelizumab infusion.

【153】In general, disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) are stopped prior to a planned pregnancy except in females at high risk of MS activity (AAN \[Rae-Grant 2018\]). Consider use of agents other than ocrelizumab for females at high risk of disease reactivation who are planning a pregnancy. Delaying pregnancy is recommended for females with persistent high disease activity; when disease-modifying therapy is needed in these patients, other agents are preferred (ECTRIMS/EAN \[Montalban 2018\]).

【154】Pregnancy Considerations

【155】Ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG 1 ). Potential placental transfer of human IgG is dependent upon the IgG subclass and gestational age, generally increasing as pregnancy progresses. The lowest exposure would be expected during the period of organogenesis .

【156】Information related to the use of ocrelizumab in pregnancy is limited . Transient peripheral B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been observed in infants born to mothers who received similar agents; immune response to live or live-attenuated vaccines may be decreased in infants exposed to ocrelizumab in utero. Evaluate immune response by measuring CD19 \+ B-cells in exposed infants prior to the administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines.

【157】In general, disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) are not initiated during pregnancy, except in females at high risk of MS activity (AAN \[Rae-Grant 2018\]). When disease-modifying therapy is needed in these patients, other agents are preferred (ECTRIMS/EAN \[Montalban 2018\]).

【158】Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes following exposure to ocrelizumab is ongoing. Health care providers are encouraged to enroll patients exposed to ocrelizumab during pregnancy in the Ocrevus Pregnancy Registry ; pregnant patients may also enroll themselves.

【159】Breastfeeding Considerations

【160】It is not known if ocrelizumab is present in breast milk.

【161】Ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG 1 ); human IgG is present in breast milk. Information related to the use of ocrelizumab in patients who are breastfeeding is limited . The potential for B-cell depletion in a breastfed infant following maternal use of ocrelizumab is not known. According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother. Other sources do not recommend breastfeeding during therapy .

【162】Monitoring Parameters

【163】Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening in all patients: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) tests (prior to therapy initiation); do not administer to patients with active hepatitis B virus confirmed by positive results for HBsAg and anti-HB tests; for patients who are negative for surface antigen (HBsAg) and positive for HB core antibody (HBcAb+) or are carriers of HBV (HBsAg+), consult a liver disease specialist prior to initiating and during therapy.

【164】Perform latent infection screening (eg, hepatitis, tuberculosis) in high-risk populations or in countries with high tuberculosis burden (baseline). Monitor quantitative serum immunoglobulins (baseline, throughout treatment as clinically necessary, especially in patients with opportunistic or recurrent infections, after discontinuation of therapy until B-cell repletion). Assess for active infection prior to treatment. Monitor for infusion reactions during infusion and for at least 1 hour following the end of the infusion. Monitor for signs/symptoms of immune-mediated colitis (evaluate promptly if colitis is suspected), infection, malignancy, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Perform brain MRI (at first signs/symptoms suggestive of PML and as clinically indicated to monitor for early signs of PML).

【165】Mechanism of Action

【166】Ocrelizumab is a recombinant humanized IgG monoclonal antibody directed against B-cells which express the cell surface antigen CD20; CD20 is present on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. B-cells are thought to influence the course of multiple sclerosis through antigen presentation, autoantibody production, cytokine regulation, and formation of ectopic lymphoid aggregates in the meninges (Hauser 2017). Ocrelizumab selectively targets and binds with high affinity to the cell surface to deplete CD20 expressing B-cells through antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis and cytotoxicity, as well as complement-mediated cytolysis .
