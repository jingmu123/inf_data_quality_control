【154】Dependent upon use, may include stool output and frequency; serum lipids, weight; fat soluble vitamin status (AACE \[Jellinger 2017\]).

【155】Mechanism of Action

【156】Psyllium is a soluble fiber. It absorbs water in the intestine to form a viscous liquid which promotes peristalsis and reduces transit time.

【157】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【158】Onset of action: Relief of constipation: 12-72 hours

【159】Absorption: None; small amounts of grain extracts present in the preparation have been reportedly absorbed following colonic hydrolysis
