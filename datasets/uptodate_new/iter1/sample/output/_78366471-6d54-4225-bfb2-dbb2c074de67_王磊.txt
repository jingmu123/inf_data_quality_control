【30】Warnings/Precautions

【31】_**Concerns related to adverse effects:**_

【32】• Bleaching effects: Benzoyl peroxide may bleach hair, colored fabric, or carpeting.

【33】• Diarrhea: Systemic absorption may occur after topical use of clindamycin. _Clostridioides_ _difficile_ \-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported and have been observed >2 months post antibiotic treatment. Use of parenteral and systemic clindamycin has resulted in severe colitis (including fatalities). Discontinue drug if significant diarrhea, abdominal cramps, or passage of blood and mucus occurs.

【34】• Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria, have been reported with use. Discontinue use immediately and initiate appropriate therapy if severe hypersensitivity occurs.

【35】• Photosensitivity: Use is associated with increased susceptibility/sensitivity to UV light; avoid sunlamps, tanning beds, or excessive sunlight exposure. Daily broad-spectrum sunscreen use and other protective measures (eg, hat) are recommended if sun exposure cannot be avoided.

【36】• Skin irritation: Certain cutaneous signs and symptoms (eg, burning/pain/stinging, dermatitis, dryness, erythema, irritation, scaling) may occur during treatment; these are most likely to occur during the first 4 weeks and usually lessen with continued use. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Use of moisturizer, decreased use, or discontinuation may be recommended.

【37】_**Concurrent drug therapy issues:**_

【38】• Sulfone products: Concomitant use of benzoyl peroxide with sulfone products (eg, dapsone, sulfacetamide) may cause temporary discoloration (yellow/orange) of facial hair and skin. Application of products at separate times during the day or washing off benzoyl peroxide prior to application of other products may avoid skin discoloration (Dubina 2009).

【39】_**Other warnings/precautions:**_

【40】• Appropriate use: For external use only; avoid contact with eyes, mouth, and mucous membranes. Do not apply to broken, eczematous, or sunburned skin. Avoid use of waxing as a depilatory method on treated skin. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes).

【41】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【42】Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; in neonates, large amounts of propylene glycol delivered orally, intravenously (eg, >3,000 mg/day), or topically have been associated with potentially fatal toxicities which can include metabolic acidosis, seizures, renal failure, and CNS depression; toxicities have also been reported in children and adults including hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution .

【66】Aminolevulinic Acid (Systemic): Photosensitizing Agents may enhance the photosensitizing effect of Aminolevulinic Acid (Systemic). _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【67】Aminolevulinic Acid (Topical): Photosensitizing Agents may enhance the photosensitizing effect of Aminolevulinic Acid (Topical). _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【68】Dapsone (Topical): Benzoyl Peroxide may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Dapsone (Topical). Specifically, the use of these agents in combination may cause skin and facial hair to temporarily turn a tan or yellow/orange color. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【69】Erythromycin (Systemic): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Clindamycin (Topical). Management: Consider avoiding the concomitant use of systemic erythromycin and topical clindamycin when treating acne vulgaris. This recommendation does not appear to apply to intravaginal use of clindamycin for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【70】Erythromycin (Topical): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Clindamycin (Topical). Management: Consider avoiding use of topical erythromycin and topical clindamycin at the same application site when treating acne vulgaris. This recommendation does not appear to apply to intravaginal use of clindamycin for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【71】Methoxsalen (Systemic): Photosensitizing Agents may enhance the photosensitizing effect of Methoxsalen (Systemic). _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【72】Multivitamins/Fluoride (with ADE): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Retinoic Acid Derivatives. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【73】Multivitamins/Minerals (with ADEK, Folate, Iron): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Retinoic Acid Derivatives. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【74】Multivitamins/Minerals (with AE, No Iron): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Retinoic Acid Derivatives. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【75】Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents: Clindamycin (Topical) may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking effect of Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【76】Porfimer: Photosensitizing Agents may enhance the photosensitizing effect of Porfimer. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【77】Verteporfin: Photosensitizing Agents may enhance the photosensitizing effect of Verteporfin. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【78】Pregnancy Considerations

【79】Refer to individual monographs.

【80】Monitoring Parameters

【81】Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions (eg, rash, swelling), stool output or diarrhea, sun sensitivity and skin stinging, burning, pain, or dryness.

【82】Mechanism of Action

【83】Clindamycin: Reversibly binds to 50S ribosomal subunits preventing peptide bond formation, thus inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis; bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending on drug concentration, infection site, and organism.

【84】Adapalene: A retinoid-like compound that is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes, all of which represent important features in the pathology of acne vulgaris.

【85】Benzoyl peroxide: Releases free-radical oxygen, which oxidizes bacterial proteins in the sebaceous follicles, decreasing the number of anaerobic bacteria and decreasing irritating-type free fatty acids.

【86】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【87】Also see individual agents.

【88】Absorption: Via the skin.

【89】Excretion: Benzoyl peroxide: Urine.王磊
