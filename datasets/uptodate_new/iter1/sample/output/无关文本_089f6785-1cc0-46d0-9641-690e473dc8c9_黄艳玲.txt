【9】Dosing: Adult

【10】**Note:** KDIGO guidelines do not recommend routine use of vitamin D analogs in patients not on dialysis with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages G3 to G5; it may be reasonable to reserve use for patients with CKD stages G4 or G5 and with severe and progressive hyperparathyroidism. Caution is advised to avoid hypercalcemia or elevated phosphate levels . Do not initiate in patients with serum calcium at the ULN (eg, >9.5 mg/dL) .

【11】Hyperparathyroidism, secondary, in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis

【12】**Hyperparathyroidism, secondary, in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis:**

【13】**IV:** Initial: 0.04 to 0.1 mcg/kg  given no more frequently than every other day at any time during dialysis; adjust dose based on serum intact PTH (iPTH) goal of 2 to 9 times the ULN for the assay used , as follows:

【14】iPTH above target and increased: Increase by 2 to 4 mcg every 2 to 4 weeks; maximum dose: 0.24 mcg/kg/day.

【15】iPTH above target and decreased by <30%: Increase by 2 to 4 mcg every 2 to 4 weeks; maximum dose: 0.24 mcg/kg/day.

【16】iPTH above target and decreased by 30% to 60%: Maintain paricalcitol dose.

【17】iPTH above target and decreased by >60%: Decrease paricalcitol dose based on clinical judgement.

【18】iPTH at target and stable: Maintain paricalcitol dose.

【19】**Note:** Dose suspension may be necessary due to persistent and abnormally low iPTH (goal iPTH 2 to 9 times the ULN for the assay used ) to reduce risk of adynamic bone disease or serum calcium persistently above normal; restart therapy at a reduced dose after iPTH and/or serum calcium has normalized.

【20】**Conversion to IV paricalcitol from IV calcitriol:** A conversion ratio of **paricalcitol to calcitriol** of approximately 3:1 or 4:1 may be used .

【21】**Oral:** Initial dose is calculated, in mcg, based on baseline iPTH level divided by 80 and administered 3 times weekly, no more frequently than every other day. **Note:** To reduce the risk of hypercalcemia initiate only after baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to ≤9.5 mg/dL.

【22】Dose titration:

【23】Titration dose (mcg) = Most recent iPTH level (pg/mL) divided by 80

【24】**Note:** In situations where monitoring of iPTH, calcium, and phosphorus occurs less frequently than once per week, a more modest initial and dose titration rate may be warranted:

【25】Modest titration dose (mcg) = Most recent iPTH level (pg/mL) divided by 100

【26】_Dosage adjustment for elevated serum calcium:_ Decrease dose by 2 to 4 mcg.

【27】Hyperparathyroidism, secondary, associated with stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease

【120】Warnings/Precautions

【121】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【122】• Excessive vitamin D: Excessive vitamin D administration may lead to over suppression of PTH, progressive or acute hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease.

【123】• Hypercalcemia: Progressive and/or acute hypercalcemia may increase risk of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures; chronic hypercalcemia may lead to generalized vascular and other soft-tissue calcification, exacerbate nephrolithiasis, and has been associated with increased mortality in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (KDIGO 2017). High intake of calcium and phosphate with vitamin D (and its derivatives) may increase risk of hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia. Risk of hypercalcemia may be increased by concomitant use of calcium-containing supplements, other vitamin D compounds, and/or medications that increase serum calcium (eg, thiazide diuretics). Monitor serum calcium frequently in high-risk patients.

【124】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【125】Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; in neonates large amounts of propylene glycol delivered orally, intravenously (eg, >3,000 mg/day), or topically have been associated with potentially fatal toxicities which can include metabolic acidosis, seizures, renal failure, and CNS depression; toxicities have also been reported in children and adults including hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution .

【189】Pregnancy Considerations

【190】Adverse events have been observed in some animal reproduction studies.

【191】Breastfeeding Considerations

【192】It is not known if paricalcitol is present in breast milk.

【193】According to the manufacturer, the decision to continue or discontinue breastfeeding during therapy should take into account the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother. Monitor breastfed infants for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia.

【194】Dietary Considerations

【195】Some products may contain coconut or palm kernel oil.

【196】Monitoring Parameters

【197】Signs and symptoms of vitamin D intoxication and hypercalcemia.

【198】Serum calcium and phosphorus:

【199】IV: Serum calcium twice weekly during initial phase, then at least monthly once dose established

【200】Oral: Serum calcium and phosphorus at baseline, at least every 2 weeks for initial 3 months or following dose adjustment, then monthly for 3 months, then every 3 months

【201】Serum or plasma intact PTH (iPTH):

【202】IV: Every 2 to 4 weeks during initial phase or after dose adjustment

【203】Oral: Baseline, at least every 2 weeks for 3 months or following dose adjustment, then monthly for 3 months, then every 3 months

【204】**KDIGO guidelines :**

【205】Serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH): Frequency of measurement may be dependent upon the presence and magnitude of abnormalities, the rate of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the use of treatments for chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) (KDIGO 2017):

【206】CKD stage G3a to G3b: Serum calcium and phosphate: Every 6 to 12 months; PTH: Frequency based on baseline level and progression of CKD

【207】CKD stage G4: Serum calcium and phosphate: Every 3 to 6 months; PTH: Every 6 to 12 months

【208】CKD stage G5 and G5D: Serum calcium and phosphate: Every 1 to 3 months; PTH: Every 3 to 6 months

【209】**Note:** Due to the complexity and interdependency of the laboratory parameters used for therapeutic decisions in chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) patients, serial assessments of phosphate, calcium, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels should be considered together (KDIGO 2017). Asymptomatic hypocalcemia is acceptable in patients with CKD stage 3 to 5 (KDIGO 2017).

【210】Calcium (total): Adults: Normal range: 8.6 to 10.2 mg/dL (SI: 2.2 to 2.6 mmol/L). Avoid hypercalcemia for CKD stages G3a to G5D; asymptomatic hypocalcemia may not require correction (KDIGO 2017).

【211】Phosphorus: 3 to 4.5 mg/dL (SI: 1 to 1.5 mmol/L). Lower elevated phosphorus levels toward the normal range for CKD stages G3a to G5D (KDIGO 2017).

【212】PTH:

【213】CKD stage G3a to G5: Optimal PTH level is unknown; evaluate patients with progressively elevated intact PTH levels or if levels are consistently above the normal range (assay-dependent) (KDIGO 2017).

【214】Dialysis patients: Maintain iPTH within 2 to 9 times the upper limit of normal for the assay used (KDIGO 2017).

【215】Mechanism of Action

【216】Decreased renal conversion of vitamin D to its primary active metabolite  reduces calcium excretion and enhances bone resorption. Paricalcitol is a synthetic vitamin D analog which binds to and activates the VDR in kidney, parathyroid gland, intestine and bone, thus reducing PTH levels and improving calcium and phosphate homeostasis.
