【3】ALERT: US Boxed Warning

【4】Serious infections:

【5】Patients treated with adalimumab are at increased risk of developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.

【6】Discontinue adalimumab if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include the following:

【7】Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB frequently have presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before adalimumab use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent infection prior to adalimumab use.

【8】Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric antifungal therapy in patients at risk of invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.

【9】Bacterial, viral, and other infections caused by opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria.

【10】Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with adalimumab prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

【11】Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with adalimumab, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

【12】Malignancy:

【13】Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescents treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–blockers, including adalimumab. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF-blockers, including adalimumab. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF-blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF-blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF-blocker or a TNF-blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants.

【139】Adverse Reactions (Significant): Considerations

【140】Autoimmune disorder

【141】**Antibody development** may occur with the use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors, including adalimumab. Most frequently, autoantibodies include anti-nuclear antibody and anti–double-stranded DNA; less frequently, anti-ENA, anti-histone Ab, and anti-cardiolipin Ab . Frequency of autoantibody development varies depending on underlying disease, specific TNF alpha inhibitor medication, and the duration of use; the clinical significance of asymptomatic antibody positivity is unclear . Antibody positivity may rarely result in the development of an autoimmune disorder, such as **lupus-like syndrome** . Symptoms may include **arthralgia** , myalgia, mucocutaneous symptoms (eg, **skin rash** ), cytopenia, fatigue, **fever** , serositis, and kidney injury . Development of an autoimmune disorder is associated with a poor treatment response of the original disease to TNF alpha inhibitor therapy . It is unclear if the development of an autoimmune disorder is a TNF alpha inhibitor class effect; several reports of rechallenge with the same TNF alpha inhibitor or a different TNF alpha inhibitor after treatment of the initial autoimmune disorder did not result in a recurrence .

【142】_Mechanism:_ Unknown; postulated mechanisms include bystander activation of autoreactive lymphocytes due to drug-specific immunity, nonspecific activation of lymphocytes, direct cytotoxicity with release of autoantigens, and disruption of central T-cell tolerance .

【143】_Onset:_ Varied; ranged from 5 weeks to 2 years .

【144】_Risk factors:_

【145】• Longer disease duration 

【146】• Female sex 

【147】• Ulcerative colitis 

【148】Demyelinating disease

【149】New-onset or exacerbation of central and peripheral nervous system **demyelinating disease** , such as **multiple sclerosis** , **optic neuritis** , acute transverse myelitis, **Guillain-Barré syndrome** , and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, may occur with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors, although causality has not been proven . Symptomatic CNS demyelination associated with TNF alpha inhibitors may be monophasic and/or clinically isolated . Partial or complete resolution may occur after discontinuation of TNF alpha inhibitors ; however, approximately one-third of TNF alpha inhibitors associated demyelinating episodes evolve into clinically definite multiple sclerosis .

【150】_Mechanism:_ Unknown; several mechanisms have been postulated, including the following: May trigger CNS demyelination directly by immune activation in genetically and/or immunologically predisposed individuals ; may inhibit remyelination via TNF type-2 receptor ; may increase ingress of auto-reactive T cells in the CNS; may alter downstream cytokine responses; may neutralize TNF systemically but not within the CNS, creating an artificially high local concentration of brain TNF (known as sponge effect); may permit latent CNS viral infection; or may promote anti-drug antibodies and immune complexes that are contributory to demyelination events .

【151】_Onset:_ Varied; mean time of exposure to TNF alpha inhibitors before onset of symptoms: 18 months .

【152】_Risk factors:_

【153】• Preexisting or recent onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disease

【154】Dermatologic reactions

【155】Various cutaneous eruptions have been reported, including **psoriasiform eruption** (either new onset or exacerbation), hidradenitis suppurativa, **lupus-like syndrome** , **eczematous rash** , **pustular rash** , **lichenoid eruption** , and **hypersensitivity angiitis** .

【156】_Mechanism:_ Psoriasiform eruptions, lichenoid drug eruptions: Non–dose-related; possibly related to cytokine imbalance or imbalance between tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interferon alpha . Lupus-like syndrome: Non–dose-related; possibly related to cytokine imbalance; development of autoantibodies typically associated with lupus may occur without clinical symptoms in patients treated with etanercept and other TNF alpha inhibitors .

【157】_Onset:_ Psoriasiform eruptions: Delayed; mean 15.6 ± 10.7 months . Hidradenitis suppurativa: Delayed; median 12 months (range: 1 to 72 months) .

【158】_Risk factors:_

【159】• Adult females (psoriatic lesions) 

【160】• Smoking (psoriatic lesions) 

【161】• Male sex (palmoplantar pustulosis) 

【162】• Younger patients (<40 years of age) (palmoplantar pustulosis) 

【163】• Patients with inflammatory bowel disease compared to other inflammatory diseases (psoriasiform reactions more frequent and severe) 

【164】• Females (hidradenitis suppurativa) 

【165】• Cross-reactivity data among TNF alpha inhibitors in patients who develop psoriatic lesions are conflicting 

【166】Heart failure

【167】New-onset **heart failure** (HF) and **worsening of heart failure** have been reported with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors, including adalimumab; however, data are conflicting, and risk is unclear . Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may be a risk factor for HF development . Some data suggest that TNF alpha inhibitors may reduce the risk of HF in the RA population by improving inflammation, lowering disease activity, and improving surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease .

【168】_Mechanism:_ Not clearly established; postulated mechanisms include pro-inflammatory cytokine activation, accelerated atherosclerosis, and reduced physical activity related to the underlying rheumatologic disease . "Reverse signaling" may occur, leading to cardiotoxic effects; TNF on cardiomyocytes of the failing heart may act as receptors, activating intracellular signaling pathways, potentiating the toxic effect of the cytokine .

【169】_Onset:_ Varied; median 8.5 months (range: 5 to 17 months \[data with infliximab\]) .

【170】_Risk factors:_

【171】• Preexisting HF

【172】• Higher disease activity (inflammation) (eg, disease activity score \[DAS28\], C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) 

【173】Hepatitis B virus reactivation

【174】Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) may occur with immunosuppressive or biologic therapy, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors . **Reactivation of HBV** may occur in both patients who are HBsAg-positive and in patients who are HBsAg-negative/HBcAb-positive with detectable HBV DNA . Criteria for HBV reactivation includes  a rise in HBV DNA compared to baseline (or an absolute level of HBV DNA when a baseline is unavailable) and  reverse seroconversion (seroreversion) from HBsAg-negative to HBsAg-positive for patients who are HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc–positive .

【175】_Mechanism:_ Inhibit stimulation of HBV-specific T lymphocytes, promoting reactivation .

【176】_Onset:_ Varied; 2 weeks after initiation, up to a year after discontinuation .

【177】_Risk factors:_

【178】• Male sex 

【179】• Older age 

【180】• Presence of cirrhosis 

【181】• High baseline HBV DNA level 

【182】• HBeAg or HBsAg seropositivity 

【183】• Absence of anti-HBs among patients with resolved HBV infection 

【184】• Chronic HBV 

【185】• Non-A HBV genotype 

【186】• Hepatitis C, hepatitis D, or HIV co-infection 

【187】Hepatoxicity

【188】Adalimumab has been associated with **increased serum transaminases** and **hepatotoxicity** . **Cholestatic hepatitis** , **reactivation of hepatitis B virus** , and **autoimmune hepatitis** have been reported . Elevated aminotransferases between 2 to 3 times the upper limit of normal may occur and is usually transient and asymptomatic . Resolution of symptoms in patients who develop an autoimmune hepatitis may require initiation of corticosteroid therapy . Immunomodulatory use, in particular methotrexate, may decrease the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors . Patients often tolerate a different TNF alpha inhibitor ; although, hepatotoxicity may recur with an alternative agent in some cases . Hepatotoxicity is more commonly associated with infliximab, compared to adalimumab and other TNF alpha inhibitors .

【189】_Mechanism:_ Unknown; idiosyncratic drug reaction  or autoimmunity due to development of autoantibodies .

【190】_Onset:_ Varied; ranges from 4 weeks to 52 weeks . Autoimmune hepatitis has a longer latency period than nonimmune cases  .

【191】Infection

【192】Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors may be associated with **infection** (including **serious infection** ). In clinical trials, serious infections were numerically higher among patients treated with TNF alpha inhibitors than among patients who received placebo. Meta-analyses and observational studies have reported inconsistency in risk. One study reported an increase in serious infection in patients treated with TNF alpha inhibitors . Another study found no increase in risk . An observational study did not demonstrate an increased infection risk among patients receiving TNF alpha inhibitors vs comparators . Infections may present as disseminated (rather than local) disease. Tuberculosis disease (including reactivation of tuberculosis infection), invasive fungal infection (including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and pneumocystosis) and bacterial infection, viral infection, or other opportunistic infections (including legionellosis and listeriosis) have been reported.

【193】_Mechanism:_ Dose-related; TNF alpha is important in the immune response against infections, suggesting that medications that inhibit TNF alpha may increase the risk of infections .

【194】_Risk factors:_

【195】• Higher doses 

【196】• Older age 

【197】• Chronic lung or kidney disease 

【198】• Concurrent immunosuppressants (eg, corticosteroids, methotrexate) 

【199】• History of an opportunistic infection

【200】• Chronic or recurrent infection

【201】• Conditions that predispose to infections (eg, advanced or poorly controlled diabetes)

【202】• Residence/travel in areas of endemic tuberculosis or mycoses (blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis)

【203】Injection-site reactions

【204】Adalimumab is associated with **injection-site reactions** and delayed reactions . Concurrent immunomodulators (eg, methotrexate, cyclosporine) reduce the development of anti-adalimumab antibodies and may reduce risk . Most reactions do not require discontinuation and do not recur . Cross-reactivity between tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors is not well described . Anti-infliximab antibodies do not cross-react with adalimumab; although, patients who develop anti-infliximab antibodies are more prone to develop anti-adalimumab antibodies . Adalimumab has been tolerated in patients with previous infusion reactions with infliximab . In contrast, there are reports of immediate hypersensitivity reactions with adalimumab in patients who had previous infliximab-related reactions .

【205】_Mechanism:_ Unknown; T-cell mediated  or IgE mediated .

【206】_Onset:_ Varied; 12 to 24 hours following injection (but may occur immediately following injection). Injection-site reactions often occur within the first month of treatment and last up to 5 days .

【207】_Risk factors:_

【208】• Younger age 

【209】Malignancy

【210】Lymphoma and other malignancies (some fatal) have been reported in children and adolescents receiving tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors, including adalimumab. Half of the malignancies reported in children and adolescents were lymphomas (Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), while other cases varied and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies not typically observed in this population. Most patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. **Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma** , a rare T-cell lymphoma, has been reported (some fatal), primarily in patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis treated with adalimumab and who received concomitant azathioprine or mercaptopurine; reports occurred predominantly in adolescent and young adult males.

【211】Long-term observational studies and meta-analyses indicate no association between TNF alpha inhibitor therapy and an overall increased risk of cancer . One study reported a significant increase in lymphomas in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving TNF alpha inhibitors compared to the general population. However, there was no significant increased risk of lymphomas in patients receiving TNF alpha inhibitors compared to those receiving conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) or with dose, increasing time since initiation, or cumulative duration . Another study reported no difference in the risk of solid tumors in patients with RA receiving TNF alpha inhibitors compared to those receiving csDMARDs . Other studies reported no increased risk of malignancy recurrence in patients receiving TNF alpha inhibitors .

【212】_Mechanism_ : May contribute to protumor activity and suppress the anti-tumor response .

【213】_Onset:_ Delayed; median 30 months (range: 1 to 84 months).

【214】Tuberculosis

【215】Adult and pediatric patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors are at risk for developing **tuberculosis** (TB) disease (including **reactivated tuberculosis** ) . A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TNF alpha inhibitors vs control and registry/longitudinal cohort studies of TNF alpha inhibitors vs other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs found a significant increase in TB risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with TNF alpha inhibitors. In the non-RCTs, incidence rates with adalimumab were higher than etanercept. Preventive treatment for latent TB infection reduced TB risk . In the RCTs, no difference in TB rates were found; however, this failure to detect a difference in TB rates between the two groups may be due to a short observational period .

【216】_Mechanism:_ TNF alpha inhibitors interfere with TNF alpha induction of the granuloma, which is a crucial defense mechanism in controlling TB . TNF alpha inhibitors modulate T-cell number, function, and cytokine signaling, important for the control of TB infection .

【217】_Onset:_ Varied; median 3 to ~73 months .

【218】_Risk factors:_

【219】• Residence in an area with high TB prevalence 

【220】• Known TB exposure or ongoing risk factors for TB exposure (eg, travel to areas with high TB prevalence; residence in correctional facilities, long-term care facilities, or homeless shelters; certain healthcare workers)

【280】Warnings/Precautions

【281】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【282】• Antibody formation: Formation of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies may occur with biologic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and may be associated with loss of efficacy (AAD-NPF \[Menter 2019\]).

【283】• Hematologic disorders: Rare cases of pancytopenia and aplastic anemia have been reported with TNF-blockers. Patients must be advised to seek medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias; discontinue if significant hematologic abnormalities are confirmed. Use with caution in patients with a history of significant hematologic abnormalities.

【284】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【285】• Active infection: Do not initiate therapy in patients with an active infection, including clinically important localized infection.

【286】• HIV: Use with caution in HIV-positive patients; TNF-α inhibitors may be appropriate in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, provided they have normal CD4 counts, no viral load, and no recent opportunistic infections (AAD-NPF \[Menter 2019\]).

【287】**_Special populations:_**

【288】• Patients with rheumatic musculoskeletal disease undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery: Hold biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) prior to surgery and plan surgery after the next dose is due. Surgery can occur after holding medication for 1 full dosing cycle (eg, for medications administered every 4 weeks, schedule surgery 5 weeks from last administered dose); therapy can be restarted once surgical wound shows evidence of healing (eg, no swelling, erythema, or drainage), sutures/staples are removed, and no ongoing nonsurgical site infections (typically ~14 days to reduce infection risk). Decisions to withhold therapy should be based on shared decision making; ensure the patient and their provider weigh risks of interrupting therapy and disease control versus risks of continuing therapy and surgical complications (ACR/AAHKS \[Goodman 2022\]).

【289】• Surgery patients: Limited experience with patients undergoing surgical procedures while on therapy; consider long half-life with planned procedures. Monitor closely for infection.

【290】**_Dosage form specific issues:_**

【291】• Latex: The packaging (needle cover of prefilled syringe and autoinjector) may contain latex.

【292】• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals . Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 . See manufacturer's labeling.

【293】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【294】• Immunizations: Patients should be brought up to date with all immunizations before initiating therapy; live vaccines should not be given concurrently. There are no data available concerning the effects of therapy on vaccination or secondary transmission of live vaccines in patients receiving therapy.

Specifically, the risk of vaccine-associated infection may be increased. Immunosuppressants (Therapeutic Immunosuppressant Agents) may diminish the therapeutic effect of Yellow Fever Vaccine. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【612】Reproductive Considerations

【613】The American Academy of Dermatology considers tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocking agents for the treatment of psoriasis to be compatible for use in patients planning to father a child (AAD-NPF \[Menter 2019\]). Patients with psoriasis planning to become pregnant may continue treatment with adalimumab. Patients with well-controlled psoriasis who wish to avoid fetal exposure can consider discontinuing adalimumab 10 weeks prior to attempting to become pregnant (Rademaker 2018).

【614】Biologics, such as adalimumab, may be continued in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis) planning to become pregnant (Mahadevan 2019). Treatment algorithms are available for use of biologics in patients with Crohn disease who are planning to become pregnant (Weizman 2019).

【615】Pregnancy Considerations

【616】Adalimumab crosses the placenta.

【617】Adalimumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG 1 ). Placental transfer of human IgG is dependent upon the IgG subclass, maternal serum concentrations, birth weight, and gestational age, generally increasing as pregnancy progresses. The lowest exposure would be expected during the period of organogenesis .

【618】Following administration to pregnant patients with inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis), cord blood and newborn serum concentrations of adalimumab are greater than maternal serum at delivery . The mean time to adalimumab clearance was 4 months (range: 2.9 to 5 months) in a study in 36 infants exposed in utero. The estimated mean half-life of adalimumab in these infants was 26 days (Julsgaard 2016). One case report notes adalimumab was detectable in the infant serum for 19 months following in utero exposure (Labetoulle 2018).

【619】Based on available data, an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal effects has not been observed following adalimumab exposure during pregnancy (Nielsen 2020). Adalimumab information from a pregnancy registry collected between 2004 and 2016 is available. Included were pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn disease (CD) treated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester (n=257), pregnant women with RA or CD not treated with adalimumab (disease untreated control, n=120), and pregnant women without RA or CD (healthy unexposed control, n=225); 42 cases lost to follow-up. The incidence of major birth defects was not significantly different between the study groups and no pattern of specific defects was observed. An increased risk of growth restriction or serious opportunistic infections was not associated with maternal adalimumab therapy when compared to the disease untreated controls. An increased risk of preterm delivery was observed in pregnant patients with RA or CD, regardless of adalimumab exposure (Chambers 2019). Information related to this class of medications is emerging, but based on available data, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) blocking agents are considered to have low to moderate risk when used in pregnancy (ACOG 776 2019).

【620】The risk of immunosuppression may be increased following third trimester maternal use of TNFα blocking agents; the fetus, neonate/infant should be considered immunosuppressed for 1 to 3 months following in utero exposure (AAD-NPF \[Menter 2019\]). Vaccination with live vaccines (eg, rotavirus vaccine) should be avoided for the first 6 months of life if exposure to a biologic agent occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy (eg, >27 weeks' gestation) (Mahadevan 2019).

【621】Maternal adalimumab serum concentrations remain stable as pregnancy progresses .

【622】Inflammatory bowel disease is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including an increased risk of miscarriage, premature delivery, delivery of a low birth weight infant, and poor maternal weight gain. Management of maternal disease should be optimized prior to pregnancy. Treatment decreases disease flares, disease activity, and the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes (Mahadevan 2019).

【623】Use of immune modulating therapies in pregnancy should be individualized to optimize maternal disease and pregnancy outcomes (ACOG 776 2019). The American Academy of Dermatology considers TNFα blocking agents for the treatment of psoriasis to be compatible with pregnancy (AAD-NPF \[Menter 2019\]). When treatment for inflammatory bowel disease is needed in pregnant women, appropriate biologic therapy can be continued without interruption. Serum levels should be evaluated prior to conception and optimized to avoid subtherapeutic concentrations or high levels which may increase placental transfer. Dosing can be adjusted so delivery occurs at the lowest serum concentration. For adalimumab, the final injection can be given 2 to 3 weeks prior to the estimated date of delivery , then continued 48 hours postpartum (Mahadevan 2019).

【624】Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes following exposure to adalimumab is ongoing. Women exposed to adalimumab during pregnancy for the treatment of an autoimmune disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease) may contact the OTIS Autoimmune Diseases Study at 877-311-8972.

【625】Breastfeeding Considerations

【626】Adalimumab is present in breast milk

【627】Based on information from three cases, adalimumab concentrations in breast milk are 0.1% to 1% of the maternal serum concentrations . In one case, the highest milk concentration was observed 6 days following a maternal dose of adalimumab 40 mg SubQ when maternal treatment for Crohn disease was restarted 4 weeks' postpartum (Ben-Horin 2010). The same maternal dose was used in cases two and three. Adalimumab was not measurable (<40 ng/mL) in the serum of one breastfeeding infant ; serum concentrations were not evaluated in the other infant (Fritzsche 2012). In a study of 21 women, only two had detectable adalimumab in their breast milk, with maximum concentrations occurring between 12 and 24 hours after the infusion (dose not stated) (Matro 2018). An increased risk of infection has not been observed in breastfeeding infants whose mothers were using adalimumab monotherapy (Mahadevan 2012).

【628】According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother. However, tumor necrosis factor alpha blocking agents are considered compatible with breastfeeding .

【629】Monitoring Parameters

【630】**Prior to therapy start:**

【631】• Evaluate for presence of malignancy (especially skin cancer), lymphadenopathy, and, for the presence of current or latent infection, ensure age-appropriate vaccinations are up to date and in general no live vaccines are administered within 4 weeks of starting therapy (AAD \[Menter 2019\]). Refer to institutional protocols for vaccination and monitoring requirements prior to initiating therapy.

【632】**• Labs:** CBC with differential, complete metabolic panel, pregnancy test, C-reactive protein, serologic testing for hepatitis B virus (hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, hepatitis B core antibody), hepatitis C virus antibody, HIV; test for tuberculosis (TB) infection (latent TB) (eg, Quantiferon Gold); consider two-step TB test in immunocompromised patients or interferon gamma release assay for TB in patients who have had Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine; chest radiograph if testing for TB infection is positive (AAD \[Menter 2019\]; ACG \[Lichtenstein 2018\]; EuroGuiDerm \[Nast 2020\]; Hanson 2013).

【633】**During therapy:**

【634】• Evaluate for presence of malignancy (especially skin cancer), lymphadenopathy, infections/infection risks, congestive heart failure, or neurological symptoms; hypersensitivity reaction, lupus-like syndrome, injection-site reactions (ACG \[Lichtenstein 2018\]; EuroGuiDerm \[Nast 2020\]). Monitor for improvement in symptoms.

【635】**• Labs** : CBC, LFTs at 4 and 12 months, then every 3 to 6 months or as clinically appropriate (EuroGuiDerm \[Nast 2020\]); annual testing/chest radiograph for patients at high-risk patients (eg, contact with individuals with TB disease \[active TB\]); hepatitis B carriers should be periodically evaluated for signs/symptoms of active hepatitis B infection (AAD \[Menter 2019\]; EuroGuiDerm \[Nast 2020\]; Hanson 2013). Consider anti-drug antibody and/or therapeutic drug monitoring in the setting of nonresponse or loss of response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy.

【636】**After therapy:**

【637】• Periodically evaluate patients who are hepatitis B carriers for signs/symptoms of active hepatitis B infection (AAD \[Menter 2019\]).

【638】**Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (eg, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis):**

【639】Reactive therapeutic drug monitoring has been suggested to guide treatment changes in adults with active IBD.

【640】Timing of serum sample: Draw trough <24 hours prior to next scheduled dose

【641】Therapeutic reference range: ≥7.5 mcg/mL (Feuerstein 2017)

【642】Mechanism of Action

【643】Adalimumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds to human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), thereby interfering with binding to TNFα receptor sites and subsequent cytokine-driven inflammatory processes. Elevated TNF levels in the synovial fluid are involved in the pathologic pain and joint destruction in immune-mediated arthritis. Adalimumab decreases signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. It inhibits progression of structural damage of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. Reduces signs and symptoms and maintains clinical remission in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis; reduces epidermal thickness and inflammatory cell infiltration in plaque psoriasis.

【644】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【645】Onset of action: Response best determined after 3 to 4 months (AAD-NPF \[Menter 2019\]).

【646】Distribution: V d : 4.7 to 6 L; Synovial fluid concentrations: 31% to 96% of serum

【647】Bioavailability: Absolute: 64%

【648】Half-life elimination: Terminal: ~2 weeks (range: 10 to 20 days)

【649】Time to peak, serum: SUBQ: 131 ± 56 hours

【650】Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【651】Older adult: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there was a trend toward lower clearance with increasing age in patients 40 to >75 years of age.
