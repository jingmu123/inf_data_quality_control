【51】Warnings/Precautions

【52】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【53】• Cholelithiasis: Cases have been reported postmarketing; some required hospitalization and some had complications. Temporary or permanent discontinuation of therapy should be considered if symptoms develop.

【54】• Elevated bilirubin: Asymptomatic elevations in bilirubin (unconjugated) occur commonly during therapy; reversible upon discontinuation. Safety data does not exist for bilirubin persistently >5 times ULN. Evaluate alternative etiologies if transaminase elevations also occur. Consider alternative therapy if jaundice or scleral icterus cause cosmetic concern.

【55】• Fat redistribution: May cause redistribution of fat (eg, buffalo hump, peripheral wasting with increased abdominal girth, cushingoid appearance).

【56】• Hypersensitivity reactions: Protease inhibitors have been associated with a variety of hypersensitivity events (some severe), including rash, anaphylaxis (rare), angioedema, bronchospasm, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and/or drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. Discontinue treatment if severe skin reactions develop. Severe skin reactions may be accompanied by fever, malaise, fatigue, arthralgias, hepatitis, oral lesions, blisters, conjunctivitis, and/or eosinophilia. Mild to moderate rash may occur early in treatment and resolve with continued therapy.

【57】• Immune reconstitution syndrome: Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome resulting in the occurrence of an inflammatory response to an indolent or residual opportunistic infection during initial HIV treatment or activation of autoimmune disorders (eg, Graves disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis) later in therapy; further evaluation and treatment may be required.

【58】• Nephrolithiasis: Cases have been reported postmarketing; some required hospitalization and some had complications. Temporary or permanent discontinuation of therapy should be considered if symptoms develop.

【59】• Renal toxicity: Concomitant use of cobicistat and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may cause renal toxicity (acute renal failure and/or Fanconi syndrome); avoid use with concurrent or recent nephrotoxic therapy. Calculate estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) prior to initiation of therapy. Assess serum phosphorus in patients with or at risk for renal impairment. In patients receiving concomitant tenofovir, assess urine glucose and urine protein prior to and periodically during treatment and monitor renal function (including recalculation of creatinine clearance) during therapy. Do not administer in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with CrCl <70 mL/minute or in patients with concomitant or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent.

【60】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【61】• Conduction abnormalities: Atazanavir may prolong PR interval; usually first degree AV block only and asymptomatic; rare cases of second-degree AV block have been reported. ECG monitoring should be considered in patients with preexisting conduction abnormalities or with medications which prolong AV conduction (dosage adjustment required with some agents).

【62】• Diabetes: Changes in glucose tolerance, hyperglycemia, exacerbation of diabetes, DKA, and new-onset diabetes mellitus have been reported in patients receiving protease inhibitors. Initiation or dose adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required.

【63】• Hemophilia A or B: Use with caution in patients with hemophilia A or B; increased bleeding (eg, spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthroses) has been reported during protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients receive additional factor VIII. In more than half of the cases, protease inhibitor treatment was continued or reintroduced if treatment was discontinued.

【64】• Hepatic impairment: Not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with underlying hepatic disease such as hepatitis B or C or marked transaminase elevations may be at risk for further transaminase elevations or hepatic decompensation. Closely monitor at risk patients at baseline and periodically during treatment.

【65】• Renal impairment: Cases of chronic kidney disease, including granulomatous interstitial nephritis, have been reported in postmarketing surveillance with or without ritonavir; consider alternative therapy in patients at high risk for renal impairment or with preexisting renal disease. Renal function monitoring should be performed at baseline and periodically during treatment. Not recommended for use in treatment-experienced patients with ESRD on hemodialysis. Consider therapy discontinuation in patients with progressive kidney disease.

【66】**_Concurrent drug therapy issues:_**

【67】• Concurrent therapy: Avoid use with other protease inhibitors, elvitegravir, ritonavir, or other atazanavir- or cobicistat-containing products.

【68】**_Special populations:_**

【69】• Pediatric: Atazanavir should not be used in patients <3 months of age due to potential for kernicterus.

【70】**_Other warning/precautions:_**

【71】• False elevations in serum creatinine: Cobicistat may inhibit tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting actual renal glomerular function; use caution when interpreting serum creatinine values in patients with medical conditions or receiving drugs needing to be monitored with estimated CrCl. Patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine >0.4 mg/dL from baseline should have renal function monitored closely. Assess estimated CrCl prior to initiating therapy; consider alternative medications that do not require dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment.

【72】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【73】Skin rash may occur with atazanavir use, usually mild to moderate; maculopapular; reported incidence lower in pediatric patients (grades 2 to 4: 14%) than adults (all grades: 20%); median onset: 7.3 weeks; treatment may be continued if rash is mild to moderate (rash may resolve; median duration: 1.4 weeks); discontinue therapy in cases of severe rash. May cause cough; reported incidence in pediatric patients: 21%. May cause fever; higher incidence observed in pediatric patients compared to adults .

【589】Food Interactions

【590】Refer to individual monographs.

【591】Reproductive Considerations

【592】Patients with HIV infection not planning a pregnancy may use any available type of contraception, considering possible drug interactions and contraindications of the specific method. Consult drug interactions database for more detailed information specific to use of atazanavir/cobicistat and combination oral contraceptives. The manufacturer recommends considering use of nonhormonal contraceptives.

【593】The Health and Human Services perinatal HIV guidelines do not recommend this fixed-dose combination for patients with HIV who are not yet pregnant but are trying to conceive (HHS \[perinatal\] 2023).

【594】Pregnancy Considerations

【595】The Health and Human Services (HHS) perinatal HIV guidelines do not recommend this fixed-dose combination as initial therapy for pregnant patients with HIV who are antiretroviral naive, who have had antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the past but are restarting, or who require a new ART regimen (due to poor tolerance or poor virologic response of current regimen). Concentrations of atazanavir may be significantly reduced during the second and third trimesters when used in combination with cobicistat. If pregnancy occurs during therapy, consideration should be given to changing to a preferred or alternative regimen. If continued in patients who are virologically suppressed, frequent viral load monitoring is recommended (HHS \[perinatal\] 2023).

【596】Breastfeeding Considerations

【597】Atazanavir is present in breast milk. It is not known if cobicistat is present in breast milk.

【598】Monitoring Parameters

【599】Vital signs, ECG; serum creatinine, estimated CrCl, and urinalysis with microscopic examination (baseline and periodically during treatment); liver function tests (baseline and periodically during treatment in patients with existing liver disease). When coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein prior to initiation and as clinically indicated during therapy; assess serum phosphorus in patients with or at risk for renal impairment. Patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine >0.4 mg/dL from baseline should have renal function monitored closely. Testing for HBV is recommended prior to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy.

【600】Mechanism of Action

【601】Atazanavir binds to the site of HIV-1 protease activity and inhibits cleavage of viral Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors into individual functional proteins required for infectious HIV. This results in the formation of immature, noninfectious viral particles.

【602】Cobicistat is a mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Inhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism by cobicistat and increases the systemic exposure of CYP3A substrates (eg, atazanavir).

【603】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【604】Refer to individual monographs.

【605】Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【606】Pediatric: In pediatric patients age 12 to 17 years, when administered together, both atazanavir and cobicistat exposure were higher than in adults; differences were not clinically significant (Tybost prescribing information 2019).
