【0】Patient education: Setting a broken bone in adults (The Basics)
Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this page.

【1】What is a fracture? 

【2】A "fracture" is another word for a broken bone. There are different kinds of fractures, depending on how the bone breaks. When a bone breaks, it might crack, break all of the way through, or shatter.

【3】If a broken bone sticks out of the skin or can be seen through a wound, doctors call it an "open" fracture. If not, doctors call it a "closed" fracture.

【4】How are fractures treated? 

【5】Treatment depends, in part, on the type of fracture you have and how serious it is. The goal of treatment is to have the ends of the broken bone line up with each other so the bone can heal.

【6】If the ends of your broken bone are not in line with each other, your doctor will need to line them up. To do this, they can sometimes move your bone to the correct position without doing surgery. This is called "setting" the bone. Doctors also use the term "closed fracture reduction."

【7】After the bone is set, the doctor will put a cast, splint, or brace on so it can heal.

【8】What happens when setting a broken bone? 

【9】When it is time for the doctor to set your broken bone:

【10】 You might get an "IV," which is a thin tube that goes into a vein. This can be used to give you fluids and medicines.

【11】 You will get pain medicines to make sure that you do not feel pain during the procedure. Types of pain medicines include:

【12】• Local – This type of medicine numbs a small part of your body so you don't feel pain.

【13】• Regional – This type of medicine blocks pain in 1 area of your body, such as an arm, a leg, or the lower half of your body.

【14】 You might also get "sedative" medicines. These help you relax, feel sleepy, and not remember the procedure.

【15】 The doctors and nurses will monitor your breathing, blood pressure, and heart rate during the procedure.

【16】 The doctor will carefully move the bones so they are back in line. After the bones are in the right place, the doctor will use a splint or cast to hold the bone in the correct position as it heals.

【17】 The length of the procedure will depend on the type and location of the fracture and how easy it is to get the bones in line.

【18】What happens after setting a broken bone? 

【19】After your procedure, the staff will watch you closely as your anesthesia wears off. Most people are able to go home the same day.

【20】How do I care for myself at home? 

【21】Ask the doctor or nurse what you should do when you go home. Make sure that you understand exactly what you need to do to care for yourself. Ask questions if there is anything you do not understand.

【22】 If you got a splint or brace, wear it as you were shown. This supports your broken bone. Some fractures are put in a cast right away. Other fractures are not put in a cast until after the swelling goes down.

【23】 If you have a cast, do not get it wet unless you are told that it is waterproof.

【24】 You might have to limit your activity or movements until your bone is healed. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what activities are safe for you to do.

【25】 Prop your injured arm or leg on pillows, keeping it above the level of your heart. This might help lessen pain and swelling.

【26】 You might want to take NSAID medicines for swelling and pain. These include ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (sample brand name: Aleve).

【27】 You might also have gotten a prescription for stronger pain medicines to take for a short time. If so, follow the instructions for taking them.

【28】 Ice can help with pain and swelling. Place an ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel over the painful part. Never put ice right on the skin. Do not leave the ice on more than 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Use for the first 24 to 48 hours after an injury.

【29】 If you smoke, try to stop. Broken bones take longer to heal if you smoke.

【30】What are the risks of setting a broken bone? 

【31】Your doctor will talk to you about all of the possible risks, and answer your questions. Possible risks include:

【32】 Nerve damage

【33】 Blood clots

【34】 The bone not healing correctly

【35】 Weakness

【36】 Ongoing pain

【37】 Surgery might be needed if the bone does not heal properly

【38】When should I call the doctor? 

【39】**Call for emergency help right away** (in the US and Canada, **call 9-1-1** ) if:

【40】 You feel short of breath or have trouble breathing.

【41】 You have sharp or severe chest pain.

【42】 You are coughing up blood.

【43】 You have severe leg pain that suddenly gets worse soon after injury.

【44】Call for advice if:

【45】 The arm or leg in the splint or cast becomes swollen or starts to hurt more.

【46】 Your splint or cast becomes too tight and uncomfortable, or your fingers or toes turn pale blue or gray.

【47】 There is a bad smell or drainage coming from your splint or cast.

【48】 You have a fever of 100.4°F  or higher or chills.

【49】 Your cast feels too loose.

【50】 You notice a crack in your cast, or it becomes soft.

【51】 You have less feeling or movement in your toes or fingers.

【52】 The skin becomes red and irritated around the cast, or the redness starts to spread up your arm or leg.

【53】 Your cast gets wet, and it is not supposed to get wet.
