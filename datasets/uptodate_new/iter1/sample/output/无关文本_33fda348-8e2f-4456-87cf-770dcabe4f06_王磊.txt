Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this page.

【1】What is an epinephrine autoinjector? 

【2】An epinephrine autoinjector (sample brand names: EpiPen, Auvi-Q) is a device that gives a person a shot of a medicine called "epinephrine." Epinephrine is used to treat a severe allergic reaction, also called "anaphylaxis." A severe allergic reaction can happen after a person eats a food, takes a medicine, or is stung by an insect they are allergic to.

【3】Epinephrine is the same as the hormone adrenaline. Your body makes its own adrenaline when you are scared, stressed, or having an allergic reaction. Using an autoinjector just gives you more adrenaline than your body can make on its own.

【4】What are the symptoms of an allergic reaction? 

【5】Symptoms can include:

【6】 Hives – These are raised patches of skin that are very itchy .

【7】 Puffiness of the face, eyelids, ears, mouth, hands, or feet

【8】 Redness or itching of the skin (without hives)

【9】 Runny nose or swelling of the tongue

【10】 Wheezing or trouble breathing

【11】 Vomiting or diarrhea

【12】 Feeling dizzy or passing out

【13】 Death (although this is rare)

【14】When should I use my epinephrine autoinjector? 

【15】Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to use your autoinjector. Most doctors recommend that you use it right away when you have an allergic reaction and:

【16】 Have trouble breathing or feel like your throat is tight

【17】 Feel dizzy or like you are going to pass out

【18】If your doctor prescribed an autoinjector for your child, use it right away when your child has an allergic reaction and:

【19】 Seems groggy or passes out

【20】 Vomits a lot

【21】 Coughs a lot

【22】 Has hives all over their body

【23】How do I use an epinephrine autoinjector? 

【24】Your autoinjector will come with directions. It's important to read the directions so you know what to do **before** you actually need to use it.

【25】These are the general steps:

【26】 Take the autoinjector out of its case.

【27】 Hold the autoinjector in your hand. Make sure that your fingers aren't covering either end.

【28】 Take off the safety cap (or caps).

【29】 If you're giving the injection to a child or someone who might have trouble staying still, hold their leg so they can't move.

【30】 Press the tip firmly into the outer thigh – The needle in the autoinjector can go through clothes .

【31】 Hold it in place for at least 2 to 3 seconds.

【32】After you use an autoinjector, **call for an ambulance** (in the US and Canada, **call 9-1-1** ) or have someone drive you to the emergency department. This is because epinephrine doesn't last very long in the body, and symptoms can sometimes come back as it wears off. In the hospital, doctors can watch you and give you more medicine if needed.

【33】What if the autoinjector doesn't stop my symptoms? 

【34】The medicine in the autoinjector should stop your symptoms within a few minutes. But if your symptoms don't improve, get worse, or return before you reach the hospital, you will need another dose.

【35】Some autoinjectors have 2 doses of medicine in them, but most have only 1. If your autoinjector has only 1 dose, you will need to use a second autoinjector.

【36】What are the side effects of epinephrine? 

【37】Epinephrine can cause short-term side effects, such as:

【38】 Fast or pounding heartbeat

【39】 Feeling nervous, shaky, or dizzy

【40】 Headache

【41】What else should I know?

【42】Know where to keep your autoinjectors:

【43】 It's important to keep your autoinjector at room temperature. Do not leave it in places that could get too hot or cold, like your car. You can buy small cases, bags, or belts meant for carrying autoinjectors.

【44】 Carry at least 1 autoinjector with you at all times in case of an allergic reaction. Tell your family members where you keep it. That way, if you have an allergic reaction but can't get your autoinjector, another person can get it and use it on you.

【45】 If your child has an autoinjector, bring it wherever they go. You should also keep at least 1 at your child's school and day care, and with other regular caregivers.

【46】Know when your epinephrine expires:

【47】 Check the dates on your autoinjectors. It is best to use one that has not expired. Over time, the epinephrine might not work as well. Check the dates on all of your autoinjectors regularly. Call your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist if they have expired and you need a new prescription.

【48】 In an emergency, using an expired autoinjector is better than not using one at all.

【49】Learn more about cost:

【50】 Some brands of autoinjectors can be expensive. The amount you have to pay depends on where you live, which autoinjector you have, and your health insurance.

【51】 If you are worried about the cost, talk to your doctor or nurse. You might be able to get a different type of autoinjector that is less expensive.
