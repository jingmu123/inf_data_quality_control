【36】_**Concerns related to adverse effects:**_

【37】• Hyperuricemia: Increases in serum uric acid have occurred, usually within the first 4 weeks of treatment initiation, and persisted throughout treatment. Assess uric acid levels periodically as clinically indicated. Individuals who have a prior history of gout are at increased risk; monitor for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia and initiate treatment with urate-lowering drugs as appropriate.

Risk is increased in patients >60 years of age, those taking corticosteroid or fluoroquinolone drugs, and patients with renal failure; consider alternative therapy in patients with a history of tendon disorders or tendon rupture. Consider discontinuing therapy if joint pain, swelling, or inflammation occurs; discontinue immediately if tendon rupture occurs.

【94】Breastfeeding Considerations

【95】It is not known if bempedoic acid or ezetimibe are present in breast milk.

【96】Monitoring Parameters

【97】Monitor lipid levels within 8 to 12 weeks of therapy initiation; signs/symptoms of hyperuricemia, assess uric acid levels as clinically indicated; signs/symptoms of tendon rupture (eg, joint pain, swelling, inflammation).

【98】Mechanism of Action

【99】Bempedoic acid: An adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL) inhibitor that lowers LDL-C by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver. ACL is an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Bempedoic acid and its active metabolite, ESP15228, require coenzyme A (CoA) activation by very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSVL1) to ETC-1002-CoA and ESP15228-CoA, respectively. ACSVL1 is expressed primarily in the liver. Inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in decreased cholesterol synthesis in the liver and lowers LDL-C in blood via upregulation of low-density lipoprotein receptors.

【100】Ezetimibe: Inhibits absorption of cholesterol at the brush border of the small intestine via the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like1. This leads to a decreased delivery of cholesterol to the liver, reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores, and an increased clearance of cholesterol from the blood; decreases total C, LDL-C, ApoB, and triglycerides while increasing HDL-cholesterol.
