【82】Warnings/Precautions

【83】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【84】• Altered cardiac conduction: Saquinavir/ritonavir prolongs the QT interval, potentially leading to torsade de pointes, and prolongs the PR interval, potentially leading to heart block. Second- or third-degree AV block has been reported (rare). An ECG should be performed for all patients prior to starting saquinavir/ritonavir therapy; do not initiate therapy in patients with a baseline QT interval ≥450 msec or diagnosed with long QT syndrome. If baseline QT interval <450 msec, may initiate saquinavir/ritonavir, but a subsequent ECG is recommended after ~10 days of therapy. For patients already receiving saquinavir/ritonavir that require concomitant therapy with another medication with the potential to prolong the QT interval, may initiate the concomitant therapy if baseline QT interval <450 msec, but a subsequent ECG is recommended after 3 to 4 days of therapy. If subsequent QT interval is prolonged over baseline by >20 msec, therapy should be discontinued. Patients who may be at increased risk for QT- or PR-interval prolongation include those with heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, hepatic impairment, electrolyte abnormalities, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, structural heart disease, or those with pre-existing cardiac conduction abnormalities; ECG monitoring is recommended for these patients. Discontinue therapy if significant arrhythmia or PR prolongation occur.

【85】• Fat redistribution: May cause redistribution of fat (eg, buffalo hump, peripheral wasting with increased abdominal girth, cushingoid appearance).

【86】• Immune reconstitution syndrome: Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome resulting in the occurrence of an inflammatory response to an indolent or residual opportunistic infection during initial HIV treatment or activation of autoimmune disorders (eg, Graves’ disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome) later in therapy; further evaluation and treatment may be required.

【87】• Increased cholesterol: Increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides have been reported; screening should be done prior to therapy and periodically throughout treatment.

【88】• Photosensitivity reactions: May cause photosensitivity reactions (eg, exposure to sunlight may cause severe sunburn, skin rash, redness, or itching); advise patient to avoid exposure to sunlight and artificial light sources (eg, sunlamps, tanning bed/booth) and to wear protective clothing, wide-brimmed hats, sunglasses, and lip sunscreen (SPF ≥15). Sunscreen should be used (broad-spectrum sunscreen or physical sunscreen \[preferred\] or sunblock with SPF ≥15) (HHS \[pediatric\] 2016).

【89】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【90】• Diabetes: Changes in glucose tolerance, hyperglycemia, exacerbation of diabetes, DKA, and new-onset diabetes mellitus have been reported in patients receiving protease inhibitors.

【91】• Electrolyte imbalances: Correct electrolyte abnormalities prior to treatment and monitor potassium and magnesium levels during therapy.

【92】• Hemophilia A or B: Use with caution in patients with hemophilia A or B; increased bleeding during protease inhibitor therapy has been reported.

【93】• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with underlying mild-to-moderate hepatic disease, including hepatitis B or C, cirrhosis, or chronic alcoholism; may cause hepatitis, portal hypertension, jaundice, and/or exacerbate preexisting hepatic dysfunction; contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. Discontinue saquinavir/ritonavir if severe hepatotoxicity occurs.

【94】• Lactose intolerance: Contains lactose; use not recommended in patients with rare hereditary disorders of lactose intolerance (eg, congenital lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption).

【95】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【96】• Appropriate use: Must be used in combination with ritonavir. Not recommended for use in combination with cobicistat; dosing recommendations for this combination have not been established.

【97】• Cross-resistance to other HIV drugs: Continued administration after loss of viral suppression efficacy may increase the likelihood of cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors. Promptly discontinue therapy if viral suppression response is lost.

【546】Reproductive Considerations

【547】Contraception is not required to initiate or continue antiretroviral therapy (ART). Patients with HIV not planning to become pregnant may use any available type of contraception, considering possible drug interactions and contraindications of the specific method. Consult the drug interactions database for more detailed information specific to use of saquinavir and specific contraceptives.

【548】Based on the Health and Humans Services (HHS) perinatal HIV guidelines, saquinavir (unboosted or boosted with ritonavir) is not one of the recommended antiretroviral agents for use in patients with HIV who are trying to conceive.

【549】Maximum viral suppression sustained below the limits of detection prior to conception is recommended for all persons with HIV who are planning a pregnancy. Optimization of the health of the person who will become pregnant is recommended. Selection of or changes to a specific antiretroviral regimen prior to pregnancy should be done as part of a shared decision-making process. In most cases, recommendations from the HHS perinatal HIV guidelines (based on data obtained from cisgender women) can be applied to transgender and gender diverse people assigned female sex at birth.

【550】Health care providers caring for couples planning a pregnancy when one or both partners are diagnosed with HIV may contact the National Perinatal HIV Hotline  for clinical consultation (HHS \[perinatal\] 2023).

【551】Pregnancy Considerations

【552】Saquinavir crosses the human placenta.

【553】Outcome information specific to saquinavir use in pregnancy is no longer being reviewed and updated in the Health and Humans Services (HHS) perinatal guidelines. The HHS perinatal HIV guidelines do not recommend saquinavir (unboosted or boosted with ritonavir) as one of the recommended antiretroviral agents for use during pregnancy and patients who are pregnant should be changed to a preferred or alternative therapy.

【554】Maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age infants. Actual risks may be influenced by maternal factors, such as disease severity, gestational age at initiation of therapy, and specific ART regimen; therefore, close fetal monitoring is recommended. Because there is clear benefit to appropriate treatment, maternal ART should not be withheld due to concerns for adverse neonatal outcomes. Long-term follow-up is recommended for all infants exposed to antiretroviral medications; children not diagnosed with HIV but who were exposed to ART in utero or as a neonate and develop significant organ system abnormalities of unknown etiology (particularly of the CNS or heart) should be evaluated for potential metabolic dysfunction. The risk of hepatic dysfunction and gestational diabetes may be increased in pregnant patients taking protease inhibitors. Consider performing the standard glucose screening test earlier in pregnancy in patients who initiated protease inhibitor therapy prior to conception.

【555】ART is recommended for all pregnant people with HIV to maximize their health, maintain the viral load below the limit of detection and reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. Selection of or changes to a specific antiretroviral regimen during pregnancy should be done as part of a shared decision-making process. Patients on fully suppressive regimens prior to pregnancy generally may continue the same regimen considering known pregnancy outcomes and pharmacokinetic data. Monitoring of patients who are pregnant is more frequent than in patients who are not pregnant. ART initiated during pregnancy can be modified after delivery. In most cases, recommendations from the HHS perinatal HIV guidelines (based on data obtained from cisgender women) can be applied to transgender and gender diverse people assigned female sex at birth.

【556】Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes following exposure to ART is ongoing. Health care providers should enroll all patients exposed to antiretroviral medications during pregnancy in the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry . Enrollment should be done as early in pregnancy as possible.

【557】Health care providers caring for pregnant patients with HIV and their infants may contact the National Perinatal HIV Hotline  for clinical consultation (HHS \[perinatal\] 2023).

【558】Monitoring Parameters

【559】**Note:** The absolute CD4 cell count is currently recommended to monitor immune status in children of all ages; CD4 percentage can be used as an alternative in children <5 years of age. This recommendation is based on the use of absolute CD4 cell counts in the current pediatric HIV infection stage classification and as thresholds for urgency of initiation of antiretroviral treatment (HHS \[pediatric\] 2017).

【560】ECG (baseline and after 3 to 4 days of therapy); Prior to initiation of therapy: Genotypic resistance testing, CD4 and viral load (every 3 to 4 months), CBC with differential, LFTs, BUN, creatinine, lipid panel, electrolytes, glucose, and urinalysis (every 6 to 12 months), and assessment of readiness for adherence with medication regimen. At initiation and with any change in treatment regimen: CBC with differential, electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, glucose, LFTs, bilirubin, urinalysis (at initiation), BUN, creatinine, albumin, total protein, lipid panel (at initiation), CD4, and viral load. After 1 to 2 weeks of therapy: Signs of medication toxicity and adherence. After 2 to 4 weeks of therapy: CBC with differential, viral load, signs of medication toxicity, and adherence; then every 3 to 4 months: CBC with differential, electrolytes, glucose, LFTs, bilirubin, BUN, creatinine, CD4, viral load, signs of medication toxicity, and adherence. Every 6 to 12 months: Lipid panel and urinalysis. CD4 monitoring frequency may be decreased to every 6 to 12 months in children who are adherent to therapy if the value is well above the threshold for opportunistic infections, viral suppression is sustained, and the clinical status is stable for more than 2 to 3 years. In patients with known or suspected complex drug resistance patterns, phenotypic resistance testing (usually in addition to genotypic resistance testing) should be performed (HHS \[pediatric\] 2017). Monitor for growth and development, signs of HIV-specific physical conditions, HIV disease progression, opportunistic infections or arrhythmias.
