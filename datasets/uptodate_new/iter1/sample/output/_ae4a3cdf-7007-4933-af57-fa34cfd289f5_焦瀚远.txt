【8】Brand Names: Canada

【9】*   Fungizone IV

【10】Pharmacologic Category

【11】*   Antifungal Agent, Parenteral

【12】Dosing: Adult

【13】**Note: Formulation:** Conventional amphotericin formulations (deoxycholate \[Amphocin, Fungizone\]) may be confused with lipid-based formulations (AmBisome, Abelcet, Amphotec). Lipid-based and conventional formulations are **not** interchangeable and have different dosage recommendations. Overdoses have occurred when conventional formulations were dispensed inadvertently for lipid-based products. **Premedication:** To minimize infusion-related immediate reactions, premedicate with the following 30 to 60 minutes prior to drug administration: acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and/or hydrocortisone. If the patient experiences rigors during the infusion, meperidine may be administered . Preinfusion administration of 1 L of NS may reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity during treatment . **Test dose:** A test dose of 1 mg in 20 mL D5W administered over 20 to 30 minutes may be considered.

【14】**Usual dosage range: IV:** 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day (range: 0.3 to 1.5 mg/kg/day); maximum dose: 1.5 mg/kg/day. **Note:** Lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B are generally preferred for treatment of systemic infections because they demonstrate comparable efficacy and better tolerability .

【71】Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Adult

【72】The renal dosing recommendations are based upon the best available evidence and clinical expertise. Senior Editorial Team: Bruce Mueller, PharmD, FCCP, FASN, FNKF; Jason A. Roberts, PhD, BPharm (Hons), B App Sc, FSHP, FISAC; Michael Heung, MD, MS.

【73】**Note:** Due to the risks of nephrotoxicity associated with amphotericin B deoxycholate, a conventional amphotericin formulation, only use when benefits outweigh the risks. Lipid-based amphotericin preparations are associated with a lower risk of nephrotoxicity and are preferred in patients with preexisting kidney impairment (including patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis who have significant residual renal function). If using amphotericin B deoxycholate, limiting dose and duration of treatment (as clinically appropriate), extending infusion time, avoiding concomitant nephrotoxic drugs, and hydration and sodium loading with 1 L of NS prior to starting therapy may reduce the risk of acute kidney injury. Monitor kidney function closely . For routes of administration other than IV (eg, intraocular), there are no specific dosage adjustments recommended (has not been studied in patients with kidney impairment); however, need for adjustment is unlikely .

【74】_**Kidney impairment prior to treatment initiation:**_

【75】**Altered kidney function: IV:** No dosage adjustment necessary for any degree of kidney impairment (only 2% to 5% excreted in biologically active form) .

【76】**Augmented renal clearance (measured urinary CrCl ≥130 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ):**

【77】**Note:** Augmented renal clearance (ARC) is a condition that occurs in certain critically ill patients without organ dysfunction and with normal serum creatinine concentrations. Younger patients (<55 years of age) admitted post trauma or major surgery are at highest risk for ARC, as well as those with sepsis, burns, or hematologic malignancies. An 8- to 24-hour measured urinary CrCl is necessary to identify these patients .

【78】**IV:** No dosage adjustment necessary .

【79】**Hemodialysis, intermittent (thrice weekly):** Not significantly dialyzable :

【80】**IV:** No dosage adjustment necessary .

【81】**Peritoneal dialysis:** Not likely to be significantly dialyzable (highly protein bound with poor peritoneal penetration) :

【82】**IV:** No dosage adjustment necessary .

【83】**CRRT:** **IV:** No dosage adjustment necessary .

【84】**PIRRT (eg, sustained, low-efficiency diafiltration): IV:** No dosage adjustment necessary .

【85】_**Nephrotoxicity during treatment:**_ Consider switching to an alternative antifungal agent or a lipid-based amphotericin formulation . However, if continued use of amphotericin B deoxycholate is deemed clinically appropriate, may consider interrupting therapy for 24 to 48 hours, then resume at one-half of the usual daily dose; the dosage may then be increased to the maximally tolerated dose . This approach will likely decrease amphotericin deoxycholate exposures, and so should be avoided in the acute phase of serious infections .

【86】Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Adult

【87】No dosage adjustment provided in manufacturer’s labeling.

【88】Dosing: Obesity: Adult

【89】The recommendations for dosing in patients with obesity are based upon the best available evidence and clinical expertise. Senior Editorial Team: Jeffrey F. Barletta, PharmD, FCCM; Manjunath P. Pai, PharmD, FCP; Jason A. Roberts, PhD, BPharm (Hons), B App Sc, FSHP, FISAC.

【90】**Class 1, 2, or 3 obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 ): Note:** Lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B are generally preferred for treatment of systemic infections because they demonstrate comparable efficacy and better tolerability .

【91】**IV:** Use **adjusted body weight** for weight-based dose calculations . In more severe infections, may consider using **actual body weight** for weight-based dose calculations, although this may be associated with increased toxicity due to higher doses . When dosing with either **adjusted or actual body weight** , a maximum daily dose of 150 mg is suggested (extrapolated from a study of a similar product ). Refer to "Dosing: Adult" for indication-specific doses.

【92】**Rationale for recommendations:** There are sparse data describing the effect of obesity on dosing requirements for polyene antifungals . There are no human pharmacokinetic studies for amphotericin B deoxycholate in patients with obesity. Even though amphotericin B deoxycholate exhibits a V d of 2.4 to 5.1 L/kg , distribution into adipose tissue appears to be limited; therefore, does not support routinely dosing based on actual body weight . Use **adjusted body weight** for weight-based dose calculations (expert opinion). For more severe infections, may consider using **actual body weight** for dose calculations .

【93】Dosing: Older Adult

【94】Refer to adult dosing.

【95】Dosing: Pediatric

【96】**Dosage guidance:**

【97】**Safety:**

【98】**Medication errors, including deaths, have resulted from confusion between lipid-based forms of amphotericin (eg, Abelcet, AmBisome) and amphotericin B deoxycholate (conventional amphotericin B for injection); amphotericin B deoxycholate doses should not exceed 1.5 mg/kg/day.** Dose units and presentation (eg, mg/kg, **mg** , mg/ **mL** , **mcg** ) vary by route of administration (IV, Intrathecal, Intravesical, Intravitreal); use caution.

【99】_Premedications:_ To minimize infusion-related immediate reactions, may premedicate with the following 30 to 60 minutes prior to administration: acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and/or hydrocortisone. If the patient experiences rigors during the infusion, meperidine may be administered. Adequate hydration and preinfusion administration of NS may reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity during amphotericin B treatment .

【100】**Clinical considerations: Test dose:** Although the manufacturer's labeling suggests a test dose and dose escalation approach, most experts recommend initiation of therapy at the target dose . A test dose of 1 **mg** administered over 20 to 30 minutes may be considered .

【101】**General dosing:**

【102】IV: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/dose once daily; maximum daily dose: 1.5 mg/kg/ **day** . Once therapy has been established, may administer 1.5 mg/kg/dose every other day .

【196】Warnings/Precautions

【197】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【198】• Anaphylaxis: Has been reported with amphotericin B-containing drugs; facilities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be available during administration due to the possibility of anaphylactic reaction. If severe respiratory distress occurs, the infusion should be immediately discontinued; during the initial dosing, the drug should be administered under close clinical observation.

【199】• Infusion reactions: Acute reactions (eg, fever, rigors, hypotension, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, tachypnea) may occur 1 to 3 hours after starting an intravenous infusion. These reactions are usually more common with the first few doses and generally diminish with subsequent doses. Avoid rapid infusion to prevent hypotension, hypokalemia, arrhythmias, and shock.

【200】• Leukoencephalopathy: Has been reported following administration of amphotericin B. Total body irradiation has been reported to be a possible predisposition.

【201】• Nephrotoxicity: May cause nephrotoxicity; risk factors include underlying renal disease, concomitant nephrotoxic medications and daily and/or cumulative dosing of amphotericin. Avoid use with other nephrotoxic drugs; drug-induced renal toxicity usually improves with interrupting therapy, decreasing dosage, or increasing dosing interval. However permanent impairment may occur, especially in patients receiving a large cumulative dose (eg, >5 g) and in those also receiving other nephrotoxic drugs. Hydration and sodium repletion prior to administration may reduce the risk of developing nephrotoxicity. Frequent monitoring of renal function is recommended.

【202】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【203】• Heart failure: In a scientific statement from the American Heart Association, amphotericin has been determined to be an agent that may cause direct myocardial toxicity (magnitude: moderate/major) (AHA \[Page 2016\]).

【204】• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.

【205】**_Special populations:_**

【206】• Patients with neutropenia: Pulmonary reactions may occur in patients with neutropenia receiving leukocyte transfusions; separation of the infusions as much as possible is advised.

【302】Pregnancy Considerations

【303】Amphotericin crosses the placenta and enters the fetal circulation. Amphotericin B is recommended for the treatment of serious systemic fungal diseases in pregnant women. Refer to current guidelines .

【304】Breastfeeding Considerations

【305】It is not known if amphotericin is excreted into breast milk. Due to its poor oral absorption, systemic exposure to the nursing infant is expected to be decreased; however, because of the potential for toxicity, breast-feeding is not recommended by the manufacturer (Mactal-Haaf 2001).

【306】Monitoring Parameters

【307】BUN and serum creatinine levels should be determined every other day when therapy is increased and at least weekly thereafter. Renal function (monitor frequently during therapy), electrolytes (especially potassium and magnesium), LFTs, temperature, PT/PTT, CBC; fluid input and output; signs of hypokalemia (muscle weakness, cramping, drowsiness, ECG changes, etc); signs/symptoms of infusion-related reaction (fever, shaking chills, hypotension, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, tachypnea).

【308】Mechanism of Action

【309】Binds to ergosterol altering cell membrane permeability in susceptible fungi and causing leakage of cell components with subsequent cell death. Proposed mechanism suggests that amphotericin causes an oxidation-dependent stimulation of macrophages (Lyman 1992).

【310】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【311】Absorption: Poor oral absorption

【312】Distribution: Concentrations in fluids from inflamed pleura, synovium, and aqueous humor are approximately 2/3 concurrent plasma concentrations; penetration into the vitreous humor or normal amniotic fluids is minimal. Description of penetration into peritoneum varies; may be improved with inflammation .

【313】CNS penetration:

【314】Preterm neonates (GA: 27.4 ± 5 weeks): High interpatient variability; 40% to 90% of serum concentrations (Baley 1990)

【315】Adults: Poor (inflamed or noninflamed meninges)

【316】V d : Pediatric patients : Highly variable; reported range: 0.38 to 3.99 L/kg 

【317】Protein binding, plasma: 90%

【318】Half-life elimination:

【319】Premature neonates (GA: 27.4 ± 5 weeks): 14.8 hours (range: 5 to 82 hours) (Baley 1990)

【320】Infants and Children : 18.1 ± 6.6 hours (range: 11.9 to 40.3 hours) (Benson 1989)

【321】Adults: Biphasic: Initial: 15 to 48 hours; Terminal: 15 days

【322】Time to peak: Within 1 hour following a 4- to 6-hour dose

【323】Excretion: Urine ; ~40% eliminated over a 7-day period and may be detected in urine for at least 7 weeks after discontinued use

【324】Clearance (Benson, 1989):

【325】Infants and Children : 0.57 ± 0.152 mL/minute/kg

【326】Children and Adolescents : 0.24 ± 0.02 mL/minute/kg焦瀚远
