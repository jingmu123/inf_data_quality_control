【60】Warnings/Precautions

【61】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【62】• Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during infusion and within 4 hours after the infusion. Anaphylaxis has occurred as early as the sixth infusion and as late as 1 year after treatment initiation. During infusion, appropriate medical treatment should be immediately available. Depending on severity of hypersensitivity reaction, management may include temporary interruption, lowering infusion rate, and/or administration of antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids. If interrupted, the infusion may be resumed at a slower rate with increases as tolerated. Pretreatment with antipyretics and/or antihistamines may prevent subsequent reactions in those cases where symptomatic treatment was required. If anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity occurs, immediately discontinue infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment.

【63】• Antibody formation: Patients have developed anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to sebelipase alfa and may be more likely to experience hypersensitivity reactions. Some patients with neutralizing antibodies experienced decreased growth velocity. No clear association exists between the development of ADA and decreased efficacy in patients.

【64】**_Dosage form specific issues:_**

【65】• Allergy to egg or egg products: Sebelipase alfa is produced in egg whites of genetically engineered chickens; consider the risks and benefits in patients with known systemic hypersensitivity reactions to eggs or egg products.

【66】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【67】From clinical trials, the reported incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was 20% for all patients ; however, the incidence in the infant age group was 64% (nine of 14 patients); patients were not premedicated prior to sebelipase alfa infusions during the trials. Hypersensitivity reaction presentation in two or more patients included the following signs and symptoms: Abdominal pain, agitation, fever, chills, diarrhea, eczema, edema, hypertension, irritability, laryngeal edema, nausea, pallor, pruritus, rash, and vomiting.

【86】Use: Labeled Indications

【87】**Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency:** Treatment of patients with lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency

【88】Metabolism/Transport Effects

【89】None known.

【90】Drug Interactions  

【91】There are no known significant interactions.

【92】Pregnancy Considerations

【93】Adverse events were not observed in animal reproduction studies. Sebelipase alfa is a recombinant form of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), an essential enzyme required for lipid metabolism .

【94】Breastfeeding Considerations

【95】It is not known if sebelipase alfa is present in breast milk.

【96】According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and the benefits of treatment to the mother.

【97】Monitoring Parameters

【98】Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction (during infusion and for at least 4 hours after completion of infusion); lipid panel; anti-drug antibody assessment; hepatic function (ALT).

【99】Mechanism of Action

【100】Sebelipase alfa binds to cell surface receptors via glycans expressed on the protein and is subsequently internalized into lysosomes. Sebelipase alfa catalyzes the lysosomal hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides to free cholesterol, glycerol, and free fatty acids. In patients with lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency, replacement with sebelipase alfa, a recombinant form of LAL, results in improvement in disease-related hepatic and lipid parameters.

【101】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【102】Onset:

【103】LDL-c and triglycerides reduction: Within 8 weeks; a transient increase in these values occurs during first 2 to 4 weeks of treatment
