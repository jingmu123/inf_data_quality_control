【87】Warnings/Precautions

【88】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【89】• Colitis: Use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including _Clostridioides difficile_ \-associated diarrhea (CDAD); CDAD has been observed >2 months postantibiotic treatment. Discontinue drug if significant diarrhea, abdominal cramps, or passage of blood and mucus occurs.

【90】• Superinfection: The use of clindamycin may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, particularly yeasts, in the vagina. Treatment-related moniliasis and vaginitis have been reported.

【91】**_Special populations:_**

【92】• Atopic patients: Use with caution in atopic patients.

【93】**_Dosage form specific issues:_**

【94】• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension and cardiovascular collapse (AAP \["Inactive" 1997\]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates. See manufacturer’s labeling.

【95】• Topical foam: Topical foam may cause irritation especially when used with abrasive, desquamating or peeling agents; avoid contact with eyes, mouth, lips, mucous membranes, or broken skin.

【96】• Topical pledget or solution: Topical pledget and topical solution contain an alcohol base and may cause eye irritation or burning. Rinse with cool tap water if product comes in contact with mucous membranes, abraded skin, or eyes. Use caution when applying near mouth (unpleasant taste).

【97】• Vaginal products: May weaken condoms, or contraceptive diaphragms; barrier contraceptives are not recommended concurrently or for 3 to 7 days (depending on the product) following treatment. Avoid vaginal intercourse or use of other vaginal products (eg, douches, tampons) during therapy (Cleocin, Clinedess, Xaciato) and for 3 days after therapy (Xaciato). Vaginal cream contains ingredients that may cause eye burning and irritation; rinse with cool tap water if product comes in contact with the eyes.

【98】_**Other warnings/precautions:**_

【99】• Appropriate use: Acne: American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) acne guidelines recommend clindamycin (topical) be used in conjunction with other therapies ( _not_ as monotherapy) due to the risk of bacterial resistance. If given for mild acne, clindamycin (topical) should be used in combination with benzoyl peroxide. If given for moderate to severe acne, it should be used in combination with a topical retinoid or systemic antibiotic agent (AAD \[Zaenglein 2016\]).

【100】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【101】Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; in neonates large amounts of propylene glycol delivered orally, intravenously (eg, >3,000 mg/day), or topically have been associated with potentially fatal toxicities which can include metabolic acidosis, seizures, renal failure, and CNS depression; toxicities have also been reported in children and adults including hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures and respiratory depression; use caution .

【178】Gel: Not for ophthalmic, dermal, or oral use. Use applicator for insertion.

【179】Suppository: Remove from packaging prior to use. If applicator is used for administration, insertion should be as far as possible into the vagina without causing discomfort; wash applicator after each use. Patient should lie down after administration to minimize leakage.

【180】**Topical:**

【181】Foam: Dispense directly into cap or onto a cool surface; do not dispense directly into hands or face (foam will melt on contact with warm skin). Wash skin with mild soap and allow to fully dry. Apply in small amounts to face using fingertips and gently massage into affected areas until foam disappears. Avoid contact with eyes, mouth, lips, mucous membranes, or broken skin.

【182】Gel: Avoid contact with eyes.

【183】Lotion: Shake well immediately before using.

【184】Solution or pledget: Avoid contact with eyes, mouth or other mucous membranes; solution/pledget contains an alcohol base and if inadvertent contact with mucous membranes occurs, rinse with liberal amounts of water. Remove pledget from foil immediately before use; discard after single use. May use more than one pledget for each application to cover area.

【185】Administration: Pediatric

【186】Intravaginal: Do not use for topical therapy, instillation in the eye, or oral administration. Wash hands prior to use.

【187】Cream: Fill applicator with cream, then insert into vagina as far as possible without causing discomfort; expel cream. Use each disposable applicator only once; discard applicator after use.

【188】Gel: Not for ophthalmic, dermal, or oral use. Use applicator for insertion.

【189】Suppository: Remove from packaging; if applicator is used for administration, place suppository into applicator and insert applicator into vagina as far as possible without causing discomfort and expel suppository.

【190】Topical: For dermal topical use only. Do not use intravaginally; instill in the eye, or administer orally. Avoid contact with eyes, mouth, lips, mucous membranes, or broken skin.

【191】Foam: Before applying foam, wash affected area with mild soap, then dry. Remove cap, hold can at an upright angle, and dispense foam directly into the cap or onto a cool surface; do not dispense foam directly onto hands or face (foam will melt upon contact with warm skin). If can is warm or foam is runny, run can under cold water. Use fingertips to pick up small amounts of foam and gently massage into affected area until foam disappears. Wash hands after applying. Avoid fire, flame, or smoking during or immediately following application.

【192】Gel, pledget, solution: Solution/pledget contains an alcohol base and if inadvertent contact with mucous membranes occurs, rinse with liberal amounts of water. Remove pledget from foil immediately before use; discard after single use. May use more than one pledget for each application to cover area.

【193】Lotion: Shake well immediately before use; apply topically.

【206】Drug Interactions  

【207】**Note** : Interacting drugs may **not be individually listed below** if they are part of a group interaction (eg, individual drugs within “CYP3A4 Inducers \[Strong\]” are NOT listed). For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program by clicking on the “Launch drug interactions program” link above.

【208】Erythromycin (Systemic): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Clindamycin (Topical). Management: Consider avoiding the concomitant use of systemic erythromycin and topical clindamycin when treating acne vulgaris. This recommendation does not appear to apply to intravaginal use of clindamycin for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【209】Erythromycin (Topical): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Clindamycin (Topical). Management: Consider avoiding use of topical erythromycin and topical clindamycin at the same application site when treating acne vulgaris. This recommendation does not appear to apply to intravaginal use of clindamycin for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【210】Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents: Clindamycin (Topical) may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking effect of Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【211】Reproductive Considerations

【212】Some vaginal products contain mineral oil which may weaken condoms or contraceptive diaphragms. Therefore, use of these products are not recommended for birth control during therapy or for 3 to 7 days (depending on the product) following treatment.

【213】Pregnancy Considerations

【214】Clindamycin crosses the placenta following oral and parenteral dosing . The amount of clindamycin available systemically is less following topical and vaginal application than with IV or oral administration.

【215】Various clindamycin vaginal products are available for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Recommendations for use in pregnant patients vary by product labeling. Current guidelines note that the same oral or vaginal regimens used in nonpregnant patients may be used during pregnancy, including oral or vaginal clindamycin (CDC \[Workowski 2021\]).

【216】If treatment for acne is needed during pregnancy, topical clindamycin may be considered if an antibiotic is needed. To decrease systemic exposure, pregnant women should avoid application to inflamed skin for long periods of time, or to large body surface areas (Kong 2013).

【217】Breastfeeding Considerations

【218】It is not known if clindamycin is present in breast milk following vaginal or topical administration; clindamycin is present in breast milk following oral and IV dosing. Systemic clindamycin concentrations are less following topical and vaginal application. This minimal absorption should minimize potential exposure to a breastfeeding infant.

【219】In general, antibiotics that are present in breast milk may cause nondose-related modification of bowel flora. Monitor breastfeeding infants for GI disturbances, diarrhea, and bloody stools if maternal treatment is required (WHO 2002).

【220】Regarding vaginal or topical administration, the manufacturer states that the decision to continue or discontinue breastfeeding during therapy should take into account the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother.

【221】If clindamycin is used topically to the chest for the treatment of acne in patients who are breastfeeding, care should be taken to avoid accidental ingestion by the infant. To decrease systemic exposure, breastfeeding patients should avoid application to inflamed skin for long periods of time, or to large body surface areas (Kong 2013).

【222】Mechanism of Action

【223】Reversibly binds to 50S ribosomal subunits preventing peptide bond formation thus inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis; bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending on drug concentration, infection site, and organism

【224】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【225】Absorption: Topical solution or foam, phosphate: Minimal; Vaginal cream, phosphate: ~5%; Vaginal suppository, phosphate: ~30%

【226】Metabolism: Hepatic; forms metabolites (variable activity); Clindamycin phosphate is converted to clindamycin HCl (active)

【227】Half-life elimination: Vaginal cream: 1.5 to 2.6 hours following repeated dosing; Vaginal suppository: 11 hours (range: 4 to 35 hours, limited by absorption rate)

【228】Time to peak, serum: Vaginal cream: ~10 to 14 hours (range: 4 to 24 hours); Vaginal suppository: ~5 hours (range: 1 to 10 hours)

【229】Excretion: Urine (<0.2% with topical foam and solution)
