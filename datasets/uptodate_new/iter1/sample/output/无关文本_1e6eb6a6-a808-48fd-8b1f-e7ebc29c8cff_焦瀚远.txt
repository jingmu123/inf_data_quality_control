【60】Medication Safety Issues

【61】Pediatric patients: High-risk medication:

【62】KIDs List: Medium, high, and very high potency topical corticosteroids, when used in neonates and infants <1 year of age for diaper dermatitis, are identified on the Key Potentially Inappropriate Drugs in Pediatrics (KIDs) list; use should be avoided due to risk of adrenal suppression; systemic absorption is higher in pediatric patients than adults (strong recommendation; low quality of evidence) (PPA \[Meyers 2020\]).

【63】Metabolism/Transport Effects

【64】Refer to individual components.

【65】Drug Interactions  

【66】**Note** : Interacting drugs may **not be individually listed below** if they are part of a group interaction (eg, individual drugs within “CYP3A4 Inducers \[Strong\]” are NOT listed). For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program by clicking on the “Launch drug interactions program” link above.

【67】**Note:** Interacting drugs may **not be individually listed below** if they are part of a group interaction (eg, individual drugs within “CYP3A4 Inducers \[Strong\]” are NOT listed). For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program

【68】Calcipotriene: Hydrocortisone (Topical) may diminish the therapeutic effect of Calcipotriene. Management: Monitor for reduced calcipotriene efficacy if combined with hydrocortisone valerate. Consider separating the administration of these agents by 10 to 12 hours to minimize the risk of this potential interaction. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【69】Talimogene Laherparepvec: Antiherpetic Antivirals may diminish the therapeutic effect of Talimogene Laherparepvec. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【70】Pregnancy Considerations

【71】Systemic exposure of acyclovir and hydrocortisone after topical administration is minimal.

【72】Mechanism of Action

【73】Acyclovir: Acyclovir is converted to acyclovir monophosphate by virus-specific thymidine kinase then further converted to acyclovir triphosphate by other cellular enzymes. Acyclovir triphosphate inhibits DNA synthesis and viral replication by competing with deoxyguanosine triphosphate for viral DNA polymerase and being incorporated into viral DNA.

【74】Hydrocortisone: Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties.
