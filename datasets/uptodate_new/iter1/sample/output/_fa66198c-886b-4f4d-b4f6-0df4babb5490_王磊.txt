【51】Warnings/Precautions

【52】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【53】• CNS depression: May cause CNS depression, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks which require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving).

【54】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【55】• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (including hypertension and heart disease).

【56】• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus.

【57】• GI obstruction: Use with caution in patients with GI obstruction.

【58】• GU dysfunction: Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia and/or GU obstruction.

【59】• Increased intraocular pressure: Use with caution in patients with increased intraocular pressure, especially narrow-angle glaucoma.

【60】• Respiratory disease: Do not use for persistent cough (eg, smoking, asthma, or emphysema) or if cough is accompanied by excessive phlegm unless directed by a health care provider.

【61】• Thyroid dysfunction: Use with caution in patients with thyroid dysfunction.

【62】**_Special populations:_**

【63】• CYP2D6 poor metabolizers: Dextromethorphan is metabolized by hepatic CYP2D6. Poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 may have exaggerated or prolonged effects of dextromethorphan. Increased risk may be seen with concomitant use of potent CYP2D6 inhibitors; use with caution .

【64】• Pediatric: Antihistamines may cause excitation in young children.

【65】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【66】• Cough: Appropriate use: Underlying cause of cough should be determined prior to prescribing.

【67】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【68】Safety and efficacy for the use of cough and cold products in pediatric patients <4 years of age is limited; the AAP warns against the use of these products for respiratory illnesses in young children. Serious adverse effects including death have been reported (in some cases, high blood concentrations of pseudoephedrine were found). Many of these products contain multiple active ingredients, increasing the risk of accidental overdose when used with other products. The FDA does not recommend OTC uses for these products in pediatric patients <2 years of age, and recommends to use with caution in pediatric patients ≥2 years of age. Health care providers are reminded to ask caregivers about the use of OTC cough and cold products in order to avoid exposure to multiple medications containing the same ingredient . Antihistamines should not be used to make an infant or child sleepy. Multiple concentrations of oral liquid formulations (eg, liquid, syrup) exist; close attention must be paid to the concentration when ordering or administering. Some dosage forms contain up to 0.95% v/v alcohol.

【85】Use: Labeled Indications

【86】**Cough and upper respiratory symptoms:** Temporary relief of symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose or throat, itchy/watery eyes, cough due to minor throat and bronchial irritation, nasal congestion, nasal passages swelling) associated with the common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), sinusitis, or other upper respiratory allergies.

【87】Medication Safety Issues

【88】Older Adult: High-Risk Medication:

【89】Beers Criteria: Brompheniramine, a first-generation antihistamine, is identified in the Beers Criteria as a potentially inappropriate medication to be avoided in patients 65 years and older (independent of diagnosis or condition) due to its potent anticholinergic properties resulting in increased risk of confusion, dry mouth, constipation, and other anticholinergic effects or toxicity; use should also be avoided due to reduced clearance with advanced age and tolerance associated with use as a hypnotic. Exposure to concurrent anticholinergic drugs also increases risk of falls, delirium, and dementia; consider total anticholinergic burden when conducting medication reviews (Beers Criteria \[AGS 2023\]).

【218】Suvorexant: CNS Depressants may enhance the CNS depressant effect of Suvorexant. Management: Dose reduction of suvorexant and/or any other CNS depressant may be necessary. Use of suvorexant with alcohol is not recommended, and the use of suvorexant with any other drug to treat insomnia is not recommended. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【219】Sympathomimetics: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of other Sympathomimetics. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【220】Tedizolid: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Tedizolid may enhance the tachycardic effect of Sympathomimetics. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【226】Tricyclic Antidepressants: May enhance the vasopressor effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists. Management: Avoid, if possible, the use of alpha-/beta-agonists in patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants. If combined, monitor for evidence of increased pressor effects and consider reductions in initial dosages of the alpha-/beta-agonist. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【227】Trimeprazine: May enhance the CNS depressant effect of CNS Depressants. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【228】Umeclidinium: May enhance the anticholinergic effect of Agents with Clinically Relevant Anticholinergic Effects. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【237】Mechanism of Action

【238】Brompheniramine maleate is an antihistamine with H 1 \-receptor activity; pseudoephedrine, a sympathomimetic amine and isomer of ephedrine, acts as a decongestant in respiratory tract mucous membranes with less vasoconstrictor action than ephedrine in normotensive individuals; dextromethorphan, a nonopioid antitussive, increases cough threshold by its activity on the medulla oblongata.
