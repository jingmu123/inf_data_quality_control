Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this page.

【1】What is warfarin? 

【2】Warfarin (brand name: Jantoven) is a medicine used to prevent or treat blood clots. It is also known as Coumadin, an old brand name.

【3】What is vitamin K? 

【4】Vitamin K helps the body make proteins that are important for blood clotting and bone health. Most vitamin K comes from foods, especially plant foods like green leafy vegetables.

【5】Why do I need to watch how much vitamin K I eat? 

【6】If you take warfarin , you need to eat about the same amount of vitamin K each day. That's because the amount of vitamin K in your diet affects the amount of warfarin you need to take. Do not take vitamin K supplements unless your doctor tells you to.

【7】A dietitian (food expert) can help you manage the amount of vitamin K in your diet.

【8】You also need to eat the same amount of vitamin K in your diet if you are on certain other medicines that work like warfarin . Examples include acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon.

【9】What can I eat and drink while taking warfarin? 

【10】It is OK to eat foods with vitamin K in them. Many of these foods are a part of a healthy diet. It is important to eat about the same amount of high-vitamin K foods every day.

【11】To keep a steady amount of vitamin K in your diet:

【12】 Know how much vitamin K you are taking in each day. Try to eat the same number of servings each day, and each week, from the list of foods that are "high" and "medium" in vitamin K. Portion sizes can affect how much vitamin K you are getting.

【13】 Be aware if you are eating more foods from the "high-vitamin K" group than you normally do.

【14】 Vitamin K can also be found in some nutrition supplement drinks, natural products, multivitamins, and calcium supplements. It's OK to take the same multivitamin every day. If you use any of these, check the labels of each product so you know how much vitamin K is in them. If you are not sure, ask your doctor, nurse, pharmacist, or dietitian.

【15】 If you make a big change in the amount of vitamin K foods that you eat, or if you cannot eat for 2 or more days, tell your doctor or nurse. They might want to do a blood test to find out if you need to change your warfarin dose.
