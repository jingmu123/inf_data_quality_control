【149】Pregnancy Considerations

【150】Adverse events were observed in animal reproduction studies.

【151】Monitoring Parameters

【152】CBC with differential (baseline); number and type of stools per day for diarrhea.

【153】Mechanism of Action

【154】After conversion from the prodrug, tedizolid phosphate, tedizolid binds to the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit. This prevents the formation of a functional 70S initiation complex that is essential for the bacterial translation process and subsequently inhibits protein synthesis. Tedizolid is bacteriostatic against enterococci, staphylococci, and streptococci (Kisgen 2014).

【159】Adults: 67 to 80 L.

【160】Protein binding: 70% to 90%.

【161】Metabolism: Tedizolid phosphate is converted by phosphatases to tedizolid (active, parent drug); no other significant circulating metabolites.
