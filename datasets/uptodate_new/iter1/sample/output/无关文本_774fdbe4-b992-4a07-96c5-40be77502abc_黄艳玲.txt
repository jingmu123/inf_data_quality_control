【4】Probiotics Safety Alert October 2023

【5】The FDA has issued a Dear Healthcare Provider letter to provide safety information on the use of probiotics in preterm infants. The letter warns health care providers that preterm or very low birthweight infants given probiotics are at risk of invasive, potentially fatal disease caused by bacteria or fungi in the probiotics. The letter also includes a reminder that the FDA has not approved any probiotic product for use as a drug or biological product in infants and that the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine, universal administration of probiotics to this vulnerable population. Even though unapproved, unlicensed probiotics are sold to treat or prevent diseases or conditions in infants, including to reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. The FDA also reminds health care providers who administer probiotics containing live bacteria or yeast to treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a disease or condition that they are required to submit an Investigational New Drug Application to the agency.

【61】Warnings/Precautions

【62】**_Disease-related:_**

【63】• Immunocompromised patients: Use dietary supplements containing live bacteria or yeast with caution in immunocompromised patients. A fatal case of GI mucormycosis caused by the mold _Rhizopus oryzae_ has been previously reported in a premature infant administered a dietary supplement containing 3 species of live bacteria (FDA Safety Information 2014).

【64】**_Dosage form specific issues:_**

【65】• Interchangeability: Significant differences may exist from one preparation compared to another with respect to biologic activity and composition.

【66】• Lactose: Some products may contain lactose; use with caution in patients with lactose intolerance.

【67】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【68】• Dietary supplement: Probiotics are classified as dietary supplements; therefore, there are no safety reviews or approved therapeutic indications by the FDA. There is no conclusive evidence to support widespread use in the treatment of diarrhea.

【69】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【70】Dietary supplements containing live bacteria or yeast may be associated with a risk of invasive fungal disease in the immunocompromised. A premature neonate developed a fatal case of GI mucormycosis caused by _Rhizopus oryzae_ ; this mold was found in an unopened bottle of ABC Dophilus powder that was used to treat the infant (FDA Safety Information 2014). Case reports of _Lactobacillus_ sepsis have also been reported in at least 5 pediatric patients (ages 18 days to 17 years) treated with _Lactobacillus Rhamnosus_ GG . The AAP recommends avoiding use of probiotics in pediatric patients who are seriously or chronically ill, including ill preterm neonates and patients with indwelling medical devices or IV catheters (AAP \[Thomas 2010\]).

【71】Other trials evaluating the addition of probiotic formulations (various live bacteria/yeast have been reported) to infant formula have reported no adverse effects when used in healthy infants. Use with caution; _Lactobacillus_ \-containing products are considered a dietary supplement and therefore less regulated by the FDA in terms of production, safety and efficacy, and definitive data reporting in these areas are lacking.
