【10】**Dosage** **guidance:**

【11】**Dosing:** Individualize dose; combination product may be used as initial therapy or substituted for individual components in patients currently maintained on both agents separately or in patients not adequately controlled with monotherapy (using one of the agents or an agent within same pharmacologic class).

【12】Hypertension, dyslipidemia, angina, documented coronary artery disease, primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease

【13】**Hypertension, dyslipidemia, angina, documented coronary artery disease, primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease:** **Oral:** Initial: Amlodipine 2.5 to 5 mg/atorvastatin 10 to 20 mg once daily; dose may be titrated after 1 to 2 weeks (amlodipine component) and after 2 to 4 weeks (atorvastatin component); maximum dose: amlodipine 10 mg/atorvastatin 80 mg once daily. Patients requiring >45% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol may be initiated with atorvastatin 40 mg once daily.

【14】**Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:** Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.

【15】Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Adult

【16】No dosage adjustment necessary.

【17】Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Adult

【18】Initiate amlodipine at 2.5 mg once daily in patients with hepatic impairment. Use is contraindicated in active liver disease or decompensated cirrhosis.

【19】Dosing: Adjustment for Toxicity: Adult

【20】**Note:** If toxicity due to atorvastatin requires discontinuation, continue amlodipine (as the single drug formulation) to maintain blood pressure control.

【21】**Severe muscle symptoms or fatigue:** Promptly discontinue use; evaluate CPK, creatinine, and urinalysis for myoglobinuria .

【22】**Mild to moderate muscle symptoms:** Discontinue use until symptoms can be evaluated; evaluate patient for conditions that may increase the risk for muscle symptoms (eg, hypothyroidism, reduced renal or hepatic function, rheumatologic disorders, such as polymyalgia rheumatica, steroid myopathy, vitamin D deficiency, or primary muscle diseases). Upon resolution, resume the original or lower dose of atorvastatin. If muscle symptoms recur, discontinue atorvastatin use. After muscle symptom resolution, may use a low dose of a different statin; gradually increase if tolerated. In the absence of continued statin use, if muscle symptoms or elevated CPK continues after 2 months, consider other causes of muscle symptoms. If determined to be due to another condition aside from statin use, may resume statin therapy at the original dose  .

【23】Dosing: Older Adult

【24】Refer to adult dosing. Initiate amlodipine at 2.5 mg once daily.

【25】Adverse Reactions

【26】Contraindications

【27】Hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) to amlodipine, atorvastatin, or any component of the formulation; active liver disease or decompensated cirrhosis.

【28】_Canadian labeling:_ Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Concurrent therapy with boceprevir, cyclosporine, elbasvir/grazoprevir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, simeprevir, telaprevir, or velpatasvir/sofosbuvir; severe hypotension (systolic <90 mm Hg); patients with unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases (>3 times ULN); breastfeeding; pregnancy.

【29】Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.

【30】Warnings/Precautions

【31】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【32】• Diabetes mellitus: Increases in HbA 1c and fasting blood glucose have been reported.

【33】• Hepatotoxicity: Persistent elevations in serum transaminases have been reported; upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels. Postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure with atorvastatin have been reported and are rare.

【34】• Hypotension: Symptomatic hypotension can occur; acute hypotension upon initiation is unlikely due to the gradual onset of action. Blood pressure must be lowered at a rate appropriate for the patient's clinical condition.

【35】• Myopathy/rhabdomyolysis: Myopathy and/or rhabdomyolysis (rarely fatal) with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria has been reported. Risk factors may include hypothyroidism (uncontrolled), kidney impairment, ≥65 years of age, high doses, or concurrent use of certain other medications. Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors use has also been reported.

【36】• Peripheral edema: The most common side effect of amlodipine is peripheral edema (dose dependent); occurs within 2 to 3 weeks of starting therapy.

【37】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【38】• Aortic stenosis: Use amlodipine with extreme caution in patients with severe aortic stenosis; may reduce coronary perfusion resulting in ischemia.

【39】• Hepatic impairment and/or ethanol use: Use atorvastatin with caution in patients who consume large amounts of ethanol or have a history of liver disease. Use amlodipine with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; may require lower starting dose; titrate slowly in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

【40】• Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction: Use amlodipine with caution in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction since reduction in afterload may worsen symptoms associated with this condition (AHA/ACC \[Ommen 2020\]).

【41】• Myasthenia gravis: May rarely worsen or precipitate myasthenia gravis (MG); monitor for worsening MG if treatment is initiated (AAN \[Narayanaswami 2021\]).

【42】• Kidney impairment: Use atorvastatin with caution in patients with kidney impairment; these patients are predisposed to myopathy.

【43】• Stroke: Patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack receiving long-term therapy with high-dose (ie, 80 mg/day) atorvastatin may be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke (SPARCL Investigators, 2006). A subsequent post-hoc analysis demonstrated that patients with lacunar or hemorrhagic stroke may be at higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke; however, this finding was determined to be hypothesis generating. The overall benefit of treatment with atorvastatin (ie, reduced risk of stroke and cardiovascular events) in this population seems to outweigh the increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke if one truly exists (Goldstein 2008).

【44】**_Special populations:_**

【45】• Older adult: Use atorvastatin with caution in patients with advanced age, these patients are predisposed to myopathy.

【46】• Surgical patients: Based on current research and clinical guidelines, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be continued in the perioperative period for noncardiac and cardiac surgery (ACC/AHA \[Fleisher 2014\]; ACC/AHA \[Hillis 2011\]). Perioperative discontinuation of statin therapy is associated with an increased risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality.

【47】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【48】• Appropriate use: Secondary causes of hyperlipidemia should be ruled out prior to therapy with atorvastatin. Atorvastatin has not been studied when the primary lipid abnormality is chylomicron elevation (Fredrickson types I and V).

【49】• Titration: Peak antihypertensive effect is delayed; dosage titration of amlodipine should occur after 7 to 14 days on a given dose.

【266】Food Interactions

【267】Reproductive Considerations

【268】Adequate contraception is recommended if an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) is required in patients who may become pregnant (AHA/ACC \[Grundy 2019\]; CCS \[Pearson 2021\]).

【269】Pregnancy Considerations

【270】Amlodipine crosses the placenta .

【271】Breastfeeding Considerations

【272】Amlodipine is present in breast milk; it is not known if atorvastatin is present in breast milk.

【273】Breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer.

【274】Dietary Considerations

【275】Before initiation of therapy with atorvastatin, patients should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet for 3 to 6 months and the diet should be continued during drug therapy.

【276】Red yeast rice contains variable amounts of several compounds that are structurally similar to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, primarily monacolin K (or mevinolin) which is structurally identical to lovastatin; concurrent use of red yeast rice with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may increase the incidence of adverse and toxic effects .

【277】Monitoring Parameters

【278】Amlodipine: Blood pressure, heart rate

【279】Atorvastatin:

【280】**ACC/AHA Blood Cholesterol Guideline recommendations (ACC/AHA \[Grundy 2019\]):**

【281】**Lipid panel (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides):** Lipid profile (fasting or nonfasting) before initiating treatment. Fasting lipid profile should be rechecked 4 to 12 weeks after starting therapy and every 3 to 12 months thereafter. If 2 consecutive LDL levels are <40 mg/dL, consider decreasing the dose.

【282】**Hepatic transaminase levels:** Baseline measurement of hepatic transaminase levels (AST and ALT); measure AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase if symptoms suggest hepatotoxicity (eg, unusual fatigue or weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, dark-colored urine or yellowing of skin or sclera) during therapy.

【283】**Monitor closely for myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.** Instruct patients to report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, weakness, or brown urine, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

【284】**CPK:** CPK should not be routinely measured. Baseline CPK measurement is reasonable for some individuals (eg, family history of statin intolerance or muscle disease, clinical presentation, concomitant drug therapy that may increase risk of myopathy). May measure CPK in any patient with symptoms suggestive of myopathy (pain, tenderness, stiffness, cramping, weakness, or generalized fatigue).

【285】Evaluate for new-onset diabetes mellitus during therapy; if diabetes develops, continue statin therapy and encourage adherence to a heart-healthy diet, physical activity, a healthy body weight, and tobacco cessation.

【286】If patient develops a confusional state or memory impairment, may evaluate patient for nonstatin causes (eg, exposure to other drugs), systemic and neuropsychiatric causes, and the possibility of adverse effects associated with statin therapy.

【287】**Manufacturer's labeling:** Consider neuromuscular and serologic testing if immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy is suspected.

【288】Mechanism of Action

【289】Amlodipine: Inhibits calcium ion from entering the “slow channels” or select voltage-sensitive areas of vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarization, producing a relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle and coronary vasodilation; increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients with vasospastic angina. Amlodipine directly acts on vascular smooth muscle to produce peripheral arterial vasodilation reducing peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure.

【290】Atorvastatin: Inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis (reduces the production of mevalonic acid from HMG-CoA); this then results in a compensatory increase in the expression of LDL receptors on hepatocyte membranes and a stimulation of LDL catabolism. In addition to the ability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to decrease levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), they also possess pleiotropic properties including improved endothelial function, reduced inflammation at the site of the coronary plaque, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and anticoagulant effects .
