【3】ALERT: US Boxed Warning

【4】Abuse, misuse, and addiction:

【5】Amphetamine has a high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including amphetamine, can result in overdose and death, and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

【6】Before prescribing amphetamine, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks, proper storage of the drug, and proper disposal of any unused drug. Throughout amphetamine treatment, reassess each patient's risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.

【107】Warnings/Precautions

【108】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【109】• Cardiovascular events: Consistent with other studies, a large retrospective cohort study involving 1,200,438 children, adolescents, and young adults (aged 2 to 24 years) prescribed methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamines, amphetamine salts, pemoline, or atomoxetine found no evidence that current use of an ADHD medication increased risk for sudden cardiac death, acute MI, or stroke (Cooper 2011).

【110】• CNS effects: May impair the ability to engage in potentially hazardous activities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks that require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving).

【111】• Hypersensitivity: Angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported.

【112】• Hypertension/tachycardia: May occur; monitor blood pressure and heart rate in all patients.

【113】• Peripheral vasculopathy: Stimulants are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud phenomenon; signs/symptoms are usually mild and intermittent, and generally improve with dose reduction or discontinuation. Peripheral vasculopathy effects have been observed at different times, at therapeutic doses, and in all age groups. Digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown have been observed; further evaluation (eg, rheumatology) may be necessary in patients developing signs and symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy.

【114】• Serotonin syndrome: Potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome (SS) may occur when amphetamine is used in combination with other serotonergic agents (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, St. John's wort, tryptophan), agents that impair metabolism of serotonin (eg, monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or CYP2D6 inhibitors that impair metabolism of amphetamine. Concomitant use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors is contraindicated. If concomitant use of amphetamine with serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is indicated, initiate amphetamine at a low dose and monitor patient closely for signs and symptoms of SS. Discontinue treatment (and any concomitant serotonergic agent) immediately if signs/symptoms arise.

【115】• Visual disturbance: Difficulty in accommodation and blurred vision has been reported with the use of stimulants.

【116】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【117】• Cardiovascular disease: Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease.

【118】• Psychiatric disorders: Use with caution in patients with preexisting psychosis (may exacerbate symptoms of behavior and thought disorder) or bipolar disorder (may induce mixed/manic episode). New-onset psychosis or mania may occur with stimulant use. Patients should be screened for bipolar disorder and risk factors for developing a manic episode prior to treatment; consider discontinuation if psychotic or manic symptoms (eg, delusional thinking, hallucinations, mania). May be associated with aggressive behavior or hostility (causal relationship not established); monitor for development or worsening of these behaviors.

【119】• Seizure disorder: Limited information exists regarding stimulant use in seizure disorder. Whereas patients with ADHD are at an increased risk for seizure activity compared to the general population, a retrospective study using drug claims data showed that the use of stimulant medications was associated with a lower risk . Manufacturers of some stimulants recommend discontinuing therapy if seizures occur.

【120】• Tourette syndrome/tics: Use with caution in patients with Tourette syndrome or other tic disorders. Stimulants may exacerbate tics (motor and phonic) and Tourette syndrome; however, evidence demonstrating increased tics is limited. Evaluate for tics and Tourette syndrome prior to therapy initiation (AACAP \[Murphy 2013\]; Pliszka 2007).

【121】**_Special populations:_**

【122】• Pediatric: Appetite suppression may occur, particularly in children. Use of stimulants has been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate; monitor growth rate and weight during treatment. Monitor weight during therapy; treatment interruption may be necessary in patients who are not increasing in height or gaining weight as expected.

【123】_**Dosage form specific issues:**_

【124】• Intestinal necrosis: Adzenys ER: Cases of intestinal necrosis, including some deaths, have been reported with the concomitant use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol, two of the inactive ingredients in Adzenys ER. In these cases, patients were administered sodium polystyrene sulfonate at doses greater than 200 times the amount present in Adzenys ER, however no absolute safe levels for the interaction of sodium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol have been established.

【125】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【126】• Discontinuation of therapy: Abrupt discontinuation following high doses or for prolonged periods may result in symptoms of withdrawal.

【127】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【128】CNS stimulant treatment has been associated with sudden death in children and adolescents with preexisting structural cardiac abnormalities; one study reported methylphenidate increased risk for arrhythmia and MI in youth without congenital heart disease (Shin 2016) and a retrospective case-control study reported an association with stimulants and sudden unexplained death in youth (Gould 2009). However, as noted in reviews  several large studies have not found an association between prescription stimulants and cardiovascular events; though most retrospective studies were large (n=55,383 to 2,131,953), some had statistical power or methodological limitations (Westover 2012). A large retrospective cohort study involving 1,200,438 children and young adults (aged 2 to 24 years) prescribed ADHD medication (methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamines, amphetamine salts, pemoline, or atomoxetine) found no evidence that ADHD medication was associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events (ie, acute MI, sudden cardiac death, stroke) in current (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.31 to 1.85) or former (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.89) users compared with nonusers, nor in current compared with former users. Results were similar with multiple alternative analyses to assess for bias or study assumptions. While point estimates of relative risks for ADHD drugs did not demonstrate increased risk, the upper limit of the 95% CI suggested a doubling of the risk could not be ruled out, although absolute magnitude of increased risk would be low. Data on any individual medication, other than methylphenidate, were too sparse for separate regression analyses (Cooper 2011). Prior to treatment with medications for ADHD, the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that all children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD have a thorough cardiovascular assessment, including patient and family health histories, determination of all medications used (prescribed and over-the-counter), and a physical examination focused on cardiovascular disease risk factors. An ECG is not mandatory but is reasonable to consider prior to stimulant medication therapy. Prompt evaluation and appropriate referral and testing, if warranted, should occur if any cardiac symptoms present (Vetter 2008).

【129】Use of stimulants in children has been associated with growth suppression; monitor growth; treatment interruption may be needed. Appetite suppression may occur; monitor weight during therapy, particularly in children. Evaluation of the effect of stimulants on growth in ADHD diagnosed children <12 years receiving treatment for at least 3 years with stimulants has shown decreased height and weight changes over time compared to age matched control; height: 4.7 to 5.5 cm/year compared to 6.3 cm/year and 2.1 to 3.3 kg/year compared to 4.4 kg/year (Poulton 2016). In pediatric patients 8 to 17 years actively treated with stimulants, significant reductions in total femoral, femoral neck, and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) were observed compared to matched unmedicated cohorts; also reported were significantly more subjects in the stimulant-treated group with BMD measurements in the osteopenic range compared to matched cohorts  (Howard 2017). A longitudinal cohort-controlled trial reported no different in peak height velocity and final adult height in subjects with ADHD and/or treated with stimulants (Harstad 2014).

【300】Food Interactions

【301】Amphetamine serum levels may be reduced if taken with acidic food, juices, or vitamin C. Management: Monitor response when taken concurrently.

【302】Pregnancy Considerations

【303】Information related to use of amphetamine in pregnancy is limited (Maurovich-Horvat 2013). The majority of human data are based on illicit amphetamine/methamphetamine exposure and not from therapeutic maternal use (Golub 2005). Use of amphetamines during pregnancy may lead to an increased risk of premature birth and low birth weight; newborns may experience symptoms of withdrawal. Behavioral problems may also occur later in childhood (LaGasse 2012). Newborns should be monitored for agitation, irritability, excessive drowsiness, or feeding difficulties

【304】Data collection to monitor pregnancy outcomes following exposure to amphetamine is ongoing. Healthcare providers are encouraged to enroll females exposed to amphetamine during pregnancy in the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychostimulants .

【305】Monitoring Parameters

【306】Prior to initiation of therapy, assess medical history and family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam to assess for cardiac disease; patients should receive further evaluation if findings suggest cardiac disease, such as ECG and echocardiogram; promptly conduct cardiac evaluation in patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or any other symptom of cardiac disease during treatment. For children already taking a stimulant, it is reasonable to evaluate medical and family history, review physical examination, and order ECG if not done prior to initiation (Vetter 2008).

【307】Monitor growth (weight and height in children; baseline and periodically during therapy); other parameters to monitor periodically during therapy: CBC with differential and platelet count, liver enzymes, blood pressure and heart rate (baseline, following dose increases, and periodically during treatment), appetite, and sleep patterns; observe for abnormal movements or tics. Patients should be reevaluated at appropriate intervals to assess continued need of the medication. Observe for signs/symptoms of new or worsening aggression or hostility, depression, delusional thinking, hallucinations, or mania. Monitor for visual disturbances. Observe for digital changes suggestive of peripheral vasculopathy (eg, Raynaud phenomenon). Monitor for signs of misuse, abuse, substance use disorder, and diversion.

【308】Mechanism of Action

【309】Amphetamines are noncatecholamine sympathomimetic amines that promote release of catecholamines (primarily dopamine and norepinephrine) from their storage sites in the presynaptic nerve terminals. A less significant mechanism may include their ability to block the reuptake of catecholamines by competitive inhibition. The anorexigenic effect is probably secondary to the CNS-stimulating effect; the site of action is probably the hypothalamic feeding center.

【310】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【311】**Note:** Alkaline urine pH will result in reduced renal elimination of amphetamine and acidic urine pH will result in increased renal elimination. Decreased renal elimination in the context of alkaline urine pH may be more pronounced when renal elimination is already decreased.

文本干净度#无关文本#【128】CNS stimulant treatment has been associated with sudden death in children and adolescents with preexisting structural cardiac abnormalities; one study reported methylphenidate increased risk for arrhythmia and MI in youth without congenital heart disease (Shin 2016) and a retrospective case-control study reported an association with stimulants and sudden unexplained death in youth (Gould 2009). However, as noted in reviews  several large studies have not found an association between prescription stimulants and cardiovascular events; though most retrospective studies were large (n=55,383 to 2,131,953), some had statistical power or methodological limitations (Westover 2012). A large retrospective cohort study involving 1,200,438 children and young adults (aged 2 to 24 years) prescribed ADHD medication (methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamines, amphetamine salts, pemoline, or atomoxetine) found no evidence that ADHD medication was associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events (ie, acute MI, sudden cardiac death, stroke) in current (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.31 to 1.85) or former (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.89) users compared with nonusers, nor in current compared with former users. Results were similar with multiple alternative analyses to assess for bias or study assumptions. While point estimates of relative risks for ADHD drugs did not demonstrate increased risk, the upper limit of the 95% CI suggested a doubling of the risk could not be ruled out, although absolute magnitude of increased risk would be low. Data on any individual medication, other than methylphenidate, were too sparse for separate regression analyses (Cooper 2011). Prior to treatment with medications for ADHD, the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that all children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD have a thorough cardiovascular assessment, including patient and family health histories, determination of all medications used (prescribed and over-the-counter), and a physical examination focused on cardiovascular disease risk factors. An ECG is not mandatory but is reasonable to consider prior to stimulant medication therapy. Prompt evaluation and appropriate referral and testing, if warranted, should occur if any cardiac symptoms present (Vetter 2008).#里面的(Westover 2012) 类似的（ ）类人名，应用全文
