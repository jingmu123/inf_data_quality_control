【31】Warnings/Precautions

【32】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【33】• Toxic shock syndrome: Has been reported with barrier contraceptive use.

【34】• Vaginal irritation: May cause vaginal irritation (eg, burning, itching or rash); irritation may also be present without symptoms. Irritation may be associated with an increased risk of getting HIV from an infected partner. Nonoxynol-9 may adversely affect lactobacillus disrupting the vaginal lining, leading to sloughing that may cause ulceration (Bonnington 2020).

【35】**_Dosage form specific issues:_**

【36】• Today Sponge: Prior to use, patients should consult healthcare provider following recent miscarriage or abortion, or with vaginal or uterine conditions which may make the product ineffective (eg, vaginal septum, uterine prolapse) or if told to not become pregnant.

【37】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【38】• Appropriate use: Patients should consult with health care provider concerning the best form of birth control. For use in persons with only 1 partner and when neither partner is infected with HIV or has HIV risk factors; most products may be used with or without a diaphragm or condom. The CDC does not recommend the use of condoms lubricated with spermicides due to their association with urinary tract infections in young females. In addition, condoms with nonoxynol-9 are no more effective than condoms without nonoxynol-9 in preventing HIV or sexually transmitted infection (CDC \[Workowski 2021\]). Use is not recommended for patients with recurrent or chronic bacterial vaginosis (Bonnington 2020)

【39】• HIV infection protection: Nonoxynol 9 does not protect against HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases and use may increase the risk of getting HIV from an infected sex partner. Not for use in persons with HIV or those who have a sexual partner with HIV; another form of birth control should be used. Proper use of a latex condom will help reduce the risk of infection from HIV. If HIV status is unknown, a different form of birth control should be used.

【40】• Rectal use: Not for use as a microbicide or lubricant during anal intercourse. Rectal use may cause irritation, which may increase the risk of getting HIV from an infected sexual partner.

【75】**Contraception:** Prevention of pregnancy

【76】Metabolism/Transport Effects

【77】None known.

【78】Drug Interactions  

【79】There are no known significant interactions.

【80】Reproductive Considerations

【81】Rates for unintended pregnancies associated with use are highly variable and may be influenced by the behavior of users, personal characteristics, or dose of nonoxynol-9 (products with higher strengths may be more effective) . The percentage of unintended pregnancies following use of these products is generally higher than with other methods of contraception; many can be used with a diaphragm and/or external (male) condom. Consistent and correct use of the external (male) latex condom is recommended to reduce the risk for sexually transmitted disease and HIV transmission and provides an additional method of contraception. Barrier contraceptives may not be appropriate for use in patients in which the risk of becoming pregnant is unacceptable due to other health conditions, because of their relatively higher failure rate if not used correctly (CDC \[Curtis 2016\]).

【82】Pregnancy Considerations

【83】Use of spermicides has not been associated with birth defects (FDA 1986).

【84】Mechanism of Action

【85】Nonoxynol 9 is a nonionic surfactant which prevents pregnancy by damaging the cell membrane of sperm; some product formulations may also provide a physical barrier
