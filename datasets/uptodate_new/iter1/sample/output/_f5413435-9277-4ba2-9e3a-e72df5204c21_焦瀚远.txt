【68】Warnings/Precautions

【69】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【70】• Cardiac events: Coronary artery vasospasm, transient ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and death have been reported within a few hours of 5-HT 1 agonist administration. Consider administering first dose in a medically supervised setting with ECG monitoring for patients with multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (eg, diabetes, hypertension, increased age, obesity, smoking, strong family history of ASCVD), but only after a cardiovascular evaluation that is satisfactory to allow for safe use.

【71】• Cerebrovascular events: Cerebral/subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke have been reported with 5-HT 1 agonist administration and some have resulted in fatalities.

【72】• Elevated blood pressure: Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has also been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension.

【73】• Vasospasm-related events: Peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud syndrome have been reported with 5-HT 1 agonists. In patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following use of a 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional doses.

【74】• Visual effects: Rarely, partial vision loss and blindness (transient and permanent) have been reported with 5-HT 1 agonists.

【75】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【76】• Coronary artery disease: Should not be given to patients who have risk factors for ASCVD (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of ASCVD, menopause, male >40 years of age) without adequate cardiac evaluation. Patients with suspected ASCVD should have cardiovascular evaluation to rule out ASCVD before considering use; if cardiovascular evaluation is satisfactory and clinicians determine that it is safe to proceed with use, first dose should be given in the health care provider's office (consider ECG monitoring). Periodic evaluation of cardiovascular status should be done in all patients.

【77】• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Drug clearance may be reduced leading to increased plasma concentrations. With moderate to severe hepatic impairment, dosage reduction of the oral product is recommended; use of orally disintegrating tablet and nasal inhalation are not recommended in moderate to severe hepatic impairment.

【78】**_Special populations:_**

【79】• Older adult: Older adult patients are more likely to have underlying cardiovascular disease and hepatic or renal impairment; use with caution. Cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for older adult patients with other cardiovascular risk factors prior to initiation of therapy.

【80】**_Dosage form specific issues:_**

【81】• Phenylalanine: Zomig-ZMT tablets contain phenylalanine.

【82】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【83】Serious adverse events have been reported with triptans in pediatric patients, including zolmitriptan; like adults, those reported have been rare and similar in nature.

【139】Medication Safety Issues

【140】Sound-alike/look-alike issues:

【141】ZOLMitriptan may be confused with SUMAtriptan

【142】Metabolism/Transport Effects

【143】**Substrate** of CYP1A2 (minor); **Note:** Assignment of Major/Minor substrate status based on clinically relevant drug interaction potential

【144】Drug Interactions  

【145】**Note** : Interacting drugs may **not be individually listed below** if they are part of a group interaction (eg, individual drugs within “CYP3A4 Inducers \[Strong\]” are NOT listed). For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program by clicking on the “Launch drug interactions program” link above.

【146】Bromocriptine: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Serotonin 5-HT1D Receptor Agonists (Triptans). Management: Consider alternatives to this combination when possible. If combined, monitor for increased bromocriptine and triptan toxicities. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【147】Cimetidine: May increase the serum concentration of ZOLMitriptan. Management: Limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in 24 hours, when coadministered with cimetidine. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【148】Droxidopa: Serotonin 5-HT1D Receptor Agonists (Triptans) may enhance the hypertensive effect of Droxidopa. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【149】Ergot Derivatives (Vasoconstrictive CYP3A4 Substrates): Serotonin 5-HT1D Receptor Agonists (Triptans) may enhance the vasoconstricting effect of Ergot Derivatives (Vasoconstrictive CYP3A4 Substrates). _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【150】Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Serotonin 5-HT1D Receptor Agonists (Triptans) may enhance the serotonergic effect of Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors. This could result in serotonin syndrome. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors may increase the serum concentration of Serotonin 5-HT1D Receptor Agonists (Triptans). _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【151】Serotonergic Agents (High Risk): Serotonin 5-HT1D Receptor Agonists (Triptans) may enhance the serotonergic effect of Serotonergic Agents (High Risk). This could result in serotonin syndrome. Management: Monitor for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome/serotonin toxicity (eg, hyperreflexia, clonus, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tremor, autonomic instability, mental status changes) when these agents are combined. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【152】Serotonin 5-HT1D Receptor Agonists (Triptans): May enhance the vasoconstricting effect of other Serotonin 5-HT1D Receptor Agonists (Triptans). _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【153】Pregnancy Considerations

【154】Outcome data following maternal use of zolmitriptan during pregnancy are limited in comparison to other 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (triptans) .

【155】Triptans relieve migraine pain by selectively binding to serotonin receptors, resulting in vasoconstriction of cranial arteries. Although the effects on uterine blood flow have not been evaluated, 1 case report suggests excessive use of a triptan may cause placental hypoperfusion .

【156】Treatment for migraine headaches in pregnant patients should be individualized (AHS \[Ailani 2021\]). Triptans are not the preferred initial treatment for acute migraine headache in pregnant patients (ACOG 2022). Until additional data are available, zolmitriptan is not the preferred triptan when first-line therapy is ineffective. Triptans should be avoided in pregnant patients with cardiac disease or hypertension .

【157】Acute treatment of cluster headache in pregnant patients is similar to nonpregnant adults; however, zolmitriptan is not preferred when a triptan is needed .

【158】Breastfeeding Considerations

【159】Zolmitriptan is present in breast milk.

【160】Data related to the presence of 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (triptans) in breast milk is available from a study of 19 lactating women  treated for migraine headaches. During the study, infants were fed previously expressed breast milk. Breast milk was sampled prior to and at intervals up to 24 hours after the dose in patients taking zolmitriptan 5 mg (nasal spray, n=1) or 2.5 mg (orally, n=3). Using the average breast milk concentration observed, authors of the study calculated the estimated exposure of zolmitriptan to the breastfed infant to be 0.6 mcg/kg/day, providing a relative infant dose (RID) of 0.7% based on the weight-adjusted maternal dose following use of the nasal spray. Following maternal use of oral zolmitriptan, the estimated exposure to the breastfed infant was calculated to be 0.2 to 1.5 mcg/kg/day (RID 0.8% to 5.3%). Using the maximum breast milk concentration, the RID of zolmitriptan was calculated to be 1.4% to 9.4%. The active metabolite of zolmitriptan was not included in the calculations (concentrations were near or below the limit of quantification). One patient was also taking propranolol for migraine headache prevention; her Cmax and AUC were higher than other patients taking zolmitriptan. A large interindividual variability among breast milk concentrations was found with all the triptans in the study, even when considering dose and dosage form (Amundsen 2021). In general, breastfeeding is considered acceptable when the RID is <10% .

【161】Treatment for migraine headaches in breastfeeding patients should be individualized (AHS \[Ailani 2021\]). According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and the benefits of treatment to the mother. Withholding breastfeeding for 24 hours after the maternal dose will minimize infant exposure via breast milk. The decision to withhold breastfeeding following a dose of zolmitriptan should be part of a shared decision-making process (ACOG 2022).

【162】Dietary Considerations

【163】Some products may contain phenylalanine.

【164】Monitoring Parameters

【165】BP; cardiovascular evaluation (prior to initiation and periodically with long-term use in patients with multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease \[ASCVD\] \[eg, diabetes, hypertension, increased age, obesity, smoking, strong family history of ASCVD\]), ECG (with first dose in patients with multiple ASCVD risk factors, but a cardiovascular evaluation that is satisfactory to allow for safe use).

【166】Mechanism of Action
