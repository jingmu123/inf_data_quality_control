【5】Dosing: Adult

【6】**Note:** All dosages expressed as **aminophylline** ; use **ideal body weight** to calculate dose (theophylline has limited distribution into body fat); individualize dose based on steady-state serum theophylline concentrations. Theophylline dose is ~80% of aminophylline dose.

【7】Reversible airflow obstruction, acute refractory symptoms

【8】**Reversible airflow obstruction, acute refractory symptoms: Note:** Routine use of aminophylline is not recommended for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations . Optimal regimen, dose, and therapeutic concentrations are uncertain; refer to institutional protocol.

【9】**Loading dose: Note:** Doses presented are intended to achieve a serum theophylline concentration of ~10 mcg/mL.

【10】**Patients who have not received aminophylline or theophylline in the previous 24 hours:** **IV:** 5.7 mg/kg.

【11】**Patients who have received aminophylline or theophylline in the previous 24 hours:** **Note:** Loading dose should **NOT** be given before obtaining a serum theophylline concentration.

【12】Calculate loading dose based on serum theophylline concentrations, as follows:

【13】**IV:** Loading dose = (desired serum theophylline concentration − measured serum theophylline concentration) \* (V d ); where V d \= 0.5 L/kg \[Example:  – 5 mcg/mL (measured)) \* 0.5 L/kg \* 70 kg = 175 mg loading dose\].

【14】**Maintenance dose:** **Note:** Dosing presented is to achieve a target theophylline concentration of 10 mcg/mL. Lower initial doses may be required in patients with reduced theophylline clearance. Adjust dose according to serum theophylline concentrations.

【15】Adults ≤60 years of age: Continuous infusion: **IV:** 0.5 mg/kg/hour; maximum dose: 1,125 mg/day unless serum theophylline concentrations indicate need for larger dose.

【19】<9.9 mcg/mL: If dosage is tolerated but symptoms are not controlled, increase infusion rate ~25%.

【20】10 to 14.9 mcg/mL: Maintain infusion rate if dosage is tolerated and symptoms controlled. Recheck serum theophylline concentrations at 24-hour intervals. If symptoms are not controlled and dosage is tolerated, consider adding additional medications to treatment regimen.

【21】15 to 19.9 mcg/mL: Consider 10% dose reduction in infusion rate to improve safety margin even if dose is tolerated.

【22】20 to 24.9 mcg/mL: Decrease infusion rate by 25% even if no adverse effects present.

【23】25 to 30 mcg/mL: Stop infusion for 24 hours and decrease subsequent infusion rate at least 25%. If symptomatic, stop infusion and consider whether overdose treatment is indicated.

【24】\>30 mcg/mL: Stop infusion and treat overdose; if resumed, decrease subsequent infusion rate at least 50%.

【25】Dipyridamole- or regadenoson-induced adverse reactions during nuclear cardiac stress testing, reversal

【26】**Dipyridamole- or regadenoson-induced adverse reactions (eg, angina, hypotension) during nuclear cardiac stress testing, reversal (off-label use):** **Note:** Since adenosine-induced side effects are short lived after discontinuation of the infusion, aminophylline administration is only very rarely required .

【27】**IV:** 50 to 250 mg administered over 30 to 60 seconds, repeat as necessary .

【82】Warnings/Precautions

【83】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【84】• Extravasation: Vesicant; ensure proper catheter or needle position prior to and during infusion. Avoid extravasation.

【85】• Theophylline toxicity: Severe and potentially fatal theophylline toxicity may occur if reduced theophylline clearance occurs. Theophylline clearance may be decreased in patients with acute pulmonary edema, heart failure, cor pulmonale, fever (≥102°F for ≥24 hours or lesser temperature elevations for longer periods), hepatic disease, acute hepatitis, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, sepsis with multiorgan failure, shock, neonates (term and premature), infants <3 months of age with decreased renal function, infants <1 year, elderly >60 years, and patients following cessation of smoking. Consider benefits versus risks and the need for more intensive monitoring in these patients; reduced dosing may be required. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of theophylline toxicity (eg, nausea or persistent, repetitive vomiting), a serum theophylline concentration should be measured immediately and subsequent doses withheld.

【86】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【87】• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiac arrhythmias (excluding bradyarrhythmias); use may exacerbate arrhythmias.

【88】• Cystic fibrosis: Use with caution in patients with cystic fibrosis; increased theophylline clearance may occur.

【89】• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment (eg, cirrhosis, acute hepatitis, cholestasis); risk of severe and potentially fatal theophylline toxicity is increased. Theophylline clearance is decreased ≥50% in these patients. Dose reduction and frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations are required.

【90】• Hyperthyroidism: Use with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism; increased theophylline clearance may occur.

【91】• Peptic ulcer disease: Use with caution in patients with active peptic ulcer disease; use may exacerbate peptic ulcer.

【92】• Seizure disorder: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders; use may exacerbate seizure disorder.

【93】_**Special populations:**_

【94】• Older adult: Use extreme caution in the elderly; these patients are at greater risk of serious theophylline toxicity.

【95】• Pediatric: Select dose with caution and with frequent monitoring of concentrations (especially <1 year); rate of clearance is highly variable in these patients.

【96】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【97】• Appropriate use: Do not increase dose in response to acute exacerbation of symptoms unless steady state serum theophylline concentration is <10 mcg/mL. As the rate of theophylline clearance may be dose-dependent, an increase in dose based upon a subtherapeutic serum theophylline concentration measurement should be limited to ~25% increase of the previous infusion rate or daily dose.

【255】Food Interactions

【256】Ethanol: Ethanol may decrease theophylline clearance. Management: Monitor theophylline concentrations, particularly when alcohol consumption patterns change.

【257】Food: Theophylline clearance is increased and half-life decreased by low carbohydrate/high protein diets, parenteral nutrition, and daily consumption of charcoal-broiled beef; a high carbohydrate/low protein diet can decrease the clearance and prolong the half-life of theophylline. Management: Avoid extremes of dietary protein and carbohydrate intake.

【258】Pregnancy Considerations

【259】Breastfeeding Considerations

【260】Aminophylline is a complex of theophylline and ethylenediamine. Theophylline is present in breast milk.

【261】Monitoring Parameters

【262】Heart rate; CNS effects (insomnia, irritability); respiratory rate (COPD patients often have resting controlled respiratory rates in low 20s); arterial or capillary blood gases (if applicable)

【263】Theophylline serum concentrations: Serum theophylline concentrations should be monitored after initiation of therapy and prior to making dose increases; in the presence of signs or symptoms of toxicity; or when a new illness, worsening of a present illness, or change in patient’s treatment regimen that may alter theophylline clearance (eg, fever _\>_ 102°F or sustained for 24 hours or more, hepatitis, or drugs that are added or discontinued); changes in fluid balance; electrolyte concentrations, acid-base balance during prolonged therapy.

【264】Loading dose: Measure serum theophylline concentrations 30 minutes after the end of an IV loading dose in patients who have not received theophylline in the previous 24 hours to determine the need for an additional loading (serum theophylline concentration <10 mcg/mL) or to delay starting the maintenance IV infusion (serum theophylline concentration >20 mcg/mL).

【265】Continuous infusion: Measure serum theophylline concentrations one half-life (eg, ~4 hours in children 1 to 9 years of age or 8 hours in nonsmoking, otherwise healthy adults) after starting a continuous infusion, then every 12 to 24 hours for duration of infusion; measure more frequently in acutely ill patients.

【266】Monitor infusion site.

【267】Therapeutic serum trough concentration:

【268】**Note:** Therapeutic goal may vary depending on acuity and severity of the patient, as well as disease state (Barnes 2013).

【269】Children: 5 to 15 mcg/mL (SI: 27.8 to 83.3 micromole/L).

【270】Adults: 5 to 15 mcg/mL (SI: 27.8 to 83.3 micromole/L) (Barnes 2013).

【271】Toxic concentration: >20 mcg/mL (SI: >111 micromole/L).

【272】Mechanism of Action

【273】Theophylline has two distinct actions; smooth muscle relaxation (ie, bronchodilation) and suppression of the response of the airways to stimuli (ie, non-bronchodilator prophylactic effects). Bronchodilation is mediated by inhibition of two isoenzymes, phosphodiesterase (PDE III and, to a lesser extent, PDE IV) while non-bronchodilation effects are mediated through other molecular mechanisms. Theophylline increases the force of contraction of diaphragmatic muscles through enhancement of calcium uptake through adenosine-mediated channels.

【274】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【275】**Theophylline:**

【276】Distribution: Theophylline: ~0.45 L/kg based on ideal body weight; distributes poorly into body fat; V d may increase in premature neonates, hepatic cirrhosis, acidemia (uncorrected), elderly, and third trimester of pregnancy.

【277】Protein binding: Theophylline: ~40%, primarily to albumin; decreased in neonates (due to a greater percentage of fetal albumin), hepatic cirrhosis, acidemia (uncorrected), elderly, third trimester of pregnancy.

【278】Metabolism: Theophylline: Hepatic via demethylation (CYP 1A2) and hydroxylation (CYP 2E1 and 3A4); forms active metabolites (caffeine and 3-methylxanthine)

【279】Half-life elimination: Theophylline: Highly variable and dependent upon age, hepatic function, cardiac function, lung disease, and smoking history

【280】Premature infants, postnatal age 3 to 15 days: 30 hours (range: 17 to 43 hours)

【281】Premature infants, postnatal age 25 to 57 days: 20 hours (range: 9.4 to 30.6 hours)

【282】Term infants, postnatal age 1 to 2 days: 25.7 hours (range: 25 to 26.5 hours)

【283】Term infants, postnatal age 3 to 30 weeks: 11 hours (range: 6 to 29 hours)

【284】Children 1 to 4 years: 3.4 hours (range: 1.2 to 5.6 hours)

【285】Children and Adolescents 6 to 17 years: 3.7 hours (range: 1.5 to 5.9 hours)

【286】Adults ≥18 years to ≤60 years (asthma, nonsmoking, otherwise healthy): 8.7 hours (range: 6.1 to 12.8 hours)

【287】Elderly >60 years (nonsmoking, healthy): 9.8 hours (range: 1.6 to 18 hours)

【288】Clearance: Certain conditions may significantly alter theophylline clearance; severe and potentially fatal theophylline toxicity may occur if reduced theophylline clearance occurs.

【289】Decreased theophylline clearance: Neonates and infants; elderly >60 years; acute pulmonary edema, cor pulmonale; fever (≥102°F for ≥24 hours or lesser temperature elevations for longer periods); heart failure; hepatic impairment (eg, cirrhosis, acute hepatitis, cholestasis); hypothyroidism; patients following cessation of smoking; sepsis with multiple organ failure; shock; third trimester of pregnancy.

【290】Increased theophylline clearance: Hyperthyroidism; cystic fibrosis; smoking (ie, marijuana or tobacco).

【291】Time to peak, serum: Within 30 minutes

【292】Excretion: Theophylline: Urine (~50% as unchanged drug \[Neonates\]; ~10% as unchanged drug \[Infants >3 months, Adolescents, and Adults\])

【293】Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【294】Altered kidney function: Clearance is decreased in infants <3 months with decreased renal function.

【295】Hepatic function impairment: Clearance is decreased by ≥50% in patients with hepatic impairment (eg, cirrhosis, acute hepatitis, cholestasis).

【296】Pediatric: Clearance is very low in neonates and reaches max values by 1 year of age, remains relatively constant until about 9 years of age, and then slowly decreases by approximately 50% to adult values at about 16 years of age. Renal excretion of unchanged theophylline in neonates amounts to about 50% of the dose, compared to about 10% in children older than three months and in adults.

【297】Older adult: Clearance is decreased by an average of 30% in patients >60 years.

【298】Sex: Significant reduction in theophylline clearance has been reported in women on the 20th day of the menstrual cycle and during the third trimester of pregnancy.

【299】Smoking: Clearance is increased by smoking (ie, marijuana or tobacco) by ~50% in young adult and ~80% in elderly tobacco smokers. Cessation of smoking for 1 week causes a reduction in theophylline clearance by ~40%.
