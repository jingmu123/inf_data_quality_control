【3】ALERT: US Boxed Warning

【4】Supine hypertension:

【5】Monitor supine blood pressure prior to and during treatment and more frequently when increasing doses. Elevating the head of the bed lessens the risk of supine hypertension, and blood pressure should be measured in this position. If supine hypertension cannot be managed by elevation of the head of the bed, reduce or discontinue droxidopa.

【72】Amezinium: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Droxidopa. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【73】Carbidopa: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Droxidopa. Carbidopa may decrease serum concentrations of the active metabolite(s) of Droxidopa. Carbidopa may increase the serum concentration of Droxidopa. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【74】Ephedra: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Droxidopa. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【75】EPHEDrine (Systemic): May enhance the hypertensive effect of Droxidopa. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【76】Foscarbidopa: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Droxidopa. Foscarbidopa may decrease serum concentrations of the active metabolite(s) of Droxidopa. Foscarbidopa may increase the serum concentration of Droxidopa. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【77】Ifenprodil: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Droxidopa. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【78】Midodrine: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Droxidopa. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【79】Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Droxidopa. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【80】Norepinephrine: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Droxidopa. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【81】Serotonin 5-HT1D Receptor Agonists (Triptans): May enhance the hypertensive effect of Droxidopa. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【82】Pregnancy Considerations

【83】Adverse events have been observed in some animal reproduction studies.

【84】Breastfeeding Considerations

【85】It is not known if droxidopa is excreted in breast milk. Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, breast-feeding is not recommended by the manufacturer.

【86】Monitoring Parameters

【87】Monitor supine blood pressure prior to and during treatment and more frequently when increasing the dose.

【88】Mechanism of Action

【89】A synthetic amino acid analog that is directly metabolized to norepinephrine by dopadecarboxylase. Droxidopa is believed to exert its pharmacological effects through norepinephrine. Norepinephrine increases blood pressure by inducing peripheral arterial and venous vasoconstriction.

【90】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【91】Absorption: High-fat meals reduce the C max and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by 35% and 20%, respectively, and delay the C max by approximately 2 hours.

【92】Distribution: V d : ~200 L

【93】Protein binding: 26% to 75%

【94】Metabolism: The metabolism of droxidopa is mediated by catecholamine pathway. Droxidopa is initially converted to methoxylated dihydroxyphenylserine , a major metabolite, by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), to norepinephrine by DOPA decarboxylase (DDC), or to protocatechualdehyde by DOPS aldolase.

【95】Half-life elimination: ~2.5 hours

【96】Time to peak, plasma: 1 to 4 hours

【97】Excretion: Urine (~75%)
