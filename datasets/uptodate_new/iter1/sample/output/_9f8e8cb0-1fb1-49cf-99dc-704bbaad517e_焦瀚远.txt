【10】Diagnostic imaging

【11】**Diagnostic imaging:**

【12】**High-grade glioma, recurrent (off-label use):**

【13】**IV:** 111 to 259 MBq ; begin positron emission tomography (PET) scanning 50 to 100 minutes after completion of administration.

【14】_To identify recurrent high-grade glioma:_ Lesions considered positive if abnormal tracer accumulation in the brain parenchyma is greater than the contralateral hemisphere with corresponding CT changes .

【15】**Prostate cancer, localization of recurrence or suspected metastasis:**

【16】**IV:** 111 to 259 MBq ; begin PET scanning 50 to 100 minutes after completion of administration .

【17】_Prior to initial definitive or suspected recurrence therapy:_ Lesions should be considered suspicious if uptake is greater than physiologic uptake in that tissue or greater than adjacent background if no physiologic uptake is expected. Tumors not containing PSMA will not be visualized; increased uptake in tumors is not specific for prostate cancer .

【18】_To select patients for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan therapy:_ Lesions should be considered positive if gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 uptake is greater than normal liver and negative if uptake is less than or equal to normal liver. Patients should be considered eligible for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan therapy if at least one tumor lesion is positive and all lesions on anatomical imaging larger in short axis than size criteria are also positive (size criteria: organs ≥1 cm, lymph nodes ≥2.5 cm, bones \[soft tissue component\] ≥1 cm). Patients should be considered ineligible for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan therapy if all lesions are negative or any one lesion larger than size criteria is negative.

【19】**Prostate cancer (primary) identification (off-label use):**

【20】**IV:** 111 to 259 MBq ; begin PET scanning 50 to 100 minutes after completion of administration.

【21】_To identify primary prostate cancer in patients with PSA ≤50 ng/mL_ : Lesions considered positive for malignancy if uptake is more than a liver activity but less than parotid uptake (mi-PSMA ES score 2) or if uptake is more than parotid uptake (mi-PSMA ES score 3) .

【39】Warnings/Precautions

【40】_**Concerns related to adverse effects:**_

【41】• Radiation accumulation: Gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 administration contributes to the patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and health care providers.

【42】**_Special handling:_**

【43】• Radiopharmaceutical: Use appropriate precautions for handling, disposal, and minimizing exposure to patients and health care personnel. Use only under supervision of individuals with experience/training in the handling of radioactive materials approved by the applicable regulatory authority.

【44】_**Other warnings/precautions:**_

【45】• Appropriate use: Gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 binds to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA); positron emission tomography (PET) images indicate the presence of PSMA in tissues. When imaging prior to initial definitive or suspected recurrence therapy, tumors may be suspicious if uptake is greater than physiologic uptake in that tissue or greater than adjacent background if no physiologic uptake was expected; tumors not containing PSMA are not visualized. When imaging to select patients for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan therapy, compare uptake of gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 at sites of suspected prostate cancer (lesions) with uptake in normal liver; lesions should be considered positive if gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 uptake is greater than normal liver and negative if uptake is less than or equal to normal liver. May also compare uptake of gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 at sites of suspected prostate cancer lesions with uptake in normal parotid glands (Hotta 2023).

【46】• Risk for misinterpretation: Uptake of gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 is not specific to prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer and nonmalignant processes (eg, fibrous dysplasia, osteophytosis, Paget disease). A negative image does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer, and a positive image does not confirm prostate cancer. The performance of gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 for recurrent prostate cancer may be affected by serum prostate-specific antigen levels and site of disease. The performance of gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 for metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy may be affected by Gleason score. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site/recurrence site, is recommended. When using to select patients for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan therapy, PET scan interpretation may vary depending on imaging readers; interpretations may be more consistent when judging gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 uptake in any one tumor lesion (compared to judging uptake for all lesions larger than size criteria). It is recommended to utilize a multidisciplinary approach to select patients for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan therapy, especially for imaging that a single reader describes as borderline or difficult to interpret, or when patient eligibility depends only on judgment of gallium Ga 68 PSMA-11 uptake for all lesions larger than size criteria.
