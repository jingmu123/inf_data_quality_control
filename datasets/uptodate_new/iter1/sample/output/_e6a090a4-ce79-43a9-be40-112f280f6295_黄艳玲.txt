【49】Warnings/Precautions

【50】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【51】• CNS effects: **\[Canadian Boxed Warning\]: Patients have reported falling asleep while engaging in activities of daily living including the driving of a car; in some cases, these events have occurred without significant warning signs.** Monitor for daytime somnolence or preexisting sleep disorder; discontinue if significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep occur. Patients must be cautioned about performing tasks which require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving). Use with caution in patients receiving other CNS depressants or psychoactive agents. Effects with other sedative drugs or ethanol may be potentiated.

【52】• Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions may occur in susceptible patients.

【53】• Impulse control disorders: Dopamine agonists used for Parkinson disease or restless legs syndrome have been associated with compulsive behaviors and/or loss of impulse control, which has manifested as pathological gambling, libido increases (hypersexuality), and/or binge eating. Causality has not been established, and controversy exists as to whether this phenomenon is related to the underlying disease, prior behaviors/substance use disorders and/or drug therapy. Dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy has been reported to reverse these behaviors in some, but not all cases.

【54】• Increased growth hormone levels: May increase human growth hormone levels.

【55】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【56】• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (MI, atrial, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmias); initiate in a monitored setting. Use is contraindicated in decompensated cardiovascular disease.

【57】• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus; monitor blood glucose frequently. Antidiabetic agents may require dose adjustment.

【58】• Glaucoma: Use with caution in patients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma; monitor IOP carefully. Use is contraindicated in patients with angle-closure glaucoma.

【59】• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Use is contraindicated in decompensated hepatic disease.

【60】• Peptic ulcer disease: Use with caution in patients with peptic ulcer disease.

【61】• Psychotic disorders: Use with extreme caution in patients with a history of psychotic disorders; observe patients closely for development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies. May also cause hallucinations and confusion.

【62】• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment. Use is contraindicated in decompensated renal disease.

【63】• Seizure disorder: Use with caution in patients with a history of seizure disorder.

【64】**_Special populations:_**

【65】• Older adult: Use with caution in the elderly; may be more sensitive to CNS effects of levodopa.

【66】• Perioperative patients: Continue therapy as close to surgical procedures as possible in patients requiring general anesthesia (excluding halothane-risk of blood pressure fluctuations and/or arrhythmias; discontinue benserazide/levodopa 12 to 48 hours before procedure); resume therapy postoperatively with a gradual increase in dose up to that established preoperatively.

【67】• Young adults: Use is contraindicated in patients <25 years of age. Animal data suggests the possibility of skeletal abnormalities if benserazide is administered before ossification is complete.

【68】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【69】• Abuse: May induce dopaminergic dysregulation syndrome resulting in excessive use of benserazide/levodopa beyond prescribed doses, particularly in males with early onset Parkinson disease (Giovannoni 2000); may lead to cognitive and behavioral disturbances. Monitor for excessive use if cognitive/behavioral disturbances develop.

【70】• Appropriate use: Not indicated in management of intention tremor, Huntington's chorea, or drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. Administer in careful increments and observe closely for development of abnormal involuntary movements.

【71】• Discontinuation of therapy: Avoid abrupt withdrawal of therapy; dopaminergic agents have been associated with a syndrome resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) on abrupt withdrawal or significant dosage reduction after long-term use. Withdraw therapy gradually and monitor closely; symptomatic patients should be treated appropriately and if necessary resumption of benserazide/levodopa therapy may be considered.

If combined, monitor for reduced levodopa efficacy. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【152】Food Interactions

【153】High protein diets have the potential to impair levodopa absorption; levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall or across the blood-brain barrier. Management: Avoid high protein diets.

【154】Food reduces the extent of levodopa absorption by 15% and peak plasma concentrations by 30%. Management: Administer with or immediately after meals.

【155】Reproductive Considerations

【156】Use is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential not using proper contraception.

【157】Pregnancy Considerations

【158】Use is contraindicated during pregnancy.

【159】Levodopa crosses the placenta and can be metabolized by the fetus and detected in fetal tissue (Merchant 1995). The incidence of Parkinson disease in pregnancy is relatively rare and information related to the use of benserazide/levodopa in pregnant women is limited . The manufacturer recommends that women who become pregnant during therapy gradually taper off therapy; avoid abrupt withdrawal.

【160】Breastfeeding Considerations

【161】Levodopa is present in breast milk (based on a study using carbidopa/levodopa) (Thulin 1998); excretion of benserazide is not known. Breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer.

【162】Dietary Considerations

【163】High-protein diets may decrease effect of levodopa.

【164】Monitoring Parameters

【165】Regular assessment of cardiovascular, hepatic, hematopoietic, and renal function with initiation and during dose stabilization then periodically with extended therapy; blood glucose frequently in patients with diabetes; symptoms of psychosis and dystonia

【166】Mechanism of Action

【167】Symptoms of Parkinson disease are due to a lack of striatal dopamine. Levodopa crosses into the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and is converted to dopamine by striatal enzymes. Benserazide inhibits the peripheral plasma breakdown of levodopa by inhibiting its decarboxylation and therefore increases levodopa availability at the BBB.

【168】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【169】Absorption: Benserazide: 66% to 74%

【170】Distribution:

【171】Benserazide: Does not cross the blood-brain barrier; mainly concentrated in kidneys, liver, lungs, and small intestine

【172】Levodopa: 57 L; crosses the blood-brain barrier and not bound to plasma proteins

【173】Metabolism:

【174】Benserazide: Hydroxylated in the intestine and liver to trihydroxybenzylhydrazine, a potent inhibitor of decarboxylase

【175】Levodopa: Major pathways: Decarboxylation to dopamine and O-methylation to 3-O-methyldopa; Minor pathways; Transamination and oxidation

【176】Bioavailability: Levodopa: 98% (range: 74% to 112%)

【177】Half-life elimination: Levodopa: 1.5 hours; 3-O-methyldopa (major metabolite): 15 hours

【178】Time to peak, serum: Levodopa: ~1 hour

【179】Excretion: Benserazide: Urine ; feces ; Levodopa: Urine (as metabolites)
