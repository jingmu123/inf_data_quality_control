【38】Warnings/Precautions

【39】_**Concerns related to adverse effects:**_

【40】• CNS depression: May cause CNS depression, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks that require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery, driving).

【41】_**Disease-related concerns:**_

【42】• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease.

【43】• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus.

【44】• Increased intraocular pressure/glaucoma: Use with caution in patients with increased intraocular pressure or glaucoma.

【45】• Prostatic hyperplasia/urinary obstruction: Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia and/or urinary obstruction.

【46】• Respiratory disease: Use caution in patients with breathing problems such as chronic bronchitis or emphysema.

【47】• Thyroid dysfunction: Use with caution in patients with thyroid dysfunction.

【48】_**Concurrent drug therapy issues:**_

【49】• Sedatives: Effects may be potentiated when used with other sedative drugs or ethanol.

【50】_**Special populations:**_

【51】• CYP2D6 poor metabolizers: Dextromethorphan is metabolized by hepatic CYP2D6. Poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 may have exaggerated or prolonged effects of dextromethorphan. Increased risk may be seen with concomitant use of potent CYP2D6 inhibitors; use with caution .

【52】• Debilitated patients: Use with caution in patients who are sedated, debilitated, or confined to a supine position.

【53】• Pediatric: Antihistamines may cause excitation in young children. Do not exceed pediatric dosing recommendations. If no recommendations exist on OTC labeling for patient’s age, the product should **not** be administered without the guidance of a physician. Not for OTC use in children <6 years of age.

【54】_**Dosage form specific issues:**_

【55】• Propylene glycol: Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; large amounts are potentially toxic and have been associated with hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution .

【56】_**Other warnings/precautions:**_

【57】• Self-medication (OTC use): When used for self-medication (OTC), notify health care provider if symptoms do not improve within 7 days, or are accompanied by fever, rash, or persistent headache.

【58】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【59】Safety and efficacy for the use of cough and cold products in pediatric patients <4 years of age is limited; the AAP warns against the use of these products for respiratory illnesses in young children. Serious adverse effects including death have been reported (in some cases, high blood concentrations of pseudoephedrine were found). Many of these products contain multiple active ingredients, increasing the risk of accidental overdose when used with other products. The FDA does not recommend OTC uses for these products in pediatric patients <2 years of age and recommends to use with caution in pediatric patients ≥2 years of age. Health care providers are reminded to ask caregivers about the use of OTC cough and cold products in order to avoid exposure to multiple medications containing the same ingredient .

【60】Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; in neonates large amounts of propylene glycol delivered orally, intravenously (eg, >3,000 mg/day), or topically have been associated with potentially fatal toxicities which can include metabolic acidosis, seizures, renal failure, and CNS depression; toxicities have also been reported in children and adults including hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution .

【76】Medication Safety Issues

【77】Older Adult: High-Risk Medication:

【78】Beers Criteria: Pyrilamine, a first-generation antihistamine, is identified in the Beers Criteria as a potentially inappropriate medication to be avoided in patients ≥65 years of age (independent of diagnosis or condition) due to its potent anticholinergic properties resulting in increased risk of confusion, dry mouth, constipation, and other anticholinergic effects or toxicity; use should also be avoided due to reduced clearance with advanced age and tolerance associated with use as a hypnotic. Exposure to concurrent anticholinergic drugs also increases risk of falls, delirium, and dementia; consider total anticholinergic burden when conducting medication reviews (Beers Criteria \[AGS 2023\]).

【79】High alert medication:

【80】The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) includes this medication among its list of drugs (pediatric liquid medications requiring measurement) which have a heightened risk of causing significant patient harm when used in error (High-Alert Medications in Community/Ambulatory Care Settings).
