【102】Warnings/Precautions

【103】_**Concerns related to adverse effects:**_

【104】• Cardiac effects: Heart failure, including grade 3 events, has been reported; myocarditis (in the absence of heart failure) has been observed rarely. Baseline and routine cardiac monitoring (other than electrocardiograms) were not performed in clinical trials, and patients with symptomatic heart failure, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and coronary artery bypass graft within 3 months of study entry were excluded from studies. The median time to onset of heart failure was 2 months (range: 11 days to 12 months); heart failure resolved in one-half of patients following therapy interruption or discontinuation and with appropriate medical management.

【105】• CNS effects: Cognitive impairment, mood disorders, dizziness, and sleep disturbances have been reported with entrectinib. Approximately one-quarter of patients experienced cognitive impairment (including cognitive disorders, confusion, attention disturbance, memory impairment, amnesia, aphasia, mental status changes, hallucinations, and delirium); symptoms occurred within 3 months of entrectinib initiation in most patients. Grade 3 cognitive impairment was reported. Mood disorders and sleep disturbances were reported in ≥10% of patients. Mood disorders included anxiety, depression, and agitation and occurred at a median onset of 1 month (range: 1 day to 9 months); grade 3 mood disorders occurred rarely. One completed suicide was reported . Sleep disturbances included insomnia, somnolence, hypersomnia, and sleep disorder; grade 3 events were rare. The incidence of CNS adverse events was similar between patients with and without CNS metastases; however, dizziness, headache, paresthesia, balance disorder, and confusion appeared to occur more frequently in patients with CNS metastases who had received prior CNS irradiation (compared to those who did not receive CNS radiation). Caution patients about performing tasks that require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving).

【106】• Fractures: The risk of skeletal fractures is increased with entrectinib therapy; fractures occurred more frequently in pediatric patients  than adults  in clinical trials. In adults and pediatrics, some fractures occurred due to a fall or other trauma to the affected site; in pediatric patients, some fractures occurred with no trauma. Radiologic abnormalities (possibly indicative of tumor involvement at the site of fracture) were reported in some adult patients, although there was inadequate assessment for tumor involvement at fracture sites. Most fractures (in adults and pediatrics) involved the hip or other lower extremity (femoral or tibial shaft); bilateral femoral neck fractures occurred rarely. The median time to fracture was 3.8 months in adults (range: 0.3 to 18.5 months) and 4.3 months in pediatrics (range: 2 to 28.7 months). Entrectinib was interrupted more frequently in adult patients  than pediatric patients  in clinical trials; a small number of pediatric patients discontinued therapy due to fractures. Promptly evaluate for signs/symptoms of fractures, such as pain, changes in mobility, or deformity. No data is available on entrectinib effects on healing of confirmed fractures or risk of future fractures.

【107】• Hepatotoxicity: Increased AST and ALT (any grade) occurred in close to one-half and one-third of patients, respectively; grade 3 and 4 transaminase elevations have been reported. The median time to onset of elevated AST and ALT was 2 weeks (range: 1 day to 29.5 months for AST; 1 day to 9.2 months for ALT).

【108】• Hyperuricemia: Hyperuricemia has been reported, including grade 4 events; one patient died due to tumor lysis syndrome. Hyperuricemia resolved in close to three-quarters of patients following initiation of antihyperuricemic therapy (without entrectinib therapy interruption or dose reduction).

【109】• Ocular toxicity: Vision changes were reported in approximately one-fifth of patients in clinical trials; grade 1 toxicity was most common, although grade 2 and 3 events also occurred. Vision disorders included blurred vision, photophobia, diplopia, visual impairment, photopsia, cataract, and vitreous floaters.

【110】• QT interval prolongation: QTcF interval prolongation >60 msec was reported in a small percentage of patients with at least one postbaseline ECG assessment; QTcF interval >500 msec occurred rarely. Patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure, and/or those taking concomitant medications associated with QT prolongation are at significant risk of developing QTc interval prolongation.

【111】_**Special populations:**_

【112】• Pediatrics: Based on limited data in pediatric patients with solid tumors, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, bone fractures, weight gain, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, increased gamma-glutamyl transferase, and device-related infections occurred more frequently in pediatric patients compared with adults.

【207】Food Interactions

【208】Grapefruit may increase entrectinib plasma levels. Management: Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice during therapy.

【209】Reproductive Considerations

【210】Evaluate pregnancy status prior to treatment initiation in patients who could become pregnant. Patients who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy and for at least 5 weeks after the last entrectinib dose. Patients with partners who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy and for 3 months after the last entrectinib dose.

【211】Pregnancy Considerations

【212】Based on the mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, in utero exposure to entrectinib may cause fetal harm.

【213】Entrectinib inhibits specific tropomyosin tyrosine receptor kinases (TRK). In persons with congenital mutations in TRK pathway proteins, anhidrosis, cognitive impairment, developmental delay, obesity, and insensitivity to pain have been observed following decreased TRK-mediated signaling.

【214】Breastfeeding Considerations

【215】It is not known if entrectinib is present in breast milk.

【216】Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer during therapy and for 7 days after the last entrectinib dose.

【217】Dietary Considerations

【218】Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice during entrectinib therapy.

【219】Monitoring Parameters

【220】Assess _NTRK_ gene fusion status (locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors; in tumor or plasma specimen) or _ROS1_ rearrangement status (non-small cell lung cancer; in tumor or plasma specimen) prior to treatment initiation; testing using plasma specimens is only appropriate when tumor tissue is unavailable for testing. Monitor liver functions tests (including ALT and AST) every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment, then monthly thereafter, and as clinically indicated; serum uric acid level (prior to initiation and periodically throughout therapy). Evaluate pregnancy status prior to treatment (in patients who could become pregnant). Assess left ventricular ejection fraction prior to initiation. Monitor for signs and symptoms of heart failure, including shortness of breath and edema; MRI or cardiac biopsy may be necessary for diagnosis in patients with myocarditis with or without a decreased ejection fraction. Assess QT interval and electrolytes at baseline and periodically throughout therapy (monitor at-risk patients and those with current QT prolongation closely; monitor more frequently based on risk factors such as heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval). Perform an ophthalmic evaluation as clinically necessary. Monitor for signs/symptoms of CNS adverse effects (cognitive impairment, mood disorders, dizziness, sleep disturbances), fractures (promptly evaluate signs/symptoms such as pain, changes in mobility, or deformity), tumor lysis syndrome/hyperuricemia, and visual changes. Monitor more frequently in patients with hepatic function impairment. Monitor adherence.

【221】The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management provisional clinical opinion recommends HBV screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.

【222】Mechanism of Action

【223】Entrectinib inhibits tropomyosin tyrosine receptor kinases (TRK) TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC. TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC are encoded by neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase ( _NTRK_ ) genes _NTRK1_ , _NTRK2_ , and _NTRK3_ , respectively. Entrectinib also inhibits proto-oncogenic tyrosine-protein kinase _ROS1_ and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). M5 (the major active entrectinib metabolite) demonstrated similar activity (in vitro) against TRK, _ROS1_ , and ALK. Fusion proteins that include TRK, _ROS1_ , or ALK kinase domains act as oncogenic drivers to promote hyperactivation of downstream signaling pathways, resulting in unchecked cell proliferation.

【224】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【225】Distribution: Entrectinib: 551 L; M5 (active metabolite): 81.1 L.

【226】Protein binding: Entrectinib and M5 (active metabolite): >99% to plasma proteins.

【227】Metabolism: Primarily hepatic via CYP3A4 to form the active metabolite M5.

【228】Half-life elimination: Entrectinib: 20 hours; M5 (active metabolite): 40 hours.

【229】Time to peak: 4 to 6 hours.

【230】Excretion: Feces ; urine .

【231】Clearance: 19.6L/h (entrectinib); 52.4 L/h (M5).

【232】Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【233】Hepatic function impairment: Following a single entrectinib 100 mg oral dose , the entrectinib AUC INF was increased by 39% in mild and moderate hepatic impairment and by 23% in severe hepatic impairment, compared to normal hepatic function. The combined AUC last of entrectinib and M5 was increased by 16% in mild and moderate hepatic impairment and by 4% in severe hepatic impairment, compared to normal hepatic function. Large variability in entrectinib systemic exposure was observed in the hepatic impairment.
