【81】Warnings/Precautions

【82】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【83】• Elevated INR: May be associated with increased INR and subsequent bleeding, especially in nutritionally deficient patients, prolonged treatment, or patients with cancer, hepatic or renal disease. Monitor coagulation parameters and manage as clinically indicated (eg, administration of phytonadione).

【84】• Hemolytic anemia: May rarely cause hemolytic anemia (including fatalities). Has been associated with a higher risk of hemolytic anemia relative to other cephalosporins (approximately threefold); monitor carefully during use and consider cephalosporin-associated immune anemia in patients who have received cefotetan within 2 to 3 weeks (either as treatment or prophylaxis). Discontinue drug, if applicable, and institute supportive measures as clinically indicated.

【85】• Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate supportive measures.

【86】• Penicillin allergy: Use with caution in patients with a history of penicillin allergy.

【87】• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including _C. difficile_ \-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed >2 months postantibiotic treatment.

【88】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【89】• GI disease: Use with caution in patients with a history of GI disease, particularly colitis.

【90】• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; dosage adjustment required.

For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program by clicking on the “Launch drug interactions program” link above.

【133】Alcohol (Ethyl): CefoTEtan may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Alcohol (Ethyl). _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【134】Aminoglycosides: Cephalosporins may enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Aminoglycosides. Cephalosporins may decrease the serum concentration of Aminoglycosides. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【135】Bacillus clausii: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Bacillus clausii. Management: Bacillus clausii should be taken in between antibiotic doses during concomitant therapy. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【136】BCG (Intravesical): Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of BCG (Intravesical). _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【137】BCG Vaccine (Immunization): Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of BCG Vaccine (Immunization). _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【138】Cholera Vaccine: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Cholera Vaccine. Management: Avoid cholera vaccine in patients receiving systemic antibiotics, and within 14 days following the use of oral or parenteral antibiotics. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【139】Fecal Microbiota (Live) (Oral): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Antibiotics. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【140】Fecal Microbiota (Live) (Rectal): Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Fecal Microbiota (Live) (Rectal). _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【141】Furosemide: May enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Cephalosporins. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【142】Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (Anti-PD-1, -PD-L1, and -CTLA4 Therapies): Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (Anti-PD-1, -PD-L1, and -CTLA4 Therapies). _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【143】Lactobacillus and Estriol: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Lactobacillus and Estriol. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【144】Mycophenolate: Antibiotics may decrease serum concentrations of the active metabolite(s) of Mycophenolate. Specifically, concentrations of mycophenolic acid (MPA) may be reduced. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【145】Probenecid: May increase the serum concentration of Cephalosporins. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【146】RifAMPin: Cephalosporins (N-methylthiotetrazole \[NMTT\] Side Chain Containing) may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of RifAMPin. Specifically, the risk for bleeding may be increased. Management: Avoid concomitant use of rifampin with cephalosporins that contain an N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT) side chain when possible. If combined, closely monitor prothrombin time or other coagulation tests and administer vitamin K as needed. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【147】Sodium Picosulfate: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Sodium Picosulfate. Management: Consider using an alternative product for bowel cleansing prior to a colonoscopy in patients who have recently used or are concurrently using an antibiotic. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

Postpone vaccination until 3 days after cessation of antibiotics and avoid starting antibiotics within 3 days of last vaccine dose. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【149】Vitamin K Antagonists (eg, warfarin): Cephalosporins may enhance the anticoagulant effect of Vitamin K Antagonists. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【150】Food Interactions

【151】Concurrent use with ethanol may cause a disulfiram-like reaction. Management: Monitor patients.

【152】Pregnancy Considerations

【153】Cefotetan crosses the placenta and produces therapeutic concentrations in the amniotic fluid and cord serum. Cefotetan is one of the antibiotics recommended for prophylactic use prior to cesarean delivery.

【154】Breastfeeding Considerations

【155】Cefotetan is present in breast milk

【156】Although the manufacturer recommends to use with caution, cephalosporins are generally considered acceptable for use in breastfeeding women (Ito 2000). In general, antibiotics that are present in breast milk may cause nondose-related modification of bowel flora. Monitor infants for GI disturbances, such as thrush or diarrhea (WHO 2002).

【157】Dietary Considerations

【158】Some products may contain sodium.

【159】Monitoring Parameters

【160】Monitor renal, hepatic, and hematologic function periodically with prolonged therapy. Monitor prothrombin time in patients at risk of prolongation during cephalosporin therapy (nutritionally-deficient, prolonged treatment, renal or hepatic disease). Monitor for signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia, including hematologic parameters where appropriate.

【161】Mechanism of Action

【162】Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to one or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which in turn inhibits the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls, thus inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis. Bacteria eventually lyse due to ongoing activity of cell wall autolytic enzymes (autolysins and murein hydrolases) while cell wall assembly is arrested.

【163】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【164】Distribution: Widely to body tissues and fluids including bile, gallbladder, kidney, skin, tonsils, uterus, sputum, prostatic and peritoneal fluids.

【165】Protein binding: 88%.

【166】Half-life elimination:

【167】Infants and Children: 1.85 to 3.5 hours (Martin 1994).

【168】Adults: 3 to 4.6 hours, prolonged in patients with moderately impaired renal function (up to 10 hours).

【169】Time to peak, serum: IM: 1 to 3 hours.

【170】Excretion: Urine .

【171】Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【172】Anti-infective considerations:

【173】_Parameters associated with efficacy:_

【174】Time dependent; associated with time free drug concentration ( _f_ T) > minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): Goal: ≥40% to 50% ( _f_ T) > MIC (bacteriostatic), ≥60% to 70% ( _f_ T) > MIC (bactericidal) .

【175】Expected drug exposure in normal renal function:

【176】Adults, C max (peak):

【177】Single dose:

【178】500 mg: ~69 to 79 mg/L .

【179】1 g: ~126 to 142 mg/L .

【180】2 g: ~237 to 337 mg/L .

【181】Steady state: 1 g twice daily: 147.58 ± 22.71 mg/L (Liu 2020).
