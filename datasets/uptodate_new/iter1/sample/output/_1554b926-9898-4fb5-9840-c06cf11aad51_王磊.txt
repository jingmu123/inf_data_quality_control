【3】ALERT: US Boxed Warning

【4】Hepatotoxicity:

【5】Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents usually have occurred during the first 6 months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first 6 months.

【6】Children <2 years of age are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those on multiple antiseizure medications, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease. When these products are used in this patient group, they should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. The incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups.

【7】Patients with mitochondrial disease:

【8】There is an increased risk of valproate-induced acute liver failure and resultant deaths in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by DNA mutations of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) gene (eg, Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome). Valproate is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children younger than 2 years who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder. In patients >2 years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, only use after other antiseizure medications have failed. This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with valproate for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver testing. POLG mutation screening should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice.

【9】Fetal risk:

【10】Valproate can cause major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects (eg, spina bifida). In addition, valproate can cause decreased IQ scores and neurodevelopmental disorders following in utero exposure. Valproate is therefore contraindicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in pregnant women and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. Valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such situations, effective contraception should be used.

【11】A Medication Guide describing the risks of valproate is available for patients.

【12】Pancreatitis:

【13】Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with a rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Cases have been reported shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If pancreatitis is diagnosed, valproate should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated.

【20】Dosing: Neonatal

【21】**Dosage guidance:**

【22】**Safety:** Due to the increased risk of valproic acid and derivatives-associated hepatotoxicity, valproic acid and derivatives are not preferred agents for use in neonates and not routinely used ; reserve use in refractory cases only after other multiple therapeutic options have failed.

【23】Refractory seizures

【24】**Refractory seizures:** Limited data available: Oral: Loading dose: 20 mg/kg, followed by a maintenance dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours; adjust dose according to serum concentrations; dosing based on a report of six neonates (GA: 30 to 41 weeks) that showed oral valproic acid effectively controlled seizure activity in five of six patients; however, therapy was discontinued in 50% of the patients due to hyperammonemia; frequent monitoring is recommended .

【25】Refractory status epilepticus

【26】**Refractory status epilepticus:** Limited data available: IV: Loading dose: 20 to 40 mg/kg followed by a continuous IV infusion of 5 mg/kg/ **hour** was used in five neonates; once patients were seizure-free for 12 hours and no longer had seizure activity on EEG, the infusion rate was decreased every 2 hours by 1 mg/kg/ **hour** .

【27】Dosing: Pediatric

【28】**Dosage guidance:**

【29】**Safety:** Use of Depakote ER in pediatric patients <10 years of age is not recommended; do not confuse Depakote ER with Depakote. **Erroneous substitution of Depakote (delayed-release tablets) for Depakote ER has resulted in toxicities; only Depakote ER is intended for once daily administration.**

【30】Migraine, prophylaxis

【31】**Migraine, prophylaxis:**

【32】Divalproex sodium (eg, Depakote tablets):

【33】Children ≥5 years and Adolescents ≤16 years: Limited data available: Oral: Initial 10 to 15 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses; maximum initial dose: 250 mg/dose. Titrate as needed over 4 to 6 weeks to 40 to 45 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses; maximum daily dose: 1,000 mg/ **day** . Dosing based on multiple pediatric trials. In one open-label trial of divalproex sodium (DVS) (n=42; age range: 7 to 16 years); dose was initiated at 15 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses and increased as needed over 6 weeks to 45 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses. After 4 months, 78.5% of subjects had a 50% decrease in headaches frequency, 14.2% had a 75% decrease in headache frequency, and 9.5% became headache free . In a randomized comparative trial of pediatric patients aged 4 to 15 years, sodium valproate (n=54) was initiated at 10 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses and titrated based on clinical response and tolerability up to a maximum dose of 40 mg/kg/day in divided doses; similar efficacy to propranolol (n=56) was observed with regards to decrease in headache frequency by >50%, mean headache duration, headache severity, and improved response to rescue medications . A small (n=10) open-label trial of pediatric patients 9 to 17 years showed a statistically significant decrease in mean frequency of headache attacks, severity, and duration with divalproex sodium therapy using a daily dose range of 500 to 1,000 mg/day .

【34】Adolescents ≥17 years: Depakote: Oral: 250 mg twice daily; adjust dose based on patient response; maximum daily dose: 1,000 mg/ **day** .

【35】Depakote ER: Limited data available: Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: Oral: 500 mg once daily for 15 days, may increase to 1,000 mg once daily; adjust dose based on patient response; usual dosage range: 250 to 1,000 mg/day; dose should be individualized; if smaller dosage adjustments are needed, use Depakote delayed-release tablets; results from a Phase 3, long-term  open-label trial of 241 patients (age: 12 to 17 years) showed a 75% decrease in median 4-week headache days between the first and fourth months of the trial . In a short-term , double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial of 304 patients (age: 12 to 17 years), Depakote ER  was no different than placebo at reducing the 4-week headache rate; however, a large placebo effect was observed in the study population (Apostol 2008).

【36】Migraine, treatment; refractory

【37】**Migraine, treatment; refractory:** Limited data available, efficacy results variable, optimal regimen not established:

【38】Intermittent IV: Adolescents 500 or 1,000 mg infused at 50 mg/minute; a repeat dose of 500 mg may be administered if pain relief not observed ; dosing based on two retrospective reports that evaluated experience in 43 patients treated for acute migraine attack(s) (n=60; some subjects presented with multiple attacks); the mean age in both reports was 15 years and the majority of patients received 1,000 mg doses. One trial evaluated 48 clinic visits for acute migraine attack in 31 patients; adequate pain relief was reported in 77.6% of visits (n=45) after a single valproic acid dose; the mean time to achieve maximum pain relief was 63 ± 31 minutes (range: 15 to 160 minutes) after a single dose of valproic acid; maximum pain reduction following a repeat 500 mg dose was observed at 124 ± 62 minutes (range: 20 to 250 minutes) .

【39】Continuous IV infusion: Children ≥4 years and Adolescents:

【40】_Loading dose:_ IV: 20 mg/kg; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose infused over 30 to 60 minutes.

【41】_Continuous infusion:_ IV: Initial: 1 mg/kg/ **hour** ; adjust to maintain target serum concentrations of 80 to 100 mcg/mL (assessed at 2 to 4 hours and at 24 hours after loading dose) . Dosing based on a retrospective report including 83 patients (mean age: 12.9 years; range: 4 to 18 years) who received IV valproate for status migrainosus after failing home oral therapy and initial IV therapy in the emergency department (diphenhydramine, metoclopramide, and ketorolac); the mean reported rate was 1 mg/kg/ **hour** , and an excellent response  was reported in 55  patients; within the responder group, 56% reported response within 16 hours and 76% within 24 hours. Patients were then transitioned to oral valproic acid therapy migraine prophylaxis therapy on the delayed-released formulation initiated at the same dosage as last 24 hours of IV infusion .

【42】Seizure disorder

【43】**Seizure disorder:** **Note:** Due to the increased risk of valproic acid and derivatives-associated hepatotoxicity in patients <2 years, valproic acid and derivatives are not preferred agents in this population.

【44】Oral:

【45】_General dosing (including focal onset seizures with impaired consciousness or awareness \[complex partial seizures\], mixed seizure disorders, tonic-clonic):_ Children and Adolescents: Limited data available for some seizure types and ages <10 years : Initial: 10 to 15 mg/kg/day in 1 to 3 divided doses; increase by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day at weekly intervals until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases; daily doses >250 mg should be given in divided doses; maintenance: 30 to 60 mg/kg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses; Depakote and Depakote Sprinkle can be given twice daily; **Note:** Children receiving more than 1 antiseizure medication (ie, polytherapy) may require doses up to 100 mg/kg/day in 3 to 4 divided doses.

【46】_Generalized nonmotor (absence) seizures, focal onset seizures with or without impaired consciousness or awareness (simple and complex):_ Children and Adolescents: Initial: 15 mg/kg/day in 1 to 3 divided doses; increase by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day at weekly intervals until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases; daily doses >250 mg should be given in divided doses; maintenance: 30 to 60 mg/kg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses; Depakote and Depakote Sprinkle can be given twice daily.

【47】_Conversion to Depakote ER from a stable dose of immediate release or delayed release:_ May require an increase in the total daily dose between 8% and 20% administered once daily to maintain similar serum concentrations . For doses that do not directly convert to a Depakote ER dose form, clinicians may consider increasing to the next highest dose of the immediate or delayed-release (eg, Depakote) formulation before converting to the appropriate daily dose of Depakote ER.

【48】_Conversion to monotherapy from adjunctive therapy:_ The concomitant antiseizure drug (AED) can be decreased by ~25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of valproic acid therapy or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

【49】Parenteral: Children and Adolescents: Limited data available in some cases depending on seizure types and age : IV: Total daily IV dose is equivalent to the total daily oral dose; however, IV dose should be divided with a frequency of every 6 hours; if IV form is administered 2 to 3 times/day, close monitoring of trough concentrations is recommended; switch patients to oral product as soon as clinically possible as IV use >14 days has not been studied.

【50】Rectal: Limited data available: Children and Adolescents: Dilute oral syrup 1:1 with water for use as a retention enema :

【51】Loading dose: 17 to 20 mg/kg once.

【52】Maintenance: 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours.

【53】Status epilepticus; urgent therapy/second-line therapy or refractory

【54】**Status epilepticus; urgent therapy/second-line therapy or refractory:** Limited data available:

【55】Loading dose: Initial:

【56】_American Epilepsy Society guidelines_ : Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 40 mg/kg as a single dose; maximum dose: 3,000 mg/dose.

【57】_Neurocritical care guidelines_ : Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 20 to 40 mg/kg; may be followed by an additional 20 mg/kg after 10 minutes if needed.

【58】Maintenance dose: Continuous IV infusion: 5 mg/kg/ **hour** after the loading dose was used in pediatric continuous IV infusion studies ; once patients were seizure-free for 6 hours, the infusion rate was decreased by 1 mg/kg/ **hour** every 2 hours . Lower initial infusion rates of 1 mg/kg/ **hour** have also been described .

【59】**Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:** Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.

【60】Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric

【61】All patients: Mild to severe impairment: No dosage adjustment required (including patients on hemodialysis); however, protein binding is reduced in patients with renal impairment; monitoring **only** total valproate serum concentrations may be misleading.

【62】Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Pediatric

【63】All patients:

【64】Mild to moderate impairment: Not recommended for use in hepatic disease; clearance is decreased with liver impairment. Hepatic disease is also associated with decreased albumin concentrations and 2- to 2.6-fold increase in the unbound fraction of valproate. Free concentrations of valproate may be elevated while total concentrations appear normal; therefore, monitoring **only** total valproate concentrations may be misleading.

【65】Severe impairment: Use is contraindicated.

【66】Dosing: Adult

【67】**Dosage guidance:**

【68】**Dosing:** All doses in this monograph are expressed as the equivalent amounts of valproic acid. Available formulations of valproate (active moiety) include valproic acid, valproate sodium, and divalproex sodium (also known as valproate semisodium) salts; refer to product-specific labeling for details. The dosing recommendations are expressed as the total daily dose (ie, per 24 hours) unless stated otherwise. The total daily oral dose is given in 1 to 4 divided doses per day depending on the type of preparation.

【69】**Dosage form information:** Although the manufacturer recommends divided doses of the DR formulation (usually dosed 2 to 3 times daily) to maintain stable serum concentrations, once the dose is stabilized, once-daily dosing may be tolerated in some patients . However, fluctuating serum concentrations may increase the risk for breakthrough seizures in patients with seizure disorders . The ER oral formulation is not available in Canada.

【70】Bipolar disorder

【71】**Bipolar disorder:**

【72】**Acute mania or acute episodes with mixed features (in combination with or as an alternative to an antipsychotic) (BAP \[Goodwin 2016\]):**

【73】Fixed dose: **Oral:** Initial: 500 to 750 mg/day in 1 to 4 divided doses based on chosen formulation (immediate release usually dosed 3 to 4 times daily, delayed release usually dosed 2 to 3 times daily, extended release commonly dosed once daily but may also be dosed twice daily) ; increase by 250 to 500 mg/day every 1 to 3 days to reach desired clinical effect and therapeutic serum concentration ; therapeutic serum levels generally occur with doses of 1.5 to 2.5 **g/day** . Maximum recommended dosage: 60 **mg/kg/day** .

【74】Weight-based loading dose _for rapid symptom control_ : **Oral:** Initial: 20 to 30 mg/kg/day in 1 to 4 divided doses based on chosen formulation (immediate release usually dosed 3 to 4 times daily, delayed release usually dosed 2 to 3 times daily, extended release commonly dosed once daily but may also be dosed twice daily). After 2 to 3 days, adjust dose upward or downward to reach desired clinical effect and therapeutic serum concentration ; therapeutic serum levels generally occur with doses of 1.5 to 2.5 **g/day** . To avoid intolerable adverse effects, some experts limit the initial rapid loading dose to 20 mg/kg/day (up to 2 **g/day** if body weight exceeds 100 kg) and then adjust based on response and serum concentration . Maximum recommended dosage: 60 **mg/kg/day** .

【75】**Bipolar disorder, depressive episode (alternative agent) (mono- or adjunctive therapy) (off-label use):** Based on limited data: **Oral:** Initial: 500 to 750 mg/day in 1 to 4 divided doses based on chosen formulation (immediate release usually dosed 3 to 4 times daily, delayed release usually dosed 2 to 3 times daily, extended release commonly dosed once daily but may also be dosed twice daily); increase by 250 to 500 mg every 1 to 3 days to reach desired clinical effect and therapeutic serum concentration; therapeutic serum levels generally occur with doses of 1.5 to 2.5 **g/day** .

【76】**Maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder (off-label):** **Oral:** Continue dose and combination regimen that was used to achieve control of the acute episode .

【77】Focal onset seizures and generalized onset seizures

【78】**Focal (partial) onset seizures and generalized onset seizures:**

【79】**Note:** FDA-approved for mono- and adjunctive therapy of complex partial and absence seizures, and adjunctive therapy for multiple seizure types; used off label as monotherapy for other seizure types.

【80】**Oral, IV (non-status epilepticus):** Initial monotherapy or adjunctive therapy: 10 to 15 mg/kg/day for complex partial seizures or 15 mg/kg/day for absence seizures in 1 to 4 divided doses based on chosen formulation ( **Oral:** immediate release usually dosed 3 to 4 times daily, delayed release usually dosed 2 to 3 times daily, extended release commonly dosed once daily but may also be dosed twice daily; **IV:** dosed every 6 hours) . Increase by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day at weekly intervals until optimal clinical response and/or therapeutic levels are achieved; maximum recommended dose: 60 mg/kg/day . **Note:** Some experts suggest checking serum level ~1 to 2 weeks after initial dose to guide dose adjustments .

【81】_Conversion to monotherapy from valproate adjunctive therapy:_ Initial oral/IV dosage as above. Dosage reduction of the concomitant antiseizure drug may begin when valproate therapy is initiated or 1 to 2 weeks following valproate initiation. Concomitant antiseizure drug withdrawal may be variable, one suggested strategy is tapering the concomitant antiseizure drug over 8 weeks (eg, by ~25% every 2 weeks).

【82】Migraine, intractable and status migrainosus

【83】**Migraine, intractable and status migrainosus (alternative agent) (off-label use): IV:** 500 mg to 1 **g** as a single dose as part of an appropriate combination regimen .

【84】Migraine, prevention

【85】**Migraine, prevention:**

【86】**Note:** An adequate trial for assessment of effect is considered to be at least 2 to 3 months at a therapeutic dose .

【87】**Oral:** Initial: 500 mg once daily (ER) or in 2 divided doses (DR or ER); increase dose gradually based on response and tolerability in increments of 250 mg/day at intervals >3 days, up to 1 **g/day** in 1 to 2 divided doses based on chosen formulation (DR or ER). Based on clinical experience, some patients require doses up to 1.5 **g/day** for sufficient response; however, adverse effects are increased .

【88】Status epilepticus

【89】**Status epilepticus** **(off-label use):** **Note:** Given in combination with an IV benzodiazepine: **IV:** Loading dose: 20 to 40 mg/kg administered at a rate up to 10 mg/kg/minute (maximum dose: 3 **g** ) . In non-convulsive status epilepticus, some experts recommend a maximal infusion rate of 5 mg/kg/minute .

【90】**Discontinuation of therapy:** In patients receiving valproic acid chronically, unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal, valproic acid should be withdrawn gradually (eg, over 2 to 6 months to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency (in patients with epilepsy) or other withdrawal symptoms) . In patients discontinuing therapy for treatment of bipolar disorder, close monitoring for several weeks to months for reemergence of mania/hypomania is recommended .

【91】**Dosing conversions: Note:** The ER formulation is not available in Canada:

【92】_**Conversion from immediate release to DR or ER**_ **:** When converting to DR, use the same total daily dose as the immediate release and divide into 2 to 3 daily doses. When converting from immediate release to ER, increase the total daily dose of ER by 8% to 20% and dose once daily (most common) or twice daily .

【93】**_Conversion from_** **_DR to ER:_** For patients on a stable dose of DR, increase the total daily dose of ER by 8% to 20% to maintain similar serum concentrations, and dose once daily (most common) or twice daily .

【94】**_Conversion to IV valproate preparations_** _:_ To continue therapy IV in patients temporarily unable to receive oral therapy, total daily IV dose should be equivalent to the total daily oral dose (expressed as valproic acid) and divided every 6 hours. Trough levels may fall below the equivalent oral regimen when administered less frequently than every 6 hours; in these cases, closely monitor trough plasma concentrations.

【95】**Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:** Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.

【96】Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Adult

【97】The renal dosing recommendations are based upon the best available evidence and clinical expertise. Senior Editorial Team: Bruce Mueller, PharmD, FCCP, FASN, FNKF; Jason Roberts, PhD, BPharm (Hons), B App Sc, FSHP, FISAC; Michael Heung, MD, MS.

【98】**Altered kidney function: IV, Oral:**

【99】CrCl ≥10 mL/minute: No dosage adjustment necessary.

【100】CrCl <10 mL/minute: No specific dosage adjustment necessary; however, free valproate clearance may be reduced up to ~30%. Closely monitor clinical response and tolerability in addition to valproic acid serum concentrations, when appropriate. Monitoring of free valproic acid concentrations (when available) is preferred due to decreased protein binding in severe kidney impairment. Total valproate concentrations may be misleading .

【101】**Hemodialysis, intermittent (thrice weekly):**

【102】**IV, Oral:** No specific dosage adjustment necessary. At therapeutic concentrations, dialysis decreases valproic acid concentrations by 20% ; supplemental doses are typically unnecessary as concentrations rebound within a few hours after dialysis . Closely monitor clinical response and tolerability in addition to valproic acid serum concentrations, when appropriate; monitoring of free valproic acid concentrations (when available) is preferred due to decreased protein binding in severe kidney impairment. Total valproate concentrations may be misleading .

【103】**Peritoneal dialysis:** Minimally dialyzed (~4.5%) :

【104】**IV, Oral:** No specific dosage adjustment necessary. Closely monitor clinical response and tolerability in addition to valproic acid serum concentrations, when appropriate; monitoring of free valproic acid concentrations (when available) is preferred due to decreased protein binding in severe kidney impairment. Total valproate concentrations may be misleading .

【105】**CRRT:**

【106】**IV, Oral:** No specific dose adjustment necessary. However, critically ill patients receiving CRRT may exhibit reduced protein binding and increased free valproic acid concentrations, leading to increased removal. Closely monitor clinical response and tolerability in addition to valproic acid serum concentrations, when appropriate; monitoring of free valproic acid concentrations (when available) is preferred. Total valproate concentrations may be misleading .

【107】**PIRRT (eg, sustained, low-efficiency diafiltration):**

【108】**IV, Oral:** No specific dose adjustment necessary. However, critically ill patients receiving PIRRT may exhibit reduced protein binding and increased free valproic acid concentrations, leading to increased removal. Closely monitor clinical response and tolerability in addition to valproic acid serum concentrations, when appropriate; monitoring of free valproic acid concentrations (when available) is preferred. Total valproate concentrations may be misleading .

【109】Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Adult

【110】The liver dosing recommendations are based upon the best available evidence and clinical expertise. Senior Editorial Team: Matt Harris, PharmD, MHS, BCPS, FAST, Jeong Park, PharmD, MS, BCTXP, FCCP, FAST, Arun Jesudian, MD, Sasan Sakiani, MD.

【111】**Note:**

【112】**• Safety:** Drug-induced liver injury: Valproate is predominately metabolized in the liver through glucuronidation, beta- and omega-oxidation; metabolites generated through oxidation are the primary route of de novo toxic intermediaries, a direct cause of hepatotoxicity . Liver biochemistry abnormalities (which are reversible with dose reduction or discontinuation) are common, particularly in patients taking valproate as part of a multidrug regimen .

【113】**• Clinical consideration:** Differentiate etiology of encephalopathy: Valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy may mimic hepatic encephalopathy .

【114】Therapeutic drug monitoring: Assess free valproic acid levels. Valproate is highly albumin-bound (~90%), resulting in higher levels of unbound drug in hypoalbuminemia seen in liver insufficiency; total valproate concentrations can be misleading in this setting .

【115】**Liver impairment prior to treatment initiation:**

【116】**Initial or dose adjustment in patients with preexisting liver cirrhosis:**

【117】**Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A:**

【118】**Note:** Although the manufacturer's labeling states that use of valproate is contraindicated in patients with liver disease, if alternative agents are not available, use of valproate may be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks .

【119】**IV, Oral:** Initial: Use the lowest indication-specific dose possible ; gradually adjust dose to reach desired clinical effect and therapeutic serum concentration using free valproic acid levels .

【120】**Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B and C:** Use is contraindicated .

【121】**Liver impairment developing in patients already receiving valproic acid:**

【122】**Chronic disease progression (eg, outpatient):**

【123】**Note:** If patient's liver progression includes hypoalbuminemia, consider alternative agent(s), as therapeutic drug monitoring (free valproic acid levels) may be difficult to obtain or unavailable.

【124】**Progression from baseline to new Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A: IV, Oral:** Use the lowest effective indication-specific dose; taper to discontinue and convert to an alternative agent(s) if new or worsening neurologic symptoms occur . Dose adjustments should be based on desired clinical effect and therapeutic serum concentration monitoring using free valproic acid levels .

【125】**Progression to Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B or C: IV, Oral:** Taper to discontinue and convert to an alternative agent(s); monitor for the risk of direct hepatotoxicity, worsening valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy, and other neurologic symptoms (eg, drowsiness) until valproate has been discontinued .

【126】**Acute worsening liver function (eg, requiring hospitalization):**

【127】**Note:** Discontinue valproate and convert to a different agent if valproate-induced liver injury is suspected . Additionally, do **not** use valproate in patients with hypoalbuminemia because free valproic acid levels are elevated in these patients .

【128】**Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A:** **Note:** Although the manufacturer's labeling states that use of valproate is contraindicated in patients with liver disease, if alternative agents are not available, continued use of valproate may be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks .

【129】**IV, Oral:** Use the lowest effective indication-specific dose; taper to discontinue and convert to a different agent if new or worsening neurologic symptoms occur . Dose adjustments should be based on desired clinical effect and therapeutic serum concentration monitoring using free valproic acid levels .

【130】**Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B or C: IV, Oral:** Taper to discontinue and convert to a different agent(s); monitor for the risk of direct hepatotoxicity, worsening valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy, and other neurologic symptoms (eg, drowsiness) until valproate has been discontinued .

【131】Adverse Reactions (Significant): Considerations

【132】CNS effects

【133】Valproate may cause CNS effects, mostly related to CNS depression (including **dizziness** and **drowsiness** ). However, nervous system stimulation (eg, **nervousness, insomnia** , **tremor** ) may also occur in some patients. More severe reactions, including **delirium**  and **hallucinations** , have also been reported. **Parkinsonism** and **cognitive dysfunction** are also concerns associated with several antiseizure medications, including valproate . Cognitive decline has particularly been a concern in patients with bipolar disorder . In general, valproate appears to have less effect on cognitive abilities compared to other older antiseizure medications .

【134】_Mechanism:_ Dose-related; decreases neuronal excitation in the CNS by enhancing the activity of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). Valproate also has a direct effect on voltage gated sodium channels, may regulate the excitatory activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, and regulates neuronal gene expression . Of note, cognitive function does not appear to correspond with ammonia levels in patients receiving valproate .

【135】_Onset:_ Varied; with respect to common (dose-related) CNS effects, the onset and duration correlate with the increase in concentration. Identification of patients with parkinsonism and cognitive decline have been described after several years of therapy .

【136】_Risk factors:_

【137】• Increased unbound valproate concentrations (decreased albumin) 

【138】• Use of multiple antiseizure medications 

【139】Hematologic effects

【140】Valproate is associated with a range of hematologic effects. Coagulopathy, including **thrombocytopenia** , **decreased platelet aggregation** , and acquired von Willebrand disease type I may result in **hemorrhage** in patients receiving valproate. Severe complications, including **hemorrhagic stroke** , have occurred . In some cases, platelet counts may normalize with continued treatment. Thrombocytopenia is generally reversible with dose reduction or discontinuation . Other blood disorders, including **aplastic anemia** , **neutropenia** , and **pure red cell aplasia** , have been reported .

【141】_Mechanism:_ Dose-related; thrombocytopenia may result from direct bone marrow toxicity, increased platelet destruction, or antibody-mediated depletion of thrombocytes . Valproate may inhibit erythroid differentiation and may activate the myelo-monocytic pathway . Direct suppression of bone marrow by an idiosyncratic mechanism is responsible for the most severe reactions (eg, aplastic anemia) .

【142】_Onset:_ Varied; thrombocytopenia may occur between 8 days to 16 months after initiation. In one study, the mean time to onset was 82 days (range: 38 to 170 days); may develop more quickly depending on dose/valproate levels . Neutropenia may occur in the first few weeks of treatment .

【143】_Risk factors:_

【144】Thrombocytopenia corresponds to:

【145】• Females 

【146】• Higher dosage . Probability of thrombocytopenia increases with total valproate levels ≥110 mcg/mL in females or ≥135 mcg/mL in males.

【147】• Older adults 

【148】Hepatotoxicity/hepatic failure

【149】Valproate is associated with **hepatotoxicity** and **hepatic failure** , including fatal cases in adult and pediatric patients  and may progress despite discontinuation.

【150】_Mechanism:_ Non-dose-related; idiosyncratic. Drug-mediated hepatotoxicity can be the result of direct toxicity/hepatocyte necrosis or the formation of a neoantigen, which results in an immunologic reaction . Direct hepatotoxic reactions may be caused by reactive valproate metabolites, inhibition of fatty acid β-oxidation, excessive oxidative stress, and a susceptibility to these effects may be encoded by genetic variants of key enzymes . Valproate can cause significant mitochondrial toxicity which may underlie many of these events .

【151】_Onset:_ Varied. In patients with defined susceptibility mutations, including mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG), hepatotoxicity commonly occurs within the first 3 months of treatment . The manufacturer’s labeling notes the onset of hepatotoxicity is most common in the first 6 months of therapy; however, clinicians should note these effects may occur at any time during therapy. Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury tends to occur with a more delayed onset (weeks to months) as complex mechanisms, including adaptive immune responses, have been implicated in these reactions .

【152】_Risk factors:_

【153】_•_ Pediatric patients; neonates, infants, and children <2 years of age are at higher risk 

【154】_•_ Hereditary mutations of the POLG gene (eg, Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome \[AHS\]) 

【155】_•_ Neurologic disorders

【156】_•_ Seizure disorder accompanied by developmental delay 

【157】_•_ Metabolic disorders 

【158】_•_ Patients on multiple antiseizure medications 

【159】_•_ Genetic variants of some enzymes, such as carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS1), glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2), UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT), and cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 

【160】Hyperammonemia and encephalopathy

【161】**Hyperammonemia** and/or **hyperammonemic** **encephalopathy** have been reported following the initiation of valproate therapy. This may be characterized by drowsiness, lethargy, changes in level of consciousness, slowing of cognition, vomiting, and focal neurological deficits . Several types of hyperammonemia and encephalopathy have been suggested to occur, based on whether they occur in the presence or absence of hepatic dysfunction .

【162】_Mechanism:_ Non-dose-related; idiosyncratic. In the presence of risk factors (eg, urea cycle disorders, deficiency of carnitine, or high concentrations), valproate metabolism is shunted to a greater proportion of metabolism by omega-oxidation leading to the formation of 4-en-valproic acid, which decreases the function of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase-1, a critical step in the urea cycle . Valproate therapy may induce carnitine deficiency in some individuals, particularly in children and adolescents . Valproate may also decrease the formation of N-acetyl-glutamic acid which is an allosteric activator of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 . Ammonia accumulation leads to glutamine and swelling of astrocytes with associated cerebral edema .

【163】_Onset:_ Varied; may generally occur in the first week of therapy in patients with susceptibility . However, in some cases the first detection of encephalopathy has occurred after several years of therapy .

【164】_Risk factors:_

【165】• Concurrent therapy with antipsychotic drugs 

【166】• Concurrent therapy with liver enzyme-inducing antiseizure medications 

【167】• Concurrent therapy with topiramate (even in patients who previously tolerated monotherapy)

【168】• Nutritional status or a deficiency of carnitine 

【169】• Overdose or higher doses 

【170】• Sex (inconsistent data; some studies have shown a higher risk in males whereas others have shown a higher risk in females) 

【171】Hypersensitivity reactions (delayed)

【172】Valproate is associated with several forms of delayed hypersensitivity reactions including **toxic epidermal necrolysis** (TEN), **Stevens-Johnson syndrome** (SJS), and **drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms** (DRESS) .

【173】_Mechanism:_ Non-dose-related; immunologic **.** Severe cutaneous reactions, including SJS/TEN and DRESS, are delayed type IV hypersensitivity reactions involving a T-cell mediated drug-specific immune response .

【174】_Onset:_ Varied; type IV reactions are delayed hypersensitivity reactions that typically occur days to weeks after drug exposure, but may occur more rapidly (usually within 1 to 4 days) upon re-exposure .

【175】_Risk factors:_

【176】• Concurrent therapy with lamotrigine may increase the risk of SJS/TEN and DRESS .

【177】• Previous hypersensitivity to aromatic antiseizure medications: Cross-reactivity of valproate, a non-aromatic antiseizure medication, with aromatic antiseizure medications (eg, phenytoin and carbamazepine), is not well described . However, there are isolated reports of patients who develop DRESS following an aromatic antiseizure medications, as well as with valproate .

【178】Pancreatitis

【179】Cases of **pancreatitis** have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as **hemorrhagic pancreatitis** with rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Recurrence after rechallenge with valproate has also been documented .

【180】_Mechanism:_ Non-dose-related; idiosyncratic . Direct toxicity has been proposed .

【181】_Onset:_ Varied; in clinical trials, pancreatitis that was possibly or probably related to valproate occurred between 48 and 88 days after initiation . In postmarketing reports, cases occurred in the first year of therapy, but cases have been reported beyond 1 year. In one series, the average onset was 32 months of therapy .

【182】_Risk factors:_

【183】• Most cases have been reported in children with epilepsy or in adults with kidney impairment 

【184】Suicidal ideation/tendencies

【185】Antiseizure medications have been associated with **suicidal ideation** and **suicidal tendencies** . However, the FDA meta-analysis has been criticized due to several important limitations . The risk of suicide is increased in epilepsy , but the occurrence of suicidal ideation/tendencies in epilepsy is multifactorial. While some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (but not all) have been associated with treatment-emergent psychiatric effects such as anxiety and depression, other factors such as postictal suicidal behavior and pertinent patient history must also be evaluated to provide an accurate assessment of risk for any individual drug .

【186】_Onset:_ Varied; peak incidence of suicidality across AEDs (not specific to individual agents) has been noted to occur between 1 and 12 weeks of therapy . A review of clinical trials noted that risk extended from 1 week to 24 weeks of therapy, corresponding to the duration of most trials.

【187】_Risk factors:_

【188】_•_ History of depression 

【189】_•_ Use in conditions other than epilepsy, depression, or bipolar disorder 

【190】_•_ In patients with bipolar disorder, risk for repeat suicide attempt was increased in patients with alcohol/substance abuse disorder, rapid cycling, and earlier age at onset of first manic episode

【245】_Canadian labeling:_ Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Treatment of epilepsy in pregnant women, unless no suitable alternative; treatment of epilepsy in women of childbearing potential, unless requirements of Pregnancy Prevention Program fulfilled; known systemic primary carnitine deficiency with uncorrected hypocarnitinemia; known porphyria.

【246】Epival: Additional contraindication: Treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women, unless no suitable alternative; treatment of bipolar disorder in women of childbearing potential, unless requirements of Pregnancy Prevention Program fulfilled.

【247】Warnings/Precautions

【248】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【249】• Acute head trauma: Not recommended for post-traumatic seizure prophylaxis in patients with acute head trauma; study results for this indication suggested increased mortality with IV valproate sodium use compared to IV phenytoin.

【250】• Dementia: Not recommended for treatment of dementia-associated agitation or aggression; evidence suggests lack of efficacy for this indication, as well as an increased risk of adverse effects .

【251】**_Special populations:_**

【252】• Older adult: Use with caution as older adults may be more sensitive to sedating effects and dehydration; in some older adult patients with somnolence, concomitant decreases in nutritional intake and weight loss were observed. Reduce initial dosages in older adult patients and closely monitor fluid status, nutritional intake, somnolence, and other adverse events.

【253】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【254】• Gastrointestinal: Medication residue in stool has been reported (rarely) with oral divalproex sodium formulations; some reports have occurred in patients with shortened GI transit times (eg, diarrhea) or anatomic GI disorders (eg, ileostomy, colostomy). In patients reporting medication residue in stool, it is recommended to monitor valproate level and clinical condition.

【255】• Viral replication: In vitro studies have suggested valproate stimulates the replication of HIV and CMV viruses under experimental conditions. The clinical consequence of this is unknown but should be considered when monitoring affected patients.

【256】• Withdrawal: Antiseizure medications should not be discontinued abruptly because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency; therapy should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency, unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal.

【257】Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations

【258】Although carnitine is indicated for the management of valproic acid overdose and hepatotoxicity (and strongly recommended for select patients at high risk of valproic acid-associated hepatotoxicity), the role of routine prophylactic carnitine supplementation is unclear . A case of a fatal hepatotoxic reaction has been reported in a child receiving valproic acid despite carnitine supplementation (Murphy 1993).

【259】Medication residue in stool has been reported (rarely) with oral Depakote (divalproex sodium) formulations; some reports have occurred in patients with shortened GI transit times (eg, diarrhea) or anatomic GI disorders (eg, ileostomy, colostomy). In patients reporting medication residue in stool, it is recommended to monitor valproate level and clinical condition.

Management: Reduce the Intermezzo brand sublingual zolpidem adult dose to 1.75 mg for men who are also receiving other CNS depressants. No such dose change is recommended for women. Avoid use with other CNS depressants at bedtime; avoid use with alcohol. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【516】Zuranolone: May enhance the CNS depressant effect of CNS Depressants. Management: Consider alternatives to the use of zuranolone with other CNS depressants or alcohol. If combined, consider a zuranolone dose reduction and monitor patients closely for increased CNS depressant effects. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【517】Food Interactions

【518】Food may delay but does not affect the extent of absorption. Management: May administer with food if GI upset occurs.

【519】Reproductive Considerations

【520】**Valproate is contraindicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in patients of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception.**

【521】**Valproate should not be used to treat patients with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable.**

【522】Evaluate pregnancy status in patients who could become pregnant . Patients with epilepsy prescribed valproate should be switched to other agents prior to menarche (Toledo 2021). Counsel patients at the onset of puberty and regularly during therapy regarding risks and benefits of valproate if pregnancy should occur during treatment. **Valproate should not be administered to a patient of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable** . If valproate therapy is required in patients who could become pregnant, highly effective individualized contraception should be used. When use of valproate is required in patients with epilepsy who could become pregnant, the minimum effective dose should be used, and slow-release formulations should be prescribed (to avoid high peak concentrations) (Toledo 2021).

【523】Algorithms are available for the management of patients who are planning a pregnancy or could have an unexpected pregnancy while taking valproic acid for bipolar disorder. Nonpregnant patients who are stable on monotherapy and are planning a pregnancy should undergo a slow taper (>4 weeks); alternative treatment and a faster taper should be introduced in unstable patients during this time. Additional details are available for patients planning a pregnancy who are on multiple medications (Anmella 2019).

【524】When pregnancy is being planned in patients with epilepsy, consider tapering off of therapy prior to conception if appropriate ; abrupt discontinuation of therapy may cause status epilepticus and lead to maternal and fetal hypoxia. Pregnancies should be planned 1 year prior to conception, ≥ 1 month after the last valproate dose during a seizure-free period. Contraception should continue for 3 months after discontinuing valproate and transitioning to a new antiepileptic medication (Toledo 2021).

【525】Counsel patients planning to become pregnant regarding benefits and risk of valproate use during pregnancy. Folic acid decreases the risk of neural tube defects in the general population; supplementation with folic acid should be used prior to conception and during pregnancy in all patients, including those taking valproate.

【526】Infertility, irregular menses, secondary amenorrhea, polycystic ovary syndrome, aspermia, azoospermia, decreased sperm count and motility, and abnormal sperm morphology have been reported following valproate use.

【527】Pregnancy Considerations

【528】Valproate crosses the placenta (Harden 2009b).

【529】**Valproate can cause major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects (eg, spina bifida). In addition, valproate can cause decreased IQ scores and neurodevelopmental disorders following in utero exposure.** Neural tube defects, craniofacial defects (eg, oral clefts, craniosynostosis), cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, and limb malformations (eg, clubfoot, polydactyly) have been reported. Information from the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry notes the rate of major malformations to be 9% to 11% following an average exposure to valproate monotherapy 1,000 mg/day; this is an increase in congenital malformations when compared with monotherapy with other antiseizure drugs (AED). Based on data from the CDC National Birth Defects Prevention Network, the risk of spinal bifida is approximately 1% to 2% following valproate exposure (general population risk estimated to be 0.06% to 0.07%).

【530】Nonteratogenic adverse effects have also been reported. Decreased IQ scores have been noted in children exposed to valproate in utero when compared to children exposed to other antiseizure medications or no antiseizure medications; the risk of autism spectrum disorders and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder may also be increased. Hearing loss or impairment may occur following in utero exposure. Fatal hepatic failure and hypoglycemia in infants have been noted in case reports following in utero exposure to valproate.

【531】The pharmacokinetic properties of valproate in pregnancy are highly variable. If use is needed, monitoring of total and unbound serum concentrations should be done prior to and during pregnancy (Johannessen 2018). Clotting factor abnormalities (hypofibrinogenemia, thrombocytopenia, or decrease in other coagulation factors) may develop in the mother following valproate use during pregnancy; close monitoring of coagulation factors is recommended.

【532】Due to the risks of adverse fetal events, **valproate is contraindicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in pregnant patients. Valproate should not be used to treat pregnant patients with epilepsy or bipolar disorder unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable.** Current guidelines recommend complete avoidance of valproate for the treatment of epilepsy in pregnant patients whenever possible (Harden 2009a).

【533】Monitoring Parameters

【534】Liver enzymes (prior to therapy and at frequent intervals, especially during the first 6 months), bilirubin, serum ammonia (with symptoms of lethargy, mental status change), CBC with platelets (prior to initiation and periodically during therapy), vitamin D levels, bodyweight, serum concentrations, PT/PTT (especially prior to surgery); signs and symptoms of suicidality (eg, anxiety, depression, behavior changes), motor and cognitive function, persistent vomiting

【535】In general, trough concentrations should be used to assess adequacy of therapy; peak concentrations may also be drawn if clinically necessary (eg, concentration-related toxicity). When extended-release tablets are administered at bedtime, levels drawn ≥18 hours postdose have been suggested to provide an acceptable estimate of trough concentrations when levels timed closer to the next dose are inconvenient (eg, during outpatient monitoring) .

【536】Patient-specific factors must be taken into consideration when interpreting drug concentrations, including indication, age (particularly pediatric patients), clinical response, pregnancy status, adherence, comorbidities, adverse effects, and concomitant medications .

【537】_Valproic acid, total:_

【538】**Seizure disorder** : Infants, Children, Adolescents, and Adults:

【539】A target range of 50 to 100 mcg/mL (SI: 346.5 to 693 micromole/L) is generally recognized (Patsalos 2018), although in pediatric patients (particularly neonates and young infants), the relationship between total plasma concentration and therapeutic response is not well documented ; individualized therapeutic concentration ranges for seizure control may be necessary; some patients may improve at total serum levels >100 mcg/mL (SI: 693 micromole/L), and toxicity may occur at levels of 100 to 150 mcg/mL (SI: 693 to 1,039.5 micromole/L).

【540】**Mania:** Adult: Therapeutic trough: 50 to 125 mcg/mL (SI: 346.5 to 866.3 micromole/L).

【541】_Valproic acid, free:_ In pediatric patients, reported ranges are variable and have not been defined; determination of a therapeutic free range should be individualized . In pediatric patients, higher serum concentrations were observed to have a higher percentage of unbound valproic acid (nonlinear relationship) (Panomvana Na Ayudhya 2006). Monitoring free valproic acid serum concentrations should be considered in some clinical situations which may include the following: Pediatric patients; patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, low serum albumin, elevated total serum valproic acid concentration, significant drug interactions that may displace valproic acid drug from protein sites, less than desired therapeutic response, or pregnancy . In adult patients, a therapeutic free serum range of 5 to 15 mcg/mL (SI: 34.7 to 104 micromole/L) has been suggested (Smetana 2016).

【542】Mechanism of Action

【543】Causes increased availability of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, to brain neurons or may enhance the action of GABA or mimic its action at postsynaptic receptor sites. Also blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels, which results in suppression of high-frequency repetitive neuronal firing (Bourin 2009). Divalproex sodium is a compound of sodium valproate and valproic acid; divalproex dissociates to valproate in the GI tract.

【544】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【545】Distribution: Distributes into CSF at concentrations similar to unbound concentration in plasma (ie, ~10% of total plasma concentration)

【546】V d : Total valproate: 11 L/1.73 m 2 ; Free valproate 92 L/1.73 m 2

【547】Protein binding (concentration dependent): 80% to 90%; free fraction: ~10% at 40 mcg/mL and ~18.5% at 130 mcg/mL; protein binding decreased in neonates, the elderly and patients with hepatic or renal impairment

【548】Metabolism: Extensively hepatic via glucuronide conjugation  and 40% via mitochondrial beta-oxidation; other oxidative metabolic pathways occur to a lesser extent.

【549】Bioavailability: Extended release: ~90% relative to IV dose and ~89% relative to delayed release formulation. In pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age, once-daily administration of the ER formulation produced valproate plasma concentration-time profiles similar to adults.

【550】Half-life elimination (increased in neonates, elderly, and patients with liver impairment):

【551】Newborns (exposed to VPA in utero): 30 to 60 hours

【552】Neonates first week of life: 40 to 45 hours

【553】Neonates <10 days: 10 to 67 hours

【554】Children >2 months: 7 to 13 hours

【555】Children and Adolescents 2 to 14 years: 9 hours (range: 3.5 to 20 hours) (Cloyd 1993)

【556】Adults: 9 to 19 hours

【557】Time to peak, serum:

【558】Oral:

【559】Divalproex sodium:

【560】Delayed release: tablet and sprinkle capsules: ~4 hours

【561】Extended release: 4 to 17 hours

【562】Immediate release enteric-coated tablet \[Canadian product\]: 4 hours

【563】Valproic acid delayed release capsule: 2 hours

【564】Rectal (off-label route): 1 to 3 hours (Graves 1987)

【565】Excretion: Urine ; faster clearance in children who receive other antiseizure drugs and those who are younger; age and polytherapy explain 80% of interpatient variability in total clearance; children >10 years of age have pharmacokinetic parameters similar to adults

【566】**Note:** ER formulation has 10% to 20% less fluctuation in serum concentration than delayed release formulation. ER formulation is not bioequivalent to delayed release formulation.

【567】Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【568】Altered kidney function: A 27% reduction in clearance of unbound valproate is seen in patients with CrCl <10 mL/minute. Hemodialysis reduces valproate concentrations by 20%. Therefore, no dosage adjustment appears to be necessary in patients with renal failure. Protein binding is reduced. Monitoring of free valproate concentrations may be of clinical value; total valproate concentrations may be misleading.

【569】Hepatic function impairment: Clearance is decreased with liver impairment. Hepatic disease is also associated with decreased albumin concentrations and 2- to 2.6-fold increase in the unbound fraction. Free concentrations of valproate may be elevated while total concentrations appear normal.
