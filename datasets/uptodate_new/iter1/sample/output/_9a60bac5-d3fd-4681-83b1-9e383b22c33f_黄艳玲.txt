【132】Alcohol (Ethyl): Tinidazole may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Alcohol (Ethyl). A disulfiram-like reaction may occur. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【133】Bacillus clausii: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Bacillus clausii. Management: Bacillus clausii should be taken in between antibiotic doses during concomitant therapy. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【134】BCG (Intravesical): Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of BCG (Intravesical). _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【135】BCG Vaccine (Immunization): Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of BCG Vaccine (Immunization). _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【136】Cholera Vaccine: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Cholera Vaccine. Management: Avoid cholera vaccine in patients receiving systemic antibiotics, and within 14 days following the use of oral or parenteral antibiotics. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【137】Disulfiram: Tinidazole may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Disulfiram. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【138】Fecal Microbiota (Live) (Oral): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Antibiotics. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【139】Fecal Microbiota (Live) (Rectal): Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Fecal Microbiota (Live) (Rectal). _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【140】Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (Anti-PD-1, -PD-L1, and -CTLA4 Therapies): Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (Anti-PD-1, -PD-L1, and -CTLA4 Therapies). _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【141】Lactobacillus and Estriol: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Lactobacillus and Estriol. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【142】Mycophenolate: Antibiotics may decrease serum concentrations of the active metabolite(s) of Mycophenolate. Specifically, concentrations of mycophenolic acid (MPA) may be reduced. _Risk C: Monitor therapy_

【143】Sodium Picosulfate: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Sodium Picosulfate. Management: Consider using an alternative product for bowel cleansing prior to a colonoscopy in patients who have recently used or are concurrently using an antibiotic. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【145】Food Interactions

【146】Peak antibiotic serum concentration lowered and delayed, but total drug absorbed not affected. Management: Administer with food.

【147】Dietary Considerations

【148】The manufacturer recommends that ethanol be avoided during treatment and for 3 days after therapy is complete.

【149】Pregnancy Considerations

【150】Tinidazole crosses the human placenta and enters the fetal circulation (Karhunen 1984).

【151】Bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and treatment during pregnancy is recommended. However, due to adverse events observed in animal reproduction studies and limited human data, use of agents other than tinidazole in pregnant patients is preferred (CDC \[Workowski 2021\]).

【155】Absorption: Rapid and complete

【156】Distribution: V d : ~50 L; distributes to most body tissues and fluids; crosses the blood-brain barrier

【157】Protein binding: 12%

【158】Metabolism: Hepatic via CYP3A4 (primarily); undergoes oxidation, hydroxylation and conjugation; forms a metabolite

【159】Half-life elimination: 13.2 hours
