Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this page.

【1】How can I stay safe in the hospital? 

【2】Being in the hospital can be stressful or scary. The doctors, nurses, and other staff members are there to help you feel better and stay safe. You might often be asked to repeat your name and birth date, and the staff will often check your wrist band. This is to make sure that you are getting the right care and treatment.

【3】Below are some other things you can do to stay safe during your hospital stay.

【4】Ask questions 

【5】This is very important to make sure that you know what to expect.

【6】 Be sure that you understand any tests, treatments, or procedures you are getting. If anything is not clear, ask the doctor or nurse to explain it again.

【7】 Use your own words to repeat back what you were told. This way, the doctor or nurse can make sure that you are understanding correctly.

【8】 Write down your questions. This will help you remember to ask them the next time you see the doctor. It is OK to ask your doctor to write down the answers or to give you time to write down the answers.

【9】 If possible, have a friend or family member you trust with you. They can help you ask questions and remember the answers.

【10】 Ask your doctor if it is OK to record your conversation. This way, you can share it with your family if they cannot be there.

【11】 Speak up if you are worried or confused about anything.

【12】Protect yourself from infection 

【13】This is important because people might come into contact with germs in the hospital. If they are not careful, germs can spread from one person to another. To lower the risk of infection:

【14】 Good handwashing is very important. Everyone who comes into your hospital room should wash their hands .

【15】 If you have any tubes, lines, catheters, or other equipment, the nurses will help you keep these clean. They will also look for signs of infection such as pain, redness, or swelling.

【16】Know which medicines you are taking 

【17】This is important because some medicines can change the way other medicines work. Knowing what medicines you take at home will help the hospital staff know how to care for you. Here are some tips that can help:

【18】 Give your doctor or nurse a list of all the medicines you take, or bring the medicines to the hospital with you. Include all of your prescription and over-the-counter medicines. Also include any herbs, supplements, or vitamins you take.

【19】 Do not take any of your own medicines in the hospital without talking to your doctor first.

【20】 Show your list to any doctors, nurses, or other staff who take care of you in the hospital.

【21】 Learn about any new medicines you get while in the hospital. Make sure that you know the answers to these questions:

【22】• What is this medicine?

【23】• What is it for?

【24】• What should I watch for while taking it?

【25】• How often do I take it?

【26】 Review your list again before you leave the hospital. Make sure that you know if there are new medicines you need to take at home. You might also need to make changes to your old medicines. If your list changes, throw away old lists so you are not confused.

【27】 Talk with the pharmacist when you pick up any new medicines. Make sure that you know what medicines you need and why.

【28】 Talk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist if you are worried about the cost of any of your medicines.

【29】Ask about your test results 

【30】If you had any tests while in the hospital:

【31】 Ask when you can expect to get your results.

【32】 If you have not gotten results from a test, or you do not understand the results, talk to your doctor.

【33】Lower your risk of falling 

【34】People who are older, have certain medical problems, or take certain medicines are at higher risk of falling. Falls can also happen in the hospital because you are in an unfamiliar place.

【35】Your doctors and nurses will talk to you about how to lower your risk of falling. To help keep yourself safe, you can also:

【36】 Ask for help with getting out of bed, getting up from a chair, or going to the bathroom. This is especially important if you have had surgery. Your body needs time to heal, and it's normal to need help with these things while you recover.

【37】 Wear non-slip socks or shoes that fit well and give good support.

【38】All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our peer review process is complete.
