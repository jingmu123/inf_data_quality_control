【3】ALERT: US Boxed Warning

【4】Hyperkalemia:

【5】Abnormal elevation of serum potassium levels (at least 5.5 mEq/L) can occur with all potassium-sparing agents, including triamterene. Hyperkalemia is more likely to occur in patients with renal impairment and diabetes (even without evidence of renal impairment), and in elderly or severely ill patients. Because uncorrected hyperkalemia may be fatal, serum potassium levels must be monitored at frequent intervals especially in patients receiving triamterene, when dosages are changed, or with any illness that may influence renal function.

【51】Warnings/Precautions

【52】**_Concerns related to adverse effects:_**

【53】• Fluid/electrolyte loss: Triamterene can lead to profound diuresis with fluid and electrolyte loss; close medical supervision and dose evaluation are required. Patients with heart failure, renal disease, or cirrhosis may be particularly susceptible to fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Watch for and correct electrolyte disturbances; adjust dose to avoid dehydration.

【54】• Hyperkalemia: **\[US Boxed Warning\]: Hyperkalemia can occur; patients at risk include those with renal impairment, diabetes, the elderly, and the severely ill. Serum potassium levels must be monitored at frequent intervals especially when dosages are changed or with any illness that may cause renal dysfunction.** . In patients who develop hyperkalemia or if hyperkalemia is suspected, obtain an electrocardiogram to rule out hyperkalemia-induced QRS prolongation or other cardiac arrhythmias. Discontinue triamterene and any potassium supplementation in patients who develop hyperkalemia; treat cardiac arrhythmias as clinically indicated.

【55】• Hypersensitivity reactions: Isolated occurrences have been reported. Observe for blood dyscrasias, liver damage or idiosyncratic reactions

【56】• Photosensitivity: Can cause photosensitivity.

【57】**_Disease-related concerns:_**

【58】• Adrenal insufficiency: Avoid use of diuretics for treatment of elevated blood pressure in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease). Adjustment of glucocorticoid/mineralocorticoid therapy and/or use of other antihypertensive agents is preferred to treat hypertension .

【59】• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with prediabetes or diabetes mellitus; may increase blood glucose concentrations and necessitate dosage adjustment of hypoglycemic agents.

【60】• Gout: May cause elevation in uric acid.

【61】• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction; in cirrhosis, avoid electrolyte and acid/base imbalances that might lead to hepatic encephalopathy.

【62】• Kidney stones: Use with caution in patients with kidney stones.

【63】**_Other warnings/precautions:_**

【64】• Abrupt discontinuation: In patients who have received triamterene for prolonged periods of time, a hypothetical risk of rebound kaliuresis may occur when abruptly discontinued; withdraw triamterene gradually in these patients.

【163】Pregnancy Considerations

【164】Triamterene crosses the placenta and is found in cord blood. Use of triamterene to treat edema during normal pregnancies is not appropriate; use may be considered when edema is due to pathologic causes (as in the nonpregnant patient); monitor.

【165】Monitoring Parameters

【166】Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, HCO 3 , chloride), blood pressure, CBC, BUN, creatinine, platelets

【167】Mechanism of Action

【168】Blocks epithelial sodium channels in the late distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting duct which inhibits sodium reabsorption from the lumen. This effectively reduces intracellular sodium, decreasing the function of Na+/K+ ATPase, leading to potassium retention and decreased calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen excretion. As sodium uptake capacity in the DCT/collecting duct is limited, the natriuretic, diuretic, and antihypertensive effects are generally considered weak.

【169】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【170】Onset of action: Diuresis: 2 to 4 hours; **Note:** Maximum therapeutic effect may not occur until after several days of therapy

【171】Duration: Diuresis: 7 to 9 hours

【172】Absorption: Rapid

【173】Metabolism: Primarily metabolized to the sulfate conjugate of hydroxytriamterene

【174】Time to peak, plasma: ~3 hours

【175】Excretion: Urine
