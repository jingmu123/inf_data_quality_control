【12】Candidiasis, invasive infections

【13】**Candidiasis, invasive infections:** Limited data available: IV:

【14】_BSA-directed dosing:_ 25 mg/m 2 /dose once daily ; dosing based on a pharmacokinetic study of 18 neonates (PNA: <12 weeks; GA ≥28 weeks (all except one patient); weight at enrollment: ≥500 g; most \[n=16\] were ≥1 kg); results showed similar serum concentrations to standard adult doses.

【38】Dosing: Adult

【39】Aspergillosis, invasive

【40】**Aspergillosis, invasive (including disseminated and extrapulmonary) (alternative agent):**

【41】**Note:** Reserve for salvage therapy, typically as part of an appropriate combination regimen.

【70】**IV:** 50 mg once daily. Duration is at least until resolution of neutropenia and varies based on degree and duration of immunosuppression .

【71】**_Solid organ transplant (alternative agent):_ IV:** 50 mg once daily; duration varies based on patient risk factors and transplant center protocol .

【72】**Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:** Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.

【73】Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Adult

【74】The renal dosing recommendations are based upon the best available evidence and clinical expertise. Senior Editorial Team: Bruce Mueller, PharmD, FCCP, FASN, FNKF; Jason A. Roberts, PhD, BPharm (Hons), B App Sc, FSHP, FISAC; Michael Heung, MD, MS.

【75】**Altered kidney function:** No dosage adjustment necessary for any degree of kidney dysfunction .

【76】**Hemodialysis, intermittent (thrice weekly):** Poorly dialyzed: No supplemental dose or dosage adjustment necessary .

【77】**Peritoneal dialysis:** Unlikely to be significantly dialyzed (highly protein bound): No dosage adjustment necessary .

【78】**CRRT:** Poorly dialyzed : No dosage adjustment necessary . **Note:** Significant variability in caspofungin pharmacokinetics has been observed in critically ill patients  and those on renal replacement therapies . Results of a Monte Carlo simulation suggest that instead of standard dosing (ie, 70 mg × 1 followed by 50 mg daily), a larger loading dose (ie, 100 mg) and maintenance dose of 50 mg once daily in patients <80 kg or 70 mg once daily in patients >80 kg increases the probability of achieving pharmacodynamic targets .

【79】**PIRRT (eg, sustained, low-efficiency diafiltration):** Unlikely to be significantly dialyzed: No dosage adjustment necessary . **Note:** Significant variability in caspofungin pharmacokinetics has been observed in critically ill patients  and those on renal replacement therapies . Results of a Monte Carlo simulation suggest that instead of standard dosing (ie, 70 mg × 1 followed by 50 mg daily), a larger loading dose (ie, 100 mg) and maintenance dose of 50 mg once daily in patients <80 kg or 70 mg once daily in patients >80 kg increases the probability of achieving pharmacodynamic targets in patients on CRRT ; these results are likely to be applicable to critically ill patients receiving PIRRT therapies as well .

【80】Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Adult

【81】Mild impairment (Child-Pugh class A): No dosage adjustment necessary.

【82】Moderate impairment (Child-Pugh class B): 70 mg on day 1 (where recommended), followed by 35 mg once daily; however, pharmacokinetic data suggest that this dose reduction may result in suboptimal drug exposure .

【83】Severe impairment (Child-Pugh class C): There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling. Subsequent pharmacokinetic data suggest that degree of impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C) does not further decrease clearance of caspofungin and patients with severe impairment can be dosed the same as patients with moderate impairment .

【151】Drug Interactions  

【152】**Note** : Interacting drugs may **not be individually listed below** if they are part of a group interaction (eg, individual drugs within “CYP3A4 Inducers \[Strong\]” are NOT listed). For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program by clicking on the “Launch drug interactions program” link above.

【153】**Note:** Interacting drugs may **not be individually listed below** if they are part of a group interaction (eg, individual drugs within “CYP3A4 Inducers \[Strong\]” are NOT listed). For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program

【154】CycloSPORINE (Systemic): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Caspofungin. CycloSPORINE (Systemic) may increase the serum concentration of Caspofungin. Caspofungin may increase the serum concentration of CycloSPORINE (Systemic). Management: Weigh potential benefits of caspofungin against a possible elevated risk of hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver function and re-evaluate treatment in patients with abnormal values. Mild transaminase elevations may occur relatively commonly. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【155】Inducers of Drug Clearance: May decrease the serum concentration of Caspofungin. Management: Consider using an increased caspofungin dose of 70 mg daily in adults (or 70 mg/m 2 , up to a maximum of 70 mg, daily in pediatric patients) when coadministered with known inducers of drug clearance. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【156】RifAMPin: May decrease the serum concentration of Caspofungin. Management: Caspofungin prescribing information recommends using a dose of 70 mg daily in adults (or 70 mg/m 2 , up to a maximum of 70 mg, daily in pediatric patients) who are also receiving rifampin. _Risk D: Consider therapy modification_

【157】Saccharomyces boulardii: Antifungal Agents (Systemic and Oral \[Non-Absorbable\]) may diminish the therapeutic effect of Saccharomyces boulardii. _Risk X: Avoid combination_

【158】Pregnancy Considerations

【159】Based on animal data, in utero exposure to caspofungin may cause fetal harm.

【160】When treatment of invasive _Aspergillus_ or _Candida_ infections is needed during pregnancy, other agents are preferred (HHS \[OI adult 2020\]; IDSA \[Pappas 2016\]).

【161】Monitoring Parameters

【162】Periodic liver function tests, serum potassium, CBC, hemoglobin; signs of anaphylaxis or histamine-related reactions

【163】Mechanism of Action

【164】Inhibits synthesis of β-D-glucan, limiting potential toxicity.

【165】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【166】Distribution: CSF concentrations: Nondetectable \[<10 ng/mL (n=1)\] (Sáez-Llorens 2009)

【167】Protein binding: ~97% to albumin

【168】Metabolism: Slowly, via hydrolysis and _N_ \-acetylation as well as by spontaneous degradation, with subsequent metabolism to component amino acids. Overall metabolism is extensive.

【169】Half-life elimination: Beta (distribution): 9 to 11 hours (~8 hours in children <12 years); Terminal: 40 to 50 hours; beta phase half-life is 32% to 43% lower in pediatric patients than in adult patients

【170】Excretion: Urine ; feces 

【171】Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【172】Altered kidney function: AUC is increased 30% to 49% in patients with CrCl ≤49 mL/minute after administration of a single 70 mg dose. No effect on caspofungin concentrations was seen in patients with mild to end-stage renal impairment after administration of multiple daily doses.

【173】Hepatic function impairment: AUC is increased by ~55% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) and by 76% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B).

【174】Older adult: AUC is increased by ~28%.

【175】Sex: AUC in women was ~22% higher than in men after repeat dosing.

【176】Obesity: Data with another echinocandin suggest that clearance increases as a function of weight (Hall 2011). From a small study of patients receiving caspofungin in the surgical ICU, body weight >75 kg was an independent predictor for a lower 24-hour trough concentration (Nguyen 2007).
