【23】Iron-deficiency anemia in chronic kidney disease

【24】**Iron-deficiency anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD):**

【25】_Repletion treatment:_ Limited data available: Children ≥2 years and Adolescents ≤15 years: IV: 1 mg/kg/dose per dialysis session; repeat dose with each dialysis session until patient-specific lab goals are met, then follow with maintenance dosing. Dosing based on a dose-finding trial in 14 pediatric patients (ages 2 to 15 years) receiving iron sucrose in combination with epoetin for absolute or functional iron deficiency. Due to a rapid increase in ferritin levels (from 59 mcg/L to 496 mcg/L) observed in the first 6 weeks of the trial, the dosing protocol for iron sucrose was changed from 3 mg/kg/dose per dialysis session to 1 mg/kg/dose per dialysis session; the dose of 1 mg/kg/dose per dialysis session was continued until a patient was considered replete based on study criteria, at which point the patient was transitioned to the maintenance group within the study .

【26】_Maintenance therapy:_ Children ≥2 years and Adolescents:

【27】Hemodialysis-dependent CKD: IV: 0.5 mg/kg/dose every 2 weeks for 12 weeks ; maximum dose: 100 mg/dose; may repeat if clinically indicated.

【59】Adverse Reactions (Significant): Considerations

【60】Hypersensitivity reactions

【61】Rates of infusion reactions associated with IV iron preparations vary across studies ; higher rates of infusion reactions with iron sucrose compared to other formulations . Immediate **hypersensitivity reactions** to IV iron preparations, including iron sucrose, range in severity from mild self-limited reactions (eg, **pruritus** , urticaria, asymptomatic **hypotension** ) to severe **anaphylaxis** and **anaphylactic shock** . Transient flushing and truncal myalgias, known as Fishbane reactions, occur in ~30% of all infusion reactions, quickly resolve after discontinuing the infusion, and do not recur when the infusion is restarted at a slower rate . Delayed hypersensitivity reactions, most often exanthematous cutaneous reactions, have also been reported . There is a lack of cross-reactivity between iron sucrose and iron dextran .

【62】_Mechanism_ : Non–dose-related; may be immunologic or nonimmunologic (more common) . Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis): mechanism unknown . Nonimmunologic reactions (eg, Fishbane reactions) may be due to activation of complement, referred to as complement activation-related pseudo-allergy (CARPA) . Delayed hypersensitivity reactions are commonly T-cell mediated .

【63】_Onset_ : Rapid; occur most frequently within the first 10 minutes of the infusion but may occur more than 30 minutes after completion of the infusion .

【64】_Risk factors_ :

【65】• Higher dose and faster infusion rates 

【66】• Previous reaction to IV iron 

【67】Infection

【68】IV iron, including iron sucrose, may be associated with an increased risk of infection .

【69】_Mechanism_ : Non–dose-related; IV iron can increase levels of non–transferrin-bound iron, which can lead to impaired T-cell and neutrophil function .

【70】_Onset_ : Varied; can occur after single- or multiple-dose administrations .

【71】_Risk factors_ :

【72】• Patients with inflammatory bowel disease 

【73】Iron overload

【74】Excessive iron therapy may lead to iron overload (with the possibility of iatrogenic hemosiderosis) in patients with kidney failure .

【75】_Mechanism_ : Dose-related; occurs when administered iron exceeds the carrying capacity of transferrin, leading to the release of labile, non–transferrin-bound iron .

【76】_Onset_ : Delayed; following chronic exposure .

【77】_Risk factors:_

【78】_•_ High IV iron doses 

【79】Adverse Reactions

【200】Pregnancy Considerations

【201】Iron transfer to the fetus is regulated by the placenta (BSH \[Pavord 2020\]; NAS 2020).

【202】There is a risk of adverse maternal reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, hypotension, shock) following use of parenteral iron that may result in fetal bradycardia, especially during the second and third trimesters. Although the risk is rare, immediate treatment for anaphylactoid and/or hypersensitivity reactions should be available (BSH \[Pavord 2020\]).

【203】Maternal iron requirements increase during pregnancy. Untreated iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in pregnant patients are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight, preterm birth, and increased perinatal mortality . Maternal iron deficiency is also associated with fatigue, increased risk of postpartum depression, and possibly postpartum hemorrhage (BSH \[Pavord 2020\]).

【204】Oral and parenteral iron are effective at replacing iron stores in pregnant patients (ACOG 2021), Most studies note iron therapy improves maternal hematologic parameters; however, data related to clinical outcomes in the mother and neonate are limited . Parenteral iron therapy may be used in pregnant patients who cannot tolerate or respond to oral iron, when iron deficiency occurs later in pregnancy, or when malabsorption is present .

【205】Iron sucrose has been evaluated in multiple studies for the treatment of IDA during pregnancy . However, due to limited safety data in early pregnancy, use of IV iron is generally not started until the second or third trimester .

【206】Monitoring Parameters

【207】Signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions (during and ≥30 minutes following infusion); hypotension (during and following infusion). In patients at risk of iron overload, monitor hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation. If assessing iron status, measurements should be performed ≥48 hours after last dose (due to rapid increase in values following administration).

【208】_Chronic kidney disease_ : Hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum ferritin, serum iron, transferrin, percent transferrin saturation (TSAT), total iron-binding capacity.

【209】Evaluate iron status (TSAT and ferritin) when deciding to start or continue iron therapy, and at least every 3 months in patients also receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy. Monitor ferritin and TSAT more frequently when monitoring response to IV iron therapy, when initiating or increasing ESA dose, when there is blood loss, and in any other situations where iron stores may become depleted (KDIGO 2012).

【210】_Inflammatory bowel disease_ : Monitor CBC, ferritin, TSAT, and C-reactive protein every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for the following 5 years (if disease inactive) (Goyal 2020).

【211】Serum iron (AAP \[Kleinman 2019\]):

【212】≤6 weeks: 100 to 250 mcg/dL (SI: 17.9 to 44.8 micromole/L).

【213】7 weeks to 11 months: 40 to 100 mcg/dL (SI: 7.2 to 17.9 micromole/L).

【214】1 to 10 years: 50 to 120 mcg/dL (SI: 9 to 21.5 micromole/L).

【215】≥11 years:

【216】Female: 30 to 160 mcg/dL (SI: 5.4 to 28.6 micromole/L).

【217】Male: 50 to 170 mcg/dL (SI: 9 to 30.4 micromole/L).

【218】Total iron-binding capacity (AAP \[Kleinman 2019\]):

【219】≤2 months: 59 to 175 mcg/dL (SI: 10.6 to 31.3 micromole/L).

【220】3 months to 17 years: 250 to 400 mcg/dL (SI: 44.8 to 71.6 micromole/L).

【221】≥18 years: 240 to 450 mcg/dL (SI: 43 to 80.6 micromole/L).

【222】Mechanism of Action

【223】Iron sucrose is dissociated by the reticuloendothelial system into iron and sucrose. The released iron increases serum iron concentrations and is incorporated into hemoglobin.

【224】Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)

【225】Onset of action: Hematologic response to either oral or parenteral iron salts is essentially the same; red blood cell form and color changes within 3 to 10 days

【226】Maximum effect: Peak reticulocytosis occurs in 5 to 10 days, and hemoglobin values increase within 2 to 4 weeks

【227】Distribution: V dss : Healthy adults: 7.9 L

【228】Metabolism: Dissociated into iron and sucrose by the reticuloendothelial system

【229】Half-life elimination: Healthy adults: 6 hours; Non-dialysis-dependent adolescents: 8 hours

【230】Excretion: Healthy adults: Urine  within 24 hours
