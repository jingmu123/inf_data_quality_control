【0】Patient education: Animal and human bites (The Basics)
Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this page.

【1】What should I do if I get bitten by an animal or a person? 

【2】Wash the wound with lots of soap and water, even if it stings. This can help prevent infection. If you are bleeding, press on the wound with a clean towel or bandage to slow or stop the bleeding. Keep the wound covered with a clean bandage as it heals.

【3】Should I see a doctor or nurse? 

【4】Call your doctor or nurse for advice or schedule a visit if:

【5】 You were bitten by a wild animal, such as a raccoon, skunk, woodchuck, fox, coyote, or bat. These animals can carry rabies. It is very important that you talk to a doctor or nurse right away. They can tell you if you need to get shots to prevent rabies.

【6】 You were bitten by a dog, cat, or a person and it broke the skin. (Cat bites often lead to infection. Experts usually recommend antibiotics for anyone bitten by a cat.)

【7】 You were bitten on the hand, foot, or genitals. Also, see a doctor or nurse for a bite anywhere on your body if the wound is deep or large.

【8】 You were bitten by any animal **and** you:

【9】• Have diabetes, liver disease, cancer, HIV/AIDS, or an alcohol use disorder

【10】• Have had your spleen removed

【11】• Take medicine that could affect your ability to fight infection

【12】 You are bleeding, and it won't stop even after applying pressure for 15 minutes.

【13】 You think that you might have a broken bone or another serious injury.

【14】 You were bitten on a joint, and you can't bend the joint as easily as before.

【15】 You were bitten near a prosthetic joint or blood vessel graft, or in an area that has had a skin infection or circulation problem.

【16】 It has been more than 5 years since you last had a tetanus shot, or you don't remember when your last tetanus shot was. Most people have had this vaccine at least once. It helps prevent infections that can be caused by bites.

【17】You should also see a doctor or nurse if you develop signs of infection, which include:

【18】 Pain, especially if you push on the area, that gets worse

【19】 Redness, warmth, or swelling that gets worse or spreads

【20】 Fever

【21】 Oozing pus (thick, yellow fluid) from the wound

【22】How are animal bites treated? 

【23】If you get treated for a bite, your doctor or nurse will first clean your wound. Depending on how big the wound is and where it is, they might also give you stitches. You might also get antibiotics to prevent infection, but they are not always needed.

【24】At home, you might need to change your bandages. Your doctor or nurse will give you instructions on exactly how to do this. In general, wash your hands before and after touching the wound.

【25】Some people who are bitten need a "booster shot" of the tetanus vaccine. The tetanus booster is especially important for people who got their last booster more than 5 years ago.

【26】Should I worry about rabies? 

【27】If you were bitten by an animal that could be infected with rabies, you should get a series of shots to prevent rabies. You could be at risk for rabies if you were bitten by a:

【28】 Dog, cat, or ferret that you don't know or that was acting strangely

【29】 Wild animal, such as a raccoon, fox, skunk, woodchuck, coyote, or bat. (Bats are especially likely to carry rabies. But bat bites are also hard to see.)

【30】If you were bitten by a farm animal or large rodent, call your doctor or nurse for advice. They can talk to you about the risk of rabies and what to do next.

【31】Do not worry about rabies if you were bitten by a lizard, fish, or other animal that does not have fur. Animals without fur (besides humans) cannot carry rabies.

【32】How can I prevent animal bites? 

【33】To reduce your chances of being bitten by an animal:

【34】 Do not touch or approach unknown animals – This includes wild animals and other people's pets. Always ask if it is OK to touch someone else's pet.

【35】 Keep your fingers out of cages in places like zoos and pet stores.

【36】 Never step between animals that are growling, hissing, or fighting.

【37】 Do not bother animals, especially when they are sleeping, eating, or caring for their young.

【38】It's also important to remind children to be careful around animals.
