【0】Patient education: Gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying) (The Basics)
Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this page.

【1】What is gastroparesis? 

【2】This is a condition that causes nausea and vomiting. It can also make you feel full too soon after you start eating. It happens because the stomach takes too long to empty and does not move food along through your body fast enough . Gastroparesis is also called "delayed gastric emptying." ("Gastric" means related to the stomach.)

【3】Gastroparesis can happen in people who:

【4】 Have diabetes

【5】 Had food poisoning (gastroenteritis)

【6】 Had surgery

【7】 Take certain medicines

【8】But it can also happen for no clear reason.

【9】When gastroparesis starts after someone had food poisoning, it often gets better in a few days to weeks. Sometimes, it lasts longer or never goes away. In people with diabetes, it usually does not go away, but there are things that can make it better.

【10】What are the symptoms of gastroparesis? 

【11】The symptoms can include:

【12】 Nausea with or without vomiting

【13】 Belly pain

【14】 Feeling full too soon after you start eating

【15】 Bloating (feeling as though your stomach is full of air)

【16】 Weight loss

【17】Is there a test for gastroparesis? 

【18】. If your doctor or nurse suspects that you have gastroparesis, they might do 1 or more of these tests:

【19】 **Upper endoscopy** – The doctor or nurse puts a thin tube down your throat and into your stomach. The tube has a light and a tiny camera on the end, so the doctor or nurse can see inside your stomach. If they still find food in your stomach even though it has been more than 8 hours since you ate, it's a sign that you might have gastroparesis.

【20】 Barium **follow-through, CT scan, or MRI** – You eat a special substance that shows up on imaging (imaging tests create pictures of the inside of your body). This can show if there is something blocking the flow of food, keeping it from leaving your stomach.

【21】 **Gastric emptying scintigraphy** – You eat food that has a small amount of radioactive material in it. Then, you have images taken of the inside of your body for up to 4 hours. That way, doctors can follow where the food goes and how fast it gets there. If you still have a certain amount of food in your stomach after 4 hours, you have gastroparesis.

【22】 **Breath test** – This measures substances in your breath after you eat a special meal. It can sometimes show if you have gastroparesis.

【23】Should I change my diet to feel better? 

【24】. You might feel better if you:

【25】 Eat 4 to 5 small meals during the day, instead of 2 or 3 big ones.

【26】 Put food in the blender before eating it.

【27】 Cut down on foods that have a lot of fat, such as cheese and fried foods.

【28】 Cut down on foods that have a lot of "insoluble" fiber, such as some fruits, vegetables, and beans.

【29】 Avoid fizzy drinks, like soda. They can cause more bloating and gas.

【30】 Avoid alcohol and smoking.

【31】If you have diabetes, it's also very important to keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible.

【32】How is gastroparesis treated? 

【33】Treatments can include:

【34】 Treatments to help you get the food and fluids you need – This might include taking liquid food supplements or (in rare cases) being fed through a tube.

【35】 Medicines that make the stomach empty faster

【36】 Medicines that help prevent nausea

【37】 Emptying the stomach with a tube – Your doctor might recommend this if your symptoms are severe. They will put a tube down your throat or directly into your stomach through your skin.

【38】 Electrical stimulation of the stomach – In very rare cases and for certain causes of gastroparesis, doctors use electrical stimulation to make the stomach empty.

【39】When should I call the doctor? 

【40】Call your doctor or nurse if you have:

【41】 Nausea, vomiting, or belly pain that does not get better

【42】 Trouble eating

【43】 Weight loss
