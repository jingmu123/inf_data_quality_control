There are two phases of disease: a catarrhal (prodromal) stage and an exanthem stage. The catarrhal stage is characterized by a fever with conjunctivitis, coryza, cough, and pathognomonic Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa. The sudden development of a high fever, malaise, and exanthem represents the next phase. The exanthem stage is typically characterized by an erythematous maculopapular rash that originates behind the ears and spreads to the rest of the body towards the feet. Infection is usually self-limiting and followed by lifelong immunity. Disease management includes vitamin A supplementation, symptomatic treatment, and possible post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Measles causes transient immunosuppression and may lead to serious complications such as encephalitis, otitis, or pneumonia. A rare but lethal late complication of measles is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which may also affect immunocompetent individuals. The prognosis is good in uncomplicated cases. However, newborns and immunocompromised patients are more likely to suffer from severe complications.  \nThe measles vaccine is a combination vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR vaccine); the MMRV vaccine also protects against varicella. Immunization is recommended for all children, in addition to adults without evidence of immunity to measles, mumps, and/or rubella.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "amboss_articles", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:26:57", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:27:23", "cost": 25.594}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 18:41:27", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:27:23", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:26:57"}

Even small quantities of venom (e.g., from a bee sting) may cause life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions in susceptible individuals.

Oligodendrocytes myelinate neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), while Schwann cells myelinate neurons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Myelin sheaths increase the conduction velocity of signals across axons. Inflammation and loss of the myelin sheath are the underlying pathologic processes in multiple sclerosis (CNS) and Guillain barre syndrome (PNS). Neurons are composed of dendrites, cell bodies, axons, and axon terminals. Based on their conduction velocity, diameter, and myelination, nerve fibers (axons) are classified into large, myelinated fibers with fast conduction velocity (group A); small, myelinated fibers with slow conduction velocity (group B); and small, unmyelinated fibers with slow conduction velocity (group C). Neurons communicate through the transmission of action potentials across junctions between them called synapses. Synaptic transmission can be chemical or electrical. Chemical synaptic transmission is the transfer of signals through the release of neurotransmitters (e.g. acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine) from presynaptic terminals to postsynaptic receptors. Electrical synaptic transmission is the transfer of electrical signals through gap junctions. Alterations in neurotransmitter levels have been observed in various neurological diseases, including Parkinson disease (decreased dopamine), schizophrenia (increased dopamine), depression (decreased dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin), and Alzheimer disease (decreased acetylcholine).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "amboss_articles", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 15:00:02", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:02:13", "cost": 3731.153}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 18:41:26", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:02:14", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 23:00:02"}

The main risk factors for DVT are vascular endothelial damage (e.g., surgery or trauma), venous stasis (e.g., immobility), and hypercoagulability (e.g., thrombophilia), collectively referred to as the Virchow triad. Symptoms include edema, warmth, and dull pain of the affected extremity. Patients may also present with features of pulmonary embolism (PE), a severe complication of DVT. The Wells criteria for DVT are used to determine the pretest probability (PTP) of DVT. The initial test of choice for DVT is D-dimer in patients with a low PTP and venous ultrasound (US) in patients with moderate or high PTP. A negative D-dimer assay (i.e., levels < 500 ng/mL) allows DVT to be ruled out, while a positive D-dimer (levels ≥ 500 ng/mL) is nonspecific and requires a venous ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis. Noncompressibility of the affected vein is the most important sonographic feature of DVT. Primary treatment with long-term anticoagulation for 3–6 months is recommended in all patients with DVT, with the exception of isolated asymptomatic distal DVT, for which expectant management with serial ultrasound may be considered, as the risk of postthrombotic sequelae is low. Secondary prevention (i.e., anticoagulation extended indefinitely after completion of primary treatment) is also recommended for select patients, depending on the extent and etiology of the DVT and on the patient's bleeding risk. Catheter-directed thrombolysis or thrombectomy may be considered for limb-threatening ischemia, acute iliofemoral DVT, and patients with contraindications to anticoagulation. Primary prevention of VTE is recommended in patients at risk of DVT or PE (e.g., seriously ill medical patients, most surgical patients, and long-distance travelers with additional risk factors for VTE) and includes mechanical and pharmacological measures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "amboss_articles", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:05:35", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:06:18", "cost": 42.88}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 18:41:26", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:06:19", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:05:35"}

CP results from a non-progressive damage to the brain in utero or during infantile development up to the age of 3 years. Depending on the affected brain area, spastic, ataxic, or dyskinetic cerebral palsy develops. While, in many cases, there is no identifiable cause, risk factors for cerebral palsy are prematurity, perinatal complications such as chorioamnionitis, birth trauma with intracerebral hemorrhage, or postnatal infections such as meningitis. The diagnosis of CP is usually not made until features become apparent as children fail to meet certain milestones during the postneonatal period (e.g., inability to roll over or sit independently). Physical indicators of spastic cerebral palsy include spastic paresis of multiple limbs and joint contractures, scissors gait, and persistence of primitive reflexes. Patients with non-spastic cerebral palsy present with dysarthria and abnormal involuntary movements (choreoathetoid, dystonic, or ataxic) that worsen with stress. Seizure disorders and intellectual disability are associated with all types. Diagnosis is mainly based on the clinical picture but cranial ultrasound or MRI can help identify the causative lesion (e.g., hemorrhage, brain malformation). Since there is no cure, management follows a multidisciplinary approach with a focus on treating contractures (e.g., bracing, antispasmodics, physical therapy, surgery) and ensuring social participation (e.g., speech therapy, social support).

triggered by specific physiological circumstances, e.g., dynamic LVOT obstruction, such as in HOCM, causes syncope if oxygen demand is increased.\n    *   Cerebral perfusion is reduced during the delay between the onset of an inciting event (MI, PE, hemorrhage) and the effect of compensatory physiological responses (e.g., sympathetic activation).\n*   Cardiac syncope is associated with

cardiac enzymes), and cardiac rhythm monitoring may confirm the diagnosis.\n*   Common therapeutic measures include:\n    *   Cardiac pacing\n    *   Antiarrhythmic drugs\n    *   AICD placement\n    *   Catheter ablation\n    *   Fluid resuscitation\n*   Definitive management depends on the specific underlying condition.\n*   Consult cardiology for prompt treatment of cardiac conditions.\n\n|

"【0】The term cardiac syncope is used in the 2017 AHA syncope guidelines to denote arrhythmogenic, myocardial, and vascular causes of syncope that are more often life-threatening. \\[1\\]\n\n【1】General principles\n------------------\n\n【2】*   In cardiac syncope, reduced cerebral perfusion results from insufficient cardiac output due to acute cardiac and/or circulatory failure.\n*   This can manifest as transient loss of consciousness for different reasons, for example:\n*   The underlying cause is paroxysmal and self-limiting, e.g., PSVT.\n*   The underlying cause is dynamic and is triggered by specific physiological circumstances, e.g., dynamic LVOT obstruction, such as in HOCM, causes syncope if oxygen demand is increased.\n*   Cerebral perfusion is reduced during the delay between the onset of an inciting event (MI, PE, hemorrhage) and the effect of compensatory physiological responses (e.g., sympathetic activation).\n*   Cardiac syncope is associated with one-year mortality rates of up to 33%.\n\n【3】Syncope may be the first manifestation of a life-threatening cardiac condition.\n\n【4】Management \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\\[12\\]\\[13\\]\n---------------------------------\n\n【5】*   Consider cardiac causes in patients who present with:\n*   A sudden fall without any prodrome\n*   A brief prodrome characterized by specific cardiovascular symptoms, e.g., palpitations, chest pain\n*   Place patients under continuous cardiac monitoring.\n*   Imaging (e.g., TTE, CTA), laboratory studies (e.g., cardiac enzymes), and cardiac rhythm monitoring may confirm the diagnosis.\n*   Common therapeutic measures include:\n*   Cardiac pacing\n*   Antiarrhythmic drugs\n*   AICD placement\n*   Catheter ablation\n*   Fluid resuscitation\n*   Definitive management depends on the specific underlying condition.\n*   Consult cardiology for prompt treatment of cardiac conditions.\n\n| Cardiac and vascular causes of syncope \\[1\\]\\[12\\] |\n| --- |\n| Conditions | Characteristic features

It is characterized by obstruction of the upper airways due to the collapse of the pharyngeal muscles during sleep, which causes multiple episodes of interrupted breathing (apnea and hypopnea events), leading to alveolar hypoventilation. Severe daytime sleepiness due to sleep disruption is a common symptom. Partners of affected individuals commonly describe observing restless sleep and irregular snoring, gasping, or choking episodes. The diagnosis is based on polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. Many patients develop hypertension secondary to OSA, the cardiovascular consequences of which can reduce life expectancy.
