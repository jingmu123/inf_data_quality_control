A pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal communication between the pulmonary artery and veins, and it leads to a high-pressure inflow of arterial blood into the venous system, causing venous congestion. The main symptom is dyspnea; other common symptoms include hemoptysis, platypnea and orthopnea, chest pain, and cyanosis.

Defective interactions may cause autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and autoimmune cytopenias.\n    *   In general, Fas mutations produce an increased number of circulating self-reacting lymphocytes due to defective clonal selection.\n*   The receptor\\-ligand complex activates initiator caspases such as caspase 8.\n*   Initiator caspase activates executioner caspases such as caspase 3.\n*   Immune cell activation: The release of perforin and granzyme B from cytotoxic T cells activates executioner caspases.\n\n【7】### Intrinsic pathway (mitochondrial pathway)\n\n【8】*   Involved in tissue remodeling (e.g. during embryogenesis)\n*   p53 is activated through DNA damage (e.g. hypoxia, chemical toxins, radiation) or the withdrawal of regulating factors from a proliferating cell population (e.g. IL-2 after completion of an immunologic reaction → apoptosis of effector cells).\n*   p53 causes an intracellular increase of proapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family (e.g. Bax, Bad, Bak).\n*   The Bcl-2 family is composed of numerous proteins that can have a proapoptotic (e.g. Bad, Bax, and Bak) or antiapoptotic (e.g. Bcl-2; , Bcl-xL) effect.\n*   Bcl-2 can prevent apoptosis by keeping the mitochondrial membrane intact, thereby preventing cytochrome c release.\n*   On the other hand, Bcl-2 overexpression (e.g. in follicular lymphoma) promotes tumorigenesis since it decreases caspase activation.\n*   Proapoptotic proteins increase the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane (e.g. via the formation of a membrane channel by the heterodimer Bax/Bad).\n*   Cytochrome c is released from the inner mitochondrial membrane and enters the cytosol.\n*   Cytochrome c binds to APAF-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor 1) in the cytosol, forming a wheel-like structure known as an apoptosome.\n*   The complex of cytochrome c and APAF-1 converts procaspase 9 into active caspase 9.\n*   Caspase 9 activates executioner caspases such as caspase 3.\n\n【9】Proteins of the Bcl-2 family can have opposite effects: Bad, Bax, and Bak have a proapoptotic effect, whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have an antiapoptotic effect.\n\n【10】Abnormal regulation of apoptosis\n--------------------------------\n\n【11】Tumor suppressor genes that regulate the cell cycle and cell death can mutate and allow cells to remain alive even if they have abnormal genes that can cause cancer.\n\n【12】*   Follicular lymphoma: Bcl-2 (regulator of apoptosis) on chromosome 18 is translocated to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 → overexpression of Bcl-2 → dysfunctional apoptosis of abnormal lymphocytes → tumorigenesis\n*   Burkitt lymphoma: translocation t(8;14) → c-myc (nuclear regulator protein) on chromosome 8 translocation to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 → overexpression of c-myc and Bcl-2 → lymphoma\n*   Cervical cancer: precipitated by infection with high-risk strains of HPV (e.g. HPV\\-16 and HPV\\-18)\n*   HPV encodes for protein E7 which binds to Rb → inability of Rb to bind to E2F and arrest the cell cycle → proliferation of abnormal cells → low-grade dysplasia → high-grade dysplasia → carcinoma in situ → invasive cervical carcinoma\n*   HPV encodes for protein E6 which binds to p53 → inactivation of p53 → inability of p53 to arrest the cell cycle and to activate DNA repair genes → proliferation of abnormal cells → low-grade dysplasia → high-grade dysplasia → carcinoma in situ → invasive cervical carcinoma\n*   Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome: an autosomal dominant disorder in which defective Fas-FasL interaction results in failure of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway\n*   Leads to proliferation of self-reactive, antigen\\-specific lymphocyte lineages\n*   Clinical manifestations include generalized adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and autoimmunity (typically Evans syndrome).", "index": 1342, "show": true, "start": 1342, "end": 1484, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/22 13:45:06", "endTime": "2024/08/22 13:46:40", "cost": 93.99}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-21 17:38:12", "update_time": "2024-08-21 21:46:41", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 21:45:07"}

The abdominal cavity is first accessed using a trocar or a Veress needle, most commonly in the midline (peri-umbilical region). The peritoneal cavity is then insufflated with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). A fiber-optic instrument (laparoscope) is inserted into the first trocar to visualize the abdominal cavity and to allow for other ports to be created under direct vision. Laparoscopy is often the preferred diagnostic procedure for most elective gastrointestinal and gynecological surgeries. It is contraindicated in patients with shock, cardiac/pulmonary failure, and in cases of dilated bowel loops/perforation peritonitis. There are several advantages of laparoscopy over laparotomy as the incisions used are much smaller (e.g. less postoperative pain, fewer respiratory complications). However, the surgery is technically more challenging and complications (e.g. hemorrhage, bowel injury) are difficult to control laparoscopically.

small meals that include a combination of complex carbohydrates and foods rich in protein and fat\n*   30–60 min of rest in the supine position after meals\n*   Beta blockers may be helpful to ease tachycardia arising from hypovolemia.\n\n【22】#### Late dumping\n\n【23】*   Pathophysiology: dysfunctional pyloric sphincter → rapid emptying of glucose-containing chyme into the small intestine → quick

They can have a substantial negative impact on fetal and neonatal health. The acronym TORCH stands for the causative pathogens of congenital infections: Toxoplasma gondii, others (including Treponema pallidum, Listeria, varicella zoster virus, and parvovirus B19), rubella virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV). TORCH infections can cause spontaneous abortion, premature birth, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). These infections can also cause abnormalities in the CNS, the skeletal and endocrine systems, and the complex organs (e.g. cardiac defects, vision and hearing loss). Prophylaxis is of great importance during pregnancy. Primary prevention includes vaccination for varicella and rubella (prior to pregnancy), hygiene measures (washing hands and avoiding certain foods), and screening for syphilis during pregnancy. Affected infants require regular follow-ups to monitor for hearing loss, ophthalmological abnormalities, and developmental delays.\n\n【1】Several other pathogens can also be vertically transmitted during pregnancy and have detrimental effects on the fetus and/or newborn.

It is caused by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome, which contains the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene encodes a hybrid tyrosine kinase with increased enzymatic activity that leads to unregulated proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells. These cells subsequently differentiate into mature myeloid cells, resulting in CML. CML has three distinct phases: the chronic phase (CP-CML), the accelerated phase (AP-CML), and the blast phase (BP-CML, also referred to as blast crisis. Patients with CP-CML may be asymptomatic or present with nonspecific symptoms (e.g. fever, weight loss, night sweats) and splenomegaly. AP-CML is characterized by complications secondary to the suppression of other hematologic cell lines (e.g. thrombocytopenia, anemia, recurrent infections), and the clinical picture of BP-CML is similar to that of acute leukemia. Important diagnostic features in BP-CML are severe leukocytosis (with leukocyte counts as high as 500,000/mm<sup>3</sup>), basophilia, and massive splenomegaly. The most effective treatment for CML is targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

The most common congenital anomaly is cryptorchidism, which involves the incomplete descent of the testicle into the scrotum. The testicle may be located within the abdominal cavity, inguinal canal, or at the external inguinal ring. Cryptorchidism is associated with an increased risk of infertility and/or testicular cancer; therefore, early diagnosis and initiation of medical or surgical treatment are essential. Retractile testes usually do not require surgical intervention. A varicocele is the abnormal dilation of the pampiniform vessels within the scrotum. Patients may complain of a dull, aching, and swollen scrotum (typically on the left). A “bag of worms” sensation may be palpable at the apex of the scrotum. Surgery is required in complicated cases (i.e. concurrent testicular atrophy or infertility), while conservative treatment may be considered in older patients. A hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac derived from the tunica vaginalis or remnant of the processus vaginalis (infantile hydrocele) which results in a painless swelling of the scrotum that occurs at birth or later in life.

In chronic effusion, the pericardium can stretch to a certain degree, accommodating slightly more fluid. In the acute setting, however, the added volume quickly exceeds the maximum capacity of the pericardial space. In both cases, the end result is often cardiac tamponade: compression of the heart that can lead to a life-threatening reduction in cardiac output. Pericardial effusion is initially asymptomatic, but cardiac tamponade has a distinct clinical presentation, including hypotension, tachycardia, jugular venous congestion, and pulsus paradoxus.

The cerebral hemispheres are drained by superficial cerebral veins (superior cerebral veins, middle cerebral veins, inferior cerebral veins) and deep cerebral veins (great cerebral vein, basal vein), which drain into the dural venous sinuses.

Up to 25% of American children experience some form of child maltreatment. Major risk factors include the following: less than four years of age, caregiver(s) with substance use disorders, and intimate partner violence in the household. The most common form of child maltreatment is neglect, followed by physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological maltreatment, and medical neglect. Common clinical presentations of child maltreatment include growth retardation and developmental delays secondary to neglect, trauma inconsistent with history or developmental stage secondary to physical abuse, STDs, pregnancy, and genitourinary complaints secondary to sexual abuse. When the differential diagnosis includes child maltreatment, the first diagnostic step is a thorough history and physical exam. Ophthalmologic exam and a skeletal survey should also be performed if appropriate. Management includes medical stabilization if necessary and immediately reporting any suspected child maltreatment to Child Protective Services (CPS).

In adults, the condition is commonly defined as a height of 5 ft 1 in (155 cm) or less in men and 4 ft 10 in (147 cm) or less in women. Nonpathological variant short stature can be classified into three types: familial short stature (inherited short stature), constitutional delay of growth and puberty (an inherited pattern of short stature during childhood that is followed by a growth spurt during puberty, typically resulting in normal adult height), and idiopathic short stature (short stature in the absence of any metabolic, endocrine, or other diagnosis). These types of short stature are most often normal variants of growth and rarely affect a child's development beyond longitudinal growth. The pathological causes of short stature are diverse and include psychosocial circumstances as well as a variety of genetic, endocrine, and metabolic disorders, which may affect a child's development in other ways than longitudinal growth. Further diagnostic testing is indicated if a child's growth is less than what might be expected given the average height of the parents. An x-ray of the left hand and wrist are made to determine bone age (skeletal age), based on which the adult size of the child can be predicted. Laboratory testing can help rule out any underlying condition.

It is twice as common in women than in men and its prevalence increases with age. Stress incontinence can be caused by a variety of conditions (e.g. pelvic floor weakness, intrinsic sphincter deficiency, etc.), the underlying mechanism of which is an increase in bladder pressure that exceeds sphincter resistance, which leads to expelling of urine. Individuals with the condition have predictable, small-volume urinary loss, typically during physical exertion, with no history of irritative symptoms of the bladder (urgency or frequency).

There are two phases of disease: a catarrhal (prodromal) stage and an exanthem stage. The catarrhal stage is characterized by a fever with conjunctivitis, coryza, cough, and pathognomonic Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa. The sudden development of a high fever, malaise, and exanthem represents the next phase. The exanthem stage is typically characterized by an erythematous maculopapular rash that originates behind the ears and spreads to the rest of the body towards the feet. Infection is usually self-limiting and followed by lifelong immunity. Disease management includes vitamin A supplementation, symptomatic treatment, and possible post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Measles causes transient immunosuppression and may lead to serious complications such as encephalitis, otitis, or pneumonia. A rare but lethal late complication of measles is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which may also affect immunocompetent individuals. The prognosis is good in uncomplicated cases. However, newborns and immunocompromised patients are more likely to suffer from severe complications.  \nThe measles vaccine is a combination vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR vaccine); the MMRV vaccine also protects against varicella.

Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, and a good epidemiological study depends on statistical methods being employed correctly. At the same time, flaws in study design can affect statistics and lead to incorrect conclusions. Descriptive statistics measure, describe, and summarize features of a collection of data/sample without making inferences that go beyond the scope of that collection/sample. Common measures of descriptive statistics are those of central tendency and dispersion. Measures of central tendency describe the central distribution of data and include the mode, median, and mean. Measures of dispersion describe how data is distributed and include range, quartiles, variance, and deviation. The counterpart of descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, relies on data to make inferences that do go beyond the scope of the data collected and the sample from which it was obtained. Inferential statistics involves parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.\n\n【1】The values used to describe features of a sample or data set are called variables. Variables can be independent, in the sense that they are not dependent on other variables and can thus be manipulated by the researcher for the purpose of a study (e.g. administration of a certain drug), or dependent, in the sense that their value depends on another variable and, thus, cannot be manipulated by the researcher (e.g. a condition caused by a certain drug). Variables can furthermore be categorized qualitatively in categorical terms (e.g. eye color, sex, race) and quantitatively in numerical terms (e.g. age, weight, temperature).\n\n【2】Statistical analysis is used in all types of epidemiological studies, including the evaluation of diagnostic tests before approval for clinical practice. These rely on inferential statistics to draw conclusions from sample groups that can be applied to the general population.\n\n【3】删除6:<u>See also “Epidemiology,” “Interpreting medical evidence,” and “Population health.”</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "amboss_articles", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 11:59:31", "endTime": "2024/08/22 11:59:47", "cost": 16.203}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-21 17:38:07", "update_time": "2024-08-21 19:59:46", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 19:59:30"}

The disease presentation consists of four distinct, successive clinical stages (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary) if left untreated. Primary syphilis manifests with a painless chancre (primary lesion), typically on the genitals. Secondary syphilis is characterized by a polymorphic, maculopapular rash that appears on the palms and soles. The first two stages are followed by an asymptomatic phase (latent syphilis), which may last indefinitely or progress to tertiary syphilis. During the tertiary stage, characteristic granulomas (gumma) may appear, which can cause irreversible organ damage, particularly in the cardiovascular system (e.g. syphilitic aortic aneurysm). Neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, and otosyphilis are serious manifestations that can occur at any stage of infection. Treponemal or nontreponemal serological studies are used for screening, and the diagnosis is typically made based on clinical assessment and the interpretation of syphilis serologies. Alternatively, the diagnosis can be made using studies that directly detect T. pallidum (e.g. darkfield microscopy, PCR) if a specimen of infected tissue is obtainable.

Anatomically, the outer portion of the eye is divided into three layers: the fibrous tunic (cornea and sclera), the vascular tunic (choroid, iris, and ciliary body), and the nervous tunic (retina). The eye is further divided into an anterior segment, which contains the lens and structures anterior to it, and a posterior segment, which contains the vitreous humor and the retina. The lens is suspended between the pupil and the vitreous body by ligaments attached to the ciliary body. The anterior eye is subdivided further into two chambers: the posterior chamber (between lens and iris) and the anterior chamber (between iris and cornea), both of which are filled with aqueous humor. Functionally, the eye can be divided into structures that perceive light (components of the visual pathway) and structures that refract light (refractive media). The visual pathway begins with the first-order neurons of the retina, retinal rods and cones, which convert the optical image into neuronal signals, which are transmitted to the brain. The refractive media, comprising the cornea, lens, aqueous humor, and vitreous body, directs and refracts light to the posterior region of the retina. The eye receives its arterial supply from branches of the ophthalmic artery and drains into the ophthalmic vein. Cranial nerves mediate vision (CN II) and eye movement (CN III, IV, VI), while accommodation is mediated by fibers of the autonomic nervous system. The eyeball lies within the bony orbit, which has several openings for the passage of neurovascular structures. Accessory visual structures include the lacrimal gland and the eyelid. The lacrimal gland secretes tear fluid, which reduces friction and cleans the eye, while the eyelid protects the eyeball from excessive light, dryness, and foreign bodies. The development of the eye and accessory visual structures occurs between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> week of embryonic development. Extraocular muscles connect the eyeball to the orbit and control movement of the eyelid as well as the eye.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "amboss_articles", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 11:17:15", "endTime": "2024/08/22 11:17:29", "cost": 14.17}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-21 17:38:06", "update_time": "2024-08-21 19:17:28", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 19:17:14"}

Multimodal treatment initiated in the early stages of the condition can result in remission and consists of physical and medical therapy (e.g. NSAIDs, anticonvulsants, low-dose tricyclic antidepressants).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "amboss_articles", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 11:14:52", "endTime": "2024/08/22 11:15:18", "cost": 25.778}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-21 17:38:06", "update_time": "2024-08-21 19:15:18", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 19:14:52"}
