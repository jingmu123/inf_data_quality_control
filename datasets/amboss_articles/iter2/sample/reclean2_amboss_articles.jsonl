It mainly affects weight-bearing joints and joints that are heavily used, such as the hip, knee, hands, and vertebrae. Despite the widespread view that osteoarthritis is a condition caused exclusively by degenerative “wear and tear” of the joints, newer research indicates that there are various causes, including preexisting joint abnormalities, genetics, local inflammation, mechanical forces, and biochemical processes that are promoted by proinflammatory mediators and proteases. Major risk factors for osteoarthritis include advanced age, obesity, previous injuries, and asymmetrically stressed joints. In early-stage osteoarthritis, patients typically report a reduced range of motion, joint stiffness, and pain that is aggravated with heavy use. As the disease advances, persistent pain may also be present during the night and/or at rest. The diagnosis is predominantly based on clinical features and supported by radiological findings, as classic radiographic features of osteoarthritis do not always correlate with the patient's clinical symptoms or appearance.

Typical clinical features include recurrent attacks of symptomatic hypoglycemia in individuals without diabetes.

Other strains are sexually transmitted (especially in young adults) and can be further divided into low-risk and high-risk HPV types.

Infection with oncogenic high-risk HPV types (especially HPV\\-16 and HPV\\-18) may lead to malignant disease.

Most HPV infections are asymptomatic and self-limiting, although pruritus, tenderness, and bleeding may occur.

It is a common disorder, affecting ∼ 40% of the male population by the age of 50 years. Although the underlying etiology of BPH has not been conclusively established, sex hormones likely play a key role. BPH typically manifests as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), which includes features of bladder irritation (urinary frequency, urgency, urge incontinence), features of bladder outlet obstruction (urinary hesitancy, straining to urinate, sensation of incomplete voiding), and hematuria. The initial workup comprises standardized questionnaires to assess symptom severity, physical examination including digital rectal examination (DRE), urinalysis, a voiding diary, and, in select patients, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) analysis. DRE may reveal a smooth, enlarged, nontender, and firm prostate. Imaging and urodynamic studies are indicated in patients with features of complicated LUTS and to guide management. Behavioral modifications (e.g. fluid restriction at night, bladder training) are advised in all patients with LUTS caused by BPH and may be the only management required in patients with minimal symptoms. Pharmacotherapy, such as alpha blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs), and parasympatholytics, for BPH is indicated in patients with bothersome symptoms; the choice of agent depends on the size of the prostate and the predominant symptoms. Surgery, e.g. transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), is indicated in patients with severely symptomatic BPH, those with complications due to BPH (e.g. urinary retention, recurrent UTIs, hydroureteronephrosis), and those who experience intolerable adverse effects with pharmacotherapy. In patients with BPH, the risk of developing prostate cancer is not higher than that of the general male population; therefore, standard PSA screening protocol can be followed. TURP does not reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer and, following the procedure, BPH recurs in ∼ 7% of men.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "amboss_articles", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/23 16:06:25", "endTime": "2024/08/23 16:06:33", "cost": 7.788}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-22 00:02:48", "update_time": "2024-08-23 00:06:33", "grab_time": "2024-08-23 00:06:25"}

With appropriate treatment that lowers IOP (e.g. topical prostaglandins), progression can be stopped before severe damage occurs. Acute angle-closure glaucoma, on the other hand, is characterized by the sudden onset of a painful, red, and hard eye in combination with frontal headache, blurry vision, and halos appearing around lights.

Transmission most commonly occurs via exposure to respiratory fluids. The incubation period varies between 2–14 days and may be shorter with newer variants. Common presenting symptoms include fatigue, fever, and symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection; affected individuals may also be asymptomatic. Clinical courses range from asymptomatic infection, to mild with minimal symptoms, to severe with pneumonia and life-threatening complications (e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, organ dysfunction). Diagnostic confirmation is made based on COVID-19 testing, which includes nucleic acid amplification testing (e.g. PCR) or antigen testing on a respiratory specimen. Imaging findings are nonspecific, resemble those in other viral respiratory tract infections, and should not be used to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. Individuals with mild COVID-19 can typically be managed with supportive care at home. Pharmacotherapy can be considered for outpatients with risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19. Patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 or those with risk factors for severe disease may require hospitalization for oxygen therapy, pharmacotherapy, and antithrombotic therapy. The risk of infection can be reduced through preventive efforts, which include vaccination, public health measures (e.g. social distancing, mask-wearing), and getting tested after close contact with infected individuals.\n\n【1】We at AMBOSS are doing our best to accurately update our COVID-19 content.

(MGUS)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】### Definition\n\n【6】Characterized by complete or incomplete monoclonal immunoglobulins (of any class) detectable in patient serum without accompanying clinical symptoms\n\n【7】### Epidemiology\n\n【8】*   Prevalence: ∼ 3% in general population ≥ 50 years of age\n*   The most common type of plasma cell dyscrasia (PCD)\n\n【9】### Classification\n\n【10】*   Non-IgM MGUS (IgG, IgA, IgD MGUS): most common form of MGUS (∼ 55% of cases)\n*   IgM MGUS: ∼ 15% of cases\n*   Light-chain MGUS (LC-MGUS)\n\n【11】### Risk stratification\n\n【12】Patients can be stratified into the following categories according to their risk of progression to multiple myeloma or related malignancy.\n\n【13】*   Low-risk MGUS includes all of the following:\n    *   Nonimmunoglobulin G-type M protein\n    *   M-protein concentration < 1.5 g/dL\n    *   Normal SFLC ratio\n*   Moderate to high-risk MGUS: any feature not considered low-risk\n\n【14】### Diagnostics\n\n【15】*   General considerations\n    *   Usually diagnosed as an incidental finding\n    *   Universal screening is not routinely recommended.\n    *   Diagnostic criteria may help establish a diagnosis;\n*   Initial studies\n    *   CBC, serum creatinine, and calcium\n    *   SPEP and UPEP with immunofixation\n    *   Quantitative immunoglobulin assessment\n    *   SFLC assay\n*   Additional studies: usually reserved for patients with moderate to high risk of progression to malignancy or if there is evidence of transformation to another plasma cell dyscrasia (i.e. M-protein concentration ≥ 3 g/dL, findings of a severe PCD)\n    *   Bone marrow biopsy\n    *   Skeletal imaging\n        *   WBLDCT (modality of choice)\n        *   A skeletal survey is indicated if CT is not available.\n        *   Whole-body MRI is indicated in patients with inconclusive CT results.\n\n【16】### Management\n\n【17】*   Management is usually expectant.\n*   Long-term follow up: Monitor for progression to lymphoplasmacytic malignancy.\n    *   Studies: CBC, serum calcium and creatinine, SPEP, and SFLC assays\n    *   Cadence: 6 months after diagnosis and then every 1–3 years.\n\n【18】Monitor patients with MGUS for progression to lymphoplasmacytic malignancy.\n\n【19】### Complications\n\n【20】*   Multiple myeloma\n    *   Transformation of MGUS into multiple myeloma occurs in approx. 1% of cases\n    *   Typically arises from non-IgM MGUS\n*   Light chain amyloidosis: can occur with all forms of MGUS\n*   Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia: only arises from IgM MGUS\n*   Increased risk of thrombosis (thromboprophylaxis is usually not required) and developing osteoporosis (bone densitometry should be performed at the time of diagnosis)\n*   Lymphoma\n\n【21】Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia\n------------------------------------\n\n【22】### Definition\n\n【23】A type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma associated with abnormal production of monoclonal IgM antibodies\n\n【24】### Epidemiology\n\n【25】Mostly occurs in older adults\n\n【26】### Clinical features\n\n【27】*   Peripheral neuropathy\n    *   Extremities are involved first with progressive, proximal, symmetrical spread\n    *   Presents with paresthesias and weakness (sensory and motor nerve involvement)\n*   Impaired platelet function → hemorrhagic diathesis with petechial bleeding\n*   Normochromic anemia\n*   Formation of cold agglutinins (IgM) with hyperviscosity syndrome\n    *   Raynaud phenomenon\n    *   Impaired acral blood flow\n    *   Cerebral venous thrombosis\n    *   Impaired vision (e.g. blurry vision)\n    *   Retinal hemorrhages, engorged retinal veins on fundoscopic exam\n    *   Impaired hearing\n    *   Headaches\n    *   Impaired renal and liver function\n*   Lymph node enlargement possible\n*   Constitutional symptoms (e.g. fatigue)\n\n【28】### Diagnostics\n\n【29】Diagnostic criteria may help establish a diagnosis;\n\n【30】*   Routine studies\n    *   CBC, CMP\n    *   Increased ESR, uric acid, LDH, and alkaline phosphatase\n    *   Serum β<sub>2</sub> microglobulin level\n*   Immunoglobulin studies\n    *   SPEP and UPEP with immunofixation\n    *   Quantitative serum immunoglobulin levels\n*   Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate: ≥ 10% abnormal plasma cells with Dutcher bodies (periodic acid-Schiff positive, cytoplasmic inclusions of IgM deposits that invaginate into the nucleus)\n*   Imaging studies: Consider a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.\n*   Additional studies for suspected hyperviscosity syndrome\n    *   Serum viscosity measurement\n    *   Ophthalmologic evaluation\n\n【31】Overproduction of monoclonal IgM suggests Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia rather than multiple myeloma.\n\n【32】### Treatment\n\n【33】Usually reserved for symptomatic patients\n\n【34】*   Targeted treatment: anti-CD20 antibodies (e.g. rituximab), Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. ibrutinib), purine nucleoside analogs (fludarabine and cladribine), alkylating agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide)\n*   Hyperviscosity syndrome: plasmapheresis\n\n【35】### Prognosis\n\n【36】Good, as it is a type of indolent lymphoma\n\n【37】POEMS syndrome\n--------------\n\n【38】*   Definition: a rare plasma cell disorder that causes chronic overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines\n*   Clinical features include:\n    *

It is caused by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome, which contains the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene encodes a hybrid tyrosine kinase with increased enzymatic activity that leads to unregulated proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells. These cells subsequently differentiate into mature myeloid cells, resulting in CML. CML has three distinct phases: the chronic phase (CP-CML), the accelerated phase (AP-CML), and the blast phase (BP-CML, also referred to as blast crisis. Patients with CP-CML may be asymptomatic or present with nonspecific symptoms (e.g. fever, weight loss, night sweats) and splenomegaly. AP-CML is characterized by complications secondary to the suppression of other hematologic cell lines (e.g. thrombocytopenia, anemia, recurrent infections), and the clinical picture of BP-CML is similar to that of acute leukemia. Important diagnostic features in BP-CML are severe leukocytosis (with leukocyte counts as high as 500,000/mm<sup>3</sup>), basophilia, and massive splenomegaly. The most effective treatment for CML is targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
