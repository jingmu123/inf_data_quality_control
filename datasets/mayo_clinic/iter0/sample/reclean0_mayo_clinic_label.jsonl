This might include small amounts of blood, also called spotting, between your periods. You might notice this on toilet tissue when you wipe. Or it could include a very heavy period. You know you have a very heavy period if blood is soaking through one or more tampons or pads every hour for more than four hours.\n\n【2】Vaginal bleeding from a period usually happens every 21 to 35 days. This is called the menstrual cycle. The blood comes from the lining of the uterus, which is shed through the vagina. When this happens, a new reproductive cycle has started.\n\n【3】Periods may last for just a few days or up to a week. Bleeding could be heavy or light. Menstrual cycles tend to be longer for teens and women nearing menopause. Also, menstrual flow might be heavier at those ages.\n\n【4】Unusual vaginal bleeding could be a symptom of an issue with your reproductive system. This is called a gynecological condition. Or it could be due to another medical problem or a medicine.\n\n【5】If you're in menopause and notice vaginal bleeding, see your doctor or other health care professional. It could be a cause for concern. Menopause is commonly defined as having no periods for about 12 months.\n\n【6】You might hear this type of vaginal bleeding also called abnormal vaginal bleeding. Possible causes of unusual vaginal bleeding include:\n\n【7】If you're pregnant, contact your health care team immediately if you notice vaginal bleeding.\n\n【8】To be safe, you should have any unusual vaginal bleeding checked by your doctor or other health care professional. They can tell you if there's cause for concern based on your age and whole health picture.\n\n【9】Be sure to seek care when there is unusual vaginal bleeding in these cases:\n\n【10】*   **Postmenopausal adults who don't take hormone therapy.** Hormone therapy is a treatment that helps with menopause symptoms such as hot flashes. Some bleeding may happen with these treatments. But if you notice any vaginal bleeding after menopause without hormone therapy, see a doctor.\n*   **Postmenopausal adults taking cyclic, also called sequential, hormone therapy.** Cyclic hormone therapy is when you take estrogen every day. And then, you add progestin for 10 to 12 days a month. Some withdrawal bleeding is expected with this kind of therapy. Withdrawal bleeding looks like a period. It happens for a few days of the month. But any other vaginal bleeding needs to be checked by a doctor.\n*   **Postmenopausal adults taking continuous hormone therapy.** Continuous hormone therapy is when you take a low dose of estrogen and progestin daily. Some light bleeding is expected with this therapy. But if the bleeding is heavy or goes on longer than six months, see your care team.\n*   **Children who don't have any other signs of puberty.** Signs of puberty include breast development and underarm or pubic hair growth.\n*   **Children younger than age 8.** Any vaginal bleeding in a child younger than 8 is concerning and should be checked by a doctor.\n\n【11】Unusual vaginal bleeding during the following stages is likely OK. But talk to your care team if you're concerned:\n\n【12】*   **Newborns.** Some vaginal bleeding may happen during a baby's first month of life. But bleeding that's heavy or lasts longer should be checked by a provider.\n*   **Teenage years.** Menstrual cycles can be hard to track when teens first get their periods. This can go on for a few years. Also, it's common for light spotting to happen in the days before a period.\n*   **Starting birth control pills.** Spotting might happen in the first few months.\n*   **Nearing menopause, also called perimenopause.** Periods might be heavy or hard to track during this time. Ask your care team about ways to lessen any symptoms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

First, they are more likely to undergo early menopause, due to chemotherapyinduced ovarian failure or oopherectomy. In addition, chemotherapy may have a direct adverse effect on bone minerai density (BMD), and osteoclastic activity may increase from the breast cancer itself. While estrogen therapy is considered standard for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, use of estrogen in women with a history of breast cancer is usually contraindicated. The approach to osteoporosis in women with breast cancer is also affected by the use of tamoxifen in many, as this drug appears to have opposite effects on BMD in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. We have reviewed therapeutic alternatives for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, focusing on patients with a history of breast cancer. Alendronate and raloxifene are currently approved in the United States for the prevention of osteoporosis; alendronate, raloxifene, and calcitonin are approved for treatment. Alendronate has the greatest positive effect on BMD and reduces the incidence of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. Raloxifene and calcitonin appear to reduce the incidence of vertebral fractures; their effects on the incidence of nonvertebral fractures are not yet proven. Although no published studies specifically address the use of these approved agents for osteoporosis in women with breast cancer, understanding their relative effects on BMD in postmenopausal women in general will facilitate therapy selection in this population. Postmenopausal women with a history of breast cancer should undergo bone mineral analysis. Normal results and absence of other risk factors ensure that calcium and vitamin D intake are adequate. If osteopenia or other risk factors are present, preventive therapy with alendronate or raloxifene should be considered. For osteoporosis, treatment with alendronate should be strongly considered. Raloxifene and calcitonin are alternatives when alendronate is contraindicated. Further studies are needed to evaluate the optimal timing of initial bone mineral analysis in premenopausal women after breast cancer diagnosis and to determine the value of preventive treatment in women scheduled to undergo chemotherapy.\n\n【1】AACE ( American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists ), BMD ( bone mineral density ), CI ( confidence interval ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), MORE ( Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation ), NSABP P-l ( National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-l Study ), WHO ( World Health Organization )\n\n【2】Although the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is a health concern for many, particular consideration is required for women who are breast cancer survivors. The risk for osteoporosis in these women may be increased due to the effects of cancer therapy and the cancer process itself. Because estrogen therapy, a standard treatment for osteoporosis, is generally contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer, other treatment options are necessary.\n\n【3】Osteoporosis is a state of decreased bone mass leading to skeletal fragility, resulting in an increased risk for fracture with minimal or no trauma. It is most common in white and Asian women and affects approximately 30% of postmenopausal white women in the United States.\n\n【4】\n\n【5】*   Melton III, LJ\n\n【6】Epidemiology of spinal osteoporosis.\n\n【7】_Spine._ 1997; 22 : 2S-11S\n\n【8】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (349)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【9】Osteopenia and osteoporosis are diagnosed by measuring bone mineral density (BMD).

Osteoporosis is defined as a T score of –2.5 or less, indicating a BMD that is at least 2.5 SDs less than the mean for young adults.\n\n【15】Osteoporosis leads to increased risk of fracture, particularly of the spine, hip, and forearm, causing pain and debilitation. Between 12% and 20% of patients sustaining a hip fracture die within 1 year, and of those surviving, less than 50% are able to live independently.\n\n【16】\n\n【17】*   AACE clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis\n\n【18】_Endocr Pract._ 1996; 2 : 157-171\n\n【19】*   Google Scholar\n\n【20】Each year, approximately 250,000 women in the United States suffer hip fractures, which result in health care costs of approximately $10 billion.\n\n【21】\n\n【22】*   Kessel B\n\n【23】Alternatives to estrogen for menopausal women.\n\n【24】_Proc Soc Exp Biol Med._ 1998; 217 : 38-44\n\n【25】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (41)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【26】Thus, prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are important health interventions.\n\n【27】Risk factors for the development of osteoporosis include age, family history of fracture, early menopause, low calcium intake, and physical inactivity ( Table 1 ). Decreased bone mass is the most important risk factor for fracture in patients with osteoporosis. Bone mass gradually declines with age in both men and women. However, women experience an accelerated rate of bone loss at the time of menopause. Up to 15% of total bone mass may be lost around the time of natural menopause and up to 20% within 18 months after surgical menopause.\n\n【28】\n\n【29】*   Lappe JM\n*   Tinley ST\n\n【30】Prevention of osteoporosis in women treated for hereditary breast and ovarian carcinoma: a need that is overlooked.\n\n【31】_Cancer._ 1998; 83 : 830-834\n\n【32】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (10)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【33】Table 1 Risk Factors for Osteoporosis\n\n| Personal history of fracture |\n| --- |\n| Fracture in a first-degree relative |\n| Tobacco or alcohol abuse |\n| Thin body habitus |\n| White race |\n| Estrogen deficiency |\n| Low calcium intake |\n| Drugs (glucocorticoids, phenytoin, heparin, warfarin) |\n| Physical inactivity |\n\n【35】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【36】Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, with an estimated 182,800 new cases predicted to be diagnosed in 2000 in the United States.\n\n【37】\n\n【38】*   Greenlce RT\n*   Murray T\n*   Bolden S\n*   Wingo PA\n\n【39】Cancer statistics, 2000.\n\n【40】_CA Cancer J Clin._ 2000; 50 : 7-33\n\n【41】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (3992)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【42】Progress in breast cancer detection and therapy has resulted in an increasing number of women who are long-term survivors of the disease.

Eighty-two women with recurrent breast cancer and 352 women with a first diagnosis of breast cancer (regardless of stage) were enrolled in separate studies of the effects of clodronate on incidence of skeletal metastases. None of the women had skeletal metastases at the time of enrollment. The age-adjusted prevalence of vertebral fracture was similar in the group at first diagnosis and the control population; in women with recurrent breast cancer it was 6–fold higher ( _P_ <.0001). However, compared with the general population, the annual incidence of vertebral fracture in women followed up from first breast cancer diagnosis was nearly 5 times greater ( _P_ <.0001), and in women with recurrent disease it was more than 20 times greater _(P<.0001)._ When women who developed skeletal metastases during the study period were excluded from analysis, the odds ratios for the annual incidence of vertebral fracture in women followed up from first breast cancer diagnosis and those with recurrent disease compared with the control population were 2.8 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.3–6.2) and 24.5 (95% CI, 10.755.9), respectively.

An additional 435 women were randomly assigned to one of these treatment groups or to open-label estrogen-progestin therapy (0.625/5 mg). The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD was 0.94 g/cm  , and although no T scores were given, less than 10% of women enrolled had a baseline lumbar spine BMD of less than 0.8 g/cm  . Follow up was for 2 years. Women taking 5 mg of alendronate (n=445) daily had a mean increase in BMD of the lumbar spine of 3.5% at 2 years ( _P<_ .00l), while women taking placebo (n=461) had a mean loss of 1.8%. Similarly, women in the 5–mg alendronate group had a mean increase in femoral neck BMD of 1.3% at 2 years ( _P<_ .00l) compared with a decrease of 1.6% ( _P<_ .00l) in the placebo group. The differences between groups were statistically significant at both sites ( _P_ <.001). Only 5% to 6% of women treated with alendronate lost more than 2% BMD compared with 40% to 46% of those receiving placebo. The women assigned to the estrogen group had an increase in BMD that was 1 or 2 percentage points greater than that seen for the group receiving 5 mg of alendronate. The authors concluded that alendronate is an effective alternative to estrogen for postmenopausal women in whom the primary goal is maintenance of bone mass.

All patients who received placebo lost bone mass at the lumbar spine and femoral neck (mean decreases in BMD, –5.9% and –2.0%, respectively) with the greatest loss in women who became amenorrheic (−9.5% at the lumbar spine and –4.6% at the femoral neck). There was significantly less bone loss in women treated with clodronate (–2.2% at the lumbar spine and _+0.9%_ at the femoral neck), and treated women who continued to have regular menses actually gained bone mass at both sites. The _P_ values for the differences between the changes in BMD of placebo and control groups at the lumbar spine and femoral neck were .0005 and .017, respectively.\n\n【282】Powles et al\n\n【283】\n\n【284】*   Powles TJ\n*   McCloskey E\n*   Paierson AH\n*   et al.\n\n【285】Oral clodronate and reduction in loss of bone mineral density in women with operable primary breast cancer.\n\n【286】_J Nad Cancer Inst._ 1998; 90 : 704-708\n\n【287】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (157)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【288】evaluated the effectiveness of clodronate on BMD as part of a larger study of its effect on the incidence of bone metastases in women with primary breast cancer.

Clodronate had a significant positive effect on the mean change in BMD at both the hip and the lumbar spine (differences between placebo and control groups of 1.72% at the lumbar spine and 1.85% at the total hip; _P_ \\=.04 and .008, respectively).\n\n【289】The results of these 2 studies indicate that preventive treatment for osteoporosis in premenopausal women un dergoing therapy for breast cancer may be beneficial.

Only these groups are considered here, as the FDA-approved dose of raloxifene is 60 mg. At baseline, the mean lumbar spine BMD was 0.94 g/cm  (T scores between –2.5 and +2).

The effect at the hip was comparable to that of alemdronate or estrogen, but the effect at the spine was less than that of either of these other drugs. Of importance, raloxifene appeared to increase BMD without stimulating endometrial proliferation.

The decision to use antiresorptive therapy for prevention should be individualized on the basis of age, overall health and functional status, assessment of risk factors, and T scores. For those on a basic prevention program, the AACE recommends bone mineral analysis every 1 to 2 years until bone mass is stable, after which follow-up measurements can be done every 2 to 3 years. For those on a therapeutic program with antiresorptive agents, their recommendation is for 3 consecutive annual measurements, followed by biannual testing if bone mass is stable.\n\n【458】\n\n【459】*   AACE clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis\n\n【460】_Endocr Pract._ 1996; 2 : 157-171\n\n【461】*   Google Scholar\n\n【462】Calcium and vitamin D are fundamental components of osteoporosis prevention and treatment but cannot be considered a substitute for antiresorptive therapy in women with significant osteoporosis or in osteopenic women at high risk for further bone loss or fracture.

Studies to evaluate the effect of raloxifene on breast cancer recurrence in women with a .history of the disease (with and without previous tamoxifen treatment) who are treated with this agent for osteoporosis need to be conducted.\n\n【478】For treatment of established osteoporosis, FDA-approved choices in this population include alendronate, raloxifene, and calcitonin. Based on the data reviewed, alendronate appears to be the best choice, unless it is contraindicated or not tolerated. The efficacy of combination treatments remains to be established.

Model discrimination in the internal validation cohort of veterans resulted in C statistics of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.70-0.72) and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.65-0.67) among patients with eGFR lower than 15 mL/min per 1.73 m  and 15 mL/min per 1.73 m  or higher, respectively. In the KPSC external validation cohort, the developed risk score exhibited C statistics of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.74-0.79) in men and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.71-0.76) in women with eGFR lower than 15 mL/min per 1.73 m  and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.67-0.74) in men and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.62-0.72) in women with eGFR of 15 mL/min per 1.73 m  or higher.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】A new risk prediction tool for mortality during the first year after transition to dialysis (available at www.DialysisScore.com ) was developed in the large national Veterans Affairs cohort and validated with good performance in the racially, ethnically, and gender diverse KPSC cohort. This risk prediction tool will help identify high-risk populations and guide management strategies at the transition to dialysis.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CMS ( Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ), eGFR ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ), ESRD ( end-stage renal disease ), ICD-9-CM ( International Classification of Diseases ), Ninth Revision ( Clinical Modification ), IQR ( interquartile range ), KPSC ( Kaiser Permanente Southern California ), PS ( prognostic score ), USRDS ( United States Renal Data System ), VA ( Veterans Affairs )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "2d33a550-b3ea-440f-a6e8-1a819eecf0cd", "title": "Asthma attack", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】During an asthma attack, also called an asthma exacerbation, the airways become swollen and inflamed. The muscles around the airways contract and the airways produce extra mucus, causing the breathing (bronchial) tubes to narrow.\n\n【2】During an attack, you may cough, wheeze and have trouble breathing. Symptoms of a minor asthma attack get better with prompt home treatment. A severe asthma attack that doesn't improve with home treatment can become a life-threatening emergency.\n\n【3】The key to stopping an asthma attack is recognizing and treating an asthma flare-up early. Follow the treatment plan you worked out with your doctor ahead of time. Your treatment plan should include what to do when your asthma starts getting worse, and how to deal with an asthma attack in progress.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Asthma attack signs and symptoms include:\n\n【6】*   Severe shortness of breath, chest tightness or pain, and coughing or wheezing\n*   Low peak expiratory flow (PEF) readings, if you use a peak flow meter\n*   Symptoms that fail to respond to use of a quick-acting (rescue) inhaler\n\n【7】Signs and symptoms of an asthma attack vary from person to person. Work with your doctor to identify your particular signs and symptoms of worsening asthma — and what to do when they occur.\n\n【8】If your asthma symptoms don't improve or get worse after you take medication as your doctor directed, you may need emergency treatment. Your doctor can help you learn to recognize an asthma emergency so that you'll know when to get help.\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】If your asthma flares up, immediately follow the treatment steps you and your doctor worked out in your written asthma plan. If your symptoms and peak expiratory flow (PEF) readings improve, home treatment may be all that's needed. If your symptoms don't improve with home treatment, you may need to seek emergency care.\n\n【11】When your asthma symptoms flare up, follow your written asthma plan's instructions for using your quick-acting (rescue) inhaler. PEF readings ranging from 51% to 79% of your personal best are a sign you need to use the quick-acting (rescue) medications prescribed by your doctor.\n\n【12】### Check asthma control steps with your doctor\n\n【13】Asthma can change over time, so you'll need periodic adjustments to your treatment plan to keep daily symptoms under control. If your asthma isn't well controlled, you're more likely to have an asthma attack. Lingering lung inflammation means your asthma could flare up at any time.\n\n【14】Go to all scheduled doctor's appointments. If you have regular asthma flare-ups, or if you have low peak flow readings or other signs your asthma isn't well controlled, make an appointment to see your doctor.\n\n【15】### When to seek emergency medical treatment\n\n【16】Seek medical attention right away if you have signs or symptoms of a serious asthma attack, which include:\n\n【17】*   Severe breathlessness or wheezing, especially at night or in the early morning\n*   The inability to speak more than short phrases due to shortness of breath\n*   Having to strain your chest muscles to breathe\n*   Low peak flow readings when you use a peak flow meter\n*   No improvement after using a quick-acting (rescue) inhaler\n\n【18】Causes\n------\n\n【19】An overly sensitive immune system makes your airways (bronchial tubes) become inflamed and swollen when you're exposed to certain triggers. Asthma triggers vary from person to person. Common asthma attack triggers include:\n\n【20】*   Pollen, pets, mold and dust mites\n*   Upper respiratory infections\n*   Tobacco smoke\n*   Inhaling cold, dry air\n*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n*   Stress\n\n【21】For many people, asthma symptoms get worse with respiratory infections, such as those caused by the common cold. Some people have asthma flare-ups caused by something in their work environment. Sometimes, there isn't an apparent cause for an asthma attack.\n\n【22】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【23】Anyone who has asthma is at risk of an asthma attack. You may be at increased risk of a serious asthma attack if:\n\n【24】*   You've had a severe asthma attack in the past\n*   You've previously been admitted to the hospital or had to go to the emergency room for asthma\n*   You've previously required intubation for an asthma attack\n*   You use more than two quick-acting (rescue) inhalers a month\n*   Your asthma attacks tend to sneak up on you before you notice symptoms have worsened\n*   You have other chronic health conditions, such as sinusitis or nasal polyps, or cardiovascular or chronic lung disease\n\n【25】Complications\n-------------\n\n【26】Asthma attacks can be serious. They can:\n\n【27】*   Interrupt everyday activities such as sleep, school, work and exercise, causing a significant impact on your quality of life — and can disrupt the lives of those around you.\n*   Send you to the emergency room, which can be stressful and costly.\n*   Lead to respiratory arrest and death.\n\n【28】Prevention\n----------\n\n【29】The best way to avoid an asthma attack is to make sure your asthma is well controlled in the first place. This means following a written asthma plan to track symptoms and adjust your medication.\n\n【30】While you may not be able to eliminate your risk of an asthma attack, you're less likely to have one if your current treatment keeps your asthma under control. Take your inhaled medications as prescribed in your written asthma plan.\n\n【31】These preventive medications treat the airway inflammation that causes asthma signs and symptoms. Taken on a daily basis, these medications can reduce or eliminate asthma flare-ups — and your need to use a quick-acting inhaler.\n\n【32】See your doctor if you're following your asthma action plan but still have frequent or bothersome symptoms or low peak flow readings. These are signs your asthma isn't well controlled, and you need to work with your doctor to change your treatment.\n\n【33】If your asthma symptoms flare up when you have a cold or the flu, take steps to avoid an asthma attack by watching your lung function and symptoms and adjusting your treatment as needed. Be sure to reduce exposure to your allergy triggers, and wear a face mask when exercising in cold weather.\n\n【34】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The fecal occult blood test can only detect the presence or absence of blood — it can't determine what's causing the bleeding.\n\n【5】A fecal occult blood test isn't recommended if you have colon cancer symptoms. If you notice blood in your stool or in the toilet or if you experience abdominal pain or a change in your bowel habits, make an appointment with your doctor.\n\n【6】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【7】The fecal occult blood test is one option for colon cancer screening. It may be an option if you have an average risk of colon cancer and don't have any symptoms. The fecal occult blood test is typically repeated yearly.\n\n【8】Risks\n-----\n\n【9】Risks and limitations of the fecal occult blood test include:\n\n【10】*   **The test isn't always accurate.** Your fecal occult blood test could show a negative test result when cancer is present (false-negative result) if your cancer or polyps don't bleed.\n    \n    Your test could show a positive result when you have no cancer (false-positive result) if you have bleeding from other sources, such as a stomach ulcer, hemorrhoid, or even blood swallowed from your mouth or your nose.\n    \n*   **Having a fecal occult blood test may lead to additional testing.** If your fecal occult blood test result is positive, your doctor may recommend a test to examine the inside of your colon, such as a colonoscopy.\n\n【11】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【12】Various foods, dietary supplements and medications can affect the results of some fecal occult blood tests — either indicating that blood is present when it isn't (false-positive) or missing the presence of blood that's actually there (false-negative). Your doctor may ask you to avoid certain foods or medicines. To ensure accurate test results, follow your doctor's instructions carefully.\n\n【13】For about three days before the test, your doctor may ask you to avoid:\n\n【14】*   Certain fruits and vegetables, including broccoli and turnips\n*   Red meat\n*   Vitamin C supplements\n*   Pain relievers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others)\n\n【15】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【16】There are several types of fecal occult blood tests, each with a different approach to collecting and testing stool. They include:\n\n【17】*   **Immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT, or FIT).** The collection method for this test may depend on the manufacturer, but typically, you use a special spoon or other device to collect a sample of stool and store it in a collection container that comes with the test kit.\n    \n    The collection container is then returned to your doctor or a designated lab, by mail or in person.\n    \n    Immunochemical testing is preferred over the guaiac fecal occult blood test because it's more sensitive. Also, it doesn't require any dietary restrictions before sample collection and testing can often be performed on a random stool sample.\n    \n*   **Guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT).** For this test, your doctor typically gives you test cards that are used to collect stool samples from multiple bowel movements.\n    \n    You collect a stool sample from each of two or three bowel movements in a clean container, usually taken on consecutive days, and then use an applicator stick to apply a smear of stool to a specific area of a card.\n    \n    After the samples are dry, you return them to your doctor or a designated lab, by mail or in person.\n    \n*   **Flushable reagent pad or tissue.** You can get this kit at a store without a prescription.\n    \n    You place the pad or tissue in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement, usually on three consecutive days. The pads change color when blood is present.\n    \n    You then report the changes to your doctor, usually on a mail-in form.\n    \n\n【18】For accurate results, follow the instructions and return the samples promptly.\n\n【19】Results\n-------\n\n【20】Your doctor will review the results of the fecal occult blood test and then share the results with you.\n\n【21】*   **Negative result**. A fecal occult blood test is considered negative if no blood is detected in your stool samples. If you have an average risk of colon cancer, your doctor may recommend repeating the test yearly.\n*   **Positive result.** A fecal occult blood test is considered positive if blood is detected in your stool samples. You may need additional testing — such as a colonoscopy — to locate the source of the bleeding.\n\n【22】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The TTP-HUS improved with standard therapy and resolved after tumor resection. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of carcinoma of the colon in a patient presenting with TTP-HUS.\n\n【19】**Report of a Case.** —A 66-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of intermittent fever, generalized headache, bloody diarrhea, progressive shortness of breath, and lower extremity edema. Physical examination findings were remarkable for fever, bilateral basilar crackles on auscultation of the lungs, and bilateral pitting pedal edema. Bilateral minimal pleural effusions and interstitial edema were seen on chest xray film, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal biventricular size and function with normal valve anatomy. The laboratory test results on admission suggested acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (blood urea nitrogen \\[BUN\\], 51 mg/dL; creatinine, 3.6 mg/dL; hemoglobin, 5.9 g/dL; hematocrit, 18.4%; platelet count, 46 × 10  /L; and lactate dehydrogenase \\[LDH\\], 630 U/L). Coombs test results were negative, the coagulation profile was normal, and the peripheral blood film showed numerous schistocytes. The patient was diagnosed as having TTP-HUS.\n\n【20】Further evaluation included serologic tests for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, all of which were negative. Stool cultures for _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_ species, and _Campylobacter_ species remained sterile. Antinuclear antibody levels were elevated, but levels of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (cytoplasmic and perinuclear), anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, and cryoglobulins were normal. A single irregular mass (3-cm diameter) was seen at 30 cm from the anus on flexible sigmoidoscopic examination. Biopsy of the mass revealed invasive, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon. Staging work-up showed no locoregional or distant metastases.\n\n【21】Oral prednisone (1 mg · kg  · d  ) and daily plasma exchange were initiated.

Left hemicolectomy with colorectal anastomosis was then performed. Pathologic examination of the resected tumor confirmed the diagnosis of invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon that was limited to the submucosa. The surgical margins were clear of disease, and no lymph node metastases were found. Platelet count and creatinine and LDH levels remained stable postoperatively. No adjuvant therapy was offered because the tumor was American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I (T1 N0 M0). Plasma exchange and prednisone were gradually tapered over the 6 weeks following surgery. The patient remains disease free 9 months after initial presentation with normal renal function and platelet count (BUN, 22 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.9 mg/dL; platelet count, 243 × 10  /L; and LDH, 163 U/L).\n\n【22】Cancer-associated TTP-HUS has been reported primarily as a manifestation of metastatic cancer or as a complication of cancer chemotherapy\n\n【23】\n\n【24】*   Elliott MA\n*   Nichols WL\n\n【25】Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n\n【26】_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2001; 76 : 1154-1162\n\n【27】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (81)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【28】; TTP-HUS as the initial presentation of cancer is extremely rare.

Health care providers might refer to this condition as an effusion (uh-FU-zhun) in your knee joint.\n\n【2】A swollen knee may be the result of trauma, overuse injuries, or an underlying disease or condition. To find the cause of the swelling, your provider might need to test a sample of the fluid for infection, disease or blood from an injury.\n\n【3】Removing some of the fluid may help reduce the pain and stiffness associated with the swelling. Once the underlying cause is known, treatment can begin.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms typically include:\n\n【6】*   **Swelling.** The skin around your kneecap can puff up noticeably, especially when you compare the affected knee to your other one.\n*   **Stiffness.** When your knee joint contains excess fluid, you might not be able to bend or straighten your leg completely.\n*   **Pain.** Depending on the cause of the fluid buildup, your knee might be very painful — to the point that it's impossible to bear weight on it.\n\n【7】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【8】See your health care provider if self-care measures, such as ice and rest, don't improve symptoms. Seek immediate medical attention if one knee becomes red and feels warm to the touch compared with your other knee. This can be a sign of infection within the joint.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Many types of problems, ranging from traumatic injuries to diseases and other conditions, can cause a swollen knee.\n\n【11】### Injuries\n\n【12】Damage to any part of your knee can cause excess joint fluid to accumulate. Injuries that can cause fluid buildup in and around the knee joint include:\n\n【13】*   Torn ligament, particularly the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)\n*   Cartilage (meniscus) tear\n*   Irritation from overuse\n*   Broken bones\n\n【14】### Diseases and conditions\n\n【15】Underlying diseases and conditions that can produce fluid buildup in and around the knee joint include:\n\n【16】*   Osteoarthritis\n*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Infection\n*   Gout\n*   Pseudogout\n*   Bursitis\n*   Cysts\n*   Tumors\n\n【17】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【18】Factors that may increase your risk of a swollen knee include:\n\n【19】*   **Age.** Your likelihood of developing a swollen knee related to arthritis increases as you age.\n*   **Sports.** People who participate in sports that involve twisting the knee, such as basketball, are more likely to experience the types of knee injuries that cause swelling.\n*   **Obesity.** Excess weight puts added stress on the knee joint, contributing to the tissue and joint overload and knee degeneration that can lead to a swollen knee.\n\n【20】Complications\n-------------\n\n【21】Complications of a swollen knee can include:\n\n【22】*   **Muscle loss.** Fluid in the knee can harm the working of your muscles and cause thigh muscles to weaken and atrophy.\n*   **Fluid-filled sac (Baker cyst).** The buildup of fluid in your knee can lead to the formation of a Baker cyst in the back of your knee. A swollen Baker cyst can be painful, but usually improves with icing and compression. If the swelling is severe, you might need to have fluid removed with a needle.\n\n【23】Prevention\n----------\n\n【24】A swollen knee is typically the result of an injury or chronic health condition. To manage your overall health and prevent injuries:\n\n【25】*   **Strengthen the muscles around your knee.** Strong muscles around a joint can help ease pressure on the joint itself.\n*   **Choose low-impact exercise.** Certain activities, such as water aerobics and swimming, don't place continuous weight-bearing stress on your knee joints.\n*   **Maintain a healthy weight.** Excess weight contributes to the wear-and-tear damage that can lead to a swollen knee.\n\n【26】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "2d06d1e8-c6a7-465b-9791-c0aad71206fc", "title": "Amnesia", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Amnesia refers to the loss of memories, including facts, information and experiences. Movies and television tend to depict amnesia as forgetting your identity, but that's not generally the case in real life.\n\n【2】Instead, people with amnesia — also called amnestic syndrome — usually know who they are. But they may have trouble learning new information and forming new memories.\n\n【3】Amnesia can be caused by damage to areas of the brain that are vital for memory processing. Unlike a temporary episode of memory loss, called transient global amnesia, amnesia can be permanent.\n\n【4】There's no specific treatment for amnesia, but treatment can be directed at the underlying cause. Tips to help enhance memory and get support can help people with amnesia and their families cope.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】The two main features of amnesia are:\n\n【7】*   Trouble learning new information.\n*   Trouble remembering past events and previously familiar information.\n\n【8】Most people with amnesia have problems with short-term memory, so they can't retain new information. Recent memories are most likely to be lost. More-remote or deeply ingrained memories may be spared.\n\n【9】For example, people may recall experiences from childhood or know the names of past presidents. But they may not be able to name the current president, know the month or remember what they ate for breakfast.\n\n【10】Isolated memory loss doesn't affect a person's intelligence, general knowledge, awareness or attention span. It also doesn't affect judgment, personality or identity. People with amnesia usually can understand written and spoken words and can learn skills such as bike riding or piano playing. They may understand they have a memory disorder.\n\n【11】Amnesia isn't the same as dementia. Dementia often includes memory loss but also involves other problems with thinking that lead to a decline in daily functioning. These problems include having trouble with language, judgment and visual-spatial skills.\n\n【12】Memory loss also is a common symptom of mild cognitive impairment. This disorder involves memory and other cognitive problems that aren't as severe as those experienced in dementia.\n\n【13】### Additional symptoms\n\n【14】Depending on the cause of the amnesia, other symptoms may include:\n\n【15】*   False memories that are either completely invented or are real memories misplaced in time.\n*   Confusion or disorientation.\n\n【16】### When to see a doctor\n\n【17】Anyone who experiences unexplained memory loss, head injury or confusion requires immediate medical attention.\n\n【18】People with amnesia may not know where they are or be able to seek medical care. If someone you know has symptoms of amnesia, help the person get medical attention.\n\n【19】Causes\n------\n\n【20】Typical memory function involves many parts of the brain. Any disease or injury that affects the brain can affect memory.\n\n【21】Amnesia can result from damage to brain structures that form the limbic system, which controls emotions and memories. They include the thalamus found deep within the center of the brain. They also include the hippocampal formations found within the temporal lobes of the brain.\n\n【22】Amnesia caused by brain injury or damage is known as neurological amnesia. Possible causes of neurological amnesia include:\n\n【23】*   Stroke.\n*   Brain inflammation, which may be due to an infection with a virus such as herpes simplex virus. Or inflammation may be a result of an autoimmune reaction to cancer somewhere in the body. It also may be due to an autoimmune reaction in the absence of cancer.\n*   Not enough oxygen in the brain. This may happen as a result of a heart attack, respiratory distress or carbon monoxide poisoning.\n*   Long-term alcohol misuse that leads to too little vitamin B-1, known as thiamin, in the body. When this happens, it's called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.\n*   Tumors in areas of the brain that control memory.\n*   Alzheimer's disease and other diseases that involve the degeneration of nerve tissue.\n*   Seizures.\n*   Certain medicines such as benzodiazepines or others that act as sedatives.\n\n【24】Head injuries that cause a concussion, whether from a car accident or sports, can lead to confusion and problems remembering new information. This is especially common in the early stages of recovery. Mild head injuries typically don't cause lasting amnesia, but more-severe head injuries may cause permanent amnesia.\n\n【25】Another rare type of amnesia, called dissociative amnesia, stems from emotional shock or trauma. It can result from being the victim of a violent crime or experiencing other trauma. In this disorder, people may lose personal memories and information about their lives. The memory loss is usually brief.\n\n【26】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【27】The chance of developing amnesia might increase if you've experienced:\n\n【28】*   Brain surgery, head injury or trauma.\n*   Stroke.\n*   Alcohol abuse.\n*   Seizures.\n\n【29】Complications\n-------------\n\n【30】Amnesia varies in severity and scope. But even mild amnesia takes a toll on daily activities and quality of life. The syndrome can cause problems at work, at school and in social settings.\n\n【31】It may not be possible to recover lost memories. Some people with severe memory problems need to be supervised or need to live in a care facility.\n\n【32】Prevention\n----------\n\n【33】Damage to the brain can be a root cause of amnesia. It's important to take steps to minimize your chance of a brain injury. For example:\n\n【34】*   Don't drink large amounts of alcohol.\n*   Wear a helmet when bicycling and a seat belt when driving.\n*   Treat infections quickly so that they don't have a chance to spread to the brain.\n*   Get immediate medical treatment if you have symptoms that suggest a stroke or brain aneurysm. Those symptoms include a severe headache, feeling numb on one side of the body or not being able to move one side of the body.\n\n【35】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

However, the plasma leptin level did not correlate with the waist/hip ratio in this study ( _r_ \\=0.35; _P_ \\=.38). This discrepant result might be caused by the altered distribution of body fat deposit, as in case 1, who had a higher waist/hip ratio than expected. In addition, we found that plasma leptin levels tended to decrease 30 minutes after the administration of a 75-g oral glucose challenge (–12%, –18%, and –24% in cases 1–3, respectively), whereas this effect did not occur in case 4. Nevertheless, in all participants, plasma leptin values reached the nadir (–19%, –26%, –25%, and –40% in cases 1–4, respectively) at the end (120 minutes) of the oral glucose tolerance test. Plasma leptin levels were markedly decreased on postoperative day 1, and this effect persisted to postoperative day 14 ( Table 1 ).\n\n【37】Table 1 Plasma Leptin Concentrations (ng/mL) of 4 Women After Suction Lipectomy\n\n|  | Case 1 | Case 2 | Case 3 | Case 4 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aspirated fat (mL) | 1250 | 5540 | 2300 | 12,780 |\n| Preoperation | 11.35 | 22.46 | 10.01 | 44.64 |\n| Postoperative day 1 | 9.97 | 16.25 | 8.76 | 33.40 |\n| Postoperative day 2 | 9.06 | 14.81 | 7.57 | 29.87 |\n| Postoperative day 14 | 6.68 | 9.36 | 5.83 | 26.49 |\n\n【39】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【40】**Discussion.** —Although the reason for the reduction of leptinemia after the oral glucose challenge is still elusive, a transient suppression of leptin production during the performance of a hypoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp in healthy men has been noted.\n\n【41】\n\n【42】*   Schmitz O\n*   Fisker S\n*   Orskov L\n*   Hove KY\n*   Nyholm B\n*   Moller N\n\n【43】Effects of hyperinsulinaemia and hypoglycaemia on circulating leptin levels in healthy lean males.\n\n【44】_Diabetes Metab._ 1997; 23 : 80-83\n\n【45】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【46】Insulin is a potent stimulant of leptin secretion.\n\n【47】\n\n【48】*   Saad MF\n*   Khan A\n*   Sharma A\n*   et al.\n\n【49】Physiological insulinemia acutely modulates plasma leptin.\n\n【50】_Diabetes._ 1998; 47 : 544-549\n\n【51】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (268)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【52】However, insulin has recently been found to acutely suppress rather than stimulate leptin production.\n\n【53】\n\n【54】*   Casabiell X\n*   Pineiro V\n*   De la Cruz LF\n*   et al.\n\n【55】Dual effect of insulin on in vitro leptin secretion by adipose tissue.\n\n【56】_Biochem Biophys Res Commun._ 2000; 276 : 477-482\n\n【57】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (11)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【58】The occurrence of an acutely inhibitory effect of insulin on leptin production may be caused by an instinctive adaptation to maximize energy deposit when nutrients are available and to delay the satiety response until fat tissues accumulate enough energy.\n\n【59】\n\n【60】*   Casabiell X\n*   Pineiro V\n*   De la Cruz LF\n*   et al.\n\n【61】Dual effect of insulin on in vitro leptin secretion by adipose tissue.\n\n【62】_Biochem Biophys Res Commun._ 2000; 276 : 477-482\n\n【63】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (11)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【64】Table 1 indicates that plasma leptin levels markedly decreased, and the decrease lasted for at least 14 days after suction lipectomy. The data also showed that plasma leptin concentration acutely reflected (24 hours after liposuction) the changes in the amount of body fat deposits. In addition, plasma leptin values after suction lipectomy could be roughly predicted from the aspirated volume of fat: postoperative plasma leptin level (ng/mL) = the value of preoperative plasma leptin – (aspirated fat \\[mL\\] × 0.001). Furthermore, the plasma leptin level and BMI also became disassociated as expected.

Sular\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】  \n\n【6】Nisoldipine is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure. High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled .\n\n【7】Nisoldipine is a calcium channel blocker. It works by affecting the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. As a result, it relaxes blood vessels and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload .\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet, Extended Release\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Idamycin PFS\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】  \n\n【6】Idarubicin injection is used in combination with other medicines to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\n【7】Idarubicin belongs to the group of medicines known as antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It works by interfering with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed.\n\n【8】This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Solution\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of idarubicin injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of idarubicin injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, chest pain, or heart attack which may require caution in patients receiving this medicine.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【24】*   Measles Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Mumps Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Rotavirus Vaccine, Live\n*   Rubella Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Tasonermin\n*   Varicella Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Zoster Vaccine, Live\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【30】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【31】*   Anemia or\n*   Bone marrow depression or\n*   Congestive heart failure or\n*   Heart or blood vessel disease (eg, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, myocarditis) or\n*   Heart rhythm problem (eg, arrhythmia)—Use with caution. May increase risk for heart problems caused by idarubicin.\n\n【32】*   Bone marrow suppression caused by other medicines or radiation—Should not be used in patients with this condition, unless your doctor says it is okay.\n\n【33】*   Gout or\n*   Kidney stones—Idarubicin may increase levels of uric acid in the body, which can cause gout or kidney stones.\n\n【34】*   Infection—May decrease your body's ability to fight infections.\n\n【35】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【36】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【37】Medicines used to treat cancer are very strong and can have many side effects. Before receiving this medicine, make sure you understand all the risks and benefits. It is important for you to work closely with your doctor during your treatment.\n\n【38】A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital or cancer treatment center. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins. The medicine must be injected slowly, so your IV tube will need to stay in place for 10 to 15 minutes every day for 3 days.\n\n【39】Idarubicin is sometimes given together with certain other medicines. If you are receiving a combination of medicines, it is important that you receive each one at the proper time. If you are taking some of these medicines by mouth, ask your doctor to help you plan a way to take them at the right times.\n\n【40】While you are receiving this medicine, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids so that you will pass more urine. This will help prevent kidney problems and keep your kidneys working well.\n\n【41】Idarubicin often causes nausea and vomiting. However, it is very important that you continue to receive it, even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your doctor for ways to lessen these effects.\n\n【42】### Missed Dose\n\n【43】This medicine needs to be given on a fixed schedule. If you miss a dose, call your doctor, home health caregiver, or treatment clinic for instructions.\n\n【44】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【45】It is very important that your doctor check you closely to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【46】Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. It may also cause birth defects if the father is using it when his sexual partner becomes pregnant. If you are a woman who can get pregnant, your doctor may do tests to make sure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. Use an effective form of birth control during treatment and for 6 ½ months after the last dose. Males with female partners who are able to become pregnant should use an effective form of birth control during treatment and for at least 3 ½ months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【47】Your doctor may monitor your heart while you are getting treatments with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain or discomfort, fast or irregular heartbeat, swelling of the feet and lower legs, or trouble breathing after receiving this medicine. These may be symptoms of serious heart problems.\n\n【48】Idarubicin can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【49】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【50】If idarubicin accidentally seeps out of the vein into which it is injected, it may damage some tissues and cause scarring. Tell your right away if you notice redness, pain, or swelling at the injection site.\n\n【51】While you are being treated with idarubicin, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Idarubicin may lower your body's resistance, and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have taken oral polio vaccine. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.\n\n【52】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【53】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【54】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【55】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【56】#### More common\n\n【57】1.  Black, tarry stools\n2.  bleeding gums\n3.  blood in the urine or stools\n4.  chest pain or discomfort\n5.  coughing up blood\n6.  cough or hoarseness\n7.  difficulty with breathing or swallowing\n8.  dizziness\n9.  fainting\n10.  fast or irregular heartbeat\n11.  fever or chills\n12.  increased menstrual flow or vaginal bleeding\n13.  lower back or side pain\n14.  nosebleeds\n15.  pain or discomfort in the arms, jaw, back, or neck\n16.  painful or difficult urination\n17.  paralysis\n18.  pinpoint red spots on the skin\n19.  prolonged bleeding from cuts\n20.  red or dark brown urine\n21.  red or black, tarry stools\n22.  sores in the mouth and on the lips\n23.  sweating\n24.  trouble breathing\n25.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n26.  vomiting\n\n【58】#### Less common\n\n【59】1.

These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects.

{"seq_id": "1d1e83a9-56b3-4d47-864b-b84031a1a5cd", "title": "Broken heart syndrome", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Broken heart syndrome is a heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations and extreme emotions. The condition also can be triggered by a serious physical illness or surgery. Broken heart syndrome is often a temporary condition. But some people may continue to feel unwell after the heart is healed.\n\n【2】People with broken heart syndrome may have sudden chest pain or think they're having a heart attack. Broken heart syndrome affects just part of the heart. It briefly interrupts the way the heart pumps blood. The rest of the heart continues to work as usual. Sometimes the heart contracts more forcefully.\n\n【3】Medicines are used to treat symptoms of broken heart syndrome.\n\n【4】Broken heart syndrome also may be called:\n\n【5】*   Stress cardiomyopathy.\n*   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.\n*   Recurrent takotsubo cardiomyopathy.\n*   Apical ballooning syndrome.\n\n【6】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【7】Symptoms of broken heart syndrome can mimic a heart attack. Symptoms may include:\n\n【8】*   Chest pain.\n*   Shortness of breath.\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】Any persistent chest pain could be due to a heart attack. Call 911 or emergency services if you have new or unexplained chest pain. Also call if you have a very rapid or irregular heartbeat or shortness of breath.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】The exact cause of broken heart syndrome is unclear. It's thought that a surge of stress hormones, such as adrenaline, might temporarily damage the hearts of some people. How these hormones might hurt the heart or whether something else is responsible isn't completely clear.\n\n【13】A temporary squeezing of the large or small arteries of the heart may play a role. People who have broken heart syndrome also may have a change in the structure of the heart muscle.\n\n【14】An intense physical or emotional event often comes before broken heart syndrome. Anything that causes a strong emotional response may trigger the condition. Examples include:\n\n【15】*   Sudden illness such as an asthma attack or COVID-19 infection.\n*   Major surgery.\n*   Sudden broken bone.\n*   Death of a loved one or other loss.\n*   Strong argument.\n\n【16】Rarely, use of certain drugs may lead to broken heart syndrome. They include:\n\n【17】*   Emergency medicines used to treat severe allergic reactions or severe asthma attacks.\n*   Some medicines used to treat anxiety.\n*   Nasal decongestants used to treat a stuffy nose.\n*   Illegal stimulant drugs, such as methamphetamine and cocaine.\n\n【18】Always tell your health care provider about the medicines you take, including those bought without a prescription. When starting a new medicine, talk to your provider about the potential risks and side effects.\n\n【19】### How is broken heart syndrome different from a heart attack?\n\n【20】Heart attacks are generally caused by a complete or near-complete blockage of a heart artery. In broken heart syndrome, the heart arteries are not blocked. But blood flow in the arteries of the heart may be reduced.\n\n【21】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【22】Risk factors for broken heart syndrome include:\n\n【23】*   **Sex.** Broken heart syndrome is more common in women than in men.\n*   **Age.** Most people who have broken heart syndrome are older than 50.\n*   **Mental health conditions.** People who have or had anxiety or depression may have a higher risk of broken heart syndrome.\n\n【24】Complications\n-------------\n\n【25】Most people who have broken heart syndrome quickly recover and don't have long-lasting effects. But sometimes the condition occurs again. This is called recurrent takotsubo cardiomyopathy.\n\n【26】Rarely, broken heart syndrome can cause death.\n\n【27】Complications of broken heart syndrome include:\n\n【28】*   Backup of fluid into the lungs, called pulmonary edema.\n*   Low blood pressure.\n*   Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias.\n*   Heart failure.\n*   Blood clots in the heart.\n\n【29】Prevention\n----------\n\n【30】To prevent another episode of broken heart syndrome, many health care providers recommend long-term treatment with beta blockers or similar medicines. These medicines block the potentially harmful effects of stress hormones on the heart.\n\n【31】Having chronic stress may increase the risk of broken heart syndrome. Taking steps to manage emotional stress can improve heart health and may help prevent broken heart syndrome. Some ways to reduce and manage stress include:\n\n【32】*   Get more exercise.\n*   Practice mindfulness.\n*   Connect with others in support groups.\n\n【33】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Neupro\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】  \n\n【6】Rotigotine transdermal patch is used to treat Parkinson disease. It is a dopamine agonist that works on the nervous system to help treat the symptoms of Parkinson disease.\n\n【7】Rotigotine is also used to treat a condition called Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). RLS is a neurologic disorder that affects sensation and movement in the legs and causes the legs to feel uncomfortable. This results in an irresistible feeling of wanting to move your legs to make them comfortable.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Patch, Extended Release\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of rotigotine transdermal patch in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of rotigotine transdermal patch in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to develop hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there), which may require caution in patients receiving this medicine.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】Studies suggest that this medication may alter milk production or composition. If an alternative to this medication is not prescribed, you should monitor the infant for side effects and adequate milk intake.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【24】*   Sulpiride\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【26】*   Haloperidol\n*   Metoclopramide\n*   Olanzapine\n*   Risperidone\n\n【27】### Other Interactions\n\n【28】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【30】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【31】*   Congestive heart failure or\n*   Dyskinesia (trouble controlling your muscles) or\n*   Heart or blood vessel disease or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) or\n*   Hypotension (low blood pressure) or\n*   Kidney disease, severe or\n*   Mental illness (eg, hallucinations, psychosis)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【32】*   Lung or breathing problem (eg, asthma) or\n*   Sulfite allergy—Use with caution. This medicine contains sodium metabisulfite, which may cause serious allergic reactions in patients with these conditions.\n\n【33】*   Sleep disorders or\n*   Sleepiness, history of—May cause side effects to become worse.\n\n【34】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【35】This medicine comes with patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【36】To use the skin patch:\n\n【37】*   Apply the patch right away after removing it from the protective pouch. Do not cut it into smaller pieces and do not touch the sticky surface of the patch.\n*   Apply the patch to a clean, dry, intact, and healthy skin area on your stomach, thigh, hip, flank (side of the body between the ribs and the pelvis), shoulder, or upper arm. Choose an area that is not very oily, has little or no hair, and is free of scars, cuts, burns, or any other skin irritation. If you need to put the patch on a hairy area, the area should be shaved at least 3 days before applying the patch. Avoid putting the patch on skin folds, under a waistband, or on areas where it could be rubbed by tight clothing.\n*   Press the patch firmly in place with the palm of your hand for about 30 seconds. Make sure there is good contact with your skin, especially around the edges of the patch.\n*   The patch should stay in place, even when you are showering, bathing, or swimming. Apply a new patch if it falls off.\n*   After 24 hours, remove the patch. Choose a different place on your skin to apply the new patch. Do not put a new patch in the same place for at least 14 days. Do not leave the patch on for more than 24 hours. It will not work as well after that time and it may irritate your skin.\n*   After removing a used patch, fold the patch in half with the sticky sides together. Place the folded, used patch in its protective pouch or in aluminum foil. Make sure to dispose of it out of the reach of children and pets. Wash the application site with soap and water to remove any drug or adhesive. You may also use baby or mineral oil to remove any excess medicine. Do not use alcohol or other solvents (eg, nail polish remover) to avoid skin irritation.\n*   Try to change the patch at the same time each day. If you forget to change the patch at the usual time, remove the patch you are wearing and put on a new patch. After that, apply a fresh patch at the usual time on the next day.\n*   Do not put cream, lotion, ointment, oil, or powder on the skin area where the patch will be placed.\n*   Make sure you wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying the patch.\n\n【38】### Dosing\n\n【39】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【40】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【41】*   For transdermal dosage form (patch):\n    *   For Parkinson's disease:\n        *   Adults—At first, one 2-milligram (mg) patch applied every 24 hours for early-stage disease or one 4-mg patch applied every 24 hours for advanced-stage disease. Your doctor will gradually increase your dose if needed and tolerated. However, the dose is usually not more than 6 to 8 mg every 24 hours.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS):\n        *   Adults—At first, one 1-milligram (mg) patch applied every 24 hours. Your doctor will gradually increase your dose if needed and tolerated. However, the dose is usually not more than 3 mg every 24 hours.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【42】### Missed Dose\n\n【43】If you forget to wear or change a patch, put one on as soon as you can. If it is almost time to put on your next patch, wait until then to apply a new patch and skip the one you missed. Do not apply extra patches to make up for a missed dose.\n\n【44】### Storage\n\n【45】Store the patches at room temperature in a closed container, away from heat, moisture, and direct light.\n\n【46】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【47】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【48】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【49】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【50】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【51】This medicine may cause some people to become dizzy, drowsy, lightheaded, or faint. People using rotigotine have reported falling asleep without warning during activities of daily living, including driving, which sometimes resulted in accidents. This may happen as late as one year after taking the medicine. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert, well-coordinated, or able to think well. If these side effects are especially bothersome, check with your doctor.\n\n【52】This medicine may cause changes in your blood pressure or heart rate. Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position suddenly. Getting up slowly may help. If the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【53】This medicine may cause some people to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors, including confusion, delusions, feeling aggressive or hostile, or seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there (hallucinations). If you or your caregiver notice any of these side effects, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【54】Some people who have used this medicine had unusual changes in their thoughts or behavior, including an urge to gamble, spend money, binge eat, or an increased sex drive. Talk with your doctor if this is a concern for you.\n\n【55】This medicine may cause fluid retention (edema) in some patients. Tell your doctor right away if you have bloating or swelling of the face, arms, hands, lower legs, or feet, tingling of the hands or feet, or unusual weight gain or loss.\n\n【56】Check with your doctor before using this medicine with alcohol or other medicines that affect the central nervous system (CNS). This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of medicines that affect the CNS are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicines, medicine for depression, medicine for anxiety, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics.\n\n【57】The patch contains aluminum, which can cause skin burns when used during certain procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardioversion. To prevent skin burns, make sure the patch is removed before having these procedures.\n\n【58】Heat may cause too much of the rotigotine to pass through your skin. Do not expose the patch to direct sources of heat, such as heating pads, electric blankets, heat lamps, saunas, hot tubs, heated water beds, or direct sunlight. Direct sunlight may cause your skin to change color.\n\n【59】Tell your doctor if you develop a skin rash or irritation from the patch that lasts longer than a few days, becomes more severe, or spreads to areas outside the application site.\n\n【60】Do not change your dose or stop using this medicine suddenly without first asking your doctor. You will need to slowly decrease your dose before stopping it completely. Stopping this medicine suddenly may cause anxiety, confusion, depression, fever, lack of feeling or emotion, severe muscle stiffness, sweating, trouble sleeping, uncaring, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【61】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【62】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【63】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【64】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【65】#### More common\n\n【66】1.

Edarbyclor\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】  \n\n【6】Azilsartan and chlorthalidone combination is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.\n\n【7】Azilsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, azilsartan relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.\n\n【8】Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Tablet\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Using these codes, we defined the 20 common chronic conditions recommended by the US Department of Health and Human Services. We counted only persons who received at least 2 codes for a given condition separated by more than 30 days, and we calculated the age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific prevalence of multimorbidity.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of the 138,858 study participants, 52.4% were women (n=72,732) and 38.9% had 1 or more conditions (n=54,012), 22.6% had 2 or more conditions (n=31,444), and 4.9% had 5 or more conditions (n=6853). The prevalence of multimorbidity (≥2 conditions) increased steeply with older age and reached 77.3% at 65 years and older. However, the absolute number of people affected by multimorbidity was higher in those younger than 65 years. Although the prevalence of multimorbidity was similar in men and women overall, the most common dyads and triads of conditions varied by sex. Compared with white persons, the prevalence of multimorbidity was slightly higher in black persons and slightly lower in Asian persons.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Multimorbidity is common in the general population; it increases steeply with older age, has different patterns in men and women, and varies by race/ethnicity.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ARR ( cardiac arrhythmia ), ART ( arthritis ), AST ( asthma ), AUT ( autism spectrum disorder ), CAD ( coronary artery disease ), CAN ( cancer ), CHF ( congestive heart failure ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), CMS ( Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ), COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ), DEM ( dementia ), DEP ( depression ), DIA ( diabetes ), HEP ( hepatitis ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), HTN ( hypertension ), ICD-9 ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ), LIP ( hyperlipidemia ), OST ( osteoporosis ), REP ( Rochester Epidemiology Project ), STR ( stroke ), SUB ( substance abuse disorders ), SZO ( schizophrenia )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "2b3750c1-3299-465a-921f-d06eb3f9bc8e", "title": "Sudden cardiac arrest", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the sudden loss of all heart activity due to an irregular heart rhythm. Breathing stops. The person becomes unconscious. Without immediate treatment, sudden cardiac arrest can lead to death.\n\n【2】Emergency treatment for sudden cardiac arrest includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks to the heart with a device called an automated external defibrillator (AED). Survival is possible with fast, appropriate medical care.\n\n【3】Sudden cardiac arrest isn't the same as a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked. Sudden cardiac arrest is not due to a blockage. However, a heart attack can cause a change in the heart's electrical activity that leads to sudden cardiac arrest.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest are immediate and severe and include:\n\n【6】*   Sudden collapse.\n*   No pulse.\n*   No breathing.\n*   Loss of consciousness.\n\n【7】Sometimes other symptoms occur before sudden cardiac arrest. These might include:\n\n【8】*   Chest discomfort.\n*   Shortness of breath.\n*   Weakness.\n*   Fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart called palpitations.\n\n【9】But sudden cardiac arrest often occurs with no warning.\n\n【10】### When to see a doctor\n\n【11】When the heart stops, the lack of oxygen-rich blood can quickly cause death or permanent brain damage.\n\n【12】Call 911 or emergency medical services for these symptoms:\n\n【13】*   Chest pain or discomfort.\n*   Feeling of a pounding heartbeat.\n*   Rapid or irregular heartbeats.\n*   Unexplained wheezing.\n*   Shortness of breath.\n*   Fainting or near fainting.\n*   Lightheadedness or dizziness.\n\n【14】If you see someone who's unconscious and not breathing, call 911 or local emergency services. Then start CPR. The American Heart Association recommends doing CPR with hard and fast chest compressions. Use an automated external defibrillator, called an AED, if one is available.\n\n【15】### How to do CPR\n\n【16】Do CPR if the person isn't breathing. Push hard and fast on the person's chest — about 100 to 120 pushes a minute. If you've been trained in CPR, check the person's airway. Then deliver rescue breaths after every 30 compressions.\n\n【17】If you haven't been trained, just continue chest compressions. Allow the chest to rise completely between compressions. Keep doing this until an AED is available or emergency workers arrive.\n\n【18】Portable automated external defibrillators, called AEDs, are available in many public places, including airports and shopping malls. You can also buy one for home use. AEDs come with step-by-step voice instructions for their use. They're programmed to allow a shock only when appropriate.\n\n【19】Causes\n------\n\n【20】A change in the heart's electrical activity causes sudden cardiac arrest. The change makes the heart stop pumping blood. No blood flow goes to the body.\n\n【21】### How the heart beats\n\n【22】To understand sudden cardiac arrest, it may help to know more about the heart's signaling system.\n\n【23】Electric signals in the heart control the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. Faulty or extra electrical signals can make the heart beat too fast, too slowly or in an uncoordinated way. Changes in the heartbeat are called arrhythmias. Some arrhythmias are brief and harmless. Others can lead to sudden cardiac arrest.\n\n【24】### Heart conditions that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest\n\n【25】The most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest is an irregular heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation. Rapid, erratic heart signals cause the lower heart chambers to quiver uselessly instead of pumping blood. Certain heart conditions can make you more likely to have this type of heartbeat problem.\n\n【26】However, sudden cardiac arrest can happen in people who have no known heart disease.\n\n【27】Heart conditions that can cause sudden cardiac arrest include:\n\n【28】*   **Coronary artery disease.** Sudden cardiac arrest may occur if the heart arteries become clogged with cholesterol and other deposits, reducing blood flow to the heart.\n*   **Heart attack.** If a heart attack occurs, often as a result of severe coronary artery disease, it can trigger ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest. Also, a heart attack can leave scar tissue in the heart. The scar tissue can cause changes in the heartbeat.\n*   **Enlarged heart called cardiomyopathy.** This condition usually happens when the walls in the heart muscle stretch. The heart muscle gets bigger or thicker.\n*   **Heart valve disease.** Leaking or narrowing of the heart valves can lead to stretching or thickening of the heart muscle. When the chambers become enlarged or weakened because of stress caused by a tight or leaking valve, there's an increased risk of developing a heart rhythm problem.\n*   **Heart problem present at birth, called a congenital heart defect.** Sudden cardiac arrest in children or adolescents is often due to a heart problem that they're born with. Adults who've had repair surgery for a congenital heart defect also have an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest.\n*   **Long QT syndrome (LQTS) and other heart signaling problems.** Conditions such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome cause the heart to beat in an unorganized way. If the heart rhythm isn't quickly restored, sudden death can occur. Young people with LQTS are especially at risk of sudden death.\n\n【29】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【30】The same things that increase the risk of heart disease can raise the risk of sudden cardiac arrest. These include:\n\n【31】*   A family history of coronary artery disease.\n*   Smoking.\n*   High blood pressure.\n*   High blood cholesterol.\n*   Obesity.\n*   Diabetes.\n*   An inactive lifestyle.\n\n【32】Other things that might increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest include:\n\n【33】*   A previous episode of sudden cardiac arrest or a family history of it.\n*   A previous heart attack.\n*   A personal or family history of other forms of heart disease such as heart rhythm problems, heart failure and heart problems present at birth.\n*   Growing older — the risk of sudden cardiac arrest increases with age.\n*   Being male.\n*   Using illegal drugs such as cocaine or amphetamines.\n*   Low potassium or magnesium levels.\n*   A sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea.\n*   Chronic kidney disease.\n\n【34】Complications\n-------------\n\n【35】When sudden cardiac arrest occurs, less blood flows to the brain. If the heart rhythm isn't rapidly restored, complications may include brain damage and death.\n\n【36】Prevention\n----------\n\n【37】Keeping the heart healthy may help prevent sudden cardiac arrest. You can do this by:\n\n【38】*   Eating healthy.\n*   Getting regular checkups.\n*   Not smoking or using tobacco.\n*   Being screened for heart disease.\n*   Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol.\n\n【39】Genetic tests can be done to see if you have long QT syndrome, a common cause of sudden cardiac death. Check with your insurer to see if it is covered. If you have the long QT gene, your health care provider may recommend that other family members also be tested.\n\n【40】If you have a known risk of cardiac arrest, your health care provider might recommend a heart device called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The device is placed under your collarbone.\n\n【41】You also might consider purchasing an automated external defibrillator (AED) for home use. Discuss this with your health care provider. AEDs help reset the heart's rhythm when a person has sudden cardiac arrest. But they can be expensive and aren't always covered by health insurance.\n\n【42】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Coronary artery calcification was measured noninvasively by electron beam computed tomography and CAC score calculated using the method of Agatston et al. The 10-year CHD risk was calculated based on the Framingham risk score. The association of homocysteine with log-transformed CAC score was assessed in the pooled sample and within each risk stratum by linear regression after adjustment for conventional risk factors.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】In the 1071 participants studied, homocysteine was associated with CAC quantity ( _P_ \\=.01) after adjustment for CHD risk factors (age, male sex, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes, history of smoking, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure), serum creatinine, and statin and hypertension medication use. When the association was assessed in strata based on 10-year CHD risk, homocysteine was significantly ( _P_ \\=.003) associated with CAC quantity in participants at intermediate 10-year risk of CHD (6%-20%) independent of other risk factors but not in those at lower risk or higher risk.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Plasma homocysteine is associated with quantity of CAC independent of CHD risk factors.

{"seq_id": "607d3614-eeca-41e4-87fd-56b932630155", "title": "Mesenteric ischemia", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Mesenteric ischemia (mez-un-TER-ik is-KEE-me-uh) is a condition that happens when narrowed or blocked arteries restrict blood flow to your small intestine. Decreased blood flow can permanently damage the small intestine.\n\n【2】Sudden loss of blood flow to the small intestine is called acute mesenteric ischemia. The acute type is often caused by a blood clot and requires an immediate treatment, such as surgery.\n\n【3】Mesenteric ischemia that develops over time is called chronic mesenteric ischemia. The chronic type is usually caused by a buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries. Chronic mesenteric ischemia is treated with open surgery or a procedure called angioplasty.\n\n【4】Chronic mesenteric ischemia can become acute if it's not treated. It also can lead to severe weight loss and malnutrition.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】### Acute mesenteric ischemia\n\n【7】Symptoms of the acute form of mesenteric ischemia include:\n\n【8】*   Sudden, severe belly pain.\n*   Urgent need to have a bowel movement.\n*   Fever.\n*   Nausea and vomiting.\n\n【9】### Chronic mesenteric ischemia\n\n【10】Symptoms of the chronic form of mesenteric ischemia include:\n\n【11】*   Belly pain that starts about 30 minutes after eating.\n*   Pain that worsens over an hour.\n*   Pain that goes away within 1 to 3 hours.\n\n【12】### When to see a doctor\n\n【13】If you have severe, sudden belly pain that persists, seek emergency medical care. If you develop pain after eating, make an appointment with your primary care provider.\n\n【14】Causes\n------\n\n【15】Both acute and chronic mesenteric ischemia are caused by a decrease in blood flow to the small intestine. Acute mesenteric ischemia is most commonly caused by a blood clot in the main mesenteric artery. The blood clot often starts in the heart. The chronic form is most commonly caused by a buildup of fatty deposits, called plaque, that narrows the arteries.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】The most common risk factors for acute mesenteric ischemia include:\n\n【18】*   Atrial fibrillation — an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm.\n*   Congestive heart failure — a condition in which the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should.\n*   Recent vascular surgery.\n\n【19】The most common risk factors for chronic mesenteric ischemia include:\n\n【20】*   Type 2 diabetes.\n*   High cholesterol levels.\n*   High blood pressure.\n*   Artery disease.\n*   Smoking.\n*   Obesity.\n*   Older age.\n\n【21】Complications\n-------------\n\n【22】If not treated promptly, acute mesenteric ischemia can lead to:\n\n【23】*   **Irreversible bowel damage.** Not getting enough blood flow to the bowel can cause parts of the bowel to die.\n*   **Sepsis.** This potentially life-threatening condition is caused by the body releasing chemicals into the bloodstream to fight infection. In sepsis, the body overreacts to the chemicals, triggering changes that can lead to multiple organ failure.\n*   **Death.** Both of the above complications may lead to death.\n\n【24】People with chronic mesenteric ischemia can develop:\n\n【25】*   **Fear of eating.** This happens because of the after-meal pain associated with the condition.\n*   **Weight loss that isn't intended.** This can occur as a result of the fear of eating.\n*   **Acute-on-chronic mesenteric ischemia.** Symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia can get worse, leading to the acute form of the condition.\n\n【26】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Zemplar\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】  \n\n【6】Paricalcitol injection is used to treat and prevent hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis. Hyperparathyroidism is a condition that is caused when the parathyroid glands located in the neck make too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone controls the concentrations of calcium and phosphorus in your blood. Paricalcitol helps lower the amount of PTH which lowers the calcium and phosphorus concentrations.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Solution\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

The median age was 54.5 years (range, 21 weeks' gestation to 93 years). Dyspnea, the most common presenting symptom, occurred in 98 (56.6%) of 173 patients in whom initial symptoms were recorded, whereas 64 (37.0%) had no respiratory symptoms. Median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 7.5 weeks (range, 1 day to 4.5 years). Causes of chylothorax included surgery or trauma in 101 patients (49.8%), various medical conditions in 89 (43.8%), and unknown in 13 (6.4%). Among surgical procedures, esophagectomy (29 patients) and surgery for congenital heart disease (28 patients) were the most common causes of chylothorax. Among medical conditions, lymphoma (23 patients), lymphatic disorders (19 patients), and chylous ascites (16 patients) were the most common causes.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】Chylothorax has numerous causes. In contrast to previous studies, surgery or trauma was the most common cause of chylothorax at our institution, accounting for nearly 50% of cases. Lymphoma and other malignancies caused chylothorax in only 16.7% of cases. These numbers are possibly related to the high volume of cardiothoracic surgical procedures performed at our tertiary referral center.\n\n【8】AIDS ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ), CHF ( congestive heart failure ), LAM ( lymphangioleiomyomatosis )\n\n【9】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】One-time access price info\n\n【13】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】### Subscribe:\n\n【15】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】Already a print subscriber?

Bloodstream infection rates were calculated per 1000 patient-days of risk.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 3518 patients enrolled, 1146 patients received intravenous (IV) prostanoid therapy for more than 1 day (no BSI, n=1023; ≥1 BSI, n=123; total BSI episodes, n=166). Bloodstream infections rates were significantly increased in patients receiving IV treprostinil vs IV epoprostenol (0.36 vs 0.12 per 1000 treatment days; _P_ <.001), primarily due to gram-negative organisms (0.20 vs 0.03 per 1000 treatment days; _P_ <.001). Multivariate analysis adjusting for age, causes of PAH, and year of BSI found that treatment with IV treprostinil was associated with a 3.08-fold increase (95% confidence interval, 2.05-4.62; _P_ <.001) in BSIs of any type and a 6.86-fold increase (95% confidence interval, 3.60-13.07; _P_ <.001) in gram-negative BSIs compared with treatment with IV epoprostenol.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Compared with IV epoprostenol therapy, treatment with IV treprostinil is associated with a significantly higher rate of gram-negative BSIs; observed differences in BSI rate did not seem to be due to any other analyzed factors.\n\n【9】### Trial Registration\n\n【10】clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00370214\n\n【11】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【12】BSI ( bloodstream infection ), CI ( confidence interval ), IV ( intravenous ), PAH ( pulmonary arterial hypertension ), PVR ( pulmonary vascular resistance ), REVEAL ( Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term PAH Disease Management ), RHC ( right heart catheterization )\n\n【13】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【14】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【15】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【16】One-time access price info\n\n【17】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【18】### Subscribe:\n\n【19】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【20】Already a print subscriber?

Fycompa\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】  \n\n【6】Perampanel is used alone or together with other medicines to treat certain types of epilepsy, such as partial onset seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It works in the brain to prevent seizures. Perampanel will not cure epilepsy and will only control the seizures as long as you continue to take it.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Tablet\n*   Suspension\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of perampanel to treat partial onset seizures in children younger than 4 years of age or to treat generalized tonic-clonic seizures in children younger than 12 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of perampanel in the elderly.

Participants were followed until December 31, 2003, or until the date of death. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses evaluated the strength of the associations, controlling for covariates.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Participants (3220 \\[25%\\] women) averaged 53.0±11.3 years of age at baseline. During a median follow-up of 13.5 years, 1139 deaths occurred. Receiving social support from relatives reduced mortality risk by 19% (hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95). Receiving spousal/partner support also reduced mortality risk by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99). Receiving social support from friends was not associated with mortality risk (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.75-1.09); however, participants reporting social contact with 6 or 7 friends on a weekly basis had a 24% lower mortality risk than did those in contact with 0 or 1 friend (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-0.98). Contact with 2 to 5 or 8 or more friends was not associated with mortality risk, nor was the number of weekly contacts with relatives.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Receiving social support from one’s spouse/partner and relatives and maintaining weekly social interaction with 6 to 7 friends reduced mortality risk. Such data may inform interventions to improve long-term survival.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACLS ( Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

However, the disease course remains highly variable, and the heterogeneity largely reflects different genetic abnormalities. We studied the impact of the Mayo risk-stratification model of MM on patient outcome in the era of novel therapies, evaluating each individual component of the model—fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), conventional cytogenetics (CG), and the plasma cell labeling index—that segregates patients into high- and standard-risk categories. This report consists of 290 patients with newly diagnosed MM, predominantly treated with novel agents, who were risk-stratified at diagnosis and were followed up for OS. Of these patients, 81% had received primarily thalidomide (n=50), lenalidomide (n=199), or bortezomib (n=79) as frontline or salvage therapies. Our retrospective analysis validates the currently proposed Mayo risk-stratification model (median OS, 37 months vs not reached for high- and standard-risk patients, respectively; _P_ \\=.003). Although the FISH or CG test identifies a high-risk cohort with hazard ratios of 2.1 ( _P_ \\=.006) and 2.5 ( _P_ \\=.006), respectively, the plasma cell labeling index cutoff of 3% fails to independently prognosticate patient risk (hazard ratio, 1.4; _P_ \\=.41). In those stratified as standard-risk by one of the 2 tests (FISH or CG), the other test appears to be of additional prognostic significance. This study validates the high-risk features defined by FISH and CG in the Mayo risk-stratification model for patients with MM predominantly treated with novel therapies based on immunomodulatory agents.\n\n【1】CG ( cytogenetics ), CI ( confidence interval ), FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ), HR ( hazard ratio ), IgH ( immunoglobulin heavy chain ), MM ( multiple myeloma ), mSMART ( Mayo Stratification of Myeloma and Risk-Adapted Therapy ), NR ( not reached ), PCLI ( plasma cell labeling index ), SCT ( stem cell transplantation )\n\n【2】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【3】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【4】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

Physical activity levels were converted into metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) per week and categorized to correspond with multiples of public health recommendations. We evaluated the quantitative and categorical dose-response relationship between physical activity and PCA.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A curvilinear dose-response relationship between physical activity and PCA was observed; the benefits started at two-thirds (5 MET-hour/week) of the United States and World Health Organization guidelines–recommended minimum (7.5 MET-hour/week) and continued to 5 times (40 MET-hour/week) the recommended minimum ( _P_ nonlinearity <.001). The largest benefit was noted at a level of 2 to 3 times the recommended minimum (hazard ratio, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.8). In addition, there was no evidence of an increased PCA risk at a level more than 5 times the recommended minimum (hazard ratio, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.1). These associations were consistent regardless of age, sex, body mass index, comorbid conditions, and estimated 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The beneficial effect of physical activity on PCA started at two-thirds of the recommended minimum and continued to 5 times the recommended minimum. No excess risk for PCA was present among individuals with activity levels more than 5 times the recommended minimum regardless of cardiovascular disease or lifestyle risk factor presence.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BMI ( body mass index ), HR ( hazard ratio ), ICD-10 ( International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision ), MET ( metabolic equivalent task ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), NHIS ( National Health Insurance Service ), NSC ( National Sample Cohort ), PCA ( primary cardiac arrest ), SCA ( sudden cardiac arrest ), WHO ( World Health Organization )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

He had no medical history and took no medication before the onset of symptoms. On examination, his temperature was 37.9 °C. The laboratory findings showed eosinophilia and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 15.0 mg/L. Myeloperoxidase-antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCAs) were slightly elevated (6.1 U/mL, normal: < 3.5 U/mL). Proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA, rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C virus antibody were negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed wedge-shaped regions of decreased contrast enhancement in the bilateral kidney ( Figure 1 ), suggesting low perfusion, even though the urinalysis (no proteinuria, hematuria, and cast) including the spot urine protein to creatinine ratio (45.7 mg/gCre), the serum creatinine level (0.73 mg/dL), and noncontrast CT scan were normal. The renal artery’s angiography revealed bilateral multiple renal aneurysms with parenchymal defect ( Figure 2 and Supplementary File , available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ). These findings were consistent with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). After the treatment with prednisolone (70 mg daily) and intravenous cyclophosphamide (500 mg monthly) was initiated, his symptoms improved, and the elevated CRP decreased to normal. The patient’s condition was stabilized with a normal range of serum creatinine (approximately 0.80 mg/dL); therefore, we did not repeat the angiography.\n\n【1】Figure 1 Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed wedge-shaped regions of low perfusion in the kidney.\n\n【2】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【3】Figure 2 The renal artery’s angiography revealed bilateral multiple renal aneurysms with parenchymal defect.\n\n【4】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【5】PAN is a systemic inflammatory disease and classified with medium vessel vasculitis, leading to multiple organ damages by the artery occlusion, aneurysm, and rupture.\n\n【6】\n\n【7】*   Jennette J.C.\n*   Falk R.J.\n*   Bacon P.A.\n*   et al.\n\n【8】2012 revised International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference Nomenclature of Vasculitides.\n\n【9】_Arthritis Rheum._ 2013; 65 : 1-11\n\n【10】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (4264)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【11】Therefore, the urinalysis often does not show any proteinuria, hematuria, or granular cast as glomerulonephritis associated with small-vessel vasculitis.\n\n【12】\n\n【13】*   Ozen S.\n\n【14】The changing face of polyarteritis nodosa and necrotizing vasculitis.\n\n【15】_Nat Rev Rheumatol._ 2017; 13 : 381-386\n\n【16】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (61)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【17】In addition, the renal microaneurysms are mostly too small to be detected on CT angiography.

C. Lathrop was born in Illinois in 1868, the only child of schoolteachers who were originally from Granby, MA. Few details about her childhood are known. Lathrop was homeschooled for the first 16 years of her life, after which she attended an unidentified academy for approximately 2 years, which allowed her to obtain an Illinois teaching certificate. She taught elementary school for several years but was not successful, apparently because of chronic ill health. Lathrop eventually quit teaching and moved to a farm in Granby in 1900. She initially attempted to start a poultry business, which failed. Her focus then shifted to breeding “fancy” mice and rats, which she marketed to rodent hobbyists and keepers of exotic pets, and later began selling in large numbers to scientific researchers. She also raised guinea pigs, rabbits, and ferrets. Some of her guinea pigs were purchased by the US government and used to detect toxic gases in the trenches of World War I battlefields. Two of Lathrop's close friends, Ada Gray and Edith Chapin, assisted in her animal business, and the women also employed many neighborhood children to clean cages and feed oats and crackers to the animals. Lathrop kept careful breeding records, which proved helpful for researchers. At one point, her farm housed more than 11,000 mice.\n\n【2】Several years after Lathrop developed her mouse colonies, she noticed that some of the animals were developing unusual skin lesions. She sent samples to several prominent scientists asking for help. Renowned experimental pathologist Leo Loeb (1869-1959), then at the University of Pennsylvania, became interested in the problem and diagnosed the lesions as malignant. His correspondence with Lathrop developed into an ongoing research collaboration that continued until her death. Loeb suggested several experiments related to cancer that Lathrop then carefully performed at her farm. Their mutual work resulted in 10 coauthored articles in prominent journals, such as the _Journal of Experimental Medicine_ and the _Journal of Cancer Research_ . Among other important observations, Lathrop and Loeb established that susceptibility to mammary tumors varied between different strains of mice and that ovariectomy reduced the incidence of mammary tumors.\n\n【3】William Ernest Castle (1867-1962), a pioneer in mammalian genetics who was among the first to realize the potential power of mouse models for human disease, bought some of Lathrop's mice for his laboratory in 1902, a fertile time for genetic research immediately after the rediscovery of the now-famous pea experiments of the Moravian monk Gregor Mendel. Castle directed the Bussey Institute for Biological Research at Harvard University for more than 30 years, and he trained most of the leaders in the early mammalian genetics field, including Nobel Laureate George D. Snell (1903-1996) and Clarence Cook (“C.C.”) Little (1888-1971). Little, in turn, founded a facility in Bar Harbor, ME, now known as the Jackson Laboratory, which remains one of the world's most important sources of inbred strains of laboratory mice. The most frequently used laboratory mouse strain for the past 80 years, C57BL/6J (“Black 6”), is derived from one of Lathrop's animals—mouse number 57—bred by Little. The complete genomic sequence of the C57BL/6J mouse was reported in 2002.\n\n【4】Lathrop died of pernicious anemia in 1918 and was buried in West Cemetery in Granby, near her 2 close friends Gray and Chapin. Pernicious anemia became treatable with liver extracts in the 1920s through the work of George R. Minot (1885-1950), George R. Whipple (1878-1976), and William P. Murphy (1892-1987), who shared a Nobel prize for their discovery in 1934. Ironically, William Bosworth Castle (1897-1990), the son of William Ernest Castle and a protégé of Minot, showed no interest in his father's field of animal genetics; instead, he established his formidable reputation in the field of hematology in the 1920s when he discovered that patients with pernicious anemia lack a gastric intrinsic factor. Lack of intrinsic factor due to autoantibodies against the gastric parietal cells that secrete intrinsic factor is the proximate cause of the disease that resulted in Lathrop's death.\n\n【5】Although the cartoon characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse have been honored philatelically hundreds of times by many countries, only a few postage stamps have featured real mice or other rodents, probably because of the poor reputation that rodents have had among humans for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians, for example, revered cats because cats kept grain stores free of mice and other “vermin.” The US Postal Service included the deer mouse in a 1987 series of 50 stamps featuring North American wildlife (Scott No. 2324). However, the deer mouse (genus _Peromyscus_ )—the primary reservoir species for hantavirus and a vector for transmission of several other infections including Lyme disease, babesiosis, and bubonic plague—is used for laboratory experiments less frequently than strains of the common house mouse ( _Mus musculus)_ .\n\n【6】Article info\n------------\n\n【7】### Identification\n\n【8】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/mcp.2010.0647\n\n【9】### Copyright\n\n【10】© 2010 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

These fatty acids may cause brain and nerve damage. The damage can be seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Elivaldogene autotemcel injection is recommended if the damage is determined to be early and if the brain disease is active. It will help the body to break down the fatty acids to slow the progression of damage to the brain and slow the decline in nerve function.\n\n【8】This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Suspension\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Your doctor will collect your blood through a procedure called mobilization and apheresis. Talk with your doctor if you have any concerns about this.\n\n【37】Your doctor will also want you to stay in the hospital or center for at least 2 months after your infusion.\n\n【38】Do not use medicine to treat HIV for at least 1 month before having a procedure to collect your blood.\n\n【39】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【40】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests are needed every 6 months for at least 15 years to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【41】Male patients with female partners should use an effective form of birth control before having a procedure to collect your blood and for at least 6 months after the last dose.\n\n【42】This medicine may cause blood cancer (eg, myelodysplastic syndrome). Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain, chills, cough or hoarseness, fever, lower back or side pain, painful or difficult urination, sores, ulcers, or white spots on the lips or in the mouth, swollen glands, unusual bleeding or bruising, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【43】Elivaldogene autotemcel will lower the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed or get infections more easily. To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers. Call your doctor right away if you have fever, chills, or any signs or symptoms of an infection.\n\n【44】This medicine may cause serious allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, which may be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, dizziness, fainting, fast heartbeat, trouble breathing or swallowing, or chest tightness while you are using this medicine.\n\n【45】While you are being treated with elivaldogene autotemcel, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Live virus vaccinations should not be given for at least 6 weeks before start of treatment, during treatment, and until recovery following the last cycle of this medicine.\n\n【46】Do not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells during treatment with this medicine.\n\n【47】Before you have any medical tests (eg, HIV test), tell the medical doctor in charge that you are taking this medicine. The results of some tests may be affected by this medicine.\n\n【48】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【49】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【50】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【51】#### More common\n\n【52】1.  Black, tarry stools\n2.  bleeding gums\n3.  blood in the urine or stools\n4.  blurred vision\n5.  chest pain\n6.  chills\n7.  cough or hoarseness\n8.  dizziness\n9.  fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat or pulse\n10.  fever\n11.  headache\n12.  lower back or side pain\n13.  nervousness\n14.  painful or difficult urination\n15.  pale skin\n16.  pinpoint red spots on the skin\n17.  pounding in the ears\n18.  seizures\n19.  slow or fast heartbeat\n20.  sore throat\n21.  sores, ulcers, or white spots on the lips or in the mouth\n22.  swollen glands\n23.  trouble breathing\n24.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n25.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n\n【53】#### Incidence not known\n\n【54】1.  Chest tightness\n2.  difficulty swallowing\n3.  hives, itching, or skin rash\n4.  puffiness or swelling of the eyelids or around the eyes, face, lips, or tongue\n\n【55】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention.

Your doctor may want you or your child to have your eyes checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).\n\n【41】Dinutuximab can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【42】*   If you can, avoid people with infections.

Fox was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1958 and moved with his family to Port Coquitlam, British Columbia (25 km from Vancouver), in 1968. His parents and siblings noted that Terry was extremely competitive and stubborn from an early age. Despite his small size, he was named “athlete of the year” by his graduating high school class, and he enrolled in Simon Fraser University in Vancouver in 1976, where he studied kinesiology, played junior varsity basketball, and planned to become a physical education teacher.\n\n【3】Chronic leg pain after an automobile accident in November 1976 eventually led to the diagnosis of osteosarcoma involving Fox’s right leg in March 1977. He underwent an above-the-knee amputation, followed by more than a year of adjuvant chemotherapy at the BC Cancer Agency. Reportedly, one of Fox’s physicians told him that if he had been diagnosed a few years earlier, he would have received less effective chemotherapy with a poorer chance of long-term survival, which made Fox acutely aware of the importance of cancer research. He was upset when he learned of the limited cancer research funding in Canada at the time of his diagnosis and became motivated to act after witnessing some of the difficult experiences of his fellow patients with cancer.\n\n【4】Fox recovered remarkably quickly after his amputation and began to walk with a prosthesis less than a month after his surgery. He refused to consider himself disabled and joined a wheelchair basketball team a few months later, ultimately winning a national championship. After reading about Dick Traum, an amputee who completed the New York City Marathon in 1976, Fox decided to run the entire East-West length of Canada to raise money in support of cancer research. He trained relentlessly over 15 months, logging more than 3,000 running miles despite numerous injuries to his stump as well as his healthy leg, and he completed his first marathon (in British Columbia) in August 1979. He finished dead last but was loudly cheered by moved spectators. A letter-writing campaign resulted in early publicity for his transnational marathon plans, including donation of a support van by Ford and running shoes by Adidas, as well as the encouragement of the initially skeptical Canadian Cancer Society.\n\n【5】Fox’s “Marathon of Hope” began when he dipped his artificial leg in the Atlantic Ocean near St. John’s, Newfoundland, on April 12, 1980, and was intended to finish at the Pacific Ocean in Victoria, British Columbia, sometime in 1981. Initially, crowds along Fox's route were sparse and running was lonely. But, as time passed, interest escalated across the country. National media began extensive coverage of his quest, and his route was lined by well-wishers, donors, and fellow runners. Canadians of all ages followed his progress on television and were transfixed by his off-kilter stride and seemingly endless endurance. Fox never took a day off despite difficult weather, numerous injuries, careless drivers, and frequent arguments with his support team, which included his brother.\n\n【6】In late August 1980, Fox began to develop chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath, which resulted in hospitalization just outside of Thunder Bay in Western Ontario. He was found to have developed metastatic osteosarcoma in his lungs. By the time he had to abandon his marathon efforts, on September 1st—after running 143 consecutive days and covering more than 5,000 kilometers—he had raised $1.7 million for cancer research, and his story was known to millions of people in Canada and around the world.\n\n【7】Fox received numerous systemic treatments after his cancer recurred, including experimental interferon, but his disease progressed. Despite his weakened condition, he granted many interviews and continued to make appeals for cancer research funding until just before his death. On February 1, 1981, four months before his death, Fox achieved his original goal of raising $1 for every Canadian citizen; his Marathon of Hope Fund at the time totaled $24.17 million.\n\n【8】In September 1980, he became the youngest person ever to be named a Companion of the Order of Canada. The major research unit of the BC Cancer Agency in Vancouver received funds raised by the Marathon of Hope and was designated the “Terry Fox Laboratory” in 1981. After Fox died in June 1981, numerous roads, schools, athletic centers, parks, and fitness trails across Canada were named in his honor. A previously unnamed mountain in the Selkirk Range in British Columbia was christened Mount Terry Fox, and his story was dramatized in a film and in several books.\n\n【9】Since 1981, the Terry Fox Foundation has raised over $600 million for cancer research, and Fox has become an iconic figure for both disease advocates and disabled persons. The Terry Fox National School Run Day continues to involve thousands of schools and millions of students and teachers in Canada and across the world. In November 2004, Terry Fox was voted the second “Greatest Canadian of All Time” in a national poll organized by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n【10】Terry Fox has been honored twice philatelically by Canada. In 1982 (Scott #915), Fox became the first person ever to be depicted on a Canadian postage stamp without having been deceased for at least 10 years. He was included in Canada’s Millenium Series of postage stamps in January 2000 (Scott #1824) and was also the first individual Canadian depicted on a general circulation coin, a 2005 commemorative dollar.\n\n【11】Article info\n------------\n\n【12】### Identification\n\n【13】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2013.10.037\n\n【14】### Copyright\n\n【15】© 2014 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【28】Using this medicine with any of the following is usually not recommended, but may be unavoidable in some cases. If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use this medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】*   Ethanol\n\n【30】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【31】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【32】*   Alcohol abuse, history of or\n*   Drug abuse or dependence, history of—Dependence on zolpidem may develop.\n\n【33】*   Depression, or history of or\n*   Lung disease (eg, COPD) or other breathing problems or\n*   Mental illness, history of or\n*   Myasthenia gravis (muscle disease) or\n*   Sleep apnea (breathing problems during sleep)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【34】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【35】*   Liver disease, mild to moderate—Use of zolpidem capsules must be avoided in patients with this condition.\n\n【36】*   Liver disease, severe—Use must be avoided in patients with this condition.

Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. If too much is taken, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence).\n\n【39】This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【40】Take zolpidem just before going to bed, when you are ready to go to sleep or when you are having trouble falling asleep. This medicine works very quickly to put you to sleep.\n\n【41】Swallow the extended-release tablet and capsule whole. Do not open, divide, crush, or chew it.\n\n【42】Do not take this medicine when your schedule does not permit you to get a full night's sleep (7 to 8 hours). If you must wake up before this, you may continue to feel drowsy and may experience memory problems, because the effects of the medicine have not had time to wear off.\n\n【43】Take this medicine on an empty stomach.

If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【47】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【48】*   For treatment of insomnia (trouble sleeping):\n    *   For oral dosage form (capsules):\n        *   Adults—7.5 milligrams (mg) once a day at bedtime. Take only 1 dose a night as needed. Zolpidem capsule is only available in a 7.5 mg strength.

Take only 1 dose a night as needed.\n        *   Older adults—5 mg once a day at bedtime.\n        *   Children—Use is not recommended.\n\n【49】### Missed Dose\n\n【50】If you miss a dose of this medicine, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【51】Use this medicine only when you cannot sleep. You do not need to keep a schedule for taking it.\n\n【52】### Storage\n\n【53】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【54】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【55】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【56】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【57】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【58】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【59】Using this medicine during the last 3 months of pregnancy can harm your newborn baby. Check with your doctor right away if your baby has pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, difficult or trouble breathing, excessive sleepiness, or limpness. Tell your doctor right away if you are pregnant or if you think you have become pregnant while using this medicine.\n\n【60】If you think you need to take zolpidem for more than 7 to 10 days, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Insomnia that lasts longer than this may be a sign of another medical problem.\n\n【61】Zolpidem may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hives, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat while you are using this medicine.\n\n【62】This medicine may cause you to do things while you are still asleep that you may not remember the next morning. It is possible you could drive a car, sleepwalk, have sex, make phone calls, or prepare and eat food while you are asleep or not fully awake. Tell your doctor right away if you learn that any of these has happened.\n\n【63】This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. CNS depressants are medicines that slow down the nervous system, which may cause drowsiness or make you less alert. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, barbiturates or medicine for seizures, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics. This effect may last for a few days after you stop taking this medicine. Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are using this medicine.\n\n【64】This medicine may cause some people, especially older persons, to become drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, clumsy or unsteady, or less alert than they are normally, which may lead to falls. Even though zolpidem is taken at bedtime, it may cause some people to feel drowsy or less alert on arising. Also, this medicine may cause double vision or other vision problems, or severe injuries (eg, hip fractures, severe bleeding in the head). Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\n【65】If you develop any unusual and strange thoughts or behavior while you are using zolpidem, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Some changes that have occurred in people using this medicine are like those seen in people who drink alcohol and then act in a manner that is not normal. Other changes may be more unusual and extreme, such as confusion, worsening of depression, hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there), suicidal thoughts, and unusual excitement, nervousness, or irritability.\n\n【66】Do not change your dose or stop using it without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping completely. This may help prevent a worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, including confusion as to time, place, or person, hallucinations, holding false beliefs that cannot be changed by fact, seizures, stomach or muscle cramps, tremors, unusual excitement, nervousness, or restlessness, or vomiting.\n\n【67】If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once. Taking an overdose of zolpidem or taking alcohol or other CNS depressants with zolpidem may lead to serious breathing problems (eg, respiratory depression) and unconsciousness. Symptoms of an overdose include: severe drowsiness, severe nausea or vomiting, staggering, and trouble breathing.\n\n【68】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal (eg, St. John's wort) or vitamin supplements.\n\n【69】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【70】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【71】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【72】#### Less common\n\n【73】1.

Information on self-reported PA (inactive, occasionally, monthly, weekly) and 11 chronic conditions diagnosed by a physician and reported by the study participants were recorded. Associations are summarized using hazard ratios (HRs) and Cox regression, after adjustment for covariates.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】At baseline, 43.2%, 37.5%, 14.4%, and 4.9% of participants had 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more chronic conditions, respectively. Mean follow-up was 8.9 years (median, 10.8 years; range, 0.02-11.28 years), with 1483 deaths. The HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality in participants with 1, 2, and 3 or more chronic conditions compared with those with none were 1.26 (1.05-1.39), 1.78 (1.51-2.09), and 2.27 (1.79-2.86), respectively. Being physically active (ie, doing any PA) was associated with a mortality reduction (95% CI) of 30% (14%-43%), 33% (18%-45%), 35% (16%-50%), and 47% (18%-66%) in participants with 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more chronic conditions, respectively. Compared with those with 0 chronic conditions who were physically active, participants with 2 (HR=2.63; 95% CI, 2.09-3.31) and 3 or more (HR=3.26; 95% CI, 2.42-4.38) chronic conditions who were physically inactive had the highest mortality risk.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Physical activity is associated with a reduction in increased risk of death associated with multimorbidity (ie, coexistence of ≥2 chronic conditions) in older individuals.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】HR ( hazard ratio ), PA ( physical activity )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【23】*   Iproniazid\n*   Isocarboxazid\n*   Linezolid\n*   Methotrexate\n*   Nialamide\n*   Pargyline\n*   Pexidartinib\n*   Phenelzine\n*   Procarbazine\n*   Tranylcypromine\n\n【24】### Other Interactions\n\n【25】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【26】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【27】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【28】*   Hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there)—Condition may become worse.\n\n【29】*   High fever and confusion or\n*   Muscle injury, aches, cramps—You should not take tolcapone.\n\n【30】*   Kidney problems, severe—Elimination of tolcapone may be decreased, which increases the risk of unwanted effects.\n\n【31】*   Liver problems or\n*   Liver tests higher than normal—This medicine can increase chances of serious liver problems. You should not start taking this medicine if you have these problems.\n\n【32】*   Low blood pressure or\n*   Orthostatic or postural low blood pressure (dizziness or lightheadedness when getting up suddenly from a sitting or lying position)—Condition may become worse.\n\n【33】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【34】Take this medicine only as directed by your doctor, to help your condition as much as possible. Do not take more or less of it, and do not take it more or less often than your doctor ordered.\n\n【35】It is important that you and your doctor discuss the risks of this medicine and that you read and sign a written informed consent before you begin taking this medicine.\n\n【36】### Dosing\n\n【37】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【38】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【39】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   For Parkinson's disease:\n        *   Adults—100 milligrams (mg) three times a day, taken in addition to levodopa and carbidopa.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【40】### Missed Dose\n\n【41】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【42】### Storage\n\n【43】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【44】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【45】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【46】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【47】It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits. Tolcapone may have serious effects on your liver. You must have regular blood tests done to make sure this medicine is not affecting your liver.\n\n【48】Because tolcapone may have serious effects on your liver, you should watch for any signs of these effects. Signs include dark urine; itching; light-colored stools; loss of appetite; nausea (continuing); tenderness in upper right part of abdomen; unusual drowsiness, dullness, or feeling sluggish; unusual tiredness or weakness; or yellow eyes or skin. If you notice any of these signs, contact your doctor.\n\n【49】Do not stop taking tolcapone without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are taking before stopping completely.\n\n【50】Tolcapone may cause dizziness or lightheadedness, drowsiness, weakness, or trouble in thinking or concentrating. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert, well-coordinated, or able to think clearly.\n\n【51】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. If you should have this problem, check with your doctor.\n\n【52】Hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there) may occur in some patients. This is more common in elderly patients.\n\n【53】You may experience nausea, especially when you first begin taking this medicine.\n\n【54】Tolcapone causes the urine to turn bright yellow. This is to be expected while you are taking it. This effect is harmless and will go away after you stop taking the medicine.\n\n【55】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【56】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.

{"seq_id": "f5beb8f8-da55-4c0b-9e00-5cfb43e17eff", "title": "Atorvastatin (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Atorvastatin (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Atorvaliq\n2.  Lipitor\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】  \n\n【6】Atorvastatin is used together with a proper diet to lower cholesterol and triglyceride (fats) levels in the blood. This medicine may help prevent medical problems (eg, chest pain, heart attack, or stroke) that are caused by fats clogging the blood vessels. It may also be used to prevent certain types of heart and blood vessel problems in patients with risk factors for heart problems.\n\n【7】Atorvastatin belongs to the group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins. It works by blocking an enzyme that is needed by the body to make cholesterol, and this reduces the amount of cholesterol in the blood.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Suspension\n*   Tablet\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of atorvastatin in children 10 to 17 years of age. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 10 years of age to treat homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and in children to treat other types of high cholesterol.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of atorvastatin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, heart problems, or increased risk of muscle problems, which may require caution in patients receiving atorvastatin.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【28】*   Amiodarone\n*   Amprenavir\n*   Azithromycin\n*   Bexarotene\n*   Black Cohosh\n*   Boceprevir\n*   Bosentan\n*   Clopidogrel\n*   Efavirenz\n*   Eltrombopag\n*   Ethinyl Estradiol\n*   Etravirine\n*   Fosphenytoin\n*   Fostemsavir\n*   Interferon Beta\n*   Norethindrone\n*   Oat Bran\n*   Pectin\n*   Phenytoin\n*   Pioglitazone\n*   Quinine\n*   Rifampin\n*   St John's Wort\n\n【29】### Other Interactions\n\n【30】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【31】Using this medicine with any of the following is usually not recommended, but may be unavoidable in some cases. If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use this medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【32】*   Grapefruit Juice\n\n【33】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【34】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【35】*   Alcohol abuse, or history of or\n*   Diabetes or\n*   Hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) or\n*   Liver disease, history—Use with caution.

Drinking large amounts of grapefruit juice (more than 1.2 liters each day) while you take this medicine may increase your risk of muscle injury and could result in kidney problems.\n\n【48】### Dosing\n\n【49】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【50】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【51】*   For oral dosage form (tablets and suspension):\n    *   For high cholesterol:\n        *   Adults—At first, 10 or 20 milligrams (mg) once a day.

Inclusion criteria were (1) intramedullary myelopathy, (2) neoplastic/inflammatory etiology, and (3) FDG-PET performed after myelopathy onset. Exclusion criteria were (1) extramedullary myelopathy, (2) radiation-associated myelopathy, (3) no pathological confirmation of neoplasm, and (4) inactive myelopathy. Diagnostic categories of nonsarcoid inflammatory, neoplastic, and neurosarcoid were based on their final myelopathic diagnosis. Two radiologists who independently assessed FDG-PET for spinal cord hypermetabolism and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) were blinded to the underlying etiology.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Fifty-one patients (53% women) with a median age of 60 years (range, 20-82 years) were included. Inflammatory myelopathic diagnoses (n=24) were as follows: paraneoplastic (n=13), autoimmune/other (n=5), inflammatory demyelinating (n=4), and transverse myelitis (n=2). Neoplastic diagnoses (n=21) were as follows: intramedullary metastases (n=12), intramedullary lymphoma/leukemia (n=7), and primary intramedullary neoplasm (n=2). Six patients had neurosarcoid myelopathy. Spinal cord hypermetabolism was more common with neoplastic myelopathy than with nonsarcoid inflammatory myelopathy (17 of 21 \\[81%\\] vs 6 of 24 \\[25%\\]; _P_ <.001). Agreement between radiologist’s assessments was excellent (κ=0.88). Median SUVmax was greater in neoplastic than in nonsarcoid inflammatory causes of myelopathy (3.3 g/mL vs 1.9 g/mL; _P_ <.001). The FDG-PET hypermetabolism was seen in 3 of the 6 patients (50%) with neurosarcoid myelopathy (median SUVmax, 2.6 g/mL; range, 1.8-12.2 g/mL).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Spinal cord FDG-PET hypermetabolism in patients with active myelopathy may be reliably detected and was more common in neoplastic than in inflammatory myelopathies in this study.

Patients with cardiac disease prior to the index date were excluded, and the remaining patients were categorized into epilepsy and nonepilepsy groups. Frequency matching was performed to balance the covariates across groups for the comparison of outcomes. The development of myocardial infarction (MI) and arrhythmia and/or the occurrence of sudden death were the outcomes for evaluation. A Cox proportional hazards regression model and competing risk analysis were used to compare the risks of cardiac morbidities and sudden death between groups.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The final analysis included a total of 5411 patients with epilepsy and 21,644 participants without epilepsy.

A D-dimer value greater than 250 ng/mL was considered positive for thromboembolic disease. Diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism was based solely on the interpretation of the CT angiogram. The D-dimer assay results were then compared with the CT angiographic diagnoses.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Of 946 CT studies, 172 (18%) were positive for acute pulmonary embolism. The D-dimer assay was positive for 612 (65%) of the 946 patients. For acute pulmonary embolism, the D-dimer assay had a sensitivity of 0.83 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.76-0.88), a specificity of 0.39 (95% CI, 0.36-0.43), a negative likelihood ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.32-0.62), and a negative predictive value of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.94).\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】The semiquantitative latex agglutination plasma fibrin D-dimer assay had moderate sensitivity and low specificity for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.

They raise this point as the anti–interleukin (IL)–5Rα monoclonal antibody benralizumab, which abolishes circulating eosinophils through induction of antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, has not been associated with an adverse effect profile. Indeed, an open label study of 5 years’ experience provides some reassurance,\n\n【8】\n\n【9】*   Korn S.\n*   Bourdin A.\n*   Chupp G.\n*   et al.\n\n【10】Integrated safety and efficacy among patients receiving benralizumab for up to 5 years.\n\n【11】_J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract._ 2021; 9 : 4381-4392.e4\n\n【12】*   Google Scholar\n\n【13】although this publication included only 48 participants who have safety data exceeding 5 years, a number that is far too small to be conclusive. Furthermore, there is lack of insight as to whether the licensed dose of benralizumab, which depletes blood eosinophils, also depletes tissue eosinophils—an important unknown, as the metabolic and immunoregulatory roles of eosinophils in human health are tissue related, and the extrapolation from blood eosinophil depletion to the suggestion that eosinophils play no role in human health overlooks this specificity.\n\n【14】Drs Gleich and Leiferman also quote the case report of the pregnancy outcome in a mother administered benralizumab during pregnancy.

The weight of evidence is thus very much with our concluding statement in the review article, and whereas some may still consider the jury out, it is pertinent to remember the medical dictum _primum non nocere_ , first do no harm, when a treatment that completely depletes eosinophils has no indirect or direct formal trial evidence of clinical advantage over strategies that reduce eosinophils but retain them within the normal range.\n\n【70】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【71】The authors would like to thank Peter Howarth (Respiratory Medical Franchise, GSK, United Kingdom), who was an author on the original state-of-the-art review, for his help in the drafting of this letter.

The sample included 2037 individuals aged 18 to 69 years: 488 African American women (24%), 686 white women (34%), 196 African American men (9%), and 667 white men (33%). Anthropometry included weight; hip circumference; waist circumference; waist-hip, waist-height, and weight-height ratios; body adiposity index; and body mass index. Body fat and percentage of fat were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and abdominal visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue were measured by computed tomography. Bivariate correlations, logistic regression models, and receiver operator characteristic curves were used, and analyses were stratified by sex and race.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In each sex-by-race group, all anthropometric measures were highly correlated with percentage of fat, fat mass, and subcutaneous adipose tissue and moderately correlated with visceral adipose tissue, with the exception of the waist-hip ratio. The odds of having an elevated cardiometabolic risk were increased more than 2-fold per SD increase for most anthropometric variables, and the areas under the curve for each anthropometric measure were significantly greater than 0.5.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Several common anthropometric measures were moderately to highly correlated with total body fat, abdominal fat, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in a biracial sample of women and men.

Furthermore, the need for identifying the highest-risk patients and avoiding, if possible, procedures that require contrast medium is perhaps the safest plan of care at this time. Ultrasonography, noncontrast computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or other evaluation techniques should be considered for these patients if the clinical question requiring imaging can be answered with less risk to the patient than that posed by contrast administration.\n\n【1】Bouzas-Mosquera et al point out that confounding variables may preclude judgment on the association of route of contrast administration and adverse clinical outcomes. Although we agree that any retrospective study could have unknown confounding factors or unidentified variables, we were aware of this potential in our study design and carefully matched and adjusted for multiple comorbidities known to be associated with CIN. The other studies cited by Bouzas-Mosquera et al were smaller and did not focus on definitive clinical end points.

In agreement with previous studies,  the authors found that CIN was associated with a higher adjusted mortality rate. The more surprising result is that this risk was found to be higher in patients in whom contrast medium was given intravenously than in those in whom it was administered intra-arterially. Because previous data suggest that contrast media may be more nephrotoxic when given intra-arterially,  it is not straightforward to ascribe such differences in mortality to the route of administration of contrast media alone.\n        \n    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n\n【14】Related Articles\n----------------\n\n【15】Hide Caption Download See figure in Article\n\n【16】Toggle Thumbstrip\n\n【17】*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download .PPT", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Meglumine antimoniate is used to treat an infection called leishmaniasis (Bay sore or chiclero ulcer, espundia, kala-azar or black sickness, Oriental sore, ulcera de Bejuco, uta), which is caused by protozoa (tiny, one-celled organisms).\n\n【5】Meglumine antimoniate should be administered by or under the supervision of your doctor.\n\n【6】Before Using\n------------\n\n【7】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【8】### Allergies\n\n【9】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【10】### Pediatric\n\n【11】Although there is no specific information comparing use of meglumine antimoniate in children with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.\n\n【12】### Geriatric\n\n【13】Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of meglumine antimoniate in the elderly with use in other age groups.\n\n【14】### Drug Interactions\n\n【15】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【16】### Other Interactions\n\n【17】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【18】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【19】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【20】*   Heart disease or\n*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease or\n*   Pancreatic disease—Meglumine antimoniate may make these conditions worse\n\n【21】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【22】To help clear up your infection completely, meglumine antimoniate is based on its amount of pentavalent antimony and must be given for the full time of treatment and on a regular schedule.\n\n【23】### Dosing\n\n【24】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【25】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【26】*   For injection dosage form:\n    *   For leishmaniasis (Bay sore or chiclero ulcer, espundia, kala-azar or black sickness, Oriental sore, ulcera de Bejuco, uta):\n        *   Adults and children—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The usual dose is 20 milligrams (mg) of pentavalent antimony in meglumine antimoniate per kilogram (kg) (9.09 mg per pound) of body weight per day injected into a muscle for twenty to twenty-eight days. This treatment may be repeated or continued as needed. If your infection is not severe and involves only your skin, then your doctor may decide to just inject the medicine into the skin lesion. The dose will also be determined by your doctor.\n\n【27】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【28】It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits. This is to help make sure that the infection is cleared up completely.\n\n【29】If your symptoms become worse, check with your doctor .\n\n【30】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【31】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【32】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【33】#### More common\n\n【34】1.  Fever\n2.  irregular heartbeat\n3.  nausea\n4.  pain in the upper abdominal area and back\n5.  vomiting\n\n【35】#### Rare\n\n【36】1.

Limiting your exposure to the sun and using sunscreen agents when in the sun may help prevent early wrinkling of the skin and skin cancer. There are two kinds of sunscreen agents: chemical and physical. Chemical sunscreen agents protect you from the sun by absorbing the ultraviolet (UV) and visible sun rays, while physical sunscreen agents reflect, scatter, absorb, or block these rays.\n\n【9】Sunscreen agents often contain more than one ingredient. For example, products may contain one ingredient that provides protection against the ultraviolet A (UVA) sun rays and another ingredient that protects you from the ultraviolet B (UVB) sun rays, which are more likely to cause sunburn than the UVA sun rays. Ideally, coverage should include protection against both UVA and UVB sun rays.\n\n【10】The sun protection factor (SPF) that you find on the label of these products tells you the minimum amount of UVB sunlight that is needed with that product to produce redness on sunscreen-protected skin as compared with unprotected skin. Sunscreen products with high SPFs will provide more protection against the sun.\n\n【11】Sunscreen products are available with and without your doctor's prescription. If you are using this medicine without a prescription, carefully read and follow any precautions on the label.\n\n【12】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【13】*   Stick\n*   Lotion\n*   Spray\n*   Cream\n*   Liquid\n*   Ointment\n*   Gel/Jelly\n\n【14】Before Using\n------------\n\n【15】### Allergies\n\n【16】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【17】### Pediatric\n\n【18】Infants under 6 months of age should be kept out of the sun. Sunscreen agents should not be used on infants under 6 months of age because of increased chance of side effects. Children 6 months of age and older should be kept out of the sun or have limited exposure to the sun. Sunscreen agents with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 should be applied during exposure to the sun. Lotion sunscreen products are preferred for use in children. Alcohol-based sunscreen products should be avoided because they can cause irritation.\n\n【19】### Geriatric\n\n【20】It is believed that the elderly, who spend little time in the sun and use sunscreen agents frequently, may be at risk for vitamin D deficiency (which may result in bone disease and fracture), although this has not been proven. To help you get enough vitamin D, it is recommended that you eat food rich in vitamin D, such as fortified milk or fatty fish. Your doctor may also advise you to take vitamin D supplements. Check with your doctor about this.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【23】### Other Interactions\n\n【24】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【25】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【26】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【27】*   Skin conditions or diseases, especially those caused or worsened by exposure to light—Worsening of skin condition may occur.\n\n【28】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【29】Sunscreen agents are for external use only. These products usually come with patient directions. Read them carefully before using any product.\n\n【30】In choosing the sunscreen product, you may consider the following:\n\n【31】*   Type of Activity—Take precautions when you are in places of higher elevations (mountains) or on reflective surfaces (concrete, sand, snow, or water), as these may increase the likelihood of sun damage to the skin. Use a sunscreen with ultraviolet A/ultraviolet B (UVA/UVB) coverage and with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher. Activities that make you sweat, such as outdoor jobs (gardeners, construction workers), outdoor sports (tennis) or exercise, prolonged sunbathing, or water sports such as swimming, water-skiing, or wind surfing, may result in the removal of the sunscreen agent from the skin. Use a water-resistant or waterproof sunscreen agent with SPF of 15 or more. When possible, also wear a hat, long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and UV-opaque sunglasses. Wearing UV-opaque sunglasses when you are in the sun is also necessary because the sun rays can cause cataracts.\n*   Age—Do not use sunscreen agents on infants younger than 6 months of age. For children 6 months of age and older, use a lotion form of sunscreen with broad spectrum and SPF of 15 or higher. Avoid using alcohol-based sunscreen products for this age group.\n*   Site of application—For the ear and nose, use a physical sunscreen agent. For the lips, use a gel-based lip sunscreen or lip balm.\n*   Skin condition—If your skin is dry, use a cream or lotion form of sunscreen agent. If your skin is oily, use an alcohol or gel-based sunscreen. Avoid using alcohol-based sunscreens on eczematous or inflamed skin.\n\n【32】The following are skin types (complexions) and the appropriate sunscreen agent that should be used:\n\n【33】*   Very fair; always burns easily; rarely tans—Use SPF 20 to 30.\n*   Fair; always burns easily; tans minimally—Use SPF 12 to 20.\n*   Light; burns moderately; tans gradually (light brown)—Use SPF 8 to 12.\n*   Medium; burns minimally; always tans well (moderate brown)—Use SPF 4 to 8.\n*   Dark; rarely burns; tans profusely (dark brown)—Use SPF 2 to 4.\n\n【34】Before every exposure to the sun, apply an appropriate sunscreen product that protects you against ultraviolet (UV) sun rays. For maximum sun protection, sunscreens should be applied uniformly and thickly to all exposed skin surfaces (including the lips, using lip sunscreen or lip balm). Sunscreen products containing aminobenzoic acid, lisadimate, padimate O, or roxadimate should be applied 1 to 2 hours before sun exposure. Other sunscreen products should be applied 30 minutes before sun exposure, unless otherwise directed by the package instructions. Lip sunscreens should be applied 45 to 60 minutes before sun exposure.\n\n【35】Because most sunscreens are easily removed from the skin, you should reapply these products liberally every 1 to 2 hours for adequate protection. You should reapply sunscreen especially after swimming or heavy perspiration. Lip sunscreens should be reapplied liberally at least once every hour while you are in the sun and also before and after swimming, after eating and drinking, and during other activities that remove it from the lips.\n\n【36】Keep sunscreen products (e.g., sprays) away from the eyes.\n\n【37】Some sunscreen agents contain alcohol and are flammable. Do not use near heat, near open flame, or while smoking.\n\n【38】Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average dose of sunscreen agents.\n\n【39】*   For topical dosage forms (cream, gel, lotion, lip balm, oil, spray, and stick):\n    *   For sunburn (prevention):\n        *   Adults, teenagers, and children 6 months of age and older—Apply liberally and evenly to exposed area(s) of skin (including the lips, using lip sunscreen or lip balm) before sun exposure. Reapply when needed.\n        *   Infants younger than 6 months of age—Use is not recommended.\n\n【40】### Storage\n\n【41】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【42】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【43】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【44】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【45】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【46】If rash or irritation develops, stop using the sunscreen and check with your doctor.\n\n【47】Sunscreen agents containing aminobenzoic acid, lisadimate, padimate O, or roxadimate may discolor and stain light-colored fabrics yellow.\n\n【48】In addition to using sunscreen agents, it is advisable to minimize exposure to the sun from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. (11 a.m. to 3 p.m. daylight savings time) when the sun is at its strongest. Take extra precautions also on cloudy or overcast days and around reflective surfaces such as concrete, sand, snow, or water, since these surfaces can reflect the sun's damaging rays. Wear protective clothing including a hat, long-sleeved shirt, and long pants. Sunglasses also should be worn to avoid sun damage to the eyes (cataract formation). Avoid sunlamps and tanning parlors because these can damage the skin and eyes as direct sunlight can.\n\n【49】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【50】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【51】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【52】#### Rare\n\n【53】1.  Acne\n2.  burning, itching, or stinging of the skin\n3.  early appearance of redness or swelling of the skin\n4.  late appearance of rash with or without weeping blisters that become crusted, especially in sun-exposed areas, and may extend to unexposed areas of the skin\n5.  pain in hairy areas\n6.  pus in the hair follicles\n\n【54】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【55】#### More common\n\n【56】1.  Drying or tightening of the skin\n\n【57】Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients. If you notice any other effects, check with your healthcare professional.\n\n【58】Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.\n\n【59】Portions of this document last updated: March 01, 2023\n\n【60】Original article: https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/sunscreen-agent-topical-application-route/description/drg-20070255", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

This medicine may cause blood problems, especially if it is taken for a long time.\n\n【50】If your symptoms do not improve within a few days, or if they become worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【51】Sulfapyridine may cause blood problems.

The greater the body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters), the greater the risk of comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, many cancers, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality. Class III (extreme) obesity, defined as a BMI of 40 kg/m  or greater, has also increased such that it now affects almost 1 in 20 Americans. The prevalence of extreme obesity is greater among women than among men and greater among blacks than among non-Hispanic whites or Hispanics. The effect of extreme obesity on mortality is greater among young than among older adults, greater among men than among women, and greater among whites than among blacks. The current permissive environment that promotes increased dietary energy intake and decreased energy expenditure through reduced daily physical activity coupled with genetic susceptibility is an important pathogenic factor. The number of bariatric surgical procedures performed annually is relatively small but increasing.\n\n【1】BMI ( body mass index ), BRFSS ( Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ), NHANES ( National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey )\n\n【2】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【3】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【4】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

Symptoms began with nausea and vomiting after eating a meal. The following morning she had dull right upper quadrant and periumbilical abdominal pain. Her nausea persisted, and she had multiple episodes of nonbloody nonbilious emesis. Later that day, she developed jaundice and had fever and chills, which prompted her presentation to the emergency department. She had been treated with nivolumab for melanoma, but this was discontinued 2 months before presentation owing to lack of insurance coverage. The patient also had a history of alcohol abuse disorder, drinking 2 to 3 vodka drinks per day. She took multiple over-the-counter vitamins and various supplements including more than 14 different vitamins and supplements such as iron, boron, picolinate, chromium, milk thistle, and turmeric, but was not taking any prescribed medications. She denied acetaminophen ingestion, or any other drugs.\n\n【1】In the emergency department, vital signs were stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate 80 beats/min, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, blood pressure 110/56 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed a well-nourished woman with jaundice in no acute distress, alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. She had notable scleral icterus. Abdominal examination was revealing of mild diffuse tenderness most profound in the right upper quadrant without distension, hepatosplenomegaly, or peritoneal signs, and no fluid shift wave. She had no asterixis or spider angiomata and no peripheral edema. Initial laboratory testing revealed (reference ranges provided parenthetically) an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 2800 U/L (7 to 45 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 2519 U/L (8 to 43 U/L), total bilirubin level 17.3 mg/dL (≤1.2 mg/dL), direct bilirubin level 9.5 mg/dL (0 to 0.3 mg/dL), and international normalized ratio (INR) 6.9 (0.9 to 1.1). The initial alkaline phosphatase level was 206 U/L (35 to 104 U/L). The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 569 U/L (122 to 222 U/L), lipase level 72 U/L (12 to 61 U/L), creatinine level 0.5 mg/dL (0.59 to 1.04 mg/dL), white blood cell count 7.7×10  /L ((3.4 to 9.6)×10  /L), hemoglobin level 12.3 g/dL (11.6 to 15 g/dL), and platelet level 131×10  /L ((157 to 371)×10  /L). The blood glucose level was 118 mg/dL (70 to 149 mg/dL). Right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed, which revealed a thickened gallbladder wall measuring 7 mm with a small amount of pericholecystic fluid and positive sonographic Murphy sign but no dilation of intrahepatic ducts or common bile duct. Ultrasound noted a small hemangioma of the right hepatic lobe. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast was also completed without evidence of hepatic nodules or abscesses.\n\n【2】*   1.\n    \n    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ etiology of this patient’s presentation?**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        Cholangitis\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        Metastatic disease\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        Alcoholic hepatitis\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        Ischemic hepatitis\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        Drug toxicity\n        \n    \n\n【3】Cholestasis is indicated by laboratory values with elevated direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. The differential diagnosis for cholestatic jaundice is broad, and initial evaluation should include a detailed history and physical examination followed by ultrasound or abdominal computed tomography imaging.\n\n【4】\n\n【5】*   Assy N.\n*   Jacob G.\n*   Spira G.\n*   Edoute Y.\n\n【6】Diagnostic approach to patients with cholestatic jaundice.\n\n【7】_World J Gastroenterol._ 1999; 5 : 252-262\n\n【8】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (21)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【9】Patient history is crucial and should include all medications and supplements, alcohol use, and travel history. Imaging is important to assess the presence of bile duct dilation. If bile ducts are dilated, proceeding with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography may be both diagnostic and therapeutic such as in cases of bile duct stones or strictures. Imaging is important for distinguishing between intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholestasis. Intrahepatic causes of cholestatic jaundice may include drug-induced liver injury (DILI), alcoholic hepatitis, viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, or hepatic infiltration such as sarcoidosis or lymphoma.\n\n【10】\n\n【11】*   Assy N.\n*   Jacob G.\n*   Spira G.\n*   Edoute Y.\n\n【12】Diagnostic approach to patients with cholestatic jaundice.\n\n【13】_World J Gastroenterol._ 1999; 5 : 252-262\n\n【14】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (21)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【15】Extrahepatic causes are anatomical obstruction and include gallstones, bile duct strictures, and neoplasms (most commonly pancreatic carcinoma).\n\n【16】This patient’s acute presentation with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice is concerning for an infectious etiology. This combination of signs and symptoms is well known as the Charcot triad. A positive Murphy sign is specific for acute cholecystitis, which is rarely associated with jaundice. The presence of jaundice and fever raises concern for ascending cholangitis. Acute ascending cholangitis typically occurs in the setting of bile duct obstruction with cholestasis and causes an obstructive jaundice. Cholangitis can be associated with high biliary pressure, which damages hepatocytes. Hepatocyte injury can cause abscess formation, but hepatocyte necrosis is rare and transaminases are rarely elevated beyond 2- to 3-fold. In this case however, imaging does not reveal duct dilation or lesions concerning for abscess, which makes ascending cholangitis less likely. Another diagnosis to consider is acalculous cholecystitis, which is gallbladder inflammation in the absence of gallstones. This most commonly occurs in critically ill patients with sepsis or prolonged absence of oral intake with reduced gallbladder contraction. This would be unlikely in this patient who was previously healthy.\n\n【17】Metastatic disease can also cause jaundice and should be considered in the setting of this patient’s untreated melanoma. Metastases, particularly melanoma, may lead to jaundice caused by infiltration of the hepatic parenchyma. However, in metastatic disease this is more commonly an insidious onset with painless jaundice. Fever, chills, and an acute presentation are less likely to be secondary to slow growing tumor burden.\n\n【18】Alcoholic hepatitis can be seen in patients who consume 2 or more alcoholic beverages per day. Acute alcoholic hepatitis often presents with jaundice, fever, tender hepatomegaly, elevated transaminase levels, and abnormal INR. Transaminase levels in alcoholic liver disease are typically disproportionately elevated with AST levels twice as much as ALT levels. Important to note is that liver enzyme elevations in alcoholic liver disease rarely exceed 300 U/L. Therefore, acute alcoholic hepatitis alone is unlikely to explain the significant degree of transaminase elevation seen in this patient.\n\n【19】This patient’s significant elevation in liver enzyme levels is most concerning for viral hepatitis, ischemic hepatitis, or medication/drug-related hepatitis. Ischemic hepatitis is caused by decreased hepatic perfusion from various etiologies including shock, profound hypoxia, or vaso-occlusion due to thrombus, embolism, or sickle cell crisis. Hepatocyte necrosis as a result of ischemia will typically lead to serum transaminase levels above 2000 U/L. This is unlikely in this patient given hemodynamic stability and other history. Acute viral hepatitis will have a similar presentation of symptoms and laboratory findings. Risk factors include travel to endemic areas, illicit drug use, or contact with contaminated food (such as shellfish) or water for hepatitis A. Infectious etiologies require laboratory diagnosis or exclusion. She does, however, take multiple medications and herbal supplements that increase her risk of DILI.\n\n【20】Over the next 20 hours after admission, the patient became obtunded and responsive to painful stimuli only.\n\n【21】*   2.\n    \n    **Which _one_ of the following criteria _best_ support this patient’s diagnosis of acute liver failure?**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        Acute onset of liver enzyme elevation\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        Severe liver injury, hepatic encephalopathy, and elevated INR\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        Alcohol use with liver injury but no evidence of chronic liver disease\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        Progressive jaundice\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        Acute decline in mental status\n        \n    \n\n【22】One of the diagnostic criteria for acute liver failure is the acute onset of liver enzyme elevation. As previously discussed, many situations can cause significant elevation in liver enzyme levels but may not always necessarily coincide with acute liver failure. The diagnostic criteria for acute liver failure includes acute liver injury, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy. As seen in this patient, progression to acute liver failure in less than 7 days is classified as hyperacute liver failure while progression in 7 to 21 days and in 22 to 26 days is classified as acute and subacute liver failure, respectively. Significant alcohol use is associated with both acute alcoholic hepatitis and chronic liver disease, but this history alone does not explain this patient’s diagnosis of acute liver failure. Worsening jaundice can be a sign of progressive liver failure. However, this is not specific and prehepatic causes such as hemolysis as well as posthepatic causes such as bile duct obstruction, which was excluded in this patient, can all present with worsening jaundice.\n\n【23】A decline in mental status can represent onset of hepatic encephalopathy, but this must be associated with additional manifestations of liver dysfunction to be concerning for acute liver failure. Hepatic encephalopathy can have a wide range of presentations and may manifest as a subtle decline in mental baseline with disorientation and confusion or as severe with somnolence or comatose state. The degree of encephalopathy present does not correlate with serum ammonia levels. The patient was diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy and met diagnostic criteria for acute liver failure.\n\n【24】*   3.\n    \n    **Which _one_ of the following is the _best_ next step in management?**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        Transfer to an intensive care unit for supportive measures\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        Initiate continuous renal replacement therapy\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        Initiate fluid resuscitation\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        Initiate symptomatic control with morphine\n        \n    \n\n【25】Acute liver failure is associated with rapid decompensation and high mortality. Therefore, it is crucial that these patients be managed in an intensive care unit at a hospital with liver transplant capabilities. These patients often become hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation and require vasopressor support. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is used most notably for acetaminophen toxicity, but it is also indicated in acute liver failure of uncertain etiology and has been found to improve survival when administered early in the course of disease.\n\n【26】\n\n【27】*   Lee W.M.\n*   Hynan L.S.\n*   Rossaro L.\n*   et al.\n\n【28】Acute Liver Failure Study Group  \nIntravenous _N_ \\-acetylcysteine improves transplant-free survival in early stage non-acetaminophen acute liver failure.\n\n【29】_Gastroenterology._ 2009; 137 ( Published correction appears in Gastroenterology. 2013;145(3):695 ) : 856-864\n\n【30】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (479)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【31】This patient does not currently have evidence of acute renal failure, and first-line treatment of hyperammonemia has not been trialed yet, such as lactulose, so continuous renal replacement therapy is not the best next step. Although patients with acute liver failure are at increased risk of infections because of a multitude of factors including an inability to protect their airway, bacterial translocation, and the need for invasive catheters, prophylactic antibiotics without localizing evidence of infection have not been found to improve survival.\n\n【32】\n\n【33】*   Rolando N.\n*   Gimson A.\n*   Wade J.\n*   Philpott-Howard J.\n*   Casewell M.\n*   Williams R.\n\n【34】Prospective controlled trial of selective parenteral and enteral antimicrobial regimen in fulminant liver failure.\n\n【35】_Hepatology._ 1993; 17 : 196-201\n\n【36】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (170)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【37】Patients with acute liver failure are at risk of becoming markedly volume overloaded, and fluid intake and output should be strictly monitored. Intravenous fluids, administered for hypotension or included with IV medications, should be given judiciously with prompt initiation of vasopressors if needed. Lastly, it is important to conscientiously avoid both hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic drugs. Acute liver failure leads to renal failure in 55% of patients, so medications such as morphine and ibuprofen should be avoided.\n\n【38】\n\n【39】*   Moore K.\n\n【40】Renal failure in acute liver failure.\n\n【41】_Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol._ 1999; 11 : 967-975\n\n【42】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (62)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【43】The patient was tachycardic but remained hemodynamically stable. Lactulose enemas were initiated, and she was transferred to the medical intensive care unit. Shortly afterward, she required intubation for airway protection.\n\n【44】Ultimately, treatment of acute liver failure is centered around expedient and appropriate identification of the underlying cause. Results of infectious work-up including testing for tick-borne diseases (Anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis and babesiosis), viral hepatitis testing, and human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and bacterial cultures were all negative. Liver biopsy was performed and revealed findings consistent with massive liver necrosis. She was diagnosed with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced hepatitis due to nivolumab, a programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) receptor inhibitor.\n\n【45】*   4.\n    \n    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ mechanism of this patient’s acute liver injury?**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        Cytokine storm causing shock liver\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        Immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity due to T-cell activation\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        Inhibited cytochrome P450 with increased susceptibility to alcohol toxicity\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        Adverse drug reaction inducing hepatocyte autophagy\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        Drug-induced liver injury due to direct hepatotoxicity\n        \n    \n\n【46】In acute liver failure, understanding the mechanism of injury is extremely important in determining an appropriate and expedited treatment plan. Immunotherapy (including PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitors such as nivolumab) can trigger immune responses other than the ideal treatment effect, but not via cytokine storm, leading to autoimmune complications such as colitis, thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency, and hepatitis.\n\n【47】\n\n【48】*   Ramos-Casals M.\n*   Brahmer J.R.\n*   Callahan M.K.\n*   et al.\n\n【49】Immune-related adverse events of checkpoint inhibitors.\n\n【50】_Nat Rev Dis Primers._ 2020; 6 : 38\n\n【51】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (329)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【52】Nivolumab inhibits the PD-1 checkpoint protein, which encourages a T-cell antitumor response. This T-cell activation can also lead to hepatocyte damage and hepatic necrosis. Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced hepatitis was favored over herbal supplement–induced hepatitis on the basis of her acute presentation and exposure history. She took multiple supplements frequently without recent changes, which would make acute liver failure unlikely to be caused by supplements she had previously tolerated well. Herbal supplement–induced liver injury can lead to progressive liver failure, but more commonly patients will recover after cessation of the supplement. This patient’s recent exposure to nivolumab with ongoing deterioration is more suggestive of ICI-induced hepatitis with a suspected mechanism of T-cell activation leading to progressive liver damage.\n\n【53】\n\n【54】*   Regev A.\n*   Avigan M.I.\n*   Kiazand A.\n*   et al.\n\n【55】Best practices for detection, assessment and management of suspected immune-mediated liver injury caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors during drug development.\n\n【56】_J Autoimmun._ 2020; 114 : 102514\n\n【57】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (21)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【58】Immune checkpoint inhibitors do not lead to hepatotoxicity through cytochrome P450 inhibition. Many other medications are known to affect P450 metabolism and should be thoroughly considered in this patient with known herbal supplement and alcohol use. Mechanisms of injury from hepatocyte autophagy and direct drug injury are also separate from the indirect hepatic injury caused by ICIs.\n\n【59】*   5.\n    \n    **Which _one_ of the following is the _best_ next step in management?**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        Plasmapheresis\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        Intravenous immunoglobulins\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        Corticosteroids\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        Colchicine\n        \n    \n\n【60】Plasmapheresis removes circulating autoantibodies. Plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulins are useful in certain autoimmune conditions, but are not recommended for ICI-induced hepatitis. The role of corticosteroids in acute liver failure is controversial. Stress doses may be indicated in cases of septic shock despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressors, but they have also been found to increase the risk of sepsis and thus are not typically recommended. However, in the case of ICI-induced hepatitis, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids should be initiated early. Specifically, when liver enzyme levels are more than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or bilirubin levels are more than 3 times the ULN, corticosteroids with a methylprednisolone IV or oral equivalent of 1 to 2 mg/kg per day should be given with permanent discontinuation of the checkpoint inhibitor.\n\n【61】\n\n【62】*   Nadeau B.A.\n*   Fecher L.A.\n*   Owens S.R.\n*   Razumilava N.\n\n【63】Liver toxicity with cancer checkpoint inhibitor therapy.\n\n【64】_Semin Liver Dis._ 2018; 38 : 366-378\n\n【65】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (30)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【66】If the patient does not respond to high-dose corticosteroids, then a second immunosuppressive agent (ie, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) may be required. Colchicine has significant anti-inflammatory effects, but would not be useful in managing this patient’s acute liver failure.\n\n【67】The patient was not deemed to be a liver transplant candidate owing to a history of metastatic melanoma. Her hospital course was further complicated by hemorrhagic shock after liver biopsy, and she was managed with massive transfusion protocol. Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated for volume removal. She was treated with high-dose steroids but remained persistently hypotensive, and volume removal was not possible. Ultimately, her family elected for compassionate extubation and transitioning her care to focus on her comfort only.\n\n【68】Discussion\n----------\n\n【69】When a patient has elevated liver enzyme levels, hepatic dysfunction, and coagulopathy in the absence of chronic liver disease, a diagnosis of acute liver failure must be considered. One must maintain a broad differential while quickly evaluating the potential cause, as treatment varies greatly depending on the underlying etiology and mortality is high. The approach to determining the most likely underlying etiology of acute liver failure should consider viral hepatitis, DILI, and acute ischemia. Once the commonest etiologies, that is, acetaminophen DILI and infections, are excluded, autoimmune conditions and other DILI should be considered.\n\n【70】\n\n【71】*   Thomas A.M.\n*   Lewis J.H.\n\n【72】Nonacetaminophen drug-induced acute liver failure.\n\n【73】_Clin Liver Dis._ 2018; 22 : 301-324\n\n【74】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (6)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【75】Ultimately, the diagnosis of DILI is challenging as extensive evaluation is required to make a diagnosis of exclusion and potential offending agents must all be discontinued, which makes confirming the diagnosis challenging as well. Liver biopsy may be pursued, but findings are often nonspecific with findings of active hepatitis, areas of necrosis, and occasionally portal fibrosis.\n\n【76】\n\n【77】*   De Martin E.\n*   Michot J.M.\n*   Papouin B.\n*   et al.\n\n【78】Characterization of liver injury induced by cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n\n【79】_J Hepatol._ 2018; 68 : 1181-1190\n\n【80】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (307)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【81】Treatment of acute liver failure includes supportive measures in an intensive care unit with liver transplant capabilities.

Grade 1 is defined as AST or ALT levels 3 times the ULN, with total bilirubin levels 1.5 times the ULN. In grade 1, alcohol cessation is recommended but treatment with immunotherapy can be continued if the patient remains asymptomatic. Grade 2 is AST or ALT levels 3 to 5 times the ULN, with total bilirubin levels 1.5 to 3 times the ULN. Grade 2 treatment consists of holding ICI and treating with oral prednisone. If transaminase levels decrease to grade 1 or less without requiring ongoing steroids, ICI may be reintroduced. Grade 3 is defined as AST or ALT levels greater than 5 times the ULN, with total bilirubin levels greater than 3 times the ULN. Grade 4 is defined as AST or ALT levels greater than 8 times the ULN. Treatment of grade 3 and grade 4 includes discontinuation of ICI, initiation of IV corticosteroids, and performing a liver biopsy. In patients with grade 3 and 4 toxicity who do not respond to steroids, a second immunosuppressive agent may be required and treatment with mycophenolate should be considered.\n\n【88】\n\n【89】*   Grover S.\n*   Rahma O.E.\n*   Hashemi N.\n*   Lim R.M.\n\n【90】Gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicities of checkpoint inhibitors: algorithms for management.\n\n【91】_Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book._ 2018; 38 : 13-19\n\n【92】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (64)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【93】Potential Competing Interests\n-----------------------------\n\n【94】The authors report no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

It was further shown that insulin action is lower (insulin resistance \\[IR\\]) in obesity and that IR in combination with insufficient insulin secretion is the underpinning of type 2 diabetes (T2D) stimulated momentous research on ways to enhance insulin action. The ramification of the discovery of insulin and its actions in different tissues stimulated not only technological advances in devices to monitor glucose and deliver insulin, but also novel oral and injectable therapies to treat T2D. Today we have unprecedented options in treating all patients with DM that substantially reduce the burden of debilitating diabetic complications. This is an appropriate time and context for an overview of the transformative impact of insulin discovery in treating a widely prevalent global disease that causes substantial morbidity and mortality around the world. In the next 18 months, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ will publish insightful reviews offering an opportunity for readers to look back and also look forward to the future of treatment, prevention, and potential cure of DM.\n\n【1】Development of Insulin Therapeutics\n-----------------------------------\n\n【2】Insulin extracts were used initially to treat patients with T1D and a single type of preparation was used and administered multiple times daily.\n\n【3】\n\n【4】*   Banting F.G.\n*   Best C.H.\n*   Collip J.B.\n*   Campbell W.R.\n*   Fletcher A.A.\n\n【5】Pancreatic extracts in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.\n\n【6】_Can Med Assoc J._ 1922; 12 : 141-146\n\n【7】*   Google Scholar\n\n【8】Realization of the need for higher throughput, the preparation of insulin extracts from porcine and beef pancreas, crystallization of insulin, and soluble insulin were developed by pharmaceutical organizations. After the early years of regular insulin therapy with each meal, the imperative need for a longer-acting insulin to achieve better glucose control in the post-absorptive period and overnight prompted the development of longer-acting insulin preparations. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of insulin was altered by the presence of other molecules in the solution starting with the development of longer-acting protamine zinc insulin in 1936\n\n【9】\n\n【10】*   Hagedorn H.C.\n\n【11】Protamine insulinate: (section of therapeutics and pharmacology).\n\n【12】_Proc R Soc Med._ 1937; 30 : 805-814\n\n【13】*   Google Scholar\n\n【14】\n\n【15】\n\n【16】*   Himsworth H.P.\n\n【17】Diabetes mellitus: its differentiation into insulin-sensitive and insulin-insensitive types.\n\n【18】_Lancet._ 1936; 227 : 127-130\n\n【19】*   Google Scholar\n\n【20】and neutral protamine Hagedorn or isophane insulin (in 1946) and Lente further advanced the goal to better glycemic control. The recognition that these and subsequent animal (porcine and beef) insulin preparations contained impurities that result in lipoatrophy and immunogenicity led to the development of more purified insulin preparations such as monocomponent insulins for clinical practice in the 1970s.\n\n【21】\n\n【22】*   Yue D.K.\n*   Turtle J.R.\n\n【23】Antigenicity of \"monocomponent\" pork insulin in diabetic subjects.\n\n【24】_Diabetes._ 1975; 24 : 625-632\n\n【25】*   Google Scholar\n\n【26】Insulin was the first molecule to be manufactured using recombinant insulin technology and was approved for human use in 1982.\n\n【27】\n\n【28】*   Goeddel D.V.\n*   Kleid D.G.\n*   Bolivar F.\n*   et al.\n\n【29】Expression in Escherichia coli of chemically synthesized genes for human insulin.\n\n【30】_Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A._ 1979; 76 : 106-110\n\n【31】*   Google Scholar\n\n【32】\n\n【33】\n\n【34】*   Clark A.J.\n*   Adeniyi-Jones R.O.\n*   Knight G.\n*   et al.\n\n【35】Biosynthetic human insulin in the treatment of diabetes.

Thus, analog insulin preparations continue to advance with the goal of acting rapidly after meal ingestion, extending the duration of basal insulin and resulting in stable biologic effects.\n\n【45】The Road to Closed Loop Therapy or the Artificial Pancreas\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】Monitoring glucose is a simple way to assess insulin action, and measurements of blood glucose several times per day are used routinely to guide insulin therapy. Basal-bolus insulin therapy, also called complex insulin therapy, using multiple daily insulin injections and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or conventional insulin therapy consisting of one to two insulin injections were tested in smaller studies followed by the landmark Diabetes Control and Complications trial\n\n【47】\n\n【48】*   Nathan D.M.\n*   Genuth S.\n*   Lachin J.\n*   et al.\n\n【49】The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n\n【50】_N Engl J Med._ 1993; 329 : 977-986\n\n【51】*   Google Scholar\n\n【52】which demonstrated the efficacy of improved glycemic control achieved with complex insulin therapy in preventing or delaying the progression of microvascular complications.\n\n【53】Hypoglycemia experienced by patients increased with complex insulin therapy and emphasized the need to monitor glucose continually. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in ambulatory settings started in 1998, and several more advanced generations of these devices have been developed since then. Control algorithms to modify insulin delivery based on the glucose signal from CGM have been developed, tested, and refined in the past 15 years.\n\n【54】\n\n【55】*   Kovatchev B.\n*   Cobelli C.\n\n【56】Glucose variability: timing, risk analysis, and relationship to hypoglycemia in diabetes.\n\n【57】_Diabetes Care._ 2016; 39 : 502-510\n\n【58】*   Google Scholar\n\n【59】Automated insulin delivery systems starting with low glucose insulin suspend systems have been approved since September 2013 with a hybrid closed loop (HCL) insulin system approved since September 2016 and in clinical practice since March 2017.\n\n【60】\n\n【61】*   Bergenstal R.M.\n*   Garg S.\n*   Weinzimer S.A.\n*   et al.\n\n【62】Safety of a hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system in patients with type 1 diabetes.\n\n【63】_JAMA._ 2016; 316 : 1407-1408\n\n【64】*   Google Scholar\n\n【65】More systems have been tested and are expected to become available over the next few years.\n\n【66】\n\n【67】*   Brown S.A.\n*   Kovatchev B.P.\n*   Raghinaru D.\n*   et al.\n\n【68】Six-month randomized, multicenter trial of closed-loop control in type 1 diabetes.\n\n【69】_N Engl J Med._ 2019; 381 : 1707-1717\n\n【70】*   Google Scholar\n\n【71】With the maturation of CGM, glucose control outcomes based on metrics developed for CGM are being reported and time in optimal range (TIR) of 70 to 180 mg/dL and time less than 70 mg/dL have emerged as key outcomes in clinical trials and an important outcome in clinical practice.\n\n【72】\n\n【73】*   Danne T.\n*   Nimri R.\n*   Battelino T.\n*   et al.\n\n【74】International consensus on use of continuous glucose monitoring.\n\n【75】_Diabetes Care._ 2017; 40 : 1631-1640\n\n【76】*   Google Scholar\n\n【77】\n\n【78】\n\n【79】*   Battelino T.\n*   Danne T.\n*   Bergenstal R.M.\n*   et al.\n\n【80】Clinical targets for continuous glucose monitoring data interpretation: recommendations from the International Consensus on Time in Range.\n\n【81】_Diabetes Care._ 2019; 42 : 1593-1603\n\n【82】*   Google Scholar\n\n【83】HCL achieves greater than 70% TIR and less than 4% time less than 70 mg/dL compared with about 60% TIR and greater than 4% time less than 70 mg/dL in patients on sensor-augmented insulin pump or multiple daily insulin or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy. However, time greater than 180 mg/dL continues to be a challenge everyday, even with HCL, occurring mostly in the postprandial period, and hypoglycemia continues to be experienced by patients with T1D serving as a barrier to regular health-promoting exercise. This has stimulated the development of non-glucose signals such as physical activity measurement for incorporation into automated insulin delivery and also the development of dual hormone insulin and glucagon artificial pancreas to prevent hypoglycemia and promote exercise.\n\n【84】Transplantation Therapy for Diabetes\n------------------------------------\n\n【85】Solid organ transplantation has transformed management of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in diabetes. Kidney transplantation developed in the 1950s changed the natural history of patients with both type 1 and type 2 DM with ESRD. Subsequently, technical aspects of pancreas transplantation were addressed by the 1980s and simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation has been performed mainly for patients who have T1D with ESRD since the 1980s and is an extremely transformational therapy for such patients. The importance of kidney transplantation being performed before initiating dialysis has been recognized with an increasing number of pre-emptive transplantations.\n\n【86】\n\n【87】*   Redfield R.R.\n*   Scalea J.R.\n*   Odorico J.S.\n\n【88】2015\\.

Pancreas transplantation alone has been available for such patients over the past 30 years, and islet transplantation alone (ITA) has been evaluated in prospective studies. However, ITA has many factors limiting application in the United States; thus, a pathway to clinical practice application of the therapy remains to be established as a standard of care treatment.\n\n【92】\n\n【93】*   Harlan D.M.\n\n【94】Islet transplantation for hypoglycemia unawareness/severe hypoglycemia: caveat emptor.\n\n【95】_Diabetes Care._ 2016; 39 : 1072-1074\n\n【96】*   Google Scholar\n\n【97】ITA is being pursued in certain regions of the world with Canada and France providing the best such examples to date. A few centers in the world continue to pursue islet xenotransplantation with wild-type pigs or genetically manipulated pigs serving as organ donors. Stem cell–based islet products have been pursued. The ViaCyte studies use an encapsulated pancreatic endocrine precursor cell product and phase 1/2 trials have not shown function of this product in patients with T1D in good health. A second-generation product with encapsulation but blood vessel formation from the embryonic stem cell product necessitates immunosuppressant use and is being pursued at multiple US and Canadian sites at present in patients with T1D and hypoglycemia unawareness.\n\n【98】\n\n【99】A Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy Study of VC-0 Combination Product in Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypoglycemia Unawareness (2017).\n\n【100】https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03163511?term=viacyte&draw=1&rank=1\n\n【101】*   Google Scholar\n\n【102】The development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology raised hopes of autologous stem cell–based therapy, but this technology is labor intensive, time consuming, inefficient, and expensive at this time.

The retinopathy endpoint was a 2-step progression based on fundus photographs. The DCCT showed that tight glucose control decreased the progression of retinopathy but also increased the risk of mild and severe hypoglycemia. A small subset of patients experienced much more severe hypoglycemia compared with others in the experimental cohort. Laser photocoagulation to treat proliferative retinopathy decreased the risk of severe vision loss but also increased the risk of isolated defects in the field of vision. The development of angiogenesis inhibitors has transformed management of diabetic retinopathy. Subjects enrolled in the DCCT were offered enrollment in the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study and more than 80% are being followed. Tight glucose control during the DCCT has been shown to decrease the risk of target organ complications including microvascular complications and major acute cardiovascular events (MACE).\n\n【110】Insulin Resistance\n------------------\n\n【111】Harold Himsworth proposed a classification of diabetes into two types\n\n【112】\n\n【113】*   Himsworth H.P.\n\n【114】Diabetes mellitus: its differentiation into insulin-sensitive and insulin-insensitive types.\n\n【115】_Lancet._ 1936; 227 : 127-130\n\n【116】*   Google Scholar\n\n【117】: insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant.

Results of gastric bypass surgery that significantly improves insulin action clearly supports the notion that in most cases T2D and related metabolic problems can be ameliorated with significant intentional weight loss. It is likely that mitigation of IR in multiple organs by interventions is a logical approach in preventing T2D and its complications.\n\n【130】Pharmacotherapy for T2D and Impact on Target Organ Complications\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【131】In the 1970s, therapeutic trials were started to show the impact on diabetes-associated complications. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study included testing of blood pressure and glucose control and showed an impact on microvascular complications. There was no significant impact on macrovascular complications with glycemic control, but blood pressure control was shown to play a critical role in improving morbidity. The results of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes trial, which unexpectedly increased mortality in the intensive therapy group, led to a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendation that trials of new antihyerglycemic agents include assessment of cardiovascular safety.\n\n【132】\n\n【133】*   Hiatt W.R.\n*   Kaul S.\n*   Smith R.J.\n\n【134】The cardiovascular safety of diabetes drugs—insights from the rosiglitazone experience.\n\n【135】_N Engl J Med._ 2013; 369 : 1285-1287\n\n【136】*   Google Scholar\n\n【137】The past 15 years have seen the testing and publication of results from trials designed to test the safety of a therapeutic approach including impact on cardiovascular and renal endpoints. Currently, several classes of agents have been approved for diabetes management, and certain classes include FDA labels for impact on diabetes-associated complications.

New classes of drugs, particularly GLP1 Receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and SGLT2 inhibitors, have been shown to impact target organ complications in T2D\n\n【143】Recognition of the incretin effect led to the development of GLP-1 RAs that use this effect to improve glycemic control and decrease weight in overweight and obese patients and T2D. Multiple GLP-1 RA and SGLT2 inhibitors have been tested in large multinational trials. Some GLP-1 RAs decrease the risk of MACE. Agents which act on the GLP1 system may belong to the exendin category or the GLP1 category.\n\n【144】\n\n【145】*   Mafham M.\n*   Preiss D.\n\n【146】HARMONY or discord in cardiovascular outcome trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists?.\n\n【147】_Lancet._ 2018; 392 : 1489-1490\n\n【148】*   Google Scholar\n\n【149】The latter may or may not be associated with albumin to prolong action. Currently, it appears that GLP1 agonists decrease the risk of MACE, with the main impact on cardiovascular events, and they may have some impact on renal outcomes, an effect that is not seen with exendin category agents. SGLT2 inhibitors decrease the risk of MACE, heart failure, and renal endpoints.\n\n【150】\n\n【151】*   Ingelfinger J.R.\n*   Rosen C.J.\n\n【152】Clinical credence — SGLT2 inhibitors, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease.\n\n【153】_N Engl J Med._ 2019; 380 : 2371-2373\n\n【154】*   Google Scholar\n\n【155】### Somewhat Unexpected Adverse Events With Antihyperglycemic Therapies\n\n【156】There are also less-expected adverse events that have emerged from large clinical trials in both T1D and T2D. Rapid improvement in glucose control has been shown in the DCCT and the Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-Term Outcomes With Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN6) to be associated with an increased risk of macular edema. An improvement in hemoglobin (A1c) of greater than 2% within 3 months has been identified as a risk factor for macular edema.\n\n【157】\n\n【158】*   Marso S.P.\n*   Bain S.C.\n*   Consoli A.\n*   et al.\n\n【159】Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n【160】_N Engl J Med._ 2016; 375 : 1834-1844\n\n【161】*   Google Scholar\n\n【162】A1c reduction of greater than 3% to 5% in 3 months has also been shown to be associated with neuropathy in cohort studies, and based on extensive clinical practice, this seems to be real.\n\n【163】\n\n【164】*   Gibbons C.H.\n*   Freeman R.\n\n【165】Treatment-induced neuropathy of diabetes: an acute, iatrogenic complication of diabetes.\n\n【166】_Brain._ 2015; 138 : 43-52\n\n【167】*   Google Scholar\n\n【168】Fournier gangrene, a severe cellulitis affecting the perineum, has been reported with SGLT2 inhibitors in case reports and adverse event reporting to the FDA. The a priori identification of patients at risk for these adverse events is important for future clinical practice and research. With the ability to improve glucose control and impact target organ complications, more thought must be directed towards improving A1c without increasing adverse events associated with rapid improvement. Research is needed to study whether clinical phenotype, pharmacogenomics, or environmental factors can predict the complications related to effective pharmacotherapeutic agents.\n\n【169】These large multinational trials have also clarified concerns raised about possible adverse events associated with these agents. The risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic neoplasia with GLP-1 agonists has been studied extensively. Although the risk is not increased with these agents, there is agreement that these agents are best not prescribed in individuals with past history of pancreatitis and pancreas neoplasia. Increased risk of lower extremity amputations associated with canagliflozin was a concern with early reports but this has since been clarified as not an issue.\n\n【170】\n\n【171】American Diabetes Association  \nPharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of medical care in diabetes—2019.\n\n【172】_Diabetes Care._ 2019; 42 : S90-S102\n\n【173】*   Google Scholar\n\n【174】### Need to Consider Normal Physiologic Insulin Milieu in Diabetic Patients\n\n【175】Insulin treatment by peripheral insulin administration results in alteration of normal insulin milieu. In people without diabetes, more than 50% of the insulin secreted from the pancreas is extracted by the liver, causing a liver:periphery ratio of insulin of 2:1.

An increasing number of monogenic disorders associated with diabetes have been described and may involve defects in genes associated with glucose metabolism referred to as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes or those associated with lipid metabolism that result in lipodystrophy and insulin resistant diabetes.\n\n【210】\n\n【211】*   Hattersley A.T.\n*   Patel K.A.\n\n【212】Precision diabetes: learning from monogenic diabetes.\n\n【213】_Diabetologia._ 2017; 60 : 769-777\n\n【214】*   Google Scholar\n\n【215】Establishing the correct diagnosis of MODY helps to individualize therapy for the disorder.

However, these studies have shown modest C-peptide preservation when used in T1D early after clinical diagnosis.

A phase 3 trial of this approach is currently being conducted.\n\n【230】Cost of Insulin and Other Therapies in DM\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【231】The cost of many medications has increased in the past 2 decades. However, somewhat unexpected and frustrating has been the increase in the cost of insulin, even after expiration of the patent and the availability of generic preparations. This issue appears complex and concern has been expressed by various subspecialty medical organizations. The American Diabetes Association developed a multidisciplinary task force called the Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group to evaluate the extent of this issue and propose solutions. Much work lies ahead to address this important issue if patients are to experience the benefits of clinical evidence generated.\n\n【232】\n\n【233】*   Cefalu W.T.\n*   Dawes D.E.\n*   Gavlak G.\n*   et al.\n\n【234】Erratum.

There is an imperative need to address several gaps in our understanding of diabetes. Although glucose is the seminal biomarker of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance, insulin effect on a multitude of other areas, especially energy metabolism, oxidative stress, fatty acid, and protein metabolism remains to be fully understood. Advances in these areas potentially will have substantial impact in preventing diabetes and its debilitating complications. Over the next 18 months, several of the milestones described will be addressed in insightful, clinically relevant, reviews in _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ by experts in each area.\n\n【240】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【241】The authors thank Dr Ravinder Jeet Kaur and Ms Melissa Aakre for their assistance.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Michel performed the work that was the basis for the 3 scientists’ joint research. They wanted to determine the 3-dimensional structure of the photosynthetic reaction center, a 4-protein complex, that is crucial to the process of photosynthesis in certain bacteria. The bacterial species that Michel selected to investigate was _Rhodopseudomonas viridis_ . After 4 years (1978 to 1982) of experimentation, he was able to reduce the protein complex to a pure crystalline form, thus making it possible to determine the protein structure atom-by-atom with x-ray diffraction technique. For 2 years (1982 to 1984), the 3 scientists mapped the protein complex structure using x-ray crystallography. Deisenhofer received the Nobel Prize “for his part in work that revealed the 3-dimensional structure of closely linked proteins that are essential to photosynthesis,” and Huber received his share for using x-ray crystallography to elucidate the positions of the approximately 10,000 atoms in the protein complex. This work was significant not only to the understanding of photosynthesis but also for its applications; membrane-bound proteins are important in many disease states.\n\n【2】Michel was born on July 18, 1948, in Ludwigsburg in southwestern Germany, near Stuttgart. He studied biochemistry at the University of Tübingen and received a PhD degree in chemistry from the University of Würzburg in 1977. After receiving his doctorate, Michel remained at the University of Würzburg for 2 years (1977 to 1979) as a researcher. He left Würzburg in 1979 to become a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry at Martinsried (Germany), where he did his Nobel Prize–winning work. He worked at Martinsried until 1987, when he became director of the staff of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysics in Frankfurt am Main.\n\n【3】In addition to the Nobel Prize, Michel has received the Biophysics Prize of the American Physics Society (1986), the Otto Klung Prize for Chemistry (1986), and the Otto Bayer Prize (1988). He was honored on 2 stamps issued in 1995, one by Grenada and the other by Guyana.\n\n【4】Article info\n------------\n\n【5】### Identification\n\n【6】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/76.6.570\n\n【7】### Copyright\n\n【8】© 2001 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Supplements provided consisted of full-dose almonds (73±5 g/d), half-dose almonds (38±3 g/d) plus half-dose muffins, and full-dose muffins (control). Energy and macronutrients, including individual fatty acids, were measured in the dietary supplements and fecal samples using gas chromatography and Association of Official Analytical Chemists methods. Serum was measured for lipids and fatty acids. Bioaccessibility of energy and macronutrients from almond consumption was assessed from dietary intake (7-day food records) and fecal output.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Almond-related energy bioaccessibility was 78.5%±3.1%, with an average energy loss of 21.2%±3.1% (40.6 kcal/d in the full-dose almond phase). Bioaccessibility of energy and fat from the diet as a whole was significantly less with almond consumption (in both half- and full-dose phases) compared with the control. Bioaccessibility of fat was significantly different between treatment phases ( _P_ <.001) and on average lower by 5.1% and 6.3% in the half- and full-dose almond phases, respectively, compared with the control phase. Energy bioaccessibility was significantly different between the treatment phases ( _P_ \\=.02), decreasing by approximately 2% with the inclusion of the full dose of almonds compared with the control.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Energy content of almonds may not be as bioaccessible in individuals with hyperlipidemia as predicted by Atwater factors, as suggested by the increased fat excretion with almond intake compared with the control.\n\n【9】### Trial Registration\n\n【10】ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00507520.\n\n【11】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【12】BMI ( body mass index ), FAME ( fatty acid methyl ester ), LDL-C ( low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), NCEP ( National Cholesterol Education Program )\n\n【13】Almonds, a nutrient-dense tree nut, gained the public’s attention because of their serum lipid–lowering effects\n\n【14】\n\n【15】*   Spiller G.A.\n*   Jenkins D.A.\n*   Bosello O.\n*   Gates J.E.\n*   Cragen L.N.\n*   Bruce B.\n\n【16】Nuts and plasma lipids: an almond-based diet lowers LDL-C while preserving HDL-C.\n\n【17】_J Am Coll Nutr._ 1998; 17 : 285-290\n\n【18】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (159)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【19】\n\n【20】\n\n【21】*   Jenkins D.J.\n*   Kendall C.W.\n*   Marchie A.\n*   et al.\n\n【22】Dose response of almonds on coronary heart disease risk factors: blood lipids, oxidized low-density lipoproteins, lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, and pulmonary nitric oxide: a randomized, controlled, crossover trial.\n\n【23】_Circulation._ 2002; 106 : 1327-1332\n\n【24】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (339)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【25】and additionally for their cardiometabolic health benefits.\n\n【26】\n\n【27】*   Becerra-Tomas N.\n*   Paz-Graniel I.\n*   Kendall C.W.C.\n*   et al.\n\n【28】Nut consumption and incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular disease mortality: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.\n\n【29】_Nutr Rev._ 2019; 77 : 691-709\n\n【30】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (88)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【31】\n\n【32】\n\n【33】*   Mayhew A.J.\n*   de Souza R.J.\n*   Meyre D.\n*   Anand S.S.\n*   Mente A.\n\n【34】A systematic review and meta-analysis of nut consumption and incident risk of CVD and all-cause mortality.\n\n【35】_Br J Nutr._ 2016; 115 : 212-225\n\n【36】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (110)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【37】\n\n【38】\n\n【39】*   Blanco Mejia S.\n*   Kendall C.W.\n*   Viguiliouk E.\n*   et al.\n\n【40】Effect of tree nuts on metabolic syndrome criteria: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.\n\n【41】_BMJ Open._ 2014; 4 : e004660\n\n【42】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (108)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【43】\n\n【44】\n\n【45】*   Viguiliouk E.\n*   Kendall C.W.\n*   Blanco Mejia S.\n*   et al.\n\n【46】Effect of tree nuts on glycemic control in diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled dietary trials \\[erratum appears in _PLoS One_ . 2014;9(9):e109224\\].\n\n【47】_PloS One._ 2014; 9 : e103376\n\n【48】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (123)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【49】Despite that almonds are a plant-based protein source providing vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytonutrients, they are also viewed as an energy-dense food choice owing to their high-fat content.

The Figure shows the design of the study. After an overnight fast (12-14 hours), anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and blood samples were obtained at randomization and at the end of each phase. At week 4 of each phase, 7-day weighed diet records, questionnaires on satiety and bowel movements, and fecal samples were collected. Fecal samples consisted of 3-day fecal collections made on an outpatient basis. Participants were provided with under-seat lavatory frames lined with plastic bags to be removed after use. Feces were weighed and stored at −20°C before mixing, homogenizing, and freeze-drying. Given the nature of the foods provided, participants and dietitians providing dietary counseling could not be blinded. However, investigators involved in the preparation of databases and laboratory determinations were blinded with respect to treatment sequence.\n\n【138】Figure Schematic of the randomized, controlled, crossover study design.

The study design consisted of 3 phases and 3 treatments; each participant consumed all 3 treatments in different phases, with the treatment order depending on the randomization. Treatments consisted of isoenergetic intake of a control, half-dose almonds, or full-dose almonds per day, which were consumed as part of a National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step 2 background diet.\n\n【139】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【140】### Study Participants\n\n【141】Men and postmenopausal women with hyperlipidemia but otherwise healthy were recruited by newspaper advertisement and from patients visiting the Risk Factor Modification Centre of St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Inclusion criteria included low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration of more than 4.1 mmol/L at recruitment. People were excluded if they were taking lipid-lowering medications, exhibited clinical or biochemical evidence of diabetes or renal or hepatic disease, had a body mass index (BMI) above 32 kg/m  , used antibiotics within 3 months of the study start date, used hormone replacement therapy, smoked or consumed significant amounts of alcohol (>1 drink/d), or had a triglyceride level above 4.0 mmol/L. Participants were randomized by use of a computer number generator and received treatment allocation by sealed opaque envelopes.\n\n【142】### Study Diets\n\n【143】During all phases, participants were counseled on strategies to facilitate weight maintenance and followed their self-selected, low-fat therapeutic diets (based on National Cholesterol Education Program \\[NCEP\\] Step 2 dietary guideline recommendations) into which they incorporated the provided study supplements. Nuts, soy, and dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, or herbal remedies) were excluded in the background diet during all phases of the study. Raw almonds and the control muffins were supplied, with the control supplement being matched to the calculated energy content of the almond supplement interventions. The 3 isoenergetic dietary supplements provided 22.2% of daily energy.

The FAMEs were quantified on a Varian 430-GC gas chromatograph equipped with a Varian FactorFour capillary column (VF-23 ms; 30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter × 0.25 μm film thickness) and a flame ionization detector. Samples were injected in splitless mode. The injector and detector ports were set at 250°C. The FAMEs were eluted using a temperature program set initially at 50°C for 2 minutes, increased at 20°C per minute and held at 170°C for 1 minute, then at 3°C per minute and held at 212°C for 5 minutes to complete the run at 28 minutes. The carrier gas was helium, set to a constant flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Peaks were identified by retention times of FAME standards (Nu-Chek-Prep). Fatty acid concentrations were calculated by proportional comparison of gas chromatography peak areas with that of the heptadecanoic acid internal standard.\n\n【192】A 6-point Likert scale was used to measure ease of bowel movements (from easy to pass to difficult to pass), stool consistency (watery to very hard), flatus (none to severe), abdominal pain (none to severe), and bloating (none to severe).

Supplemental Table 3 (available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ) shows the baseline characteristics of the 22 participants (12 men and 10 women) who completed the study, which comprised individuals aged 64.5±9.0 years with body weight of 72.0±13.2 kg, BMI of 25.7±3.2 kg/m  , and LDL-C concentration of 4.5±0.8 mmol/L. There were no significant differences in body weight or other measured indicators of adiposity between the phases.\n\n【221】Table 1 presents the dietary intake, showing that the incorporation of the study supplements into an NCEP Step 2 dietary pattern resulted in higher fat (specifically monounsaturated fatty acids, notably oleic acid) and lower carbohydrate intakes during the almond phases compared with the control phase. Energy, protein, fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acid, and saturated fatty acid intakes remained comparable between the 3 phases. Aside from oleic acid intake, which was significantly increased with almond consumption ( _P_ <.001), there were no differences in the other dietary fatty acids analyzed. Adherence to study supplement intake was more than 90% across all treatments.\n\n【222】Table 1 Dietary Intake and Satiety Evaluation (n=22)\n\n|  | Control | Half-dose almonds | Full-dose almonds | _P_ value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Energy (kJ/d) | 8711.1 (460.2) | 8470.5 (415.9) | 8886.8 (485.3) | .20 |\n| Energy (kcal/d) | 2082.0 (110.0) | 2024.5 (99.4) | 2124.0 (116.0) | .20 |\n| Carbohydrate (%) | 58.4 (1.2) a | 53.6 (1.1) b | 50.2 (1.5) c | <.001 |\n| Total fiber (g/d) | 32.3 (2.1) | 32.9 (2.0) | 34.4 (2.0) | .11 |\n| Protein (%) | 17.1 (0.5) | 17.9 (0.5) | 17.5 (0.5) | .07 |\n| Fat (%) | 26.0 (0.9) a | 30.1 (1.0) b | 33.6 (1.1) c | <.001 |\n| Total fat (g/d) | 60.3 (3.8) a | 67.4 (3.6) b | 79.3 (5.2) b | <.001 |\n| SFA (g/d) | 15.9 (1.4) | 15.0 (1.16) | 15.3 (1.4) | .50 |\n| Lauric acid (g/d) | 0.31 (0.08) | 0.23 (0.03) | 0.26 (0.04) | .67 |\n| Myristic acid (g/d) | 1.05 (0.15) | 0.99 (0.11) | 0.98 (0.12) | .74 |\n| Palmitic acid (g/d) | 9.18 (0.79) | 8.66 (0.59) | 9.03 (0.80) | .39 |\n| Stearic acid (g/d) | 3.43 (0.37) | 3.14 (0.27) | 3.46 (0.36) | .23 |\n| MUFA (g/d) | 20.1 (1.5) a | 29.2 (1.6) b | 39.2 (2.6) c | <.001 |\n| Palmitoleic acid (g/d) | 0.75 (0.08) | 0.82 (0.08) | 0.83 (0.07) | .06 |\n| Oleic acid (g/d) | 17.9 (1.4) a | 26.8 (1.5) b | 36.7 (2.5) c | <.001 |\n| PUFA (g/d) | 18.8 (0.9) | 17.7 (0.8) | 18.7 (1.2) | .18 |\n| Omega-3 (g/d) | 1.64 (0.15) | 1.52 (0.22) | 1.70 (0.27) | .49 |\n| α-Linolenic acid (g/d) | 1.17 (0.14) | 0.93 (0.11) | 1.20 (0.25) | .26 |\n| Omega-6 (g/d) | 16.7 (0.8) | 15.7 (0.6) | 16.5 (1.0) | .28 |\n| Linoleic acid (g/d) | 15.8 (0.82) | 14.8 (0.6) | 15.4 (0.9) | .29 |\n| Ash (mg/d) | 21.0 (1.2) a | 18.9 (1.0) b | 18.4 (1.1) b | .002 |\n| Almonds (g/d) | 0.0 (0.0) | 38.3 (2.5) | 72.7 (4.6) | <.001 |\n| Satiety | 1 (0-2) | 1 (0-2) | 1 (0-2) | .86 |\n\n【224】MUFA, monounsaturated fatty acid; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; SFA, saturated fatty acid.\n\n【225】Data are presented as mean (standard error of the mean), except for satiety, for which data are presented as median (range).\n\n【226】Values in the same row with different superscript letters are significantly different.\n\n【227】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【228】Table 2 shows that the number of bowel movements per day did not significantly differ between the phases; however, fecal composition did differ with almond consumption.

The bioaccessibility of fat was significantly different between treatment phases ( _P_ <.001) and on average lower by 5.1% and 6.3% in the half- and full-dose almond phases, respectively, compared with the control phase. The bioaccessibility of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids was also significantly lower in the half- and full-dose almond phases compared with the control phase ( _P_ <.05). Of the saturated fatty acids, there were greater amounts of stearic acid (18:0) in the fecal matter during the almond phases compared with the control, despite that the quantity consumed was comparable across all 3 phases, resulting in less bioaccessibility of this saturated fatty acid with almond consumption. Oleic acid (18:1 _n_ \\-9) was consumed in higher quantities during the almond phases; still, bioaccessibility for this monounsaturated fatty acid was less during the almond phases compared with the control phase. Whereas intake of the polyunsaturated linoleic acid (18:2 _n_ \\-6) was equivalent across all 3 phases, the fecal composition during the almond phases was higher in linoleic acid, leading to less bioaccessibility. In assessing fat specifically consumed from almonds, bioaccessibility was 78.5%±3.1%, and the average energy loss from almond fat was 21.2%±3.1% (40.6 kcal/d).\n\n【236】Table 3 Bioaccessibility of Energy and Macronutrients for the Diet as a Whole (n=22)\n\n|  | Control | Half-dose almonds | Full-dose almonds | _P_ value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Energy (%) | 92.3 (0.8) a | 91.0 (0.5) b | 90.1 (0.6) b | .02 |\n| Total carbohydrate (%) | 92.9 (0.8) | 94.2 (0.3) | 93.6 (0.6) | .19 |\n| Protein (%) | 84.1 (1.8) | 86.0 (0.9) | 85.8 (1.0) | .41 |\n| Fat (%) | 89.5 (2.0) a | 84.0 (1.3) b | 83.2 (1.2) b | .001 |\n| Fatty acids (%) |  |  |  |  |\n| SFA | 93.5 (0.7) a | 89.0 (1.5) b | 88.5 (1.4) b | .007 |\n| Lauric acid | 94.3 (1.7) | 95.5 (2.0) | 89.6 (5.7) | .48 |\n| Myristic acid | 98.8 (0.4) | 98.9 (0.5) | 97.9 (1.1) | .58 |\n| Palmitic acid | 99.7 (0.1) | 99.8 (0.1) | 99.7 (0.1) | .61 |\n| Stearic acid | 99.8 (0.1) a | 99.2 (0.2) b | 98.8 (0.4) b | .003 |\n| MUFA | 96.6 (0.5) a | 88.2 (1.2) b | 88.2 (1.6) b | .001 |\n| Palmitoleic acid | 91.6 (2.0) a | 68.0 (8.3) b | 54.8 (12.6) b | .003 |\n| Oleic acid | 96.5 (0.6) a | 88.1 (1.3) a,b | 88.5 (1.6) b | <.001 |\n| PUFA | 97.2 (0.4) a | 93.7 (0.8) b | 92.0 (1.2) b | .006 |\n| Omega-3 | 96.2 (1.4) | 94.5 (2.3) | 94.5 (2.2) | .57 |\n| α-Linolenic acid (ALA) | 94.3 (2.3) | 89.5 (4.5) | 93.3 (2.5) | .36 |\n| Omega-6 | 98.2 (0.4) a | 96.4 (0.9) a,b | 94.4 (1.5) b | .003 |\n| Linoleic acid | 97.1 (0.5) a | 93.2 (0.8) b | 91.1 (1.3) b | <.001 |\n| Ash (%) | 63.3 (3.9) | 65.3 (2.0) | 64.4 (2.3) | .89 |\n\n【238】MUFA, monounsaturated fatty acid; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; SFA, saturated fatty acid.\n\n【239】Data are presented as mean (standard error of the mean).\n\n【240】Values in the same row with different superscript letters are significantly different.\n\n【241】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【242】Energy bioaccessibility was significantly different between the treatment phases ( _P_ \\=.019), decreasing by approximately 2% with the inclusion of the full dose of almonds compared with the control. Energy bioaccessibility was positively associated with body fat percentage ( _r_ \\=0.288; _P_ \\=.02), although almond consumption was not correlated with body weight or other measures of adiposity assessed. Almond consumption was positively associated with dietary intake of oleic acid ( _r_ \\=0.839; _P_ <.001) and fecal output of oleic acid ( _r_ \\=0.651; _P_ <.001) but was inversely associated with oleic acid bioaccessibility ( _r_ \\=−0.349; _P_ \\=.004). Yet, the percentage of fecal oleic acid was not associated with the serum percentage ( _r_ \\=−0.233; _P_ \\=.06). There was no relationship between almond consumption and dietary intake of linoleic acid ( _r_ \\=0.172; _P_ \\=.17), but almond consumption was positively associated with fecal output of linoleic acid ( _R_ \\=0.558; _P_ <.001) and inversely associated with linoleic acid bioaccessibility ( _r_ \\=−0.420; _P_ <.001). The percentage of fecal linoleic acid output was not associated with the serum percentage ( _r_ \\=−0.003; _P_ \\=.98).\n\n【243】Discussion\n----------\n\n【244】The analyses investigated the effect of almond consumption on dietary energy and macronutrient bioaccessibility in individuals with hyperlipidemia. Findings indicate that substitution of a carbohydrate-based food with almonds (ie, approximately 75 g or 150 g of a carbohydrate-based food for 38 g or 75 g of almonds, respectively) into an NCEP Step 2 background dietary pattern leads to lower fat and energy bioaccessibility without negatively affecting serum levels of beneficial (18:1 _n_ \\-9) or essential (18:2 _n_ \\-6) fatty acids. The 2% decrease in energy availability observed between the full-dose almond and control phases suggests that by incorporating almonds into a typical 2000- to 3000-kcal daily intake level may result in 40 to 60 kcal/d less than expected being digested and absorbed by the body. During the course of a year, assuming no compensation, this could result in mitigating weight gain or possibly leading to a weight loss by 1.9 to 2.9 kg (4.2 to 6.3 lb). In this trial, body weight was maintained with no difference between phases, yet comparison of the energy intakes showed on average an increase of 42 kcal/d in energy intake during the full-dose almond phase compared with the control phase.\n\n【245】Previous studies have examined the effect of nut intake on energy and macronutrient bioaccessibility, showing a marked increase in fecal fat excretion in healthy individuals.

The lower dietary fiber content in the control diet compared with the almond arms possibly contributed to the greater differences in fat and energy digestibility seen in their study, whereas dietary fiber was comparable across treatments in these analyses. This is noteworthy as dietary fiber, both soluble and insoluble, has been shown to increase fat excretion and to reduce fat digestibility.\n\n【252】\n\n【253】*   Chen H.L.\n*   Haack V.S.\n*   Janecky C.W.\n*   Vollendorf N.W.\n*   Marlett J.A.\n\n【254】Mechanisms by which wheat bran and oat bran increase stool weight in humans.\n\n【255】_Am J Clin Nutr._ 1998; 68 : 711-719\n\n【256】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (121)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【257】The analyses indicate that even when accounting for dietary fiber, there remained a difference in fat and energy bioaccessibility between diets incorporating almonds compared with a control supplement.\n\n【258】Possible interactions with other food components, such as dietary fiber, is one factor that may affect fat bioaccessibility. Several other factors may also influence the proportion of an ingested nutrient that is absorbed by the body, including the food matrix and the level of processing or mastication. Fecal fat excretion has been shown to be significantly higher with less processing (ie, whole nuts vs nut butters vs nut oils) and mastication.\n\n【259】\n\n【260】*   Grundy M.M.\n*   Grassby T.\n*   Mandalari G.\n*   et al.\n\n【261】Effect of mastication on lipid bioaccessibility of almonds in a randomized human study and its implications for digestion kinetics, metabolizable energy, and postprandial lipemia.\n\n【262】_Am J Clin Nutr._ 2015; 101 : 25-33\n\n【263】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (97)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【264】\n\n【265】\n\n【266】*   Ellis P.R.\n*   Kendall C.W.\n*   Ren Y.\n*   et al.\n\n【267】Role of cell walls in the bioaccessibility of lipids in almond seeds.\n\n【268】_Am J Clin Nutr._ 2004; 80 : 604-613\n\n【269】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (256)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【270】\n\n【271】\n\n【272】*   Cassady B.A.\n*   Hollis J.H.\n*   Fulford A.D.\n*   Considine R.V.\n*   Mattes R.D.\n\n【273】Mastication of almonds: effects of lipid bioaccessibility, appetite, and hormone response.\n\n【274】_Am J Clin Nutr._ 2009; 89 : 794-800\n\n【275】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (190)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【276】\n\n【277】\n\n【278】*   Mandalari G.\n*   Grundy M.M.\n*   Grassby T.\n*   et al.\n\n【279】The effects of processing and mastication on almond lipid bioaccessibility using novel methods of in vitro digestion modelling and micro-structural analysis.\n\n【280】_Br J Nutr._ 2014; 112 : 1521-1529\n\n【281】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (63)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【282】\n\n【283】\n\n【284】*   Levine A.S.\n*   Silvis S.E.\n\n【285】Absorption of whole peanuts, peanut oil, and peanut butter.\n\n【286】_N Engl J Med._ 1980; 303 : 917-918\n\n【287】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (66)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【288】Ellis et al\n\n【289】\n\n【290】*   Ellis P.R.\n*   Kendall C.W.\n*   Ren Y.\n*   et al.\n\n【291】Role of cell walls in the bioaccessibility of lipids in almond seeds.\n\n【292】_Am J Clin Nutr._ 2004; 80 : 604-613\n\n【293】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (256)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【294】examined fecal samples after whole almond intake and identified almond tissue in the fecal material, confirming that cotyledonary cells remained intact with cell walls encapsulating intracellular lipid.

The present findings are relevant for general consumers as well as clinically for health care practitioners and patients as diabetes, cardiovascular, and general healthy eating guidelines tend to warn consumers against energy-dense foods because of their obesogenic potential; nuts, including almonds, have been stigmatized as a result of their perceived high energy density. Whereas this view has been shifting and nuts have been acknowledged for their health benefits, remnants of this concern remain, with caveats noting the energy density of nuts following statements recommending their consumption for health benefits. Globally, this is reflected by the relatively low estimated average total tree nut and peanut intake levels (15-17 g/d), which are less than half of the amounts generally recommended by dietary and health guidelines and the Food & Drug Administration–qualified health claim.\n\n【371】\n\n【372】International Nut & Dried Fruit Council  \nNuts & dried fruits statistical yearbook 2019/2020.\n\n【373】https://www.nutfruit.org/industry/technical-resources\n\n【374】Date accessed: April 22, 2020\n\n【375】*   Google Scholar\n\n【376】\n\n【377】\n\n【378】International Nut & Dried Fruit Council  \nNuts & dried fruits statistical yearbook 2017/2018.\n\n【379】https://www.nutfruit.org/industry/technical-resources\n\n【380】Date accessed: April 25, 2020\n\n【381】*   Google Scholar\n\n【382】\n\n【383】\n\n【384】U.S. Food & Drug Administration  \nGuidance for industry: a food labeling guide (12.

Moreover, the study population is relevant to those who are at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, for whom many guidelines recommending nuts, including almonds, are geared to their lipid- and blood glucose–lowering health benefits. These analyses, however, do possess a number of limitations. On the basis of the current investigation, it is difficult to discern whether the increased fecal fat content observed during the almond phase is due to fat excreted from the almonds directly or whether almond consumption induced fat malabsorption from other foods. As well, gastrointestinal secretions and mucosal cell loss may affect the composition of the fecal samples,\n\n【389】\n\n【390】*   Keller J.\n*   Layer P.\n\n【391】The pathophysiology of malabsorption.\n\n【392】_Viszeralmedizin._ 2014; 30 : 150-154\n\n【393】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (30)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【394】yet this analysis was unable to measure this potential contribution and had to assume that all of the nitrogen and fat found in the fecal samples was derived directly from the dietary protein and fat, respectively. Nevertheless, this may be controlled for by the crossover design. The findings are also limited in that urine samples were not available for analyses; thus, the absolute protein and energy bioaccessibility values should be interpreted with caution. Whereas the digestibility values for protein and energy may be lower than currently reported, it is not expected that this would greatly affect the comparison between treatments as urinary excretion of nitrogen was not found to be significantly different between tree nut and control in another investigation.\n\n【395】\n\n【396】*   Baer D.J.\n*   Novotny J.A.\n\n【397】Metabolizable energy from cashew nuts is less than that predicted by Atwater factors.\n\n【398】_Nutrients._ 2018; 11 : 33\n\n【399】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (29)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【400】In addition, short-chain fatty acids (eg, acetate, propionate, and butyrate) were not able to be assessed. As short-chain fatty acids may provide an extra energy source for de novo lipogenesis, this may have implications in the metabolic responses of the host individual.\n\n【401】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【402】Incorporating almonds into an NCEP dietary pattern resulted in less fat and energy bioaccessibility at both almond doses of 38 g/d and 73 g/d, without an observed dose response, compared with a carbohydrate-based control in hyperlipidemia. These findings in conjunction with previous investigations suggest it is possible that the energy content of almonds may not be as bioaccessible as predicted by Atwater factors. With less fat being bioaccessible, the concern of the “high energy density” of almonds and risk of weight gain may be overstated.\n\n【403】Given that the Atwater system is often used to determine the energy values for mandatory nutrient labeling of food products, food labeling of items with whole almonds may require adjustment to better reflect the metabolizable energy. Future research may investigate other food sources with similar complex food matrices to almonds, such as seeds and pulses, to determine whether there are more appropriate ways to establish and to present energy content of these foods.\n\n【404】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【405】We wish to thank the volunteer participants, Dr Balachandran Bashyam (laboratory technician), and Dr Dorothea Faulkner (registered dietitian) as well as Chole Kavcic, Diana Ghidanac, and Sarah Muncaster (hospital volunteers) at St. Michael’s Hospital and the University of Toronto for their assistance and expertise.\n\n【406】None of the sponsors had a role in any aspect of this study, including design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; and preparation, review, and approval of the manuscript or decision to publish.\n\n【407】Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------\n\n【408】*   Download .pdf (.44 MB)\n    \n    Help with pdf files\n    \n    Supplemental Material", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

It is used to treat a type of cancer of the white blood cells called B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This medicine is used in patients with CLL who have already been treated with an alkylating agent (e.g., bendamustine) that did not work well. .\n\n【5】Fludarabine injection interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by fludarabine injection, other effects may also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects may not be serious but may cause concern.

Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【28】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【29】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【30】*   Bone marrow problems (e.g., anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia)—Fludarabine injection may worsen these conditions.\n\n【31】*   Chickenpox (including recent exposure) or\n*   Herpes zoster (shingles)—Risk of severe disease affecting other parts of the body.\n\n【32】*   Gout (history of) or\n*   Kidney stones (history of)—Fludarabine may increase levels of uric acid in the body, which can cause gout or kidney stones.\n\n【33】*   Infection—Fludarabine injection may decrease your body's ability to fight infection.\n\n【34】*   Kidney disease—Use with caution. Effects of fludarabine injection may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【35】*   Transfusions—Non-irradiated blood transfusion may increase the risk of side effects of fludarabine injection.\n\n【36】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【37】This medicine may cause nausea and vomiting. However, it is very important that you continue to receive the medicine even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your doctor for ways to lessen these effects.\n\n【38】You will receive this medicine while you are in a hospital or cancer treatment center. A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine.\n\n【39】This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins. It is usually given every day for 5 days. This 5-day treatment is given again every 28 days until your body responds to the medicine. Each treatment usually takes about 30 minutes.\n\n【40】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【41】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【42】While you are being treated with fludarabine injection, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Fludarabine injection may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have recently taken oral polio vaccine. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.\n\n【43】Fludarabine injection can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection (e.g. pneumonia). It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【44】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you have fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, painful or difficult urination; shortness of breath; or unusual bleeding or bruising.\n*   Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in the urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【45】You should not use this medicine if you are also taking pentostatin (Nipent®). Taking it together with this medicine may increase the chance of serious side effect.\n\n【46】This medicine may cause a serious type of reaction called tumor lysis syndrome. Your doctor may give you a medicine to help prevent this. Call your doctor right away if you have a decrease or change in urine amount; joint pain, stiffness, or swelling; lower back, side, or stomach pain; a rapid weight gain; swelling of the feet or lower legs; or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【47】Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. You should not become pregnant while you are taking this medicine and for 6 months after stopping it. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【48】This medicine may cause unusual weakness, trouble in thinking, or trouble in seeing clearly. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do other jobs that require you to be alert, well-coordinated, or able to think or see well.\n\n【49】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【50】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【51】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【52】#### More common\n\n【53】1.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【35】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【36】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【37】*   Angina (chest pain)—Methyldopa may worsen the condition.\n\n【38】*   Type 2 diabetes mellitus—Hydrochlorothiazide may change the amount of diabetes medicine needed.\n\n【39】*   Gout (history of)—Hydrochlorothiazide may increase the amount of uric acid in the blood, which can lead to gout.\n\n【40】*   High cholesterol—Hydrochlorothiazide may raise cholesterol levels.\n\n【41】*   Kidney disease—Effects of methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide may be increased because of slower removal from the body. If severe, hydrochlorothiazide may not work.\n\n【42】*   Liver disease—Effects of methyldopa may be increased because of slower removal from the body. If hydrochlorothiazide causes loss of too much water from the body, liver disease can become much worse.\n\n【43】*   Lupus erythematosus (history of)—Hydrochlorothiazide may worsen the condition.\n\n【44】*   Mental depression (history of)—Methyldopa can cause mental depression\n*   Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)\n*   Parkinson's disease—Methyldopa may worsen the condition.\n*   Pheochromocytoma—Methyldopa may interfere with tests for the condition. In addition, there have been reports of increased blood pressure.\n\n【45】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【46】In addition to the use of the medicine your doctor has prescribed, appropriate treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and care in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium. Your doctor will tell you which factors are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet.\n\n【47】Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal. It is very important that you take your medicine exactly as directed and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well.\n\n【48】Remember that this medicine will not cure your high blood pressure but it does help control it. Therefore, you must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life. If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, stroke, or kidney disease.\n\n【49】This medicine may cause you to have an unusual feeling of tiredness when you begin to take it. You may also notice an increase in the amount of urine or in your frequency of urination. After taking the medicine for a while, these effects should lessen. In general, to keep the increase in urine from affecting your sleep:\n\n【50】*   If you are to take a single dose a day, take it in the morning after breakfast.\n*   If you are to take more than one dose a day, take the last dose no later than 6 p.m., unless otherwise directed by your doctor.\n\n【51】However, it is best to plan your dose or doses according to a schedule that will least affect your personal activities and sleep. Ask your health care professional to help you plan the best time to take this medicine.\n\n【52】To help you remember to take your medicine, try to get into the habit of taking it at the same time each day.\n\n【53】### Dosing\n\n【54】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【55】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【56】*   For treating high blood pressure:\n    *   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n        *   Adults: Two to four tablets a day, taken as a single dose or in divided doses.\n        *   Children: Dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【57】### Missed Dose\n\n【58】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【59】### Storage\n\n【60】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【61】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【62】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【63】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【64】It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly.\n\n【65】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes over-the-counter (nonprescription) medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems, since they may tend to increase your blood pressure.\n\n【66】This medicine may cause a loss of potassium from your body:\n\n【67】*   To help prevent this, your doctor may want you to:\n    *   eat or drink foods that have a high potassium content (for example, orange or other citrus fruit juices), or\n    *   take a potassium supplement, or\n    *   take another medicine to help prevent the loss of the potassium in the first place.\n*   It is very important to follow these directions. Also, it is important not to change your diet on your own. This is more important if you are already on a special diet (as for diabetes), or if you are taking a potassium supplement or a medicine to reduce potassium loss. Extra potassium may not be necessary and, in some cases, too much potassium could be harmful.\n\n【68】Check with your doctor if you become sick and have severe or continuing vomiting or diarrhea. These problems may cause you to lose additional water and potassium.\n\n【69】Before having any kind of surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment, tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are taking this medicine.\n\n【70】If you have a fever and there seems to be no reason for it, check with your doctor. This is especially important during the first few weeks you take this medicine since fever may be a sign of a serious reaction to methyldopa.\n\n【71】This medicine may cause some people to become drowsy or less alert than they are normally. This is more likely to happen when you begin to take it or when you increase the amount of medicine you are taking. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert.\n\n【72】Dizziness, light-headedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help, but if the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【73】The dizziness, light-headedness, or fainting is also more likely to occur if you drink alcohol, stand for long periods of time, exercise, or if the weather is hot. Drinking alcoholic beverages may also make the drowsiness worse. While you are taking this medicine, be careful in the amount of alcohol you drink. Also, use extra care during exercise or hot weather or if you must stand for long periods of time.\n\n【74】For diabetic patients:\n\n【75】*   This medicine may raise blood sugar levels. While you are using this medicine, be especially careful in testing for sugar in your urine. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.\n\n【76】This medicine may cause dryness of the mouth. For temporary relief, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your medical doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.\n\n【77】Hydrochlorothiazide may cause your skin to be more sensitive to sunlight than it is normally. Exposure to sunlight, even for brief periods of time, may cause a skin rash, itching, redness or other discoloration of the skin, or a severe sunburn. When you begin taking this medicine:\n\n【78】*   Stay out of direct sunlight, especially between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., if possible.\n*   Wear protective clothing, including a hat. Also, wear sunglasses.\n*   Apply a sun block product that has a skin protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. Some patients may require a product with a higher SPF number, especially if they have a fair complexion. If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.\n*   Apply a sun block lipstick that has an SPF of at least 15 to protect your lips.\n*   Do not use a sunlamp or tanning bed or booth.\n\n【79】If you have a severe reaction from the sun, check with your doctor\n\n【80】Before you have any medical tests, tell the doctor in charge that you are taking this medicine. The results of some tests may be affected by this medicine.\n\n【81】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【82】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【83】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【84】#### Rare\n\n【85】1.  Unexplained fever shortly after starting to take this medicine\n\n【86】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【87】#### Signs and symptoms of too much potassium loss\n\n【88】1.  Dry mouth\n2.  increased thirst\n3.  irregular heartbeats\n4.  muscle cramps or pain\n5.  nausea or vomiting\n6.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n7.  weak pulse\n\n【89】#### Less common\n\n【90】1.

The in-hospital and long-term outcomes (median follow-up, 6.2 years; interquartile range=4.3-8.5 years), including cardiac and noncardiac death and heart failure hospitalization, of these patients were compared with those of 1313 cancer-negative patients matched on age, sex, family history of coronary artery disease, and date of STEMI.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Patients with cancer had higher in-hospital noncardiac (1.9% vs 0.4%; _P_ \\=.03) but similar cardiac (5.8% vs 4.6%; _P_ \\=.37) mortality as matched controls. The group at highest acute mortality risk were those diagnosed as having cancer within 6 months before STEMI (hazard ratio \\[HR\\]=7.0; 95% CI, 1.4-34.4; _P_ \\=.02). At 5 years, patients with cancer had similar cardiac mortality (4.2% vs 5.8%; HR=1.27; 95% CI, 0.77-2.10; _P_ \\=.35) despite more heart failure hospitalizations (15% vs 10%; HR=1.72; 95% CI, 1.18-2.50; _P_ \\=.01) but faced higher noncardiac mortality (30.0% vs 11.0%; HR=3.01; 95% CI, 2.33-3.88; _P_ <.001) than controls, attributable solely to cancer-related deaths.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】One in 10 patients in this contemporary registry of patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI has a history of cancer. These patients have more than a 3 times higher acute in-hospital and long-term noncardiac mortality risk but no increased acute or long-term cardiac mortality risk with guideline-recommended cardiac care.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACS ( acute coronary syndrome ), AMI ( acute myocardial infarction ), CABG ( coronary artery bypass grafting ), CAD ( coronary artery disease ), CHF ( chronic heart failure ), COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ), CVA ( cerebrovascular accident ), DES ( drug-eluting stent ), GP ( glycoprotein ), HR ( hazard ratio ), IABP ( intra-aortic balloon pump ), LAD ( left anterior descending artery ), LCX ( left circumflex artery ), LMA ( left main artery ), LVEF ( left ventricular ejection fraction ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), NA ( not available ), PCI ( percutaneous coronary intervention ), RCA ( right coronary artery ), STEMI ( ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ), TIA ( transient ischemic attack ), TIMI ( Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

Prescription drugs responsible for 80% of the total Medicare pharmaceutical expenditures in rheumatology were analyzed. We calculated the mean annual drug cost per beneficiary per year, the percentage of rheumatologists who received payments, and the median annual payment per physician per drug per year. Industry payments were categorized as food/beverage and consulting/compensation. Multivariable regression models were used to assess associations between industry payments and both prescribing patterns and prescription drug expenditures.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 4822 rheumatologists in the Medicare prescribing databases, 3729 received any payment from a pharmaceutical company during this time frame. Food/beverage payments were associated with an increased proportion of prescriptions for the related drugs (range, 1.5% to 4.5%) and an increased proportion of annual Medicare spending for the related drugs (range, 3% to 23%). For every $100 in food/beverage payments, the probability of prescribing increased (range, 1.5% to 14% for most drugs) and Medicare reimbursements increased (range, 6% to 44% for most drugs). Consulting/compensation payments were associated with an increased proportion of prescriptions (range, 1.2% to 1.6%) and an increased proportion of annual Medicare spending (range, 1% to 2%). For every $1000 in consulting/compensation payments, both the probability of prescribing increased (5% or less for most drugs) and Medicare reimbursements increased (less than 10% for most drugs).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Payments to rheumatologists by pharmaceutical companies are associated with increased probability of prescribing and Medicare spending.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CMS ( Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ), NPI ( National Provider Identifier ), PUF ( Public Use File ), rACTH ( repository corticotropin )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

Insulin is used by people with diabetes to help keep blood sugar levels under control. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough or does not use insulin properly. So, you must take additional insulin to regulate your blood sugar and keep your body healthy. This is very important as too much sugar in your blood can be harmful to your health.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Suspension\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of insulin lispro protamine and insulin lispro combination injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of insulin lispro protamine and insulin lispro combination injection have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of this medicine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related heart, liver, or kidney problems which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below.

If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use this medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】*   Ethanol\n\n【30】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【31】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【32】*   Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)—Should not be used in patients with this condition. If you have low blood sugar and take insulin, your blood sugar may reach dangerously low levels.\n\n【33】*   Hypokalemia (low potassium in the blood)—Use with caution. May make this condition worse and increase your chance of having serious side effects.\n\n【34】*   Infection or any illness or\n*   Stress (eg, physical or emotional)—Use with caution. These conditions increase blood sugar and may increase the amount of insulin you need.\n\n【35】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of the slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【36】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【37】A nurse or other trained health professional may give you this medicine. You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. It is given as a shot under your skin.\n\n【38】Always double-check both the concentration (strength) of your insulin and your dose. Concentration and dose are not the same. The dose is how many units of insulin you will use. The concentration tells how many units of insulin are in each milliliter (mL), such as 100 units/mL (U-100), but this does not mean you will use 100 units at a time.\n\n【39】Each package of insulin lispro protamine and insulin lispro combination injection contains a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully before beginning your treatment and each time you get a refill for any new information. Make sure you understand:\n\n【40】*   How to prepare the medicine.\n*   How to inject the medicine.\n*   How to use disposable insulin delivery device.\n*   How to dispose of syringes, needles, and injection devices.\n\n【41】It is best to use a different place on the body for each injection (eg, under the skin of your abdomen or stomach, buttocks, thigh, or upper arm). Do not use the exact same spot for each injection. If you have questions about this, contact your doctor.\n\n【42】When used as a mealtime insulin, this insulin combination should be taken within 15 minutes before a meal (2 meals or a meal and a snack).\n\n【43】To use this medicine:\n\n【44】*   Vial: Invert the vial carefully at least 10 times to mix the insulin.\n*   KwikPen®: Mix the insulin by rolling the pen between your palms 10 times. Turn the pen upside down at least 10 times.\n*   The insulin should look cloudy or milky white after you mix it. Do not use this insulin if it is clear or has clumps or particles in it.\n*   Do not store the pen with a needle attached.\n\n【45】Follow carefully the special meal plan your doctor gave you. This is the most important part of controlling your condition, and is necessary if the medicine is to work properly. Also, exercise regularly and test for sugar in your blood or urine as directed.\n\n【46】You should never mix insulin lispro protamine and insulin lispro combination with other insulin injections without checking with your doctor first. These injections are usually done separately. Also, this medicine should not be used in an insulin infusion pump. If you have questions about this, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【47】### Dosing\n\n【48】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【49】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【50】*   For injection dosage form (suspension):\n    *   For diabetes mellitus:\n        *   Adults—The dose is based on your blood sugar and must be determined by your doctor.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【51】### Missed Dose\n\n【52】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【53】### Storage\n\n【54】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【55】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【56】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【57】Store in the refrigerator. Do not freeze.\n\n【58】Store unopened medicine in its original carton in the refrigerator until the expiry date. Do not freeze. Do not use the insulin if it has been frozen. You may also store the pen for 10 days or vial for 28 days at room temperature.\n\n【59】Store opened pens at room temperature for up to 10 days. Do not refrigerate. Store opened vials in the refrigerator or at room temperature for up to 28 days. Do not freeze.\n\n【60】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【61】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits, especially during the first few weeks you use this medicine. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【62】Never share insulin pens or cartridges with others under any circumstances. It is not safe for one pen to be used for more than one person. Sharing needles or pens can result in transmission of hepatitis viruses, HIV, or other bloodborne illnesses.\n\n【63】It is very important to follow carefully any instructions from your health care team about:\n\n【64】*   Alcohol—Drinking alcohol (including beer and wine) may cause severe low blood sugar. Discuss this with your health care team.\n*   Other medicines—Do not take other medicines during the time you are using this medicine unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription medicines such as aspirin, and medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems.\n*   Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, patients with diabetes may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur in patients with diabetes during pregnancy.\n*   Travel—Keep a recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.\n\n【65】In case of emergency—There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to:\n\n【66】*   Wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says that you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.\n*   Keep an extra supply of insulin and syringes with needles or injection devices on hand in case high blood sugar occurs.\n*   Keep some kind of quick-acting sugar handy to treat low blood sugar.\n*   Have a glucagon kit and a syringe and needle available in case severe low blood sugar occurs. Check and replace any expired kits regularly.\n\n【67】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, shortness of breath, swelling of the face, tongue, and throat, trouble breathing, or chest pain after you get the injection.\n\n【68】Using this medicine together with other diabetes medicine (eg, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, Actos®, Actoplus Met®, Avandia®) may cause serious heart problems or edema (fluid retention). Check with your doctor immediately if you are rapidly gaining weight, having chest pain or discomfort, extreme tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, uneven heartbeat, or excessive swelling of the hands, wrist, ankles, or feet.\n\n【69】You may have some skin redness, rash, itching, or swelling at the injection site. If this irritation is severe or does not go away, call your doctor. Do not inject this medicine into a skin area that is red, swollen, or itchy.\n\n【70】Too much insulin lispro protamine and insulin lispro combination can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Low blood sugar can also occur if you use this medicine with another antidiabetic medicine, changes in insulin regimen, delay or miss a meal or snack, exercise more than usual, drink alcohol, or cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting or have diarrhea. Low blood sugar must be treated before it causes you to pass out (unconsciousness). People feel different symptoms of low blood sugar. It is important that you learn which symptoms you usually have so you can treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat low blood sugar. Symptoms of low blood sugar include anxiety, behavior change similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, depression, difficulty in thinking, dizziness or lightheadedness, drowsiness, excessive hunger, fast heartbeat, headache, irritability or abnormal behavior, nervousness, nightmares, restless sleep, shakiness, slurred speech, and tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue.\n\n【71】If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel to relieve the symptoms. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Get to a doctor or a hospital right away if the symptoms do not improve. Someone should call for emergency help immediately if severe symptoms such as convulsions (seizures) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe and needle, and know how to use it. Members of your household also should know how to use it.\n\n【72】Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your antidiabetic medicine, changes in insulin regimen (eg, insulin strength, type of insulin, injection site), overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual.\n\n【73】Symptoms of high blood sugar include blurred vision, drowsiness, dry mouth, flushed, dry skin, fruit-like breath odor, increased urination, ketones in urine, loss of appetite, stomachache, nausea, or vomiting, tiredness, troubled breathing (rapid and deep), unconsciousness, or unusual thirst.\n\n【74】If symptoms of high blood sugar occur, check your blood sugar level and then call your doctor for instructions.\n\n【75】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【76】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【77】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【78】#### Incidence not known\n\n【79】1.  Anxiety\n2.  blurred vision\n3.  chills\n4.  cold sweats\n5.  confusion\n6.  cool, pale skin\n7.  cough\n8.  decreased urine\n9.  depression\n10.  difficulty with swallowing\n11.  dizziness\n12.  dry mouth\n13.  fast heartbeat\n14.  flushing or redness of the skin\n15.  headache\n16.  hives, itching, skin rash\n17.  increased hunger\n18.  increased thirst\n19.  irregular heartbeat\n20.  loss of appetite\n21.  muscle pain or cramps\n22.  nausea\n23.  nervousness\n24.  nightmares\n25.  numbness or tingling in the hands, feet, or lips\n26.  puffiness or swelling of the eyelids or around the eyes, face, lips, or tongue\n27.  seizures\n28.  shakiness\n29.  slurred speech\n30.  sweating\n31.  swelling of the arms or legs\n32.  tightness in the chest\n33.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n34.  unusually warm skin\n35.  vomiting\n\n【80】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【81】#### Incidence not known\n\n【82】1.  Bleeding, blistering, burning, coldness, discoloration of the skin, feeling of pressure, hives, infection, inflammation, itching, lumps, numbness, pain, rash, redness, scarring, soreness, stinging, swelling, tenderness, tingling, ulceration, or warmth at the injection site\n2.  redistribution or accumulation of body fat\n3.  weight gain\n\n【83】Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients.

{"seq_id": "47901a7f-cdce-421e-8446-6131a0c0c2d1", "title": "Worldwide Injection Technique Questionnaire Study", "text": "【0】Worldwide Injection Technique Questionnaire Study\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【1】From February 1, 2014, through June 30, 2015, 13,289 insulin-injecting patients from 423 centers in 42 countries participated in one of the largest surveys ever performed in diabetes. The first results of this survey are published elsewhere in this issue. Herein we report that the most common complication of injecting insulin is lipohypertrophy (LH), which was self-reported by 29.0% of patients and found by physical examination in 30.8% by health care professionals (HCPs). Patients with LH consumed a mean of 10.1 IU more insulin daily than patients without LH. Glycated hemoglobin levels averaged 0.55% higher in patients with vs without LH. Lipohypertrophy was associated with higher rates of unexplained hypoglycemia and glycemic variability as well as more frequent diabetic ketoacidosis, incorrect rotation of injection sites, use of smaller injection zones, longer duration of insulin use, and reuse of pen needles (each _P_ <.05). Routine inspection of injection sites by the HCP was associated with lower glycated hemoglobin levels, less LH, and more correct injection site rotation. Patients were also more likely to rotate correctly if they received injection instructions from their HCP in the past 6 months. Fewer than 40% of patients claimed to have gotten such instructions in the past 6 months, and 10% said that they have never received training on how to inject correctly despite injecting for a mean of nearly 9 years. Use of these data should stimulate renewed commitment to optimizing insulin injection practices.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】BMI ( body mass index ), HbA1c ( glycated hemoglobin ), HCP ( health care professional ), ITQ ( Injection Technique Questionnaire ), LH ( lipohypertrophy ), T1DM ( type 1 diabetes ), T2DM ( type 2 diabetes ), TDD ( total daily dose )\n\n【4】In a separate article in this issue we introduce the worldwide Injection Technique Questionnaire (ITQ) survey.\n\n【5】\n\n【6】*   Frid A.H.\n*   Hirsch L.J.\n*   Menchior A.R.\n*   Morel D.R.\n*   Strauss K.W.\n\n【7】Worldwide Injection Technique Questionnaire study: population parameters and injection practices.\n\n【8】_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2016; 91 : 1212-1223\n\n【9】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (67)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【10】That article describes the patient population and its injecting practices as well as survey methods, materials, centers, and participants. The present article addresses injection-related complications and the role of the health care professional (HCP).\n\n【11】Results\n-------\n\n【12】### Lipohypertrophy\n\n【13】To assess the presence of lipohypertrophy (LH), patients were asked: “Do you have any swelling or lumps under the skin at your usual injection sites that have been there for some time (weeks, months, or years)?” Overall, 29.0% answered yes. Nurses were asked to examine all the injection sites for LH both visually and by palpation. They found LH in 30.8% of patients; the frequencies by site and type of examination are shown in Table 1 . The frequency of LH was relatively consistent across the 42 countries surveyed. Lipohypertrophy was seen almost twice as frequently in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) as in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and was virtually absent in patients with gestational diabetes, probably because of the very short time that such patients have been using insulin (data not shown).\n\n【14】Table 1 Findings From Visual and Palpation Examination by Nurses for Lipohypertrophy by Site\n\n| Injection site | Examination type | Lipohypertrophy found (%)aOverall, the nurses found lipohypertrophy in 30.8% of patients. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Abdomen (n=7565) | Visual | 17.3 |\n|  | Palpation | 21.1 |\n| Thigh (n=5425) | Visual | 9.8 |\n|  | Palpation | 11.2 |\n| Buttock (n=2566) | Visual | 2.1 |\n|  | Palpation | 2.8 |\n| Arm (n=4204) | Visual | 11.2 |\n|  | Palpation | 13.4 |\n\n【16】a Overall, the nurses found lipohypertrophy in 30.8% of patients.\n\n【17】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【18】Although there was a correlation between LH lesions that were visible and those that were palpated, it was not 100%. Table 2 presents data on this correlation in abdominal LH (the most frequent site used and consequently the one most frequently reported as having LH). Eighty-four percent of LH could be both seen and felt, but 14% could be felt but not seen. The same pattern is seen with the thigh, buttock, and arm (data not shown). When nurses found LH they were asked to measure the lesion along its longest axis. Results are shown in Supplemental Table 1 (available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ).\n\n【19】\n\n【20】Fitter4Diabetes website. http://www.fitter4diabetes.com . Accessed June 7, 2016.\n\n【21】*   Google Scholar\n\n【22】Lesions of LH varied from a mean of approximately 35 mm (in the arm) to approximately 50 mm (in the buttock), but there was considerable variability around these averages. When nurses found LH they asked the patient whether they were still injecting into it, and 44.0% said yes. Patients still injecting into LH were then asked how often they were doing so and why ( Table 3 ).\n\n【23】Table 2 Correlation Between Visible and Palpable Findings of Abdominal Lipohypertrophy\n\n【24】\n\n【25】A total of 6423 patients' abdomens were examined. Percentages are based on the 1311 patients with lipohypertrophy.\n\n| Palpable | Visible (No. \\[%\\]) |\n| --- | --- |\n| No | Yes |\n| --- | --- |\n| No | 5112 | 23 (2) |\n| Yes | 186 (14) | 1102 (84) |\n\n【27】a A total of 6423 patients' abdomens were examined.

We found no association between the presence of LH and body mass index. Just less than one-third of those taking glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists were found to have LH, but there was no association between LH and the duration of this therapy. It is unclear whether LH predated glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist therapy.\n\n【33】There was a strong association between the presence of LH and the total daily dose (TDD) of insulin ( Table 4 ). A mean of 10.1 IU more insulin was consumed in the population with LH compared with those without LH. In patients with T2DM, this average TDD difference rose to 13.5 IU, whereas in patients with T1DM, the average TDD difference was 5.4 IU. These differences were similar in patients with LH who continued to inject into LH vs those who did not ( Table 4 ).\n\n【34】Table 4 TDD of Insulin as a Function of LH\n\n【35】\n\n【36】LH = lipohypertrophy; TDD = total daily dose.\n\n| Parameter | TDD (IU), mean ± SD | Patients (No.) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| LH present |  |  |\n| YesbDifferences “Yes” vs “No”; significant at P<.001. | 55.2±33.0 | 2192 |\n| No | 45.1±31.5 | 4889 |\n| Total | 48.2±32.3 | 7081 |\n| Injecting into LH |  |  |\n| YesbDifferences “Yes” vs “No”; significant at P<.001. | 56.1±33.2 | 1644 |\n| No | 47.1±32.2 | 2064 |\n| Total | 51.1±32.9 | 3708 |\n\n【38】a LH = lipohypertrophy; TDD = total daily dose.\n\n【39】b Differences “Yes” vs “No”; significant at _P_ <.001.\n\n【40】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【41】Similar differences were seen for the various types of insulin: fast-acting analogues (mean of 4.4 IU more in patients with LH vs those without), basal analogues (mean of 1.5 IU more), and premixes (mean of 9.8 IU more) (all differences significant at _P_ <.05). All currently used families of insulins were associated with LH (ie, there are no insulins that seem to protect the user from LH). However, it is not possible by the present data to determine whether any one type of insulin has higher risks.\n\n【42】The presence of LH was associated with higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA <sub>1c </sub> ) values, with a mean HbA <sub>1c </sub> level 0.55% higher in patients with LH than in those without LH ( Table 5 ). These differences were almost the same for patients with T1DM as for those with T2DM. Lipohypertrophy was associated with higher rates of unexpected hypoglycemia and glycemic variability as well as more frequent diabetic ketoacidosis. (Data not shown but all differences were significant at _P_ <.05.)\n\n【43】Table 5 Association of Lipohypertrophy With HbA <sub>1c </sub> Levels\n\n【44】\n\n【45】HbA1c = glycated hemoglobin.\n\n| Lipohypertrophy | HbA 1c (%), mean ± SD | Patients (No.) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| YesbDifferences “Yes” vs “No”; significant at P<.001. | 8.85±2.7 | 2205 |\n| No | 8.30±1.9 | 4795 |\n| Total | 8.47±2.2 | 7000 |\n\n【47】a HbA <sub>1c </sub> \\= glycated hemoglobin.\n\n【48】b Differences “Yes” vs “No”; significant at _P_ <.001.\n\n【49】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【50】Lipohypertrophy was associated with incorrect rotation of injection sites, use of smaller injecting zones, longer duration of insulin use, and reuse of pen needles (all significant at _P_ <.05). The higher the number of times the pen needle was reused, the more frequently LH was reported ( Table 6 ). The size of the LH was also related to the number of times the needle was used ( Supplemental Table 2 , available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ).\n\n【51】\n\n【52】Fitter4Diabetes website. http://www.fitter4diabetes.com .

Correct injection site rotation is defined as always injecting at least 1 cm from a previous injection. Those who rotate correctly were found to have less LH, less hyperglycemia, less unexplained hypoglycemia, and lower glucose variability. (Data not shown but each difference was significant at _P_ <.05.) Mean levels of HbA <sub>1c </sub> were 0.57% lower in those who correctly rotate ( Table 7 ). Correct rotation was also associated with 4.7 IU lower TDD ( Table 7 ). When the HCP checked sites routinely, this practice was associated with lower HbA <sub>1c </sub> levels, less LH, and more correct rotation. Patients were also more likely to rotate correctly if they received injection instructions in the past 6 months. Correct rotation seems to increase in frequency as the needle shortens ( Table 7 ), although this may be a by-product of the level of education and training given when switching patients to such needles.\n\n【61】Table 7 Association of Correct Injection Site Rotation With HbA <sub>1c </sub> Levels, TDD of Insulin, and Needle Length\n\n【62】\n\n【63】HbA1c = glycated hemoglobin; TDD = total daily dose.\n\n| Parameter | Correct rotation |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yes | No | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| HbA 1c |  |  |  |\n| %, mean ± SD | 8.28±1.79 | 8.85±2.01 | 8.44±1.87 |\n| Patients (No.) | 5187 | 2123 | 7310 |\n| TDD |  |  |  |\n| IU, mean ± SD | 47.2±31.8 | 51.9±33.1 | 48.6±32.3 |\n| Patients (No.) | 5220 | 2164 | 7384 |\n| Needle length (%) (n=7185) |  |  |  |\n| 4 mm | 76.3bDifference significant compared with the other needle length values at P<.001. |  |  |\n| 5 mm | 71.1 |  |  |\n| 6 mm | 71.6 |  |  |\n| 8 mm | 63.9cDifference significant compared with the other needle length values at P<.001. |  |  |\n\n【65】a HbA <sub>1c </sub> \\= glycated hemoglobin; TDD = total daily dose.\n\n【66】b Difference significant compared with the other needle length values at _P_ <.001.\n\n【67】c Difference significant compared with the other needle length values at _P_ <.001.\n\n【68】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【69】### Bleeding and Bruising\n\n【70】Patients were asked whether they saw bleeding or bruising from their injection sites, and 60.2% reported that they did. They were also asked about the frequency of bleeding or bruising, and only 0.5% said always, 7.3% said often (several times a week), 41.5% said sometimes (several times a month), and 50.8% said almost never (several times a year).\n\n【71】### Pain\n\n【72】Just more than half of the injectors reported having pain on injection. Of these, 84.5% report having painful injections only several times a month or year (ie, not with every injection). Groups with a higher frequency of reported pain were patients with T1DM, children, adolescents, and women. (Data not shown but all differences were significant at _P_ <.05.) Pain was commonly associated with bleeding ( Table 8 ). Pain is also associated with several other factors, without obvious causative relationships: injecting through clothes, injecting insulin while it is still cold (just out of the refrigerator), hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, LH, injecting into LH, incorrect site rotation, higher HbA <sub>1c </sub> levels, lower body mass index, younger age, and higher TDD of insulin. (Data not shown but each difference was significant at _P_ <.05.) Pain is also associated with needle reuse and seems to increase as a function of the number of times the needle is reused ( Table 8 ).\n\n【73】Table 8 Association of Injection Pain With Bleeding and Needle Reuse\n\n| Parameter | Pain |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yes | No |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bleeding (%) (n=9061) |  |  |\n| Yes | 42 | 18 |\n| No | 13 | 27 |\n| Needle reuse (n=3771)aIndividual percentages in each row are significantly different from the values in each row below at P < .001. |  |  |\n| 2 times | 52.4 |  |\n| 3-5 times | 55.1 |  |\n| 6-10 times | 59.5 |  |\n| \\>10 times | 62.9 |  |\n\n【75】a Individual percentages in each row are significantly different from the values in each row below at _P_ < .001.\n\n【76】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【77】### Lipoatrophy and Inflammation\n\n【78】Nurses also examined each injection site for the presence of lipoatrophy and redness ( Table 9 ). Both of these were reported at a much lower frequency than LH.\n\n【79】Table 9 Frequency of Lipoatrophy and Redness by Injection Site\n\n| Injection site | Finding | Patients (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Abdomen (n=7565) | Lipoatrophy | 0.6 |\n|  | Redness | 3.3 |\n| Thigh (n=5425) | Lipoatrophy | 0.5 |\n|  | Redness | 2.8 |\n| Buttock (n=2566) | Lipoatrophy | 0.2 |\n|  | Redness | 0.4 |\n| Arm (n=4204) | Lipoatrophy | 0.4 |\n|  | Redness | 3.6 |\n\n【81】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【82】### Insulin Leakage\n\n【83】Overall, 36.9% of patients reported leakage or backflow of insulin from the skin. Of these, 84.5% reported that the occurrence was rare (several times a month or a year). Leakage occurred more frequently in patients with T1DM than in those with T2DM. Leakage seemed to be more frequent in patients who had LH or who injected into LH, did not leave the pen needle under the skin for 10 seconds after injecting, or did not rotate injection sites correctly ( Table 10 ).\n\n【84】Table 10 Association of Leakage From the Skin With Time That the Needle Is Under the Skin and TDD of Insulin\n\n【85】\n\n【86】TDD = total daily dose.\n\n| Parameter | Leakage | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| YesbEach percentage is a significant decline compared with the previous percentage at P<.001. | No |\n| --- | --- |\n| Dwell time (No. \\[%\\]) |  |  |  |\n| Not aware how long | 142 (42.9) | 189 (57.1) | 331 (100.0) |\n| <5 s | 649 (40.9) | 936 (59.1) | 1585 (100.0) |\n| 5-10 s | 1512 (38.7) | 2394 (61.3) | 3906 (100.0) |\n| \\>10 s | 974 (35.7) | 1751 (64.3) | 2725 (100.0) |\n| TDD of insulin |  |  |  |\n| IU, mean ± SD | 51.8±32.2 | 46.6±32.5 | 48.5±32.4 |\n| Patients (No.) | 2819 | 4777 | 7596 |\n\n【88】a TDD = total daily dose.\n\n【89】b Each percentage is a significant decline compared with the previous percentage at _P_ <.001.\n\n【90】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【91】The longer that pen users left the needle under the skin after the plunger was pushed in (and especially if they reached the 10-second goal), the less frequently leakage was reported. Patients with leakage used, on average, 5.2 IU more insulin a day ( Table 10 ).\n\n【92】### Role of HCPs\n\n【93】Identification of HCPs can be found in Supplemental Table 3 (available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org )\n\n【94】\n\n【95】Fitter4Diabetes website. http://www.fitter4diabetes.com .

The frequency of HCP injection site inspection as reported by patients is shown in Table 11 . Approximately 28% said that site inspection was routinely performed at each visit, but nearly 39% said that they could not remember it ever being performed. The last time patients reported receiving instruction or advice on injections is provided in Table 11 . They were also asked what injection topics they could not remember ever being trained on ( Table 12 ).

More than 70% of patients with gestational diabetes had their sites checked routinely, whereas less than half of patients with T1DM did and only approximately a quarter of patients with T2DM. Most diabetes nurses checked sites routinely, whereas others (including diabetes specialist doctors) rarely did. Checking sites routinely was associated with lower HbA <sub>1c </sub> levels, less LH, and more correct rotation. Patients were also more likely to rotate correctly if they received injection instruction in the past 6 months. Furthermore, more recent instruction is associated with lower levels of needle reuse and fewer hospitalizations for hypoglycemia. (Data not shown but all differences were significant at _P_ <.05.)\n\n【135】Discussion\n----------\n\n【136】Nearly a third of the participants described lesions consistent with LH at their injection sites, and approximately the same proportion were found to have LH by the examining nurse (using visual inspection and palpation). One clue to the presence of LH is that normal skin can be pinched tightly together, whereas LH lesions cannot. In addition, LH often has a rubbery texture or is felt as a “step up” when palpating injection sites with lubricated fingers (using ultrasound gel or an equivalent).\n\n【137】The prevalence rates of LH in insulin-injecting patients with DM in 5 studies are, from lowest to highest: 14.5% (Hajheydari et al, 2011),\n\n【138】\n\n【139】*   Hajheydari Z.\n*   Kashi Z.\n*   Akha O.\n*   Akbarzadeh S.\n\n【140】Frequency of lipodystrophy induced by recombinant human insulin.\n\n【141】_Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci._ 2011; 15 : 1196-1201\n\n【142】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【143】27.1% (Raile et al, 2001),\n\n【144】\n\n【145】*   Raile K.\n*   Noelle V.\n*   Landgraf R.\n*   Schwarz H.P.\n\n【146】Insulin antibodies are associated with lipoatrophy but also with lipohypertrophy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.\n\n【147】_Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes._ 2001; 109 : 393-396\n\n【148】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (63)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【149】34.5% (Partanen and Rissanen, 2000),\n\n【150】\n\n【151】*   Partanen T.M.\n*   Rissanen A.\n\n【152】Insulin injection practices.\n\n【153】_Pract Diabetes Int._ 2000; 17 : 252-254\n\n【154】*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (41)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【155】48.0% (Kordonouri et al, 2002),\n\n【156】\n\n【157】*   Kordonouri O.\n*   Lauterborn R.\n*   Deiss D.\n\n【158】Lipohypertrophy in young patients with type 1 diabetes.\n\n【159】_Diabetes Care._ 2002; 25 : 634\n\n【160】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (77)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【161】and 64% (Blanco et al, 2013).\n\n【162】\n\n【163】*   Blanco M.\n*   Hernández M.T.\n*   Strauss K.W.\n*   Amaya M.\n\n【164】Prevalence and risk factors of lipohypertrophy in insulin-injecting patients with diabetes.\n\n【165】_Diabetes Metab._ 2013; 39 : 445-453\n\n【166】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (188)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【167】In the 2009 ITQ,\n\n【168】\n\n【169】*   De Coninck C.\n*   Frid A.\n*   Gaspar R.\n*   et al.\n\n【170】Results and analysis of the 2008-2009 Insulin Injection Technique Questionnaire survey.\n\n【171】_J Diabetes._ 2010; 2 : 168-179\n\n【172】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (106)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【173】48% of the more than 4200 patients answered “yes” to the following question (acknowledged to be somewhat nonspecific): “Have you ever noticed swelling of fatty tissue or small bumps at your injection sites?” The percentages in the 16 countries surveyed in that ITQ ranged from 30% to 88%.

Note, however, that the wording of this question in the earlier ITQ is very different from the wording in the current ITQ: “Do you have any swelling or lumps under the skin at your usual injection sites that have been there for some time (weeks, months, or years)?” (2014-1015 version). The earlier wording permits a wider time window and gives a less specific definition of LH than the wording in the latest ITQ. The fact that the most recent prevalence values (∼30%) are lower than those in the 2009 ITQ (48%) is almost certainly a function of that nonspecific earlier wording and not of an actual reduction in LH worldwide ( Table 13 ).\n\n【198】Glycated hemoglobin values were approximately 0.5% higher in injectors with LH than in those without LH (in both T1DM and T2DM) and are significantly higher with incorrect rotation of sites and frequent needle reuse, 2 practices that should be remediable through effective education/training. Most diabetes experts agree that a 0.5% difference in HbA <sub>1c </sub> levels is significant. If a reduction in LH can lead to sustainable declines of this magnitude, a significant decrease in complications as well as in health care costs may be achieved.\n\n【199】The frequencies of unexpected hypoglycemia and glucose variability are significantly higher with the presence of LH, with injecting into LH, with incorrect rotation of sites, and with needle reuse. These findings are consistent with impaired and variable insulin absorption and action when injected into LH tissue, recently demonstrated in high-quality clamp and mixed meal crossover studies.\n\n【200】\n\n【201】Famulla S, Hövelmann U, Fischer A, et al.

Such reductions should improve clinical outcomes, reduce insulin consumption, and, thereby, lower costs.\n\n【214】It is increasingly apparent that proper injection technique is essential to good diabetes management. It may be as important as the choice and dose of insulin because the insulin will not work effectively unless injected properly. The specialist diabetes nurse has a primary role in educating the patient on all aspects of injecting. In almost every country surveyed by the ITQ, this nurse is the primary guide and trainer for injections, although other HCPs often participate. Finally, the ITQ shows that it pays to check injection or infusion sites regularly, meaning ideally every visit but at a minimum yearly. The same is true of insulin delivery instruction. It should be given simultaneously with site inspection.\n\n【215】We also developed an Internet tool that allows users to query the ITQ database directly and to obtain infographics based on these queries. It is available in an interactive form on Tableau Public Adam Yeung's Profile website.\n\n【216】\n\n【217】ITQ survey data. Tableau Public Adam Yeung's Profile website. http://tabsoft.co/23V6ofi .

Its scope covers injection practices from beginning to end: choice of device through to disposal. It elucidates the common habits that patients practice and the complications and other obstacles they face. Only in this manner can practical and targeted recommendations be made. A new set of insulin delivery recommendations has been developed and is also published in this issue.\n\n【222】\n\n【223】*   Frid A.H.\n*   Kreugel G.\n*   Grassi G.\n*   et al.\n\n【224】New insulin delivery recommendations.\n\n【225】_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2016; 91 : 1231-1255\n\n【226】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (177)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【227】Individual countries and local regions should revise and publish their own ITQ findings as well as insulin delivery guidelines in light of the new recommendations and the worldwide ITQ survey data reported herein.\n\n【228】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【229】Our sincerest thanks to the 423 centers in 42 countries throughout the world (see Supplemental Table 9 , available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org )\n\n【230】\n\n【231】Fitter4Diabetes website. http://www.fitter4diabetes.com .

Keep from freezing.\n\n【46】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【47】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【48】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【49】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【50】IIt is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly and does not cause unwanted effects.\n\n【51】This medicine may cause diarrhea, and in some cases it can be severe. It may occur 2 months or more after you or your child stop using this medicine. Do not take any medicine to treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor. If you have any questions or if mild diarrhea continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【52】This medicine may cause some people to become dizzy. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy.\n\n【53】Do not use polyurethane condoms during treatment and for 7 days after using the gel. You may use another form of condom (eg, latex or polyisoprene) for added protection against pregnancy or HIV.\n\n【54】This medicine may cause vaginal yeast infections (candidiasis). Check with your doctor right away if you have itching of the vagina or outside genitals, pain during sexual intercourse, or thick, white curd-like vaginal discharge without odor or with mild odor.\n\n【55】Vaginal medicines usually leak out of the vagina during treatment. To keep the medicine from getting on your clothing, wear a minipad or sanitary napkin. Do not use tampons since they may soak up the medicine.\n\n【56】To help clear up your infection completely and make sure it does not return, good health habits are also required.\n\n【57】*   Wear cotton panties (or panties or pantyhose with cotton crotches) instead of synthetic (eg, nylon or rayon) panties.\n*   Wear only freshly washed panties daily.\n\n【58】Do not have sex or use vaginal products (eg, tampons or douches) during treatment and for 3 days after using the gel. Do not have sexual intercourse while you are using the cream. Having sexual intercourse may reduce the strength of the medicine. This may cause the medicine to not work as well.\n\n【59】Do not use latex (rubber) contraceptive products such as condoms, diaphragms, or cervical caps for 72 hours after stopping treatment with vaginal clindamycin cream. The cream contains oils that weaken or harm the latex products, causing them to not work properly to prevent pregnancy. If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.\n\n【60】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【61】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【62】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【63】#### More common\n\n【64】1.  Itching of the vagina or genital area\n2.  pain during sexual intercourse\n3.  thick, white vaginal discharge with no odor or with mild odor\n\n【65】#### Less common\n\n【66】1.

We divided the patients according to the prescription of DPP-4 inhibitor with or without dose adjustment according to estimated glomerular filtration rate. The incidences of emergency department visits, hypoglycemia, and mortality were assessed using hazard ratios estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Approximately 40% of patients with T2DM and CKD were prescribed an inappropriate dose of DPP-4 inhibitor from 2009 through 2011; this proportion decreased to 24.4% in 2015. Hazard ratios (95% CIs) for inappropriate vs appropriate dosing of DPP-4 inhibitors were 1.115 (1.005-1.237) for mortality, 1.074 (1.018-1.133) for emergency department visits, and 1.192 (1.054-1.349) for severe hypoglycemia after multivariable adjustment for confounding factors.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】One of every 3 patients with T2DM and CKD received inappropriate dosing of DPP-4 inhibitor, which was associated with high risk of emergency department visits, severe hypoglycemia, and mortality.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACCORD ( Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ), ADVANCE ( Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), DPP-4 ( dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ), eGFR ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ), EXAMINE ( Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care ), HR ( hazard ratio ), MDRD ( Modification of Diet in Renal Disease ), NHID ( National Health Information Database ), SAVOR-TIMI 53 ( Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53 ), SD ( standard deviations ), T2DM ( type 2 diabetes mellitus ), TECOS ( Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes With Sitagliptin ), VADT ( Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial )\n\n【11】The prevalence of diabetes in Koreans 30 years and older increased steadily from 5.6% in 2006 to 8.0% in 2013.\n\n【12】\n\n【13】*   Noh J.\n*   Han K.D.\n*   Ko S.H.\n*   Ko K.S.\n*   Park C.Y.\n\n【14】Trends in the pervasiveness of type 2 diabetes, impaired fasting glucose and co-morbidities during an 8-year-follow-up of nationwide Korean population.\n\n【15】_Sci Rep._ 2017; 7 : 46656\n\n【16】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (35)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【17】Complications associated with diabetes have increased concomitantly; 38.8% of patients with end-stage renal disease were found to have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 1.2% of patients with T2DM had end-stage renal disease.\n\n【18】\n\n【19】*   Noh J.\n\n【20】The diabetes epidemic in Korea.\n\n【21】_Endocrinol Metab (Seoul)._ 2016; 31 : 349-353\n\n【22】*   Google Scholar\n\n【23】\n\n【24】\n\n【25】*   Ko S.H.\n*   Han K.\n*   Lee Y.H.\n*   et al.\n\n【26】Past and current status of adult type 2 diabetes mellitus management in Korea: a National Health Insurance Service database analysis.\n\n【27】_Diabetes Metab J._ 2018; 42 : 93-100\n\n【28】*   Google Scholar\n\n【29】The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with T2DM was 27.3% according to the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 2011-2013.\n\n【30】\n\n【31】*   Park J.I.\n*   Baek H.\n*   Jung H.H.\n\n【32】Prevalence of chronic kidney disease in Korea: the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 2011-2013.\n\n【33】_J Korean Med Sci._ 2016; 31 : 915-923\n\n【34】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (81)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【35】In patients with T2DM, the presence of CKD markedly increases cardiovascular risk and mortality.\n\n【36】\n\n【37】*   Fox C.S.\n*   Matsushita K.\n*   Woodward M.\n*   et al.\n\n【38】Associations of kidney disease measures with mortality and end-stage renal disease in individuals with and without diabetes: a meta-analysis.\n\n【39】_Lancet._ 2013; 380 : 1662-1673\n\n【40】*   Google Scholar\n\n【41】\n\n【42】\n\n【43】*   Foley R.N.\n*   Murray A.M.\n*   Li S.\n*   et al.\n\n【44】Chronic kidney disease and the risk for cardiovascular disease, renal replacement, and death in the United States Medicare population, 1998 to 1999.\n\n【45】_J Am Soc Nephrol._ 2005; 16 : 489-495\n\n【46】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (816)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【47】\n\n【48】\n\n【49】*   Kim K.J.\n*   Kwon T.Y.\n*   Yu S.\n*   et al.\n\n【50】Ten-year mortality trends for adults with and without diabetes mellitus in South Korea, 2003 to 2013.\n\n【51】_Diabetes Metab J._ 2018; 42 : 394-401\n\n【52】*   Google Scholar\n\n【53】In addition, in people with T2DM, CKD is a significant risk factor for the development of hypoglycemia.\n\n【54】\n\n【55】*   Moen M.F.\n*   Zhan M.\n*   Hsu V.D.\n*   et al.\n\n【56】Frequency of hypoglycemia and its significance in chronic kidney disease.\n\n【57】_Clin J Am Soc Nephrol._ 2009; 4 : 1121-1127\n\n【58】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (308)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【59】\n\n【60】\n\n【61】*   Yun J.S.\n*   Ko S.H.\n\n【62】Risk factors and adverse outcomes of severe hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【63】_Diabetes Metab J._ 2016; 40 : 423-432\n\n【64】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (43)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【65】Clearance of many drugs decreases with decreasing kidney function, and this results in prolonged exposure to higher levels of the drug or its metabolites and potentially adverse effects. Patients with moderate to severe CKD (stages 3-5) are at greatest risk for this occurrence. According to the Korean Diabetes Fact Sheet 2015, metformin accounted for 80.4% of total prescriptions in 2013, and sulfonylurea accounted for 58.5%.

Some types of DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and vildagliptin, require dose reduction in patients with renal impairment because of their predominantly renal route of excretion, but other types of DPP-4 inhibitors (eg, linagliptin) are exempt from dose adjustment because they are excreted via the enterohepatic system.\n\n【70】Limited real-world information is available regarding rates of dose adjustment and the safety of dose adjustment in patients with T2DM and CKD. The objectives of this study were to estimate the level of inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors and to assess the risk of death, emergency department (ED)visits, and severe hypoglycemia according to appropriate and inappropriate doses of DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with T2DM and CKD.\n\n【71】Methods\n-------\n\n【72】### Study Database\n\n【73】Data for the analysis were from the National Health Information Database (NHID), which is a public database on health care utilization and health screening that contains sociodemographic and mortality information for the entire population of South Korea. The NHID contains data for 2002 through 2015. The NHID, which is produced by the National Health Insurance Service, was launched by integrating 375 insurance associations in 2000 and provides longitudinal data for 97% of the Korean population, with linkage to the National Death Registry\n\n【74】\n\n【75】*   Lee J.\n*   Lee J.S.\n*   Park S.H.\n*   Shin S.A.\n*   Kim K.\n\n【76】Cohort profile: the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC), South Korea.\n\n【77】_Int J Epidemiol._ 2017; 46 : e15\n\n【78】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【79】\n\n【80】\n\n【81】*   Song S.O.\n*   Jung C.H.\n*   Song Y.D.\n*   et al.\n\n【82】Background and data configuration process of a nationwide population-based study using the Korean National Health Insurance System.\n\n【83】_Diabetes Metab J._ 2014; 38 : 395-403\n\n【84】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (413)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【85】and the national health screening program.

Approval was obtained from the institutional review board of Kangbuk Samsung Hospital for the study protocol.\n\n【92】### Patient Selection and Procedures\n\n【93】This was a national observational cohort study that included 82,332 patients aged 30 to 75 years with T2DM and CKD who were prescribed DPP-4 inhibitors from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014. From January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014, 22,692,503 individuals participated in the national health screening program. Of these, the following individuals were excluded: age younger than 30 years or older than 75 years, eGFR determined not by MDRD equation, eGFR lower than 15 mL/min per 1.73 m  or higher than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m  , absence of diabetes, absence of DPP-4 inhibitor prescription within 1 year after the national health screening program, missing data, history of end-stage renal disease, or death within 1 year after the national health screening. Finally, the total number of eligible participants in this study was 82,332. Chronic kidney disease was defined based on the eGFR, which is based on the serum creatinine level. The eGFR was calculated using the MDRD GFR equation: GFR = 186 × (Serum Creatinine)  \\* (age)  \\* 0.742 (if female).\n\n【94】\n\n【95】*   Levey A.S.\n*   Bosch J.P.\n*   Lewis J.B.\n*   Greene T.\n*   Rogers N.\n*   Roth D.\n\n【96】Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Group  \nA more accurate method to estimate glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine: a new prediction equation.\n\n【97】_Ann Intern Med._ 1999; 130 : 461-470\n\n【98】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (13235)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【99】A patient’s degree of CKD was assigned according to the definitions of the National Kidney Foundation. We examined the following groups of patients on the basis of CKD: moderate CKD (stage 3; eGFR, 30-59 mL/min per 1.73 m  ) and severe CKD (stage 4; eGFR, 15-29 mL/min per 1.73 m  ). The DPP-4 inhibitors were selected according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System; codes A10BH04+A10BD13 (alogliptin), A10BH91 (anagliptin), A10BH06+A10BD18 (gemigliptin), A10BH05+A10BD11 (linagliptin), A10BH03+A10BD10 (saxagliptin), A10BH01+A10BD07 (Sitagliptin), A10BH90 (teneligliptin), and A10BH02+A10BD08 (vildagliptin) were considered. Appropriate or inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors was defined based on the daily dose of DPP-4 inhibitor, the patient’s eGFR, and the manufacturer’s guidelines. To allow adequate follow-up time to address the research questions and ensure that any observed absence of health care events was due to true medical inactivity rather than cessation of care, patients were required to have 12 months of continuous post–index date data. The index date was defined for each patient as the date of the first prescription or pharmacy dispensation for any DPP-4 inhibitor. Treatment initiation episodes were defined as prescription/filling of a prescription for any DPP-4 inhibitor.\n\n【100】### Outcomes\n\n【101】Outcomes were all-cause death as well as ED visits and severe hypoglycemia. All-cause death was defined according to the National Death Registry. Emergency department visits were defined according to the emergency medical care charge code (AC101-AC105), which is necessary to claims for emergency management regardless of diagnosis and hospitalization. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an ED visit due to hypoglycemia ( _International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification_ codes E1163, E1263, E1363, E1463, and E16.x).\n\n【102】### Data Analyses\n\n【103】Baseline characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Categorical variables are described as frequencies and percentages and continuous variables as mean ± SD. We compared baseline characteristics of participants who received appropriate or inappropriate doses of DPP-4 inhibitors. Continuous variables were compared using the Student _t_ test, and categorical variables were compared using the χ  test. According to appropriate or inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors, incidences of outcomes were estimated using the total follow-up period for death, number of ED visits, and number of severe hypoglycemia episodes. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was also conducted. All outcome analyses were stratified according to appropriate or inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis while controlling for baseline covariates. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs are reported for outcomes. Inappropriate dosing effects in subgroups defined based on eGFR and other antidiabetic medications and potential interactions were evaluated by Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, and results are presented in a forest plot. We deemed a 2-tailed _P_ <.05 to be significant. Analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) and R programming, version 3.4.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\n\n【104】Results\n-------\n\n【105】We first analyzed the level of inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2015. Prescriptions of DPP-4 inhibitors to patients with T2DM increased by 11.6-fold (from 50,191 persons to 580,443 persons) during this period. At the same time, prescription of DPP-4 inhibitors to patients with T2DM with a GFR less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m  increased similarly by 10.9-fold (from 6344 persons to 69,109 persons). The proportion of patients with T2DM and CKD who received inappropriate doses of DPP-4 inhibitors was approximately 40% from 2009 through 2011. This proportion decreased starting in 2012 and reached 24.4% in 2015; at the same time, the use of new DPP-4 inhibitors (eg, linagliptin and gemigliptin) that do not require dosage adjustment in any stage of CKD increased starting in 2012 ( Supplemental Figures 1 and 2 , available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ). However, the proportion of inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors that do require dosage adjustment did not change in the same period ( Supplemental Figure 1 ).\n\n【106】### Characteristics of Inappropriate and Appropriate Dosing DPP-4 Inhibitor Groups\n\n【107】Of 82,332 persons, 21,559 (26.2%) were prescribed inappropriate dosing of DPP-4 inhibitor. Several differences were noted between patients receiving an inappropriate dose of DPP-4 inhibitors and those receiving an appropriate dose ( Table1 ). There were slightly fewer male than female patients in the inappropriate dosing group (46.8%), whereas there were slightly more male than female patients in the appropriate dosing group (51.0%) ( _P_ <.001). Patients in the inappropriate dosing group were older (mean ± SD age: 64.73±7.65 years vs 64.28±7.67 years; _P_ <.001); had lower mean ± SD diastolic blood pressure (76.5±10.0 mm Hg vs 76.9±9.9 mm Hg; _P_ <.001), glucose level (139.71±49.17 mg/dL \\[7.75±2.73 mmol/L\\] vs 141.62±48.55 mg/dL \\[7.86±2.69 mmol/L\\]; _P_ <.001), and eGFR (48±8.77 mL/min per 1.73 m  vs 52.6±8.07 mL/min per 1.73 m  ; _P_ <.001); and had a higher mean ± SD total cholesterol level (179.24±43.16 mg/dL \\[4.64±1.12 mmol/L\\] vs 178.5±41.91 mg/dL \\[4.62±1.09 mmol/L\\]; _P_ <.001) than those in the appropriate dosing group. Patients in the inappropriate dosing group were also more likely to receive insulin (18.84% vs 16.35%; _P_ <.001) and meglitinide (2.09% vs 1.83%; _P_ \\=.02) and less likely to receive sulfonylurea (59.68% vs 63.37%; _P_ <.001) and metformin (58.78% vs 64.36%; _P_ <.001) than those in the appropriate dosing group.\n\n【108】Table 1 Baseline Characteristics of Study Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease by the Appropriate and Inappropriate Dosing of Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors, 2012 to 2014\n\n| Characteristic | Inappropriate dosing group (n=21,559) | Appropriate dosing group (n=60,773) | _P_ valueaDerived from the t test for continuous variables or the χ2 test for categorical variables. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age (y), mean ± SD | 64.73±7.65 | 64.28±7.67 | <.001 |\n| Age group (No. \\[%\\]) |  |  | <.001 |\n| 30-39 y | 72 (0.33) | 194 (0.32) |  |\n| 40-49 y | 935 (4.34) | 2965 (4.88) |  |\n| 50-59 y | 3517 (16.31) | 9591 (15.78) |  |\n| 60-69 y | 9418 (43.68) | 28,738 (47.29) |  |\n| 70-75 y | 7617 (35.33) | 19,285 (31.73) |  |\n| Sex (%) |  |  | <.001 |\n| Men | 10,083 (46.77) | 30,990 (50.99) |  |\n| Women | 11,476 (53.23) | 29,783 (49.01) |  |\n| Alcohol drinking (No. \\[%\\]) |  |  | <.001 |\n| None/mild | 16,536 (76.7) | 44,926 (73.92) |  |\n| Moderate | 4319 (20.03) | 13,646 (22.45) |  |\n| Heavy | 704 (3.27) | 2201 (3.62) |  |\n| Smoking (No. \\[%\\]) |  |  | <.001 |\n| Nonsmoker | 14,309 (66.37) | 38,851 (63.93) |  |\n| Former smoker | 3961 (18.37) | 12,268 (20.19) |  |\n| Current smoker | 3289 (15.26) | 9654 (15.89) |  |\n| Glucose (mg/dL \\[mmol/L\\]), mean ± SD | 139.71±49.17 (7.75±2.73) | 141.62±48.55 (7.86±2.69) | <.001 |\n| Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg), mean ± SD | 128.69±16.14 | 128.76±15.8 | .57 |\n| Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), mean ± SD | 76.54±10.03 | 76.86±9.9 | <.001 |\n| Estimated glomerular filtration rate, mean ± SDbEstimated glomerular filtration rates are estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. | 48±8.77 | 52.6±8.07 | <.001 |\n| Total cholesterol (mg/dL \\[mmol/L\\]), mean ± SD | 179.24±43.16 (4.64±1.12) | 178.5±41.91 (4.62±1.09) | .03 |\n| Other antidiabetic treatment (No. \\[%\\]) |  |  |  |\n| Insulin | 4062 (18.84) | 9934 (16.35) | <.001 |\n| Sulfonylurea | 12,867 (59.68) | 38,512 (63.37) | <.001 |\n| Metformin | 12,672 (58.78) | 39,111 (64.36) | <.001 |\n| Meglitinide | 451 (2.09) | 1111 (1.83) | .02 |\n| Thiazolidinediones | 2069 (9.6) | 5597 (9.21) | .09 |\n| Acarbose | 1680 (7.79) | 4844 (7.97) | .41 |\n\n【110】a Derived from the _t_ test for continuous variables or the χ  test for categorical variables.\n\n【111】b Estimated glomerular filtration rates are estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation.\n\n【112】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【113】### Associations Between Inappropriate Dosing With DPP-4 Inhibitors and Death, ED Visits, and Severe Hypoglycemia\n\n【114】A total of 1663 deaths occurred overall (529 in the inappropriate dosing group and 1134 in the appropriate dosing group) ( Table 2 ). The incidence of deaths in the appropriate dosing group (14.14 deaths per 1000 person-days; 95% CI, 13.34-14.99 deaths per 1000 person-days) was lower than that in the inappropriate dosing group (17.34 events per 1000 person-days; 95% CI, 15.92-18.88 events per 1000 person-days; log-rank _P_ <.001) ( Figure 1A ), and the HR of inappropriate dosing was 1.149 (95% CI, 1.036-1.275). In multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling, the incidence of death was significantly higher in the inappropriate dosing group than in the appropriate dosing group (adjusted HR=1.115; 95% CI, 1.005-1.237) ( Table 2 ) after adjusting for age, sex, smoking and alcohol drinking status, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol level, other antidiabetic drug treatment, and history of ED visits or severe hypoglycemia events. Although the incidence of ED visits in the appropriate dosing group (64.52 events per 1000 person-days; 95% CI, 62.73-66.36 events per 1000 person-days) was not different from that in the inappropriate dosing group (66.58 events per 1000 person-days; 95% CI, 63.65-69.66 events per 1000 person-days; log-rank _P_ \\=.60) ( Figure 1B ), the incidence of severe hypoglycemia and ED visits due to hypoglycemia in the appropriate dosing group (10.24 events per 1000 person-days; 95% CI, 9.55-10.97 events per 1000 person-days) was notably lower than that in the inappropriate dosing group (12.54 events per 1000 person-days; 95% CI, 11.33-13.88 events per 1000 person-days; log-rank _P_ \\=.03) ( Figure 1C ). Table 2 also shows that the inappropriate dosing group had higher risk of ED visits (HR=1.076; 95% CI, 1.02-1.135) and severe hypoglycemia (HR=1.199; 95% CI, 1.061-1.357) than the inappropriate dosing group after adjusting for age, sex, and history of ED visits or severe hypoglycemia events.

Even after adjustment for available confounding factors, adjusted HRs for death in patients who were prescribed the inappropriate dose of DPP-4 inhibitor were virtually unaffected in CKD stage 3 (1.12; 95% CI, 1.005-1.248; _P_ \\=.04), but adjusted HRs for death in the group that received the inappropriate dose of DPP-4 inhibitors was not significant in CKD stage 4 (0.885; 95% CI, 0.617-1.27; _P_ \\=.51). The adjusted HRs for ED visits and severe hypoglycemia in the inappropriate dosing group increased with increasing CKD stage. In multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling, adjusted HRs for ED visits and severe hypoglycemia were 1.056 (95% CI, 0.999-1.116; _P_ \\=.05) and 1.131 (95% CI, 0.993-1.289; _P_ \\=.06), respectively, in patients with CKD stage 3 with inappropriate DPP-4 inhibitor dosing and 1.252 (95% CI, 0.987-1.588; _P_ \\=.06) and 1.609 (95% CI, 1.065-2.432; _P_ \\=.02) in patients with CKD stage 4 with inappropriate DPP-4 inhibitor dosing ( Figure 2 ).\n\n【125】Figure 2 Risk of death, emergency department visits, and severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (stage 3 or 4) by patterns of medication prescription using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis while controlling for baseline covariates.

First, we analyzed the safety of an inappropriate dose of DPP-4 inhibitor monotherapy. Analysis of patients with T2DM and CKD on only DPP-4 inhibitor monotherapy revealed that the risks of death (HR=0.928; 95% CI, 0.648-1.33; _P_ \\=.69), ED visits (HR=1.011; 95% CI, 0.878-1.164; _P_ \\=.88), and severe hypoglycemia (HR=1.243; 95% CI, 0.683-2.263; _P_ \\=.48) were not different between the appropriate and inappropriate dosing groups. In dual therapy with DPP-4 inhibitor and metformin, the adjusted HR of deaths (HR=1.448; 95% CI, 1.112-1.886; _P_ \\=.006) and ED visits (HR=1.146; 95% CI, 1.007-1.305; _P_ \\=.04) were significantly higher in the inappropriate dosing group than in the appropriate dosing group. However, the adjusted HR of severe hypoglycemia in the inappropriate dosing group was not significantly different compared with the appropriate dosing group (HR=1.485; 95% CI, 0.918-2.403; _P_ \\=.11). In patients treated with a combination of DPP-4 inhibitor, metformin, and other antidiabetic medications, the risks of death (HR=1.149; 95% CI, 1.02-1.294; _P_ \\=.02), ED visits (HR=1.094; 95% CI, 1.026-1.167; _P_ \\=.006), and severe hypoglycemia (HR=1.237; 95% CI, 1.086-1.41; _P_ \\=.001) were significantly higher in the inappropriate dosing group than in the appropriate dosing group after adjusting for all available confounding factors ( Figure 2 ).\n\n【129】Discussion\n----------\n\n【130】The findings from this nationwide cohort study were that inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors was associated with a 15% increased risk of death from all causes in patients with T2DM with CKD stage 3 or 4 compared with appropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors. These findings were supported by the observations that inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors was accompanied by a 7.6% increased risk of ED visits and a 19.9% increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, whereas risks of ED visits and severe hypoglycemia in patients treated with inappropriate doses of DPP-4 inhibitor increased with an increase in CKD stage in subgroup analysis. Risk of death, ED visits, and severe hypoglycemia with appropriate DPP-4 inhibitor dosage persisted after adjustment for possible confounders. Although the results of an observational study should be interpreted with caution, the questions that the present study asks cannot be answered with a prospective controlled design. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this nationwide observational study of 82,332 patients with T2DM and CKD is the first and largest to examine the associations between death from all causes, number of ED visits, and number of episodes of severe hypoglycemia according to appropriate or inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors.\n\n【131】The DPP-4 inhibitors have advantages over older agents, which can cause weight gain and tend to cause hypoglycemia, and are, therefore, a welcome addition as second-line therapy in patients when metformin is no longer sufficient.\n\n【132】\n\n【133】American Diabetes Association  \n8\\.

According to toxicological studies in animals, the no observed adverse effect levels based on area under the curve and maximum concentration for outcomes in animals treated with sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin, and linagliptin were 6 or more, 7 or more, more than 29, more than 27, and 40 or more times higher than the usual clinical levels, respectively.

Moreover, patients treated with an appropriate dose of DPP-4 inhibitor and metformin had 30% lower mortality (95% CI, 0.521-0.962; _P_ \\=.027) than those treated with an inappropriate dose of DPP-4 inhibitors and metformin. Therefore, when prescribing combinations of antidiabetic drugs, DPP-4 inhibitors should be prescribed according to renal function and manufacturer guidelines.\n\n【245】Hypoglycemia is the most common and important treatment-related adverse event in patients with diabetes. Many previous studies have established that patients with T2DM and CKD have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, which is also associated with an excessive mortality rate in these patients. According to a large retrospective observational study of 243,222 patients followed up at the Veterans Health Administration who had 2,040,206 glucose measurements, with mortality determined 1 day after glucose measurement, the risk of hypoglycemia in a patient with T2DM and CKD was 2-fold greater than that of a patient with T2DM without CKD, and the risk of 1-day mortality also increased with hypoglycemia.\n\n【246】\n\n【247】*   Moen M.F.\n*   Zhan M.\n*   Hsu V.D.\n*   et al.\n\n【248】Frequency of hypoglycemia and its significance in chronic kidney disease.\n\n【249】_Clin J Am Soc Nephrol._ 2009; 4 : 1121-1127\n\n【250】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (308)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【251】During the past decade, 3 large prospective trials—ACCORD\n\n【252】\n\n【253】*   Gerstein H.C.\n*   Miller M.E.\n*   et al.\n\n【254】Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Study Group  \nEffects of intensive glucose lowering in type 2 diabetes.\n\n【255】_N Engl J Med._ 2008; 358 : 2545-2559\n\n【256】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (6623)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【257】(Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes), ADVANCE\n\n【258】\n\n【259】*   Patel A.\n*   MacMahon S.\n*   et al.\n\n【260】ADVANCE Collaborative Group  \nIntensive blood glucose control and vascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n【261】_N Engl J Med._ 2008; 358 : 2560-2572\n\n【262】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (6129)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【263】(Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation), and VADT\n\n【264】\n\n【265】*   Duckworth W.\n*   Abraira C.\n*   Moritz T.\n*   et al.\n\n【266】Glucose control and vascular complications in veterans with type 2 diabetes.\n\n【267】_N Engl J Med._ 2009; 360 : 129-139\n\n【268】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (3977)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【269】(Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial)—have found that an event of severe hypoglycemia is associated with increased risk of subsequent mortality.

Possible reasons for this may be that there were only 2671 persons (3.2% of the study population) with T2DM and CKD stage 4. This sample size may have been too small to accurately determine the relationship between mortality and DPP-4 inhibitor dosing in patients with CKD stage 4. Second, patients with T2DM and CKD stage 4 had 2- to 3-fold higher mortality rates than patients with T2DM and CKD stage 3 in the present study. Increased mortality due to other causes may also have confounded the association between death and DPP-4 inhibitor dosing in these patients. Third, an appropriate DPP-4 inhibitor dose for patients with CKD stage 3 might be inappropriate and harmful in patients with CKD stage 4. A previous study of a single dose of sitagliptin showed that the area under the plasma concentration curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity was approximately 3.8-fold higher for CKD stage 4 relative to the normal renal function controls.\n\n【283】\n\n【284】*   Bergman A.J.\n*   Cote J.\n*   Yi B.\n*   et al.\n\n【285】Effect of renal insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor.\n\n【286】_Diabetes Care._ 2007; 30 : 1862-1864\n\n【287】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (162)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【288】Hence, the dose of sitagliptin was decreased to be one-quarter of that prescribed to patients with T2DM and normal renal function. However, that same study also showed that time after administration of a drug when the maximum plasma concentration is reached and terminal half-life increased with decreasing renal function and that in clinical practice, a multiple-dose situation is more likely than a single-dose situation; thus, this dose reduction could be insufficient.\n\n【289】Rates of nonadherence to renal dosing guidelines vary according to methodological approach.

A recent systemic review of 18 studies that addressed adherence to renal dose adjustment showed that the prevalence of renally inappropriate drug use ranged from 1% to 37% in outpatient settings.\n\n【296】\n\n【297】*   Dorks M.\n*   Allers K.\n*   Schmiemann G.\n*   Herget-Rosenthal S.\n*   Hoffmann F.\n\n【298】Inappropriate medication in non-hospitalized patients with renal insufficiency: a systematic review.\n\n【299】_J Am Geriatr Soc._ 2017; 65 : 853-862\n\n【300】*   Google Scholar\n\n【301】Similar to this previous study, we found that the prevalence of inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors varied from 24% to 43%. Although the prevalence of inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors decreased over time due to increasing use of DPP-4 inhibitors that do not require dosage adjustment with CKD stage, the prevalence of inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors requiring dosage adjustment for all stages of CKD did not change during the study. A recent systemic review of 49 studies reported that only 1 study found an association between inappropriate drug use and mortality in patients with CKD. Breton et al\n\n【302】\n\n【303】*   Breton G.\n*   Froissart M.\n*   Janus N.\n*   et al.\n\n【304】Inappropriate drug use and mortality in community-dwelling elderly with impaired kidney function: the Three-City population-based study.\n\n【305】_Nephrol Dial Transplant._ 2011; 26 : 2852-2859\n\n【306】*   Google Scholar\n\n【307】reported that exposure to an inappropriate dose of drugs was independently associated with higher all-cause mortality (HR=1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9). In the present study, we analyzed only the inappropriate dosing of DPP-4 inhibitors and found that this was independently associated with higher all-cause mortality (HR=1.15; 95% CI, 1.04-1.28).\n\n【308】To our knowledge, this is the first observational study to examine the associations between death from all causes, ED visits, and incidence of severe hypoglycemia episodes with appropriate or inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitors. The strengths of this study are its large size and national representation. In addition, the present results were consistent across sensitivity and subgroup analyses. This study also has some limitations. First, it was a retrospective observational study and, as such, was prone to the limitations inherent to this study design. Real-world patients may differ in many aspects from the patients in a controlled study. Although the analyses were adjusted for most available demographic and clinical variables, data on potentially significant confounders, such as overall glucose level, information about the appropriateness of other classes of medications, and other medical care, were not available for adjustment. Second, medication adherence was not considered because the database contains only information about filled prescriptions. Third, due to the retrospective design, CKD stages determined by the single-time measurement of serum creatinine level can misclassify patients and be changed during the observed period. Fourth, with respect to the risk of hypoglycemia, inappropriate dosing of other antidiabetic drugs, especially sulfonylurea, could be a bias in this study even after we adjusted for antidiabetic drug treatment in multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Finally, this study did not address the mechanisms linking inappropriate doses of DPP-4 inhibitor and associated death, ED visits, or severe hypoglycemia. Although randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm or disprove these results, clinical trials to test the safety of inappropriate dosing in patients with T2DM and CKD with DPP-4 inhibitors may not be possible. The high-quality observational data provided by the present study, therefore, may represent the most readily available, highest level of evidence for this situation.\n\n【309】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【310】The analysis of nationwide data from patients with T2DM and CKD stage 3 revealed that inappropriate dosing with DPP-4 inhibitor was associated with a statistically significantly higher risk of death from all causes compared with treatment with an appropriate dose of DPP-4 inhibitor; however, this held true only for combination therapy (dual and higher), not monotherapy with DPP-4 inhibitor. Inappropriate DPP-4 inhibitor dosing was also associated with a significantly higher risk of ED visits and severe hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM and CKD stages 3 and 4 than treatment with an appropriate dose of DPP-4 inhibitor. The present results have important therapeutic implications for the prescription of DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with T2DM and CKD stage 3 or 4.\n\n【311】Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------\n\n【312】*   Download .pdf (.05 MB)\n    \n    Help with pdf files\n    \n    Supplemental Figure 1\n    \n\n【313】*   Download .pdf (.05 MB)\n    \n    Help with pdf files\n    \n    Supplemental Figure 2\n    \n\n【314】Supplemental material can be found online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org .

{"seq_id": "ab945e36-1182-46c3-bd40-a2713dfae2d0", "title": "Estrogen And Progestin Oral Contraceptives (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Estrogen And Progestin Oral Contraceptives (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】  \n\n【4】Oral contraceptives are known also as the Pill, OCs, BCs, BC tablets, or birth control pills. This medicine usually contains two types of hormones, estrogens and progestins and, when taken properly, prevents pregnancy. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization is prevented. Although oral contraceptives have other effects that help prevent a pregnancy from occurring, this is the main action.\n\n【5】Sometimes a woman's egg can still develop even though the medication is taken once each day, especially when more than 24 hours pass between two doses. In almost all cases when the medicine was taken properly and an egg develops, fertilization can still be stopped by oral contraceptives. This is because oral contraceptives also thicken cervical mucus at the opening of the uterus. This makes it hard for the partner's sperm to reach the egg. In addition, oral contraceptives change the uterus lining just enough so that an egg will not stop in the uterus to develop. All of these effects make it difficult to become pregnant when properly taking an oral contraceptive.\n\n【6】No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Studies show that fewer than one of each one hundred women correctly using oral contraceptives becomes pregnant during the first year of use. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective. Using condoms, diaphragms, progestin-only oral contraceptives, or spermicides is not as effective as using oral contraceptives containing estrogens and progestins. Discuss with your health care professional your options for birth control.\n\n【7】The triphasic cycle product of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol (the brand name Ortho Tri-Cyclen) and norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (the brand name Estrostep) can be used for the treatment of moderate acne only if the patient is at least 15 years old, has acne that has not improved with topical anti-acne medicines, has gotten approval from her doctor, has begun to have menstrual periods, desires an oral contraceptive for birth control, and plans to stay on it for at least 6 months.\n\n【8】Sometimes these preparations can be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.\n\n【9】Oral contraceptives are available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】### Importance of Diet\n\n【11】Make certain your health care professional knows if you are on any special diet, such as a low-sodium or low-sugar diet.\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】This medicine is frequently used for birth control in teenage females and has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems than it does in adults. Some teenagers may need extra information on the importance of taking this medication exactly as prescribed.\n\n【17】### Pregnancy\n\n【18】Oral contraceptives are not recommended for use during pregnancy and should be discontinued if you become pregnant or think you are pregnant. When oral contraceptives were accidently taken early in pregnancy, problems in the fetus did not occur. Women who are not breast-feeding may begin to take oral contraceptives two weeks after having a baby.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】Oral contraceptives pass into the breast milk and can change the content or lower the amount of breast milk. Also, they may shorten a woman's ability to breast-feed by about 1 month, especially when the mother is only partially breast-feeding. Because the amount of hormones is so small in low-dose contraceptives, your doctor may allow you to begin using an oral contraceptive after you have been breast-feeding for a while. However, it may be necessary for you to use another method of birth control or to stop breast-feeding while taking oral contraceptives.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【23】### Other Interactions\n\n【24】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【25】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【26】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【27】*   Abnormal changes in menstrual or uterine bleeding or\n*   Endometriosis or\n*   Fibroid tumors of the uterus—Oral contraceptives usually improve these female conditions but sometimes they can make them worse or make the diagnosis of these problems more difficult.\n\n【28】*   Blood clots (or history of) or\n*   Heart or circulation disease or\n*   Stroke (or history of)—If these conditions are already present, oral contraceptives may have a greater chance of causing blood clots or circulation problems, especially in women who smoke tobacco. Otherwise, oral contraceptives may help prevent circulation and heart disease if you are healthy and do not smoke.\n\n【29】*   Breast disease (not involving cancer)—Oral contraceptives usually protect against certain breast diseases, such as breast cysts or breast lumps; however, your doctor may want to follow your condition more closely.\n\n【30】*   Cancer, including breast cancer (or history of or family history of)—Oral contraceptives may worsen some cancers, especially when breast, cervical, or uterine cancers already exist. Use of oral contraceptives is not recommended if you have any of these conditions. If you have a family history of breast disease, oral contraceptives may still be a good choice but you may need to be tested more often.\n\n【31】*   Chorea gravidarum or\n*   Gallbladder disease or gallstones (or history of) or\n*   High blood cholesterol or\n*   Liver disease (or history of, including jaundice during pregnancy or oral contraceptive use) or\n*   Mental depression (or history of)—Oral contraceptives may make these conditions worse or, rarely, cause them to occur again. Oral contraceptives may still be a good choice but you may need to be tested more often.\n\n【32】*   Diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes)—Use of oral contraceptives may cause an increase, usually only a small increase, in your blood sugar and usually does not affect the amount of diabetes medicine that you take. You or your doctor will want to test for any changes in your blood sugar for 12 to 24 months after starting to take oral contraceptives in case the dose of your diabetes medicine needs to be changed.\n\n【33】*   Epilepsy (seizures) (or history of) or\n*   Heart or circulation problems or\n*   High blood pressure (hypertension) or\n*   Migraine headaches—Oral contraceptives may cause fluid build-up and may cause these conditions to become worse; however, some people have fewer migraine headaches when they use oral contraceptives.\n\n【34】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【35】To make using oral contraceptives as safe and reliable as possible, you should understand how and when to take them and what effects may be expected.\n\n【36】A paper with information for the patient will be given to you with your filled prescription, and will provide many details concerning the use of oral contraceptives. Read this paper carefully and ask your health care professional if you need additional information or explanation.\n\n【37】Take this medicine with food to help prevent nausea that might occur during the first few weeks. Nausea usually disappears with continued use or if the medicine is taken at bedtime.\n\n【38】When you begin to use oral contraceptives, your body will require at least 7 days to adjust before a pregnancy will be prevented. You will need to use an additional birth control method for at least 7 days. Some doctors recommend using an additional method of birth control for the first cycle (or 3 weeks) to ensure full protection. Follow the advice of your doctor or other health care professional.\n\n【39】Try to take the doses no more than 24 hours apart to reduce the possibility of side effects and to prevent pregnancy. Since one of the most important factors in the proper use of oral contraceptives is taking every dose exactly on schedule, you should never let your tablet supply run out. When possible, try to keep an extra month's supply of tablets on hand and replace it monthly.\n\n【40】It is very important that you keep the tablets in their original container and take the tablets in the same order that they appear in the container. The containers help you keep track of which tablets to take next. Different colored tablets in the same package contain different amounts of hormones or are placebos (tablets that do not contain hormones). The effectiveness of the medicine is reduced if the tablets are taken out of order.\n\n【41】*   Monophasic (one-phase) cycle dosing schedule: Most available dosing schedules are monophasic. If you are taking tablets of one strength (color) for 21 days, you are using a monophasic schedule. For the 28-day monophasic cycle you will also take an additional 7 inactive tablets, which are another color. If you are taking the brand name Mircette, the last seven tablets of the 28-day cycle contains two inactive tablets (for Days 22 and 23) and five tablets (for Days 24 through 28) that contain a low dose of estrogen. Taking the last 7 tablets is not required for full protection against pregnancy but they do help to replace estrogen.\n*   Biphasic (two-phase) cycle dosing schedule: If you are using a biphasic twenty-one–day schedule, you are taking tablets of one strength (color) for either seven or ten days, depending on the medication prescribed (the first phase). You then take tablets of a second strength (color) for the next eleven or fourteen days, depending on the medication prescribed (the second phase). At this point, you will have taken a total of twenty-one tablets. For the twenty-eight–day biphasic cycle you will also take an additional seven inactive tablets, which are a third color.\n*   Triphasic (three-phase) cycle dosing schedule: If you are using a triphasic twenty-one–day schedule, you are taking tablets of one strength (color) for five, six or seven days, depending on the medicine prescribed (the first phase). You then take tablets of a second strength (color) for the next five, seven, or nine days, depending on the medicine prescribed (the second phase). After that, you take tablets of a third strength (color) for the next five, seven, nine, or ten days, depending on the medicine prescribed (the third phase). At this point, you will have taken a total of twenty-one tablets. For the twenty-eight–day triphasic cycle you will also take an additional seven inactive tablets, which are a fourth color.\n*   Quadriphasic (four-phase) cycle dosing schedule: If you are using a quadriphasic twenty-eight–day schedule, you are taking tablets of one strength (dark yellow) for the first two days, depending on the medicine prescribed (the first phase). You then take tablets of a second strength (medium red) for the next three to seven, depending on the medicine prescribed (the second phase). After that, you take tablets of a third strength (light yellow) for the next eight to twenty-four days, depending on the medicine prescribed (the third phase). At this point, you will have taken a total of twenty-four tablets. For the twenty-eight–day quadriphasic cycle you will also take an additional two (dark red) tablets for next two days, followed by two inactive tablets, which are white. After taking the last white tablet, start taking the first dark yellow tablet from the new blister pack the following day.\n\n【42】If you are taking one of the brand name products, Estrostep Fe or Loestrin Fe, each of the last seven tablets that you will take on Days 21 through 28 of your cycle contains iron. These tablets are also a different color from the other tablets in your package. They help to replace some of the iron you lose when you have a menstrual period.\n\n【43】### Dosing\n\n【44】The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【45】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【46】*   For oral dosage forms (monophasic, biphasic, triphasic, or quadriphasic tablets):\n    *   For contraception:\n        *   Adults and teenagers—\n            *   For the twenty-one–day cycle—Take 1 tablet a day for twenty-one days. Skip seven days. Then repeat the cycle.\n            *   For the twenty-eight–day cycle—Take 1 tablet a day for twenty-eight days. Then repeat the cycle.\n\n【47】*   For oral dosage forms (norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol triphasic tablets and norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol triphasic tablets:\n    *   To treat acne:\n        *   Adults and teenagers—\n            *   For the twenty-one–day cycle—Take 1 tablet a day for twenty-one days. Skip seven days. Then repeat the cycle.\n            *   For the twenty-eight–day cycle—Take 1 tablet a day for twenty-eight days. Then repeat the cycle.\n        *   Teenagers up to 15 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【48】### Missed Dose\n\n【49】Call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions.\n\n【50】Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label if you miss a dose of this medicine. The following information includes only some of the ways to handle missed doses. Your health care professional may want you to stop taking the medicine and use other birth control methods for the rest of the month until you have your menstrual period. Then your health care professional can tell you how to begin taking your medicine again.\n\n【51】For monophasic, biphasic, triphasic, or quadriphasic cycles:\n\n【52】*   If you miss the first tablet of a new cycle—Take the missed tablet as soon as you remember and take the next tablet at the usual time. You may take 2 tablets in one day. Then continue your regular dosing schedule. Also, use another birth control method until you have taken seven days of your tablets after the last missed dose.\n*   If you miss 1 tablet during the cycle—Take the missed tablet as soon as you remember. Take the next tablet at the usual time. You may take 2 tablets in one day. Then continue your regular dosing schedule.\n*   If you miss 2 tablets in a row in the first or second week—Take 2 tablets on the day that you remember and 2 tablets the next day. Then continue taking 1 tablet a day. Also use another birth control method until you begin a new cycle.\n*   If you miss 2 tablets in a row in the third week; or\n*   If you miss 3 or more tablets in a row at any time during the cycle—\n    *   Using a Day-1 start: Throw out your current cycle and begin taking a new cycle. Also, use another birth control method until you have taken seven days of your tablets after the last missed dose. You may not have a menstrual period this month. But if you miss two menstrual periods in a row, call your health care professional.\n    *   Using a Sunday start: Keep taking one tablet a day from your current pack until Sunday. Then, on Sunday, throw out your old pack and begin a new pack. Also use another birth control method until you have taken seven days of your tablets after the last missed dose. You may not have a menstrual period this month. But if you miss two menstrual periods in a row, call your health care professional.\n\n【53】If you miss any of the last seven (inactive) tablets of a twenty-eight–day cycle, there is no danger of pregnancy. However, the first tablet (active) of the next month's cycle must be taken on the regularly scheduled day, in spite of any missed doses, if pregnancy is to be avoided. The active and inactive tablets are colored differently for your convenience.\n\n【54】### Storage\n\n【55】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【56】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【57】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【58】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【59】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine does not cause unwanted effects. These visits will usually be every 6 to 12 months, but some doctors require them more often.\n\n【60】Tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are taking this medicine before any kind of surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment. Your doctor will decide whether you should continue taking this medicine.\n\n【61】The following medicines may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. You should use an additional method of birth control during each cycle in which any of the following medicines are used:\n\n【62】*   Ampicillin\n*   Barbiturates\n*   Carbamazepine (e.g., Tegretol)\n*   Griseofulvin (e.g., Fulvicin)\n*   Penicillin V\n*   Phenytoin (e.g., Dilantin)\n*   Primidone (e.g., Mysoline)\n*   Rifampin (e.g., Rifadin)\n*   Ritonavir (e.g., Norvir)\n*   Tetracyclines (medicine for infection)\n*   Troglitazone (e.g., Rezulin)\n\n【63】Check with your doctor if you have any questions about this.\n\n【64】Vaginal bleeding of various amounts may occur between your regular menstrual periods during the first 3 months of use. This is sometimes called spotting when slight, or breakthrough bleeding when heavier. If this should occur:\n\n【65】*   Continue on your regular dosing schedule.\n*   The bleeding usually stops within 1 week.\n*   Check with your doctor if the bleeding continues for more than 1 week.\n*   After you have been taking oral contraceptives on schedule and for more than 3 months and bleeding continues, check with your doctor.\n\n【66】Missed menstrual periods may occur:\n\n【67】*   If you have not taken the medicine exactly as scheduled. Pregnancy must be considered as a possibility.\n*   If the medicine is not the right strength or type for your needs.\n*   If you stop taking oral contraceptives, especially if you have taken oral contraceptives for 2 or more years\n\n【68】Check with your doctor if you miss any menstrual periods so that the cause may be determined.\n\n【69】In some patients using estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of the gums may occur. Brushing and flossing your teeth carefully and regularly and massaging your gums may help prevent this. See your dentist regularly to have your teeth cleaned. Check with your medical doctor or dentist if you have any questions about how to take care of your teeth and gums, or if you notice any tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of your gums. Also, it has been shown that estrogen-containing oral contraceptives may cause a healing problem called dry socket after a tooth has been removed. If you are going to have a tooth removed, tell your dentist or oral surgeon that you are taking oral contraceptives.\n\n【70】Some people who take oral contraceptives may become more sensitive to sunlight than they are normally. When you begin taking this medicine, avoid too much sun and do not use a sunlamp until you see how you react to the sun, especially if you tend to burn easily. If you have a severe reaction, check with your doctor. Some people may develop brown, blotchy spots on exposed areas. These spots usually disappear gradually when the medicine is stopped.\n\n【71】If you suspect that you may have become pregnant, stop taking this medicine immediately and check with your doctor\n\n【72】If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your doctor that you are taking birth control pills\n\n【73】Check with your doctor before refilling an old prescription, especially after a pregnancy. You will need another physical examination and your doctor may change your prescription.\n\n【74】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【75】Healthy women who do not smoke cigarettes have almost no chance of having a severe side effect from taking oral contraceptives. For most women, more problems occur because of pregnancy than will occur from taking oral contraceptives. But for some women who have special health problems, oral contraceptives can cause some unwanted effects. Some of these unwanted effects include benign (not cancerous) liver tumors, liver cancer, or blood clots or related problems, such as a stroke. Although these effects are very rare, they can be serious enough to cause death. You may want to discuss these effects with your doctor.\n\n【76】Smoking cigarettes during the use of oral contraceptives has been found to greatly increase the chances of these serious side effects occurring. To reduce the risk of serious side effects, do not smoke cigarettes while you are taking oral contraceptives. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use. The risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age.\n\n【77】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【78】The following side effects may be caused by blood clots. Get emergency help immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【79】#### Rare\n\n【80】1.  Abdominal or stomach pain (sudden, severe, or continuing)\n2.  coughing up blood\n3.  headache (severe or sudden)\n4.  loss of coordination (sudden)\n5.  loss of vision or change in vision (sudden)\n6.  pains in chest, groin, or leg (especially in calf of leg)\n7.  shortness of breath (sudden or unexplained)\n8.  slurring of speech (sudden)\n9.  weakness, numbness, or pain in arm or leg (unexplained)\n\n【81】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【82】#### More common\n\n【83】1.  Changes in the uterine bleeding pattern at menses or between menses, such as decreased bleeding at menses, breakthrough bleeding or spotting between periods, prolonged bleeding at menses, complete stopping of menstrual bleeding that occurs over several months in a row, or stopping of menstrual bleeding that only occurs sometimes\n\n【84】#### Less common\n\n【85】1.  Headaches or migraines (although headaches may lessen in many users, in others, they may increase in number or become worse)\n2.  increased blood pressure\n3.  vaginal infection with vaginal itching or irritation, or thick, white, or curd-like discharge\n\n【86】#### For women with diabetes mellitus\n\n【87】1.  Mild increase of blood sugar—Faintness, nausea, pale skin, or sweating\n\n【88】#### Rare\n\n【89】1.  Mental depression\n2.  swelling, pain, or tenderness in upper abdominal area\n\n【90】#### For women who smoke tobacco\n\n【91】1.  Pains in stomach, side, or abdomen\n2.  yellow eyes or skin\n\n【92】#### For women with a history of breast disease\n\n【93】1.  Lumps in breast\n\n【94】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【95】#### More common\n\n【96】1.  Abdominal cramping or bloating\n2.  acne (usually less common after first 3 months and may improve if acne already exists)\n3.  breast pain, tenderness, or swelling\n4.  dizziness\n5.  nausea\n6.  swelling of ankles and feet\n7.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n8.  vomiting\n\n【97】#### Less common\n\n【98】1.  Brown, blotchy spots on exposed skin\n2.  gain or loss of body or facial hair\n3.  increased or decreased interest in sexual intercourse\n4.  increased sensitivity of skin to sunlight\n5.  weight gain or loss\n\n【99】Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients. If you notice any other effects, check with your healthcare professional.\n\n【100】Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.\n\n【101】Portions of this document last updated: Feb. 01, 2023\n\n【102】Original article: https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/estrogen-and-progestin-oral-contraceptives-oral-route/description/drg-20069422", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "cabba199-dae2-4f0d-9a66-b46292785f6a", "title": "Nail fungus", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Nail fungus is a common infection of the nail. It begins as a white or yellow-brown spot under the tip of your fingernail or toenail. As the fungal infection goes deeper, the nail may discolor, thicken and crumble at the edge. Nail fungus can affect several nails.\n\n【2】If your condition is mild and not bothering you, you may not need treatment. If your nail fungus is painful and has caused thickened nails, self-care steps and medications may help. But even if treatment is successful, nail fungus often comes back.\n\n【3】Nail fungus is also called onychomycosis (on-ih-koh-my-KOH-sis). When fungus infects the areas between your toes and the skin of your feet, it's called athlete's foot (tinea pedis).\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Symptoms of nail fungus include a nail or nails that are:\n\n【6】*   Thickened\n*   Discolored\n*   Brittle, crumbly or ragged\n*   Misshapen\n*   Separated from the nail bed\n*   Smelly\n\n【7】Nail fungus can affect fingernails, but it's more common in toenails.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】You may want to see a health care provider if self-care steps haven't helped and the nail becomes increasingly discolored, thickened or misshapen. Also talk with your health care provider if you have:\n\n【10】*   Diabetes and think you're developing nail fungus\n*   Bleeding around the nails\n*   Swelling or pain around the nails\n*   Difficulty walking\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】Nail fungus is caused by various fungal organisms (fungi). The most common is a type called dermatophyte. Yeast, bacteria and molds also can cause nail infections. The discoloration from a bacterial infection tends to be green or black.\n\n【13】Fungal infection of the foot (athlete's foot) can spread to the nail, and a fungal infection of the nail can spread to the foot. You can also get the infection from contact with spaces where fungi can thrive, such as the floor tile in a gym shower or inside dark, sweaty, moist shoes.\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】Factors that can increase your risk of developing nail fungus include:\n\n【16】*   Older age\n*   Wearing shoes that make your feet sweat heavily\n*   Having had athlete's foot in the past\n*   Walking barefoot in damp public areas, such as swimming pools, gyms and shower rooms\n*   Having a minor skin or nail injury\n*   Having a skin condition that affects the nails, such as psoriasis\n*   Having diabetes, blood flow problems or a weakened immune system\n\n【17】Complications\n-------------\n\n【18】A severe case of nail fungus can be painful and may cause permanent damage to your nails. And it may lead to other serious infections that spread beyond your feet if you have a suppressed immune system due to medication, diabetes or other conditions.\n\n【19】Prevention\n----------\n\n【20】The following habits can help prevent nail fungus or reinfections and athlete's foot, which can lead to nail fungus:\n\n【21】*   Keep your nails clean and dry. Wash your hands and feet regularly. Wash your hands after touching an infected nail. Dry well, apply an antifungal foot powder and moisturize your nails. Consider applying a nail hardener, which might help strengthen nails and cuticles.\n*   Keep your nails trimmed. Cut nails straight across, smooth the edges with a file and file down thickened areas. Disinfect your nail clippers after each use. Letting your nails grow long creates more places for the fungus to grow.\n*   Wear absorbent socks or change your socks throughout the day.\n*   Choose shoes made of materials that breathe.\n*   Discard old shoes or treat them with disinfectants or antifungal powders.\n*   Wear footwear in pool areas and locker rooms.\n*   Choose a nail salon that uses sterilized manicure tools for each customer. Or disinfect tools you use for home pedicures.\n*   Give up nail polish and artificial nails.\n*   If you have athlete's foot, treat it with an antifungal product.\n\n【22】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "56f7d826-8ba3-4052-831e-b55af09f947e", "title": "Acetaminophen, Caffeine, And Dihydrocodeine (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Acetaminophen, Caffeine, And Dihydrocodeine (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Panlor-DC\n2.  Panlor-SS\n3.  Trezix\n4.  Zerlor\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】  \n\n【6】Acetaminophen, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine combination is used to relieve moderate to moderately severe pain.\n\n【7】Acetaminophen is used to relieve pain and reduce fever in patients. It does not become habit-forming when taken for a long time. But acetaminophen may cause other unwanted effects when taken in large doses, including liver damage. Caffeine is a CNS stimulant that is used with pain relievers to increase their effect. It has also been used for migraine headaches. Dihydrocodeine belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.\n\n【8】When dihydrocodeine is used for a long time or in large doses, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Capsule\n*   Tablet\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Trezix™ in the pediatric population. It should not be used in children 12 years of age or younger. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【18】Trezix™ should not be used to relieve pain after surgery removal of tonsils or adenoids in any children. Severe breathing problems and deaths have been reported in some children who received codeine after tonsil or adenoid surgery.\n\n【19】### Geriatric\n\n【20】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of acetaminophen, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related lung, liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving acetaminophen, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine combination in order to avoid potentially serious side effects.\n\n【21】### Breastfeeding\n\n【22】Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using this medicine.\n\n【23】### Drug Interactions\n\n【24】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【26】*   Nalmefene\n*   Naltrexone\n*   Riociguat\n*   Safinamide\n*   Samidorphan\n*   Viloxazine\n\n【27】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【42】*   Lung breathing problems (eg, asthma, respiratory depression), severe or\n*   Stomach or bowel blockage (including paralytic ileus)—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【43】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【44】Take this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. This is especially important for elderly patients, who may be more sensitive to the effects of pain medicines. If too much of this medicine is taken for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence) or cause an overdose. Also, large amounts of acetaminophen may cause liver damage.\n\n【45】This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【46】This combination medicine contains acetaminophen (Tylenol®). Carefully check the labels of all other medicines you are using, because they may also contain acetaminophen. It is not safe to use more than 4 grams (4,000 milligrams) of acetaminophen in one day (24 hours), as this may increase the risk for serious liver problems.\n\n【47】### Dosing\n\n【48】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【49】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【50】*   For oral dosage form (capsules):\n    *   For moderate to severe pain:\n        *   Adults—2 capsules every 4 hours as needed. Your doctor may increase your dose as needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 10 capsules per day.\n        *   Children 12 years of age and older—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n        *   Children younger than 12 years of age—Should not be used in these patients.\n\n【51】### Missed Dose\n\n【52】If you miss a dose of this medicine, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【53】### Storage\n\n【54】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【55】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【56】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【57】Drop off any unused narcotic medicine at a drug take-back location right away. If you do not have a drug take-back location near you, flush any unused narcotic medicine down the toilet. Check your local drug store and clinics for take-back locations. You can also check the DEA web site for locations. Here is the link to the FDAsafe disposal of medicines website:www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/ensuringsafeuseofmedicine/safedisposalofmedicines/ucm186187.htm .\n\n【58】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【59】It is very important that your doctor check your progress while you are using this medicine, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of treatment. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it.\n\n【60】Do not use this medicine if you are using or have used an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) such as isocarboxazid \\[Marplan®\\], linezolid \\[Zyvox®\\], phenelzine \\[Nardil®\\], selegiline \\[Eldepryl®\\], tranylcypromine \\[Parnate®\\]) within the past 14 days.\n\n【61】This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (medicines that can make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics. Also, there may be a greater risk of liver damage if you drink 3 or more alcoholic beverages while you are taking acetaminophen. Do not drink alcoholic beverages. Check with your doctor before taking any of these medicines while you are using this medicine.\n\n【62】This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.\n\n【63】If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once. Signs of an overdose include: dark urine, difficult or troubled breathing, irregular, fast or slow, or shallow breathing, nausea or vomiting, pain in the upper stomach, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, pinpoint pupils of the eyes, or yellow eyes or skin.\n\n【64】Codeine is changed to morphine in the body. Some people change codeine to morphine more quickly than others. These individuals are called \"ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine\". Contact your doctor immediately if you experience extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing. These symptoms may indicate that you are an \"ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine\". As a result, there is too much morphine in the body and more side effects of morphine than usual. Children may be especially sensitive to this effect. Do not give this medicine to:\n\n【65】*   Children younger than 12 years of age.\n*   Children younger than 18 years of age who have had surgery removal of tonsils or adenoids.\n*   Children 12 to 18 years of age who have a high risk for breathing problems (eg, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, lung disease).\n\n【66】If a nursing mother is an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine, it could lead to a morphine overdose in the nursing baby and cause very serious side effects.\n\n【67】For nursing mothers taking this medicine:\n\n【68】*   Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about taking codeine or about how this medicine may affect your baby.\n*   Call your doctor if you become extremely tired and have difficulty caring for your baby.\n*   Your baby should generally nurse every 2 to 3 hours and should not sleep for more than 4 hours at a time.\n*   Check with your doctor, hospital emergency room, or local emergency services (eg, \"call 9-1-1\") right away if your baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, difficulty breathing, or limpness. These may be symptoms of an overdose and need immediate medical attention.\n\n【69】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. Also, lying down for a while may relieve dizziness or lightheadedness.\n\n【70】This medicine may make you dizzy, drowsy, confused, or disoriented. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\n【71】Using narcotics for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.\n\n【72】Do not change your dose or suddenly stop using this medicine without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, such as convulsions (seizures), hallucinations, stomach or muscle cramps, tremors, or unusual behavior.\n\n【73】Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects, including neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using this medicine.\n\n【74】Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.\n\n【75】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, or certain skin conditions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome). These reactions can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, fever or chills, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat while you are using this medicine.\n\n【76】Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.\n\n【77】Using too much of this medicine may cause reduced infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children. '\n\n【78】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【79】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【80】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【81】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【82】#### More common\n\n【83】1.

By revealing structures too small to be seen by the unaided human eye, microscopes illuminate biology and disease in the same way that telescopes give insight into the large-scale structure of the universe. Because scientists and physicians use microscopes daily, familiarity can invite ennui. But in recent years, some artists and scientists have focused on the aesthetics of microscopic structures and the ways in which these instruments unveil the strange beauty of the hidden world.\n\n【2】The inventor of the microscope is unknown. Magnifying lenses appeared in the late medieval period in northern Italy at around the same time as eyeglasses. While compound microscopes with multiple lenses were already in use in Europe in the 1620s, including by astronomer and polymath Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), it was a simple one-lens microscope that Delft draper and lens making hobbyist, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1724), used to highlight the composition of blood, saliva, pond water, and other fluids. More than anyone else, it was van Leeuwenhoek whose observations awakened biologists in the 17  century to the vast potential of microscopy. Scientists became so fascinated by microscopes that French astronomer, Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille (1713-1762), immortalized these instruments in his proposed astronomical constellation “Microscopium,” a small southern asterism that was one of 88 constellations formally recognized by the International Astronomical Union in 1930.\n\n【3】Since those promising early days, there have been many advances in microscopy equipment and techniques that have led to clearer and sharper images. The advent of achromatic lenses improved optics by decreasing chromatic and spherical aberration, while electron and x-ray microscopy allowed ultrastructural visualization. Mounting, lighting, and tissue staining techniques that debuted in the 19  century dramatically improved the usefulness of microscopes in evaluating diseased tissues and understanding normal biology.\n\n【4】The microscope remains the workhorse of pathology departments and of biology laboratories around the globe, and it is also essential in numerous engineering and industrial applications. But how live images seen through an ocular are represented for others to view later has changed dramatically over time. In 1665, Robert Hooke (1635-1703), in England published _Micrographia; or, Some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies Made by Magnifying Glasses._ Like van Leewenhoek and virtually all other microscopists for the first 2 centuries, Hooke rendered his observations as illustrations drawn in ink, subject to the impressions of the viewer **.**\n\n【5】Photography came along the 19  century and made transmission of what was seen through the ocular much more objective. John Benjamin Dancer (1812-1887), an English instrument maker, made the first photomicrographs in 1839, employing the then-new imaging technique of daguerrotyping. That same year, William Henry Fox Talbot (1800-1877), used a technique he called “photographic drawing” to render insect wings and botanical specimens at 200-300x magnification. (Others, including Sir Humphrey Davy (1778-1829), the chemist who isolated potassium and sodium, may have made photomicrographs even earlier but left no convincing record.) In the 20  century, museums and other institutions began to stage exhibitions of photomicrographs, for their aesthetic value as much as for their scientific interest. These images became much easier to create and manipulate as digital imagers became common in the late 20  century and with the advent of inexpensive data storage and photo editing computer programs.\n\n【6】In December 2022, the United States Postal Service announced a new stamp issue focusing on beautiful and interesting microscopic images. “Life Magnified” will feature 20 brightly colored structures on a black background. Some of the chosen images were recent winners of the Nikon Small World Photomicrography competition, which has been celebrating light microscopy since 1975 ( https://www.nikonsmallworld.com ). Other stamps recognize the contribution of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) enthusiasts, such as Steven Gschmeissner ( https://theworldcloseup.com/about-me ) and Dennis Kunkel ( https://www.denniskunkel.com ), whose colorized SEM images are featured in the United Kingdom-based Science Photo Library.\n\n【7】Several of the stamps in this series depict structures in the human body, such as a stack of red blood cells arranged in a way that suggests pathological rouleaux. Another depiction is a knotted human hair, perhaps alluding to structural disorders of the hair such as Uncontrollable Hair Syndrome, which is due to germline mutations in the _PADI3_ , _TCHH,_ or _TGM_ gene. Other stamps depict microorganisms that can contribute to human disease, including mold spores, protozoans, and pollen. Animal structures that are paralleled in humans, like mouse neurons and starling bones, are also represented. And some images, like barnacle legs, diatoms, a snail tongue, and the antenna of a moth, are simply attractive and striking.\n\n【8】The collection was assembled by long-time USPS art director and graphic artist Derry Noyes ( https://derrynoyes.com/ ), who has designed numerous postage stamps over the past 40 years and whose father, Eliot Noyes (1910-1977), was a graphic and industrial designer responsible for the famous IBM Selectric typewriter.\n\n【9】The stamp series is scheduled for release on August 10, 2023, with first day of issue ceremony planned during the Great American Stamp Show of the American Philatelic Society at the Huntington Convention Center in Cleveland, Ohio. A Scott catalogue number has not yet been assigned.\n\n【10】Potential Competing Interests\n-----------------------------\n\n【11】The author reports no competing interests.\n\n【12】Article info\n------------\n\n【13】### Footnotes\n\n【14】Stamp Vignettes focus on biographical details and accomplishments related to science and medicine, and not individual views and prejudices except where they had a major impact on the subject's life.

First, anesthesia for these patients is best delivered using a technique that minimizes the use of perioperative opiates and avoids the deleterious effect of positive pressure ventilation and pneumoperitoneum. Regional anesthesia is well tolerated and preferable in these patients. Second, the Essure hysteroscopic system (Conceptus, Mountain View, CA) is very effective. No pregnancies were reported during the follow-up period. We agree that previous tubal surgery is a relative (but not an absolute) contraindication if anatomy can be identified using radiologic intervention.\n\n【1】Article info\n------------\n\n【2】### Identification\n\n【3】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/83.10.1189\n\n【4】### Copyright\n\n【5】© 2008 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

{"seq_id": "8ca5ded1-fcc4-414f-815c-f4f796366e89", "title": "Herman Boerhaave – Master Clinician and Humanist", "text": "【0】Herman Boerhaave was born on December 31, 1668, in Voorhout, a small village in the Dutch Republic (later the Netherlands), near the city of Leiden. In 1682, Boerhaave suffered from a non-healing ulcer on his left thigh and moved to Leiden to get better medical treatment than he could obtain in his home village, but after that treatment had failed and he had suffered from chronic pain in his leg for months, he finally successfully treated himself with a mixture of his own urine and various salts. His father, a Protestant clergyman who died in 1683, played a major role in his upbringing and formation of his moral values.\n\n【1】Young Boerhaave entered the University of Leiden in 1684 on a scholarship, where he studied philosophy and theology in preparation for the clergy. He was an apt student who greatly admired the work of Isaac Newton and received a gold medal for an oration on Cicero. He received a theology degree in 1689, based on his thesis on the difference between the mind and body. He continued studying theology, but he became involved in an argument on a canal boat, which led to a false accusation of being a follower of Baruch Spinoza, who was considered a heretic by both the Protestant and Catholic churches. Although Boerhaave was a devout Christian, the accusations of heresy and atheism prevented a career as a clergyman.\n\n【2】During his University studies, perhaps due to his experience treating his own leg wound, Boerhaave became interested in medicine and had attended public dissections by Anton Nuck, an anatomist working in Leiden until his death in 1692. Boerhaave also independently studied the writings of Hippocrates and Bartholin as well as the famous English physician, Thomas Sydenham. Therefore, he entered the University of Harderwijk – a university that had a poor reputation but offered low tuition. Following a dissertation on the examination of excrement, he received his medical degree in 1693.\n\n【3】The University of Leiden appointed him as a lecturer in 1701. In addition, he gave private lectures on the theory and practice of medicine for which he was paid by the students. He was subsequently offered a professorship at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands but rejected it despite his poor financial situation. The University of Leiden promised him he would receive a professorship when it became available.\n\n【4】Boerhaave continued to teach, and his outstanding lectures attracted physicians from all of Europe. These lectures resulted in the publication of his “ _Institutiones Medicae_ ” in 1708, and in the following year his aphorisms on the recognition and treatment of various diseases. That same year the chairs of medicine and botany became available at the University of Leiden and he was appointed to both. Although he had had no formal training in botany, he established one of the finest botanical gardens in Europe at the university.\n\n【5】His lectures in medicine soon attracted many students from all over Europe. He was able to communicate with most of these visitors, as it was said that he spoke a dozen languages. When the professor of chemistry at the University of Leiden died, Boerhaave was appointed to succeed him. For the following decade he held three (medicine, botany, chemistry) of the five chairs at the University of Leiden, Faculty of Medicine. He lectured on chemistry to the medical students and then published an influential textbook in the field. He was an outstanding teacher because he stressed that students should understand medicine, chemistry, and botany rather than engage in simple rote memorization, and he often lectured for 4-5 hours each day. The lectures were so large and popular that some students hired others to get to the classroom early and reserve their seats.\n\n【6】One of his best known students was Albrecht von Haller from Bern, who became one of the most prolific medical writers of all time. von Haller wrote more than 10,000 descriptions of plants and their uses during his lifetime, which were collected into a 61-volume herbarium. Another talented student, Gerard van Swieten, a native of Leiden, was appointed personal physician to Queen Mary Theresa of Austria. In this position, van Swieten reorganized the teaching of medicine at the Allgemeines Krankenhaus and the University of Vienna. He also established medical care for Austria, emphasizing a need for proper sanitation.\n\n【7】Boerhaave revitalized bedside teaching when he developed two 6-bed wards at the St. Caecilia Gasthuis – 6 beds for men and 6 for women. He emphasized the use of the medical history and physical examination followed by the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment plan similar to today's medical practice.\n\n【8】He introduced the use of the thermometer in clinical medicine. His student, Anton DeHaen, correlated the temperature readings of patients with a thermometer designed by Fahrenheit. Although he made few original discoveries in medicine, he did describe Boerhaave syndrome, which is a spontaneous perforation of the esophagus, usually due to severe vomiting. In 1714 he subsequently became rector of the University of Leiden, in addition to his continued teaching.\n\n【9】He married Maria Drolenvaux, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, in 1710. Although they had four children, only one daughter survived to adulthood.\n\n【10】He was tall and had a very calm disposition. In fact, he was asked one time if he ever became angry? He answered that by nature he was passionate, but that “by prayer and meditation” he had been able to master his temper. It is said that Boerhaave received letters that were sent to “The greatest physician in the world,” and they were promptly delivered to him. In the book _Institutiones Medicae_ , he said the ideal physician was one who was knowledgeable about the basic sciences, and was able to carry out diagnostic tests as well as investigations in clinical research.\n\n【11】His success was based upon the simplicity, clarity, and wisdom exhibited in his lectures. His personal warmth and his clinical skills at the bedside were considered outstanding. It was said that he kept Peter the Great, the Russian Czar, waiting as he continued to see patients who had arrived earlier.\n\n【12】He developed severe gout as he aged and was bedridden because of it at one time for 6 months. When he returned to the University, church bells in the city of Leiden were rung in celebration.\n\n【13】He developed a lung abscess and died September 23, 1738. He was honored twice by the Netherlands philatelically: In 1928 (Scott #B34), and in 1938 by a stamp (Scott #B107) on the 200th anniversary of his death.\n\n【14】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【15】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【16】Article info\n------------\n\n【17】### Identification\n\n【18】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.09.014\n\n【19】### Copyright\n\n【20】© 2018 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research\n\n【21】### ScienceDirect\n\n【22】Access this article on ScienceDirect\n\n【23】Herman Boerhaave – Master Clinician and Humanist\n\n【24】*   \n*   \n\n【25】Hide Caption Download See figure in article\n\n【26】Toggle Thumbstrip\n\n【27】*   Figure\n    \n*   Figure\n    \n\n【28】*   View Large Image\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download .PPT\n\n【29】Figures\n-------\n\n【30】*   \n*   \n\n【31】Related Articles\n----------------\n\n【32】Hide Caption Download See figure in Article\n\n【33】Toggle Thumbstrip\n\n【34】*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download .PPT", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The patient was walking in a grocery store parking lot, where she was stung by a wasp on her ankle. She tripped, fell, and was unable to get up without assistance. She was helped up almost immediately after the fall by a bystander, and the patient was assisted walking to her car. At home, she was able to walk unassisted; however, she realized this inability to get up after falling was highly unusual for her given the vigorous workout regimen she had been performing on a daily basis for several years. While previously she had been able to do 60 abdominal crunches a day, the morning of the fall she could only do one. Her husband also noticed that she had been dragging her feet while walking around the house for the past month. Given this history, recent fall, and subacute weakness, the patient presented to her primary care physician, who after reviewing the patient’s initial laboratory work sent her to the Mayo Clinic emergency department.\n\n【1】On evaluation at the emergency department, the patient was in no acute distress and had no concerns other than muscle weakness. She reported no myalgias, muscle cramping, or muscle twitching. The patient did recall that she had felt the sensation of objects getting stuck in her throat while swallowing food and medications for many weeks. On physical examination, the patient’s muscle tone appeared normal throughout without group atrophy. She likewise did not exhibit tremors or muscle fasciculations. Her deltoid, triceps, and biceps strength testing exhibited antigravity with inability to hold against resistance (3 of 5 on a manual muscle strength testing \\[MMT\\] scale). Her thigh muscles likewise could activate against gravity with inability to withstand resistance (3 of 5 on MMT) bilaterally. The patient exhibited preserved distal strength in her forearms, fists, fingers, calves, feet, and toes bilaterally against resistance (5 of 5 on MMT). She had decreased neck strength as well as decreased strength with diminished abdominal flexion on examination (both 3 of 5 on MMT). The patient had full passive range of motion of her joints. Reflexes were symmetrically normal in both her upper and lower extremities. The cranial nerves were all intact without unilateral facial droop, ptosis, slurred speech, or decreased facial muscle strength. Skin examination revealed ecchymosis over the right eye lid, left wrist, and left ankle related to the fall but no rashes. The rest of the physical examination was unrevealing. Her current medications at admission were zoledronic acid, 5-mg annual intravenous (IV) infusion; levothyroxine, 25 μg daily; nortriptyline, 25 mg daily; cholecalciferol, 2000 IU daily; aspirin, 81 mg daily; atorvastatin, 40 mg daily; and cyanocobalamin, 1000 μg daily. Each of these medications, including statin and aspirin, had remained stable in dosage for multiple years.\n\n【2】*   1.\n    \n    **Given this patient’s constellation of symptoms, which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ diagnosis?**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        Rhabdomyolysis\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        Polymyalgia rheumatica\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        Hypothyroid myopathy\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        Immune-mediated myopathy\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        Guillain-Barré syndrome\n        \n    \n\n【3】Because the patient had never experienced myalgias with the evolving weakness and was quickly helped up after her minor fall with little time on the ground, rhabdomyolysis was less likely \n\n【4】\n\n【5】*   Bosch X.\n*   Poch E.\n*   Grau J.M.\n\n【6】Rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury.\n\n【7】_N Engl J Med._ 2009; 361 (published correction appears in N Engl J Med. 2011;364(20):1982\\] : 62-72\n\n【8】*   Google Scholar\n\n【9】Polymyalgia rheumatica most commonly presents with pain and stiffness in the neck, torso, shoulder, and pelvic girdles accompanied by morning stiffness and gelling phenomenon that improves as the day goes by. It is almost exclusively a disease of older adults. Its prevalence increases with age, and it is more common in women. In the case of our patient, she had not experienced myalgias or any other pain; on the other hand, weakness was an important symptom, making the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica less likely.\n\n【10】\n\n【11】*   Bosch X.\n*   Poch E.\n*   Grau J.M.\n\n【12】Rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury.\n\n【13】_N Engl J Med._ 2009; 361 (published correction appears in N Engl J Med. 2011;364(20):1982\\] : 62-72\n\n【14】*   Google Scholar\n\n【15】Hypothyroid myopathy, or in some rare cases hyperthyroidism, may appear as a polymyositis-like syndrome\n\n【16】\n\n【17】*   Madariaga M.G.\n\n【18】Polymyositis-like syndrome in hypothyroidism: review of cases reported over the past twenty-five years.\n\n【19】_Thyroid._ 2002; 12 : 331-336\n\n【20】*   Google Scholar\n\n【21】; hypothyroid myopathy presents with myalgias that are exacerbated by exercise, usually in patients with untreated hypothyroidism. Our patient had a history of treated hypothyroidism with stable doses of levothyroxine for a prolonged period, and she did not experience myalgias, making this diagnosis less likely.\n\n【22】Our patient’s clinical picture best fits an immune-mediated myopathy based on the subacute clinical presentation and proximal muscle weakness with sparing of the distal musculature. The immune-mediated myopathies are a heterogeneous group of acquired muscle disorders characterized by proximal muscle weakness that often requires histopathologic evaluation to clarify differences between them, such as dermatomyositis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, and necrotizing autoimmune myopathy. Guillain-Barré syndrome could present similarly with insidious onset of decreased strength, but our patient’s preserved distal strength, normal reflexes, and lack of viral prodrome make this diagnosis less likely as well.\n\n【23】\n\n【24】*   Fokke C.\n*   van den Berg B.\n*   Drenthen J.\n*   Walgaard C.\n*   van Doorn P.A.\n*   Jacobs B.C.\n\n【25】Diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome and validation of Brighton criteria.\n\n【26】_Brain._ 2014; 137 : 33-43\n\n【27】*   Google Scholar\n\n【28】Laboratory evaluation revealed the following (reference ranges provided parenthetically): creatine kinase (CK), elevated to 10,588 U/L; thyrotropin, 9.5 mIU/L; free thyroxine, 1.1 ng/dL (0.9 to 1.7 ng/dL); triiodothyronine, 115 ng/dL (80 to 200 ng/dL); aspartate aminotransferase, 247 U/L; and creatinine, 0.58 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed trace hemoglobin but no red blood cells on the urine microscopy, a finding that may be suggestive of myoglobinuria. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were within normal limits.\n\n【29】The work-up for a systemic autoimmune process including antinuclear antibody, anti–Sjögren syndrome–related antigen A, anti–Sjögren syndrome–related antigen B, anti–Jo-1 antibody, anti–topoisomerase 1 antibody, and anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody yielded negative results. Serum and urine myoglobin levels were not checked.\n\n【30】*   2.\n    \n    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ next test for this patient?**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the affected thigh\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        Brain MRI\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        Skin biopsy\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        Electromyography (EMG)\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        Muscle biopsy\n        \n    \n\n【31】Although MRI of the patient’s thigh could reveal signs of inflammation, MRI would be nonspecific in distinguishing inflammatory vs metabolic myopathies. If MRI were performed in the setting of inflammatory myositis, T2-weighted imaging would reveal signal abnormalities in muscle and fascia due to inflammation, edema, or muscle replacement by fatty tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was not performed because a central neurologic process, such as Parkinson disease or stroke, was unlikely. The patient’s clinical picture, most consistent with an inflammatory myopathy, was unlikely to be dermatomyositis given the lack of skin involvement, rendering a skin biopsy low yield. Normal nailfold capillary examination is another way dermatomyositis could be eliminated from the differential diagnosis, but it was not performed during hospitalization.\n\n【32】Electromyography (EMG) is the best next step for this patient in order to identify if the underlying pathology was neuropathic or myopathic in nature prior to more invasive testing. Furthermore an EMG is helpful to identify which muscle group has the highest yield and can be targeted for a muscle biopsy. Muscle biopsy is usually the next step after an EMG has shown a myopathic pattern.\n\n【33】Our patient underwent EMG of the left upper and lower extremity. Results of nerve conduction studies of the left upper and lower limb were within normal limits. Needle examination of the left upper and lower limb and thoracic paraspinal muscles revealed short-duration, low-amplitude, complex motor unit potentials in the majority of the proximal muscles sampled. There were large numbers of fibrillation potentials and myotonic-like discharges in the biceps, triceps, and gluteus medius suggesting evidence of a generalized myopathy with predominantly proximal involvement. Given the patient’s presentation and prevalence of myotonic-like discharges, a necrotizing autoimmune myopathy best fit the clinical picture. Unilateral EMG was performed in order to preserve the contralateral deltoid muscle from iatrogenic artifact in the event of a future muscle biopsy.\n\n【34】\n\n【35】*   Joyce N.C.\n*   Oskarsson B.\n*   Jin L.W.\n\n【36】Muscle biopsy evaluation in neuromuscular disorders.\n\n【37】_Phys Med Rehabil Clin N Am._ 2012; 23 : 609-631\n\n【38】*   Google Scholar\n\n【39】*   3.\n    \n    **Which _one_ of the following is _most likely_ to lead to a diagnosis for this patient?**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        Serum aldolase measurement\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        Lumbar puncture\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        Positron emission tomography/computed tomography\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        Muscle biopsy\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        Nerve conduction study\n        \n    \n\n【40】Aldolase can be a helpful tool in identifying muscle breakdown in patients with symptoms of myositis who present with normal CK levels. This patient’s aldolase level was 83.7 U/L; however, this enzyme is not sensitive or specific in determining what type of myositis our patient has. Lumbar puncture would be applicable in the setting of ascending muscle weakness suggestive of Guillian-Barré syndrome or other findings suggestive of a central neuropathic process such as muscle fasciculation or visible tremors. However, a lumbar puncture would not aid in determining inflammatory myopathy subtype. Polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and necrotizing autoimmune myopathies have been associated with underlying malignancy, which could be identified through positron emission tomography/computed tomography; nevertheless, identification of malignancy, although more likely in dermatomyositis, is not helpful in distinguishing one myopathy from the other. A muscle biopsy would be the most appropriate diagnostic test for our patient with a currently undifferentiated myopathy.\n\n【41】\n\n【42】*   Mammen A.L.\n\n【43】Statin-associated autoimmune myopathy.\n\n【44】_N Engl J Med._ 2016; 374 : 664-669\n\n【45】*   Google Scholar\n\n【46】Nerve conduction study would not be helpful because these studies would have already been performed as a part of the EMG, which previously revealed active myopathy with normal nerve conduction of the left upper and left lower extremity.\n\n【47】Right deltoid biopsy in our patient revealed the following: necrotic muscle fibers in each fascicle with macrophage replacement; small collections of mononuclear cells at perimysial and perivascular sites with a mild increase in perimysial fibrous and fatty connective tissue; increases of acid phosphatase in macrophages replacing necrotic fibers as well as in scattered cells within the perimysium; one fascicle with mild perifascicular atrophy; and Congo red staining negative for amyloid, indicating inflammatory muscle disease pointing toward the diagnoses of polymyositis or immune-mediated inflammatory myopathy.

This case reveals the importance of a thorough medical reconciliation on hospital admission. A careful review of the patient’s medications helped us narrow the differential diagnosis because this history and presentation can be commonly mistaken for other myopathic syndromes (eg, polymyositis, dermatomyositis). It was likewise important that hospital work-up included infectious, autoimmune, and endocrine laboratory testing to avoid misdiagnosis and delay of immunosuppressive treatment. Evaluation and diagnostic work-up will likely need to include histopathologic evaluation of the affected muscle groups as this will provide clarity in differentiating a necrotizing autoimmune myopathy from other immune-mediated myopathies that impact proximal muscle groups.

Achieving long-term weight loss (LTWL) success, defined as reaching at least a 5% to 10% weight loss goal, is challenging, yet important for overall metabolic health. It is currently unclear whether achieving higher thresholds of LTWL is associated with improved health. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the association between LTWL thresholds (5%-9.9%, 10%-14.9%, 15%-19.9%, ≥20%) and metabolic health (metabolic syndrome and metabolic risk _z_ score) among 7670 US adult respondents to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2014) who were overweight or obese (past or present), were not underweight in the past year, not pregnant, and attempting to lose or maintain weight. A subsample of 3362 participants was used in the analysis of the metabolic risk _z_ score. Multivariable regression models were constructed adjusting for covariates. Results indicate that the lowest and the 2 highest LTWL thresholds were related to lower odds for metabolic syndrome; for example, greater than or equal to 20% LTWL (odds ratio=0.52; 95% CI, 0.23-0.44; _P_ <.001). All LTWL thresholds were significantly associated with the metabolic risk _z_ score, with the largest effect among the 2 highest LTWL thresholds, that is, 15% to 19.9% LTWL ( _β_ \\=−0.45; 95% CI, −0.54 to −0.36; _P_ <.001) and greater than or equal to 20% LTWL ( _β_ \\=−0.35; 95% CI, −0.53 to −0.17; _P_ <.001). In conclusion, although achieving the currently recommended LTWL target was related to improved metabolic health, the 15% LTWL threshold was associated with more favorable outcomes.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】HDL-C ( high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), LTWL ( long-term weight loss ), NHANES ( National Health and Examination Survey )\n\n【4】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【5】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【6】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【7】One-time access price info\n\n【8】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【9】### Subscribe:\n\n【10】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【11】Already a print subscriber?

The surgical blood order equation (SBOE), which includes values for hemoglobin lost at surgery, preoperative hemoglobin level, and minimal acceptable hemoglobin level, was used to estimate the number of units of red blood cells (RBCs) needed for each patient at surgery and thus identify which patients should have made preoperative autologous blood donations.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】The statistically significant indicators for RBC production were predonation hemoglobin concentration ( _P_ <.001) and male sex ( _P_ \\=.003). Combining the regression equation for erythropoiesis with the SBOE allowed development of guidelines for the use of preoperative autologous RBC donation and erythropoietic therapy. For primary THA surgery, a patient with a predonation hemoglobin level higher than 14.7 _g/dL_ does not need preoperative autologous donation. Preoperative autologous RBC donation would be effective for men with hemoglobin concentrations of 14.7 g/dL or less and for women with predonation hemoglobin levels of 13.2 to 14.7 gldL. In women whose hemoglobin level is less than 13.2 gl dL, erythropoietic therapy should accompany autologous donation.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】Incorporation of patient factors with the SBOE system may result in increased efficiency and decreased cost of autologous blood ordering practices before THA.\n\n【8】MCH ( mean corpuscular hemoglobin ), MCHC ( mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration ), MCV ( mean corpuscular volume ), MSBOS ( maximal surgical blood order schedule ), RBC ( red blood cell ), r-HuEPO ( recombinant human erythropoietin ), SBOE ( surgical blood order equation ), THA ( total hip arthroplasty )\n\n【9】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】One-time access price info\n\n【13】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】### Subscribe:\n\n【15】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "5a95a6d1-88fd-450b-ac44-4f33ad4e3f41", "title": "Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS)", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a type of motor neuron disease that causes the nerve cells in the brain that control movement to fail over time. PLS causes weakness in your voluntary muscles, such as those you use to control your legs, arms and tongue. You may experience movement problems, such as difficulty with balance, slow movements and clumsiness. You may eventually experience problems with chewing, swallowing and speaking.\n\n【2】This rare condition can develop at any age, but it usually occurs between ages 40 and 60 and is more common in males than females. A very rare subtype of PLS, known as juvenile primary lateral sclerosis, begins in early childhood and is caused by an abnormal gene passed from parents to children.\n\n【3】PLS is often mistaken for another, more common motor neuron disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While likely related to ALS, PLS progresses more slowly than ALS and in most cases isn't fatal.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of primary lateral sclerosis usually take years to progress and generally begin in the legs. Rarely, PLS begins in your tongue or hands and then progresses down your spinal cord to your legs. However, the disease has highly variable effects from person to person. Signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【6】*   Stiffness, weakness and muscle spasms (spasticity) in your legs, rarely starting in one leg, and eventually progressing to your arms, hands, tongue and jaw\n*   Slowed movement\n*   Tripping, clumsiness and difficulty with balance\n*   Hand clumsiness\n*   Hoarseness, as well as slowed, slurred speech and drooling\n*   Difficulties with chewing and swallowing\n*   Sometimes, frequent, rapid and intense shifts in emotions (mood lability)\n*   Rarely, breathing problems and bladder problems late in the disease\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Make an appointment to see your doctor if you have persistent problems with stiffness or weakness in your legs or arms, or with swallowing or speaking.\n\n【9】If your child develops involuntary muscle spasms or seems to be losing balance more often than usual, make an appointment with a pediatrician for an evaluation.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】In primary lateral sclerosis, the nerve cells in the brain that control movement (upper motor neurons) slowly break down and fail over time. This makes the nerves unable to activate the motor neurons in the spinal cord, which control voluntary muscles. This loss causes movement problems, such as difficulty with balance, weakness, slowed movement and clumsiness, and problems with speech and swallowing.\n\n【12】### Adult-onset primary lateral sclerosis\n\n【13】The cause of PLS that begins in adulthood is unknown. In most cases, it's not an inherited disease, and it's not known why or how it begins.\n\n【14】### Juvenile primary lateral sclerosis\n\n【15】Juvenile PLS is caused by mutations in a gene called ALS2.\n\n【16】Although researchers don't understand how this gene causes the disease, they know that the ALS2 gene gives instructions for creating a protein called alsin, which is present in motor neuron cells. When the instructions are changed in someone with juvenile PLS, the protein alsin becomes unstable and doesn't work properly, which in turn impairs normal muscle function.\n\n【17】Juvenile PLS is an autosomal recessive inherited disease, meaning that both parents have to be carriers of the gene to pass it to their child, even though they don't have the disease themselves.\n\n【18】Complications\n-------------\n\n【19】Average progression of primary lateral sclerosis can take as long as 20 years and has highly variable effects from person to person. Some people continue to walk, but others eventually need to use wheelchairs or other assistive devices.\n\n【20】In most cases, adult-onset PLS isn't thought to shorten life expectancy, but it can gradually affect the quality of your life as more muscles become disabled. Weaker muscles can cause you to fall, which can result in injuries. Problems with chewing and swallowing may result in poor nutrition. Performing activities of daily living, such as bathing and dressing, may become difficult.\n\n【21】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

It is used to decrease the clotting ability of the blood and help prevent harmful clots from forming in blood vessels. This medicine is sometimes called a blood thinner, although it does not actually thin the blood. Heparin will not dissolve blood clots that have already formed, but it may prevent the clots from becoming larger and causing more serious problems.\n\n【5】Heparin is used to prevent or treat certain blood vessel, heart, and lung conditions. Heparin is also used to prevent blood clotting during open-heart surgery, bypass surgery, kidney dialysis, and blood transfusions.

Lotrel\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】  \n\n【6】Amlodipine and benazepril is a combination of medicines that are used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.\n\n【7】Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker (CCB). It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. A lower blood pressure will increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.\n\n【8】Benazepril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Capsule\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of amlodipine and benazepril combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【18】### Geriatric\n\n【19】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of amlodipine and benazepril combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving amlodipine and benazepril combination.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below.

{"seq_id": "2734add7-557c-45d2-8d2d-499c8c782a0b", "title": "Alfuzosin (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Alfuzosin (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Uroxatral\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】  \n\n【6】Alfuzosin is used to treat the signs and symptoms of benign enlargement of the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH). Benign enlargement of the prostate is a problem that can occur in men as they get older. The prostate gland is located below the bladder. As the prostate gland enlarges, certain muscles in the gland may become tight and get in the way of the tube that drains urine from the bladder. This can cause problems with urinating, such as a need to urinate often, a weak stream when urinating, or a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely.\n\n【7】Alfuzosin helps relax the muscles in the prostate and the opening of the bladder. This may help increase the flow of urine or decrease the symptoms. However, alfuzosin will not shrink the prostate. The prostate may continue to get larger. This may cause the symptoms to become worse over time. Therefore, even though alfuzosin may lessen the problems caused by enlarged prostate now, surgery may still be needed in the future.\n\n【8】This medicine is usually given only to men. It is not normally given to women or children.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Tablet, Extended Release\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Alfuzosin is not indicated for use in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【18】### Geriatric\n\n【19】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of alfuzosin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults and are likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution in patients receiving alfuzosin.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Nipple discharge happens less commonly in women who aren't pregnant or breast-feeding. It may not be cause for concern, but it's wise to have it evaluated by a doctor to be sure. Men who experience nipple discharge under any circumstances should be evaluated.\n\n【3】One or both breasts may produce a nipple discharge, either spontaneously or when you squeeze your nipples or breasts. Nipple discharge may look milky, clear, yellow, green, brown or bloody. Discharge that isn't milk comes out of your nipple through the same ducts that carry milk. The discharge can involve a single duct or multiple ducts. The consistency of nipple discharge can vary — it may be thick and sticky or thin and watery.\n\n【4】Nipple discharge is a typical part of breast function during pregnancy or breast-feeding. It may also be associated with menstrual hormone changes and fibrocystic changes. The milky discharge after breast-feeding usually affects both breasts and can continue for up to two or three years after stopping nursing.\n\n【5】A papilloma is a noncancerous (benign) tumor that can be associated with bloody discharge. The discharge associated with a papilloma often occurs spontaneously and involves a single duct. Although the bloody discharge may resolve on its own, your doctor will likely recommend a diagnostic mammogram and a breast ultrasound to see what's causing the discharge. You may also need a biopsy to confirm that it's a papilloma or to exclude a cancer. If the biopsy confirms a papilloma, your doctor will refer you to a surgeon to discuss treatment options.\n\n【6】Often, nipple discharge stems from a benign condition. However, breast cancer is a possibility, especially if:\n\n【7】*   You have a lump in your breast\n*   Only one breast is affected\n*   The discharge contains blood or is clear\n*   The discharge is spontaneous and persistent\n*   The discharge affects only a single duct\n\n【8】Nipple discharge is rarely a sign of breast cancer. But it might be a sign of an underlying condition that requires treatment.\n\n【9】If you're still having menstrual periods and your nipple discharge doesn't resolve on its own after your next menstrual cycle and occurs spontaneously, make an appointment with your health care provider to have it evaluated.\n\n【10】If you're past menopause and you have a spontaneous nipple discharge from a single duct in one breast only, see your provider right away for evaluation.\n\n【11】In the meantime, take care to avoid nipple stimulation — including frequent checks for discharge — because stimulation can result in persistent nipple discharge.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【24】*   Allergy to gentamicin or aminoglycoside antibiotics or\n*   Allergy to products made from cow—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【25】*   Cancer near the injured knee—It is not known whether removing and implanting the chondrocyte cells can affect the growth or spread of a nearby cancer.\n\n【26】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【27】This medicine is to be given only by a doctor who have completed Vericel's Surgeon Training Program. Carticel® will be injected into your knee joint with a needle during surgery.\n\n【28】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【29】Your doctor will check your progress closely while you are receiving this medicine. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it and to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【30】Use crutches to help you walk for the first 6 to 8 weeks after receiving the implant.\n\n【31】After the implant surgery, your doctor will direct you to start a rehabilitation program that includes exercise. This program is a very important part of your treatment. You will be instructed to start out slowly and to increase gradually the number of times that you do each exercise. To get the most help from this program, it is very important that you follow the instructions as closely as possible. Do not do different exercises, and do not increase the number of times you do each exercise faster than directed. If pain or swelling occurs when you increase the amount of exercise you are doing, go back to the last level of exercise until the pain and swelling are gone, then try again. Use ice packs to help reduce the swelling.\n\n【32】Check with your doctor right away if sharp pain occurs in the knee that received the implant, or if “locking” of the knee occurs.\n\n【33】Autologous cultured chondrocytes are the patient's own cartilage cells. Patients undergoing surgical procedures using Carticel® are not routinely tested for transmissible infectious diseases and may increase risk to have them. Talk with your doctor about this risk if you are concerned.\n\n【34】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【35】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【36】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【37】#### More common\n\n【38】1.  Sharp pain or \"locking\" when you try to move your knee joint\n\n【39】#### Less common\n\n【40】1.  Bruising (severe)\n2.  difficulty with moving\n3.  heat, redness, swelling, or oozing at the site of surgery\n4.  muscle pain or stiffness\n5.  pain, swelling, or redness in the joints\n\n【41】#### Less common or rare\n\n【42】1.  Inability to bend the knee\n2.  swelling of the knee\n\n【43】#### Rare\n\n【44】1.  Fever and pain (occurring together)\n\n【45】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【46】#### More common\n\n【47】1.  “Crackling” sound or pain when moving the knee\n2.  increased growth of scar over your knee joint\n3.  stiffness or “catching” of the knee\n\n【48】Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients.

{"seq_id": "9762ccdd-6578-4124-addf-7ab317cdcaa0", "title": "HIDA scan", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】A hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan is an imaging procedure used to diagnose problems of the liver, gallbladder and bile ducts.\n\n【2】For a HIDA scan, also known as cholescintigraphy or hepatobiliary scintigraphy, a radioactive tracer is injected into a vein in the arm. The tracer travels through the bloodstream to the liver, where the bile-producing cells take it up. The tracer then travels with the bile into the gallbladder and through the bile ducts to the small intestine.\n\n【3】A nuclear medicine scanner, called a gamma camera, tracks the flow of the tracer from the liver into the gallbladder and small intestine and creates computer images.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】A HIDA scan is most often done to evaluate the gallbladder. It's also used to look at the bile-excreting function of the liver and to track the flow of bile from the liver into the small intestine. A HIDA scan is often used with X-ray and ultrasound.\n\n【6】A HIDA scan might help in the diagnosis of several diseases and conditions, such as:\n\n【7】*   Gallbladder inflammation, called cholecystitis.\n*   Bile duct obstruction.\n*   Congenital problems in the bile ducts, such as biliary atresia.\n*   Postoperative complications, such as bile leaks and fistulas.\n*   Assessment of liver transplant.\n\n【8】Your health care provider might use a HIDA scan as part of a test to measure the rate at which bile is released from your gallbladder, a process known as gallbladder ejection fraction.\n\n【9】Risks\n-----\n\n【10】A HIDA scan carries only a few risks. They include:\n\n【11】*   Allergic reaction to medicines containing radioactive tracers used for the scan.\n*   Bruising at the injection site.\n*   Radiation exposure, which is small.\n\n【12】Tell your health care provider if there's a chance you could be pregnant or if you're breastfeeding. In most cases, nuclear medicine tests, such as the HIDA scan, aren't performed in pregnancy because of potential harm to the baby.\n\n【13】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【14】### Food and medications\n\n【15】Your health care provider is likely to ask you:\n\n【16】*   To fast for four hours before your HIDA scan. You might be allowed to drink clear liquids.\n*   To stop taking some medicines and supplements.\n\n【17】### Clothing and personal items\n\n【18】You might be asked to:\n\n【19】*   Change into a hospital gown.\n*   Leave jewelry and other metal accessories at home or remove them before the procedure.\n\n【20】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【21】### Before the procedure\n\n【22】Your health care team will position you on a table, usually on your back, and inject the radioactive tracer into a vein in your arm. You might feel pressure or a cold sensation while the radioactive tracer is injected.\n\n【23】### During the procedure\n\n【24】During the test, you may get an IV injection of the medicine sincalide (Kinevac), which makes your gallbladder contract and empty. Morphine sometimes is given during a HIDA scan to make the gallbladder easier to see.\n\n【25】A gamma camera is positioned over your abdomen to take pictures of the tracer as it moves through your body. This process takes about an hour, during which you'll need to remain still.\n\n【26】Tell your team if you become uncomfortable. You might be able to lessen the discomfort by taking deep breaths.\n\n【27】A specialist in medical imaging, called a radiologist, will watch a computer screen to see the progress of the radioactive tracer through your body. You might need more imaging within 24 hours if original images aren't good enough.\n\n【28】### After the procedure\n\n【29】Most people can go about their day after the scan. The small amount of radioactive tracer will lose its reactivity or pass through your urine and stool over the next day or two. Drink plenty of water to help flush it out of your system.\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will consider your symptoms and other test results as well as the results of your HIDA scan.\n\n【32】Results of a HIDA scan include:\n\n【33】*   **Typical.** The radioactive tracer moved freely with the bile from the liver into the gallbladder and small intestine.\n*   **Slow movement of radioactive tracer.** Slow movement of the tracer might indicate a blockage or obstruction, or a problem in liver function.\n*   **No radioactive tracer seen in the gallbladder.** Inability to see the radioactive tracer in the gallbladder might indicate acute inflammation, called acute cholecystitis.\n*   **Low gallbladder ejection fraction.** The amount of tracer leaving the gallbladder is low after medicine is given to make it empty. This might indicate chronic inflammation, known as chronic cholecystitis.\n*   **Radioactive tracer detected in other areas.** Radioactive tracer found outside of the biliary system might indicate a leak.\n\n【34】Your health care provider will discuss the results with you.\n\n【35】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

How do you tell a patient who has recently received a diagnosis of cancer that the first-choice chemotherapy agent is not currently available for his treatment? What can you say to the family of a patient who suffers a respiratory arrest because she received an overdose of an opioid that was being used at your institution because the usual drug is currently unavailable and an error was made because the practitioners ordering and administering the replacement drug were less familiar with its pharmacologic profile?\n\n【1】These are not theoretical questions but are some of the difficult ones that health care professionals in the United States have faced over the past few years as a result of the widespread shortage of multiple drugs.

These 3 individuals are among the US experts most directly involved in our understanding of the effect of drug shortages and are also among those most active in addressing the causes of these shortages.\n\n【8】Although the authors explain that etiologies of drug shortages are multiple and complex, the initial “knee-jerk” response of most people who hear about the problem is to look toward the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to quickly find and implement a solution. However, the regulatory authority of the FDA is quite limited. The FDA, through its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, is the government agency responsible for protecting the public health by regulating the manufacturing of prescription and nonprescription drugs and by ensuring that medication is safe and effective and meets specific quality and labeling standards. These roles are critical for health care delivery but do not provide the agency the authority to address all aspects of the shortage problem. The FDA cannot require a pharmaceutical company to make a specific drug or to increase the amount of a drug produced, and it has no authority to set drug prices or to determine to whom a drug is distributed.\n\n【9】Although the number and classes of drugs in short supply have increased over the past decade, drug shortages are not a new problem in the United States. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Drug Shortage Program began in 1999, and the number of staff was recently increased to 11 in response to the greater workload caused by the growing number of shortages. The FDA staff has worked in conjunction with many stakeholder groups to raise awareness of the drug shortage problem and to seek solutions. Important milestones resulting from these relationships included the Drug Shortages Summit held in November 2010 (Bethesda, MD) and the Drug Shortage Public Workshop held in September 2011 (Silver Springs, MD). At the latter event, participants made several recommendations such as the need for improved communication among the FDA, stakeholder groups, and manufacturers.\n\n【10】\n\n【11】US Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration.

Manufacturers of life-supporting or life-sustaining drugs must now notify the FDA of a “permanent discontinuance in the manufacture of the drug or an interruption of the manufacture of the drug that is likely to lead to a meaningful disruption in the supply” at least 6 months in advance or as soon as is “practicable.”\n\n【19】\n\n【20】Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, 112th Cong, Public Law 112-144 (2012).\n\n【21】*   Google Scholar\n\n【22】This has been a powerful tool that has enabled FDA staff to prevent or mitigate numerous shortages in 2012 and 2013 by working with the manufacturers as soon as the FDA is made aware of problems.\n\n【23】The FDASIA requires that the FDA distribute information on drug shortages to physician, health care, and patient organizations and that the FDA maintain an up-to-date list of drugs that are in short supply. The law also requires the FDA to create a task force on drug shortages and develop and implement a strategic plan for preventing shortages.

(2) The profit margin for this class of drugs is extremely small. (3) There is no redundancy in the manufacturing capacity, and there are no backup production lines for these drugs. (4) There are only a few firms producing generic sterile injectable drugs. (5) Many of the manufacturing lines and facilities used for generic sterile injectable drugs are quite old and are at increased risk for production or sterility problems that result in shutdowns. Some manufacturers are building new plants that will help with the production process and capacity, but other possible causes such as the supply chain issues and raw material sourcing remain.\n\n【35】The FDASIA required the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study to examine the causes of the drug shortages and to provide recommendations on how to prevent or eliminate them. The GAO report is to be submitted to the Congress within 18 months after FDASIA was enacted, and it is hoped that this will shed sufficient light on the causes of the shortages so that new regulatory or legislative remedies can be implemented.\n\n【36】The problem of drug shortages is not confined to the United States, as documented in recent reports from Europe and Canada.\n\n【37】\n\n【38】*   Huys I.\n*   Simoens S.\n\n【39】European drug shortages: a call for action!.\n\n【40】_Int J Pharm Pract._ 2013; 21 : 1-2\n\n【41】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (15)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【42】\n\n【43】\n\n【44】*   Ferguson K.\n*   Woodcock T.\n\n【45】Ensuring a sustainable supply of drugs for anaesthesia and peri-operative care.\n\n【46】_Anaesthesia._ 2012; 67 : 1313-1316\n\n【47】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (6)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【48】\n\n【49】\n\n【50】*   Hall R.\n*   Chisholm R.\n*   Cheng D.\n*   Murphy M.\n*   Campbell D.\n\n【51】Drug shortages in anesthesia and perioperative medicine: Canada needs a better supply system.\n\n【52】_Can J Anaesth._ 2012; 59 : 629-635\n\n【53】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (7)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【54】\n\n【55】\n\n【56】*   Bedard M.\n\n【57】Drug shortages: can we resolve that problem?.\n\n【58】_Can J Anaesth._ 2013; 60 : 523-527\n\n【59】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (3)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【60】\n\n【61】\n\n【62】*   Hall R.\n*   Bryson G.L.\n*   Flowerdew G.\n*   Grabowski-Comeau A.\n*   Turgeon A.F.\n\n【63】Canadian Perioperative Anesthesia Clinical Trials Group  \nDrug shortages in Canadian anesthesia: a national survey \\[published correction appears in _Can J Anaesth._ 2013;60(11):1170\\].\n\n【64】_Can J Anaesth._ 2013; 60 : 539-551\n\n【65】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (32)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【66】Although their health care systems differ from that in the United States, many of the root causes of the international shortages appear to be identical to ours.

Because the company was a sole source supplier of 80% of these classes of drugs in Canada, this series of events had a catastrophic effect on the practices of anesthesiologists and critical care physicians in the country. To be cost-effective, most drug supply chains have adopted “just-in-time” delivery and the inventory reserves of manufacturers and suppliers are purposefully kept at a minimum. As such, the aforementioned Canadian disruption of drug production affected the supply chain and the end users extremely quickly, and the resulting shortage of drugs surprised most affected Canadian physicians.\n\n【73】To address this growing global problem, the International Drug Summit was held in Toronto, Canada, in June 2013.

The pain might worsen with certain movements, such as swinging a golf club.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】Consult your doctor if rest, ice and over-the-counter pain relievers don't ease your elbow pain and tenderness. Seek immediate care if:\n\n【10】*   Your elbow is hot and inflamed, and you have a fever\n*   You can't bend your elbow\n*   Your elbow looks deformed\n*   You suspect you've broken a bone\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】Golfer's elbow, also known as medial epicondylitis, is caused by damage to the muscles and tendons that control your wrist and fingers. The damage is typically related to excess or repeated stress — especially forceful wrist and finger motions. Improper lifting, throwing or hitting, as well as too little warmup or poor conditioning, also can contribute to golfer's elbow.\n\n【13】Besides golf, many activities and occupations can lead to golfer's elbow, including:\n\n【14】*   **Racket sports.** Improper technique with tennis strokes, especially the backhand, can cause injury to the tendon. Excessive use of topspin and using a racket that's too small or heavy also can lead to injury.\n*   **Throwing sports.** Improper pitching technique in baseball or softball can be another culprit. Football, archery and javelin throwing also can cause golfer's elbow.\n*   **Weight training.** Lifting weights using improper technique, such as curling the wrists during a biceps exercise, can overload the elbow muscles and tendons.\n*   **Forceful, repetitive occupational movements.** These occur in fields such as construction, plumbing and carpentry\n\n【15】To cause golfer's elbow, the activity generally needs to be done for more than an hour a day on many days.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】You could be at higher risk of developing golfer's elbow if you're:\n\n【18】*   Age 40 or older\n*   Performing repetitive activity at least two hours a day\n*   Obese\n*   A smoker\n\n【19】Prevention\n----------\n\n【20】You can take steps to prevent golfer's elbow:\n\n【21】*   **Strengthen your forearm muscles.** Use light weights or squeeze a tennis ball. Even simple exercises can help your muscles absorb the energy of sudden physical stress.\n*   **Stretch before your activity.** Walk or jog for a few minutes to warm up your muscles. Then do gentle stretches before you begin your game.\n*   **Fix your form.** Whatever your sport, ask an instructor to check your form to avoid overload on muscles.\n*   **Use the right equipment.** If you're using older golfing irons, consider upgrading to lighter graphite clubs. If you play tennis, make sure your racket fits you. A racket with a small grip or a heavy head may increase the risk of elbow problems.\n*   **Lift properly.** When lifting anything — including free weights — keep your wrist rigid and stable to reduce the force to your elbow.\n*   **Know when to rest.** Try not to overuse your elbow. At the first sign of elbow pain, take a break.\n\n【22】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Baseline eCRF in maximal metabolic equivalents was determined using nonexercise sex-specific algorithms and further grouped into age- and sex-specific tertiles.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Over a mean of 8.3±3.2 years of follow-up, 945 (3.9%) incident strokes occurred (377 in blacks and 568 in whites). The association between eCRF and stroke risk differed significantly by race ( _P_ <sub>Interaction </sub> <.001). In whites, after adjustment for stroke risk factors and physical functioning score, the hazard ratio of stroke was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.67-1.00) times lower in the middle tertile of eCRF than in the lowest tertile and was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.43-0.69) times lower in the highest tertile of eCRF. The protective effect of higher levels of eCRF on stroke incidence was more pronounced in those 60 years or older among whites. No association between eCRF and stroke risk was observed in blacks.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Estimated cardiorespiratory fitness measured using nonexercise equations is a useful predictor of stroke in whites. The lack of an overall association between eCRF and stroke risk in blacks suggests that the assessment of eCRF in blacks may not be helpful in primary stroke prevention.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BMI ( body mass index ), CRF ( cardiorespiratory fitness ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), DM ( diabetes mellitus ), ECG ( electrocardiographic ), eCRF ( estimated cardiorespiratory fitness ), HR ( hazard ratio ), MET ( metabolic equivalent ), PA ( physical activity ), REGARDS ( REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ), RHR ( resting heart rate ), WC ( waist circumference )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

Median survival after diagnosis of an MPE is 4 months. Patients can present with an MPE as a complication of far-advanced cancer or as the initial manifestation of an underlying malignancy. Common cancer types causing MPEs include lymphomas, mesotheliomas, and carcinomas of the breast, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and ovaries. However, almost all tumor types have been reported to cause MPEs. New imaging modalities assist the evaluation of patients with a suspected MPE; however, positive cytologic or tissue confirmation of malignant cells is necessary to establish a diagnosis. Even in the presence of known malignancy, up to 50% of pleural effusions are benign, underscoring the importance of a firm diagnosis to guide therapy. Rapidly evolving interventional and histopathologic techniques have improved the diagnostic yield of standard cytology and biopsy. Management of an MPE remains palliative; it is critical that the appropriate management approach is chosen on the basis of available expertise and the patient's clinical status. This review summarizes the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of MPE.

The CDI cases were identified by PCR in the inpatient and outpatient settings. The CDI IRs per 10,000 inpatient-days are estimated by year, surveillance category, age, sex, race/ethnicity, and Charlson comorbidity index. Recurrence rates are presented by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Death and colectomy in the 30 days after CDI diagnosis, white blood cell count, and serum creatinine level are assessed.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Among 268,655 patients, 4286 (1.6%) had CDI. Among these patients, 671 (15.7%) had recurrent infections. The IR was highest among community-onset, health care facility–associated infections (11.1 per 10,000 inpatient-days). The CDI IRs differed by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Overall, 528 patients (12.3%) died within 30 days of a positive CDI test result. The CDI IRs increased 34% with implementation of PCR testing.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Increasingly, PCR is being used because of its higher diagnostic sensitivity. Reassessing the epidemic using PCR updates our understanding of CDI risk. Our capacity to identify patients presenting in the outpatient setting after discharge provides a more accurate picture of health care–associated CDI rates, particularly because the community appears to assume an increasing role in CDI onset and possibly transmission. The CDI burden differs by race, comorbidity, sex, and previous health care use. The detected increase in CDI incidence after transitioning to PCR diagnosis was modest compared with previous studies.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CDI ( Clostridium difficile infection ), ED ( emergency department ), EIA ( enzyme immunoassay ), HCF ( health care facility ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), ICD-9-CM ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ), IR ( incidence rate ), KPSC ( Kaiser Permanente Southern California ), PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ), WBC ( white blood cell )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

Using polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and DNA sequencing, a comprehensive mutational analysis of the long QT syndrome susceptibility genes ( _KCNQ1_ , _KCNH2_ , _SCN5A, KCNE1,_ and _KCNE2_ ) and a targeted analysis of the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia type 1–associated gene ( _RYR2_ ) were conducted.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Overall, 45 putative pathogenic mutations absent in 400 to 700 controls were identified in 45 autopsy-negative SUD cases (26.0%). Females had a higher yield (26/67 \\[38.8%\\]) than males (19/106 \\[17.9%\\]; _P_ <.005). Among SUD cases with exercise-induced death, the yield trended higher among the 1- to 10-year-olds (8/12 \\[66.7%\\]) compared with the 11- to 20-year-olds (4/27 \\[14.8%\\]; _P_ \\=.002). In contrast, for those who died during a period of sleep, the 11- to 20-year-olds had a higher yield (9/25 \\[36.0%\\]) than the 1- to 10-year-olds (1/24 \\[4.2%\\]; _P_ \\=.01).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Cardiac channel molecular autopsy should be considered in the evaluation of autopsy-negative SUD. Several interesting genotype-phenotype observations may provide insight into the expected yields of postmortem genetic testing for SUD and assist in selecting cases with the greatest potential for mutation discovery and directing genetic testing efforts.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CPVT ( catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia ), LQTS ( long QT syndrome ), SCD ( sudden cardiac death ), SUD ( sudden unexplained death ), SUDEP ( sudden unexplained death in epilepsy )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

Risk stratification was performed using both the Parsonnet risk scoring system and the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation. Active follow-up by questionnaire investigated major adverse cardiac events.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】This study consisted of 84 patients with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range, 62-75 years); 14 (17%) were female. All patients had class III/IV symptoms. Previous operations included multiple coronary artery bypass grafts (15 patients \\[18%\\]) and heart transplantation (1 patient \\[1%\\]). Internal thoracic artery graft from a previous operation was patent in 43 patients (51%). Perioperative hemodynamic support with inotropes (35%) and intra-aortic balloon pump (14%) or ventricular assist device (2%) was common. The surgical approach varied for each patient. One operative death (1%) occurred. Estimated survival at 5 and 7 years was 77% and 67%, respectively. Late major adverse cardiac events observed during follow-up were cardiac death (n=66), nonoperative reintervention (n=8), and nonfatal myocardial infarction (n=5).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting can mitigate reoperative risk in patients with an estimated risk of 10% or higher who are undergoing single- or double-vessel revascularization with satisfactory long-term outcome.\n\n【8】CABG ( coronary artery bypass grafting ), CI ( confidence interval ), EuroSCORE ( European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation ), MIDCAB ( minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting ), OPCAB ( off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ), RR ( risk ratio )\n\n【9】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】One-time access price info\n\n【13】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】### Subscribe:\n\n【15】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】Already a print subscriber?

Maximal treadmill tests were conducted using the Balke protocol and were used to estimate CRF. We stratified patients into low, moderate, and high CRF categories. The FN BMD was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Odds ratios (ORs) for T-scores of −2.5 or less (osteoporosis) and −1.0 or less (low BMD) were calculated for categorical CRF and were adjusted for weight, age, and days per week of resistance activity.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The sample prevalence of osteoporosis in the FN was 4.1% and of low BMD was 49.4%. There was a significant inverse association between higher CRF category and osteoporosis measured at the FN (moderate vs low: OR=0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.74; high vs low: OR=0.19; 95% CI, 0.09-0.42) and low BMD (moderate vs low: OR=0.64; 95% CI, 0.43-0.96; high vs low: OR=0.43; 95% CI, 0.29-0.65).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In men, CRF is directly associated with BMD. These results suggest that moderate-to-high CRF levels attained through regular physical activity may attenuate age-related decline in BMD. Further studies are needed to determine whether this translates to a lower risk of osteoporotic fracture in more fit men.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACSM ( American College of Sports Medicine ), BMD ( bone mineral density ), BMI ( body mass index ), CCLS ( Cooper Center Longitudinal Study ), CRF ( estimated cardiorespiratory fitness ), DXA ( dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ), FN ( femoral neck ), MET ( metabolic equivalent ), OR ( odds ratio ), serum vitamin D ( 25-hydroxyvitamin D ), SMR ( standardized mortality ratio ), WHO ( World Health Organization )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

As part of the endocrine system, the adrenal glands produce hormones that give instructions to nearly every organ and tissue in the body.\n\n【2】You have two adrenal glands, one located above each kidney. Each gland contains two tissue types: the cortex and the medulla. Benign adrenal tumors that develop in the cortex are also called adrenal adenomas. Those that develop in the medulla are also called pheochromocytomas (fee-o-kroe-moe-sy-TOE-muhs).\n\n【3】Most benign adrenal tumors cause no symptoms and don't need treatment. But sometimes these tumors secrete high levels of certain hormones that can cause complications.\n\n【4】The most common hormones that can be over-secreted are aldosterone and cortisol from the cortex and adrenalin hormones from the medulla. In these cases, benign adrenal tumor treatment may include surgery or medications.\n\n【5】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "83b474a6-61bd-4295-9840-370fd72ddf73", "title": "Role of Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography in Patients With Suspected Choledocholithiasis", "text": "【0】Role of Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography in Patients With Suspected Choledocholithiasis\n### Objectives\n\n【1】To investigate the diagnostic efficacy of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in choledocholithiasis and to determine whether use of MRCP may eliminate the need for purely diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).\n\n【2】### Patients and Methods\n\n【3】A total of 116 patients with suspected biliopancreatic pathology were studied prospectively between November 1996 and February 1998. Choledocholithiasis was initially suspected in 61 patients and rated before ERCP and MRCP as being of low, intermediate, or high probability based on clinical, laboratory, and/or imaging findings (Cotton criteria).\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】The sensitivity of choledocholithiasis diagnosis was 91%, with a global efficacy of 90%. The level of duct stone obstruction was visualized in all patients. Suprastenotic dilatation also showed a good correlation to ERCP. Choledocholithiasis was found in 32 patients (65%) and 3 patients (33%) in the high- and intermediate- probability groups, respectively. None of the low-probability patients had choledocholithiasis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed for only a diagnostic (not therapeutic) purpose in 3 patients (6%) and 2 patients (22%) of the high- and intermediate- probability cases, respectively.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography seems to be effective in diagnosing choledocholithiasis. It plays a fundamental role in patients with a low or intermediate risk of choledocholithiasis, contributing to the avoidance of purely diagnostic ERCP.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】CT ( computed tomography ), ERCP ( endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ), HASTE ( half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo ), MRCP ( magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography )\n\n【10】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】### Subscribe:\n\n【16】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【17】Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "f0736ff3-00ff-4cac-8e3b-e15224383772", "title": "Meningioma", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】A meningioma is a tumor that arises from the meninges — the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Although not technically a brain tumor, it is included in this category because it may compress or squeeze the adjacent brain, nerves and vessels. Meningioma is the most common type of tumor that forms in the head.\n\n【2】Most meningiomas grow very slowly, often over many years without causing symptoms. But sometimes, their effects on nearby brain tissue, nerves or vessels may cause serious disability.\n\n【3】Meningiomas occur more commonly in women and are often discovered at older ages, but they may occur at any age.\n\n【4】Because most meningiomas grow slowly, often without any significant signs and symptoms, they do not always require immediate treatment and may be monitored over time.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms of a meningioma typically begin gradually and may be very subtle at first. Depending on where in the brain or, rarely, spine the tumor is situated, signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【7】*   Changes in vision, such as seeing double or blurriness\n*   Headaches, especially those that are worse in the morning\n*   Hearing loss or ringing in the ears\n*   Memory loss\n*   Loss of smell\n*   Seizures\n*   Weakness in your arms or legs\n*   Language difficulty\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】Most signs and symptoms of a meningioma evolve slowly, but sometimes a meningioma requires emergency care.\n\n【10】**Seek emergency care** if you have:\n\n【11】*   Sudden onset of seizures\n*   Sudden changes in vision or memory\n\n【12】**Make an appointment to see your health care provider** if you have persistent signs and symptoms that concern you, such as headaches that worsen over time.\n\n【13】In many cases, because meningiomas do not cause any noticeable signs or symptoms, they are only discovered as a result of imaging scans done for reasons that turn out to be unrelated to the tumor, such as a head injury, stroke or headaches.\n\n【14】Causes\n------\n\n【15】It isn't clear what causes a meningioma. Doctors know that something alters some cells in your meninges to make them multiply out of control, leading to a meningioma tumor.\n\n【16】Whether this occurs because of genes you inherit, hormones (which may be related to the more frequent occurrence in women), the rare instance of prior exposure to radiation or other factors remains largely unknown. There is no solid evidence to support the belief that meningiomas occur because of cellphone use.\n\n【17】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【18】Risk factors for a meningioma include:\n\n【19】*   **Radiation treatment.** Radiation therapy that involves radiation to the head may increase the risk of a meningioma.\n*   **Female hormones.** Meningiomas are more common in women, leading doctors to believe that female hormones may play a role. Some studies have also suggested a link between breast cancer and meningioma risk related to the role of hormones. Some research suggests that the use of oral birth control and hormone replacement therapy could raise the risk of meningioma growth.\n*   **An inherited nervous system disorder.** The rare disorder neurofibromatosis 2 increases the risk of meningioma and other brain tumors.\n*   **Obesity.** A high body mass index (BMI) is an established risk factor for many types of cancers, and a higher prevalence of meningiomas among obese people has been observed in several large studies. But the relationship between obesity and meningiomas is not clear.\n\n【20】Complications\n-------------\n\n【21】A meningioma and its treatment, typically surgery and radiation therapy, can cause long-term complications, including:\n\n【22】*   Difficulty concentrating\n*   Memory loss\n*   Personality changes\n*   Seizures\n*   Weakness\n*   Sensory changes\n*   Language difficulty\n\n【23】Your provider can treat some complications and refer you to specialists to help you cope with other complications.\n\n【24】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "561bfaf6-71aa-4c17-836d-1316bd7f822a", "title": "Dabrafenib (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Dabrafenib (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Tafinlar\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】  \n\n【6】Dabrafenib is used alone or in combination with trametinib to treat melanoma (skin cancer) that has spread or that cannot be removed by surgery. It is also used together with trametinib to help prevent melanoma from coming back after surgery. It is only used if the melanoma cells have the BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. Dabrafenib is also used together with trametinib to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) that has spread and has no satisfactory treatment options. It is only used if the NSCLC cells and ATC cells have the BRAF V600E mutation. Dabrafenib is also used in combination with trametinib to treat solid tumors that have spread, that cannot be removed by surgery, or that have gotten worse (progressed) and has no satisfactory treatment options. It is only used if the solid tumors have the BRAF V600E mutations. Dabrafenib is also used in combination with trametinib to treat low-grade glioma (LGG) in patients who require other treatments. It is only used if the brain tumor has the BRAF V600E mutations. Your doctor will use a special test to look for these mutations. Dabrafenib belongs to the group of medicines, called antineoplastics (cancer medicines).\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Capsule\n*   Tablet for Suspension\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of dabrafenib to treat melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and anaplastic thyroid cancer in children, to treat solid tumors in children younger than 6 years of age, and to treat glioma in children younger than 1 year of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dabrafenib in the elderly.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

{"seq_id": "b96dc40d-020b-4f8d-aa29-9337e54c441f", "title": "High blood pressure (hypertension)", "text": "【0】High blood pressure (hypertension)\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】High blood pressure is a common condition that affects the body's arteries. It's also called hypertension. If you have high blood pressure, the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls is consistently too high. The heart has to work harder to pump blood.\n\n【2】Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). In general, hypertension is a blood pressure reading of 130/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher.\n\n【3】The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association divide blood pressure into four general categories. Ideal blood pressure is categorized as normal.)\n\n【4】*   **Normal blood pressure.** Blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg or lower.\n*   **Elevated blood pressure.** The top number ranges from 120 to 129 mm Hg and the bottom number is below, not above, 80 mm Hg.\n*   **Stage 1 hypertension.** The top number ranges from 130 to 139 mm Hg or the bottom number is between 80 and 89 mm Hg.\n*   **Stage 2 hypertension.** The top number is 140 mm Hg or higher or the bottom number is 90 mm Hg or higher.\n\n【5】Blood pressure higher than 180/120 mm Hg is considered a hypertensive emergency or crisis. Seek emergency medical help for anyone with these blood pressure numbers.\n\n【6】Untreated, high blood pressure increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and other serious health problems. It's important to have your blood pressure checked at least every two years starting at age 18. Some people need more-frequent checks.\n\n【7】Healthy lifestyle habits —such as not smoking, exercising and eating well — can help prevent and treat high blood pressure. Some people need medicine to treat high blood pressure.\n\n【8】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【9】Most people with high blood pressure have no symptoms, even if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels. You can have high blood pressure for years without any symptoms.\n\n【10】A few people with high blood pressure may have:\n\n【11】*   Headaches\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Nosebleeds\n\n【12】However, these symptoms aren't specific. They usually don't occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or life-threatening stage.\n\n【13】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【14】Blood pressure screening is an important part of general health care. How often you should get your blood pressure checked depends on your age and overall health.\n\n【15】Ask your provider for a blood pressure reading at least every two years starting at age 18. If you're age 40 or older, or you're 18 to 39 with a high risk of high blood pressure, ask for a blood pressure check every year.\n\n【16】Your care provider will likely recommend more-frequent readings if have high blood pressure or other risk factors for heart disease.\n\n【17】Children age 3 and older may have blood pressure measured as a part of their yearly checkups.\n\n【18】If you don't regularly see a care provider, you may be able to get a free blood pressure screening at a health resource fair or other locations in your community. Free blood pressure machines are also available in some stores and pharmacies. The accuracy of these machines depends on several things, such as a correct cuff size and proper use of the machines. Ask your health care provider for advice on using public blood pressure machines.\n\n【19】Causes\n------\n\n【20】Blood pressure is determined by two things: the amount of blood the heart pumps and how hard it is for the blood to move through the arteries. The more blood the heart pumps and the narrower the arteries, the higher the blood pressure.\n\n【21】There are two main types of high blood pressure.\n\n【22】### Primary hypertension, also called essential hypertension\n\n【23】For most adults, there's no identifiable cause of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure is called primary hypertension or essential hypertension. It tends to develop gradually over many years. Plaque buildup in the arteries, called atherosclerosis, increases the risk of high blood pressure.\n\n【24】### Secondary hypertension\n\n【25】This type of high blood pressure is caused by an underlying condition. It tends to appear suddenly and cause higher blood pressure than does primary hypertension. Conditions and medicines that can lead to secondary hypertension include:\n\n【26】*   Adrenal gland tumors\n*   Blood vessel problems present at birth, also called congenital heart defects\n*   Cough and cold medicines, some pain relievers, birth control pills, and other prescription drugs\n*   Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines\n*   Kidney disease\n*   Obstructive sleep apnea\n*   Thyroid problems\n\n【27】Sometimes just getting a health checkup causes blood pressure to increase. This is called white coat hypertension.\n\n【28】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【29】High blood pressure has many risk factors, including:\n\n【30】*   **Age.** The risk of high blood pressure increases with age. Until about age 64, high blood pressure is more common in men. Women are more likely to develop high blood pressure after age 65.\n*   **Race.** High blood pressure is particularly common among Black people. It develops at an earlier age in Black people than it does in white people.\n*   **Family history.** You're more likely to develop high blood pressure if you have a parent or sibling with the condition.\n*   **Obesity or being overweight.** Excess weight causes changes in the blood vessels, the kidneys and other parts of the body. These changes often increase blood pressure. Being overweight or having obesity also raises the risk of heart disease and its risk factors, such as high cholesterol.\n*   **Lack of exercise.** Not exercising can cause weight gain. Increased weight raises the risk of high blood pressure. People who are inactive also tend to have higher heart rates.\n*   **Tobacco use or vaping.** Smoking, chewing tobacco or vaping immediately raises blood pressure for a short while. Tobacco smoking injures blood vessel walls and speeds up the process of hardening of the arteries. If you smoke, ask your care provider for strategies to help you quit.\n*   **Too much salt.** A lot of salt — also called sodium — in the body can cause the body to retain fluid. This increases blood pressure.\n*   **Low potassium levels.** Potassium helps balance the amount of salt in the body's cells. A proper balance of potassium is important for good heart health. Low potassium levels may be due to a lack of potassium in the diet or certain health conditions, including dehydration.\n*   **Drinking too much alcohol.** Alcohol use has been linked with increased blood pressure, particularly in men.\n*   **Stress.** High levels of stress can lead to a temporary increase in blood pressure. Stress-related habits such as eating more, using tobacco or drinking alcohol can lead to further increases in blood pressure.\n*   **Certain chronic conditions.** Kidney disease, diabetes and sleep apnea are some of the conditions that can lead to high blood pressure.\n*   **Pregnancy.** Sometimes pregnancy causes high blood pressure.\n\n【31】High blood pressure is most common in adults. But kids can have high blood pressure too. High blood pressure in children may be caused by problems with the kidneys or heart. But for a growing number of kids, high blood pressure is due to lifestyle habits such as an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise.\n\n【32】Complications\n-------------\n\n【33】The excessive pressure on the artery walls caused by high blood pressure can damage blood vessels and body organs. The higher the blood pressure and the longer it goes uncontrolled, the greater the damage.\n\n【34】Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to complications including:\n\n【35】*   **Heart attack or stroke.** Hardening and thickening of the arteries due to high blood pressure or other factors can lead to a heart attack, stroke or other complications.\n*   **Aneurysm.** Increased blood pressure can cause a blood vessel to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm. If an aneurysm ruptures, it can be life-threatening.\n*   **Heart failure.** When you have high blood pressure, the heart has to work harder to pump blood. The strain causes the walls of the heart's pumping chamber to thicken. This condition is called left ventricular hypertrophy. Eventually, the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, causing heart failure.\n*   **Kidney problems.** High blood pressure can cause the blood vessels in the kidneys to become narrow or weak. This can lead to kidney damage.\n*   **Eye problems.** Increased blood pressure can cause thickened, narrowed or torn blood vessels in the eyes. This can result in vision loss.\n*   **Metabolic syndrome.** This syndrome is a group of disorders of the body's metabolism. It involves the irregular breakdown of sugar, also called glucose. The syndrome includes increased waist size, high triglycerides, decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL or \"good\") cholesterol, high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels. These conditions make you more likely to develop diabetes, heart disease and stroke.\n*   **Changes with memory or understanding.** Uncontrolled high blood pressure may affect the ability to think, remember and learn.\n*   **Dementia.** Narrowed or blocked arteries can limit blood flow to the brain. This can cause a certain type of dementia called vascular dementia. A stroke that interrupts blood flow to the brain also can cause vascular dementia.\n\n【36】By Mayo Clinic Staff", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
