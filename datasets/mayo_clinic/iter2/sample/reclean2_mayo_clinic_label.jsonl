Useful guidelines provide guidance to busy clinicians but at the same time allow opportunity to understand the evidence behind each recommendation. The intended result of clinical practice guidelines is that patients will benefit from optimal, evidence-based health care and outcomes.\n\n【20】The primer by Murad in this issue of the _Proceedings_\n\n【21】无关删除-2:<u>*   Murad M.H.</u>\n\n【22】Clinical practice guidelines: a primer on development and dissemination.\n\n【23】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2017; 92 : 423-433</u></u>\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (229)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【25】directs the reader through the methodological standards for guideline development. By providing a clear outline of important guideline considerations, this primer can constructively lead multidisciplinary groups through the process of developing useful guidelines. Murad also describes a multilayered approach that allows a busy clinician to quickly access guideline recommendations but also permits deeper layers of evaluation of the evidence behind the recommendations.\n\n【26】Several challenges accompany the development of high-quality clinical practice guidelines. Diverse groups produce clinical practice guidelines, including specialty societies, disease advocacy groups, governmental agencies, and health plans. Variable methodologies and quality of guideline development processes can result in differing conclusions, and separate groups may produce conflicting guidelines. In order for guidelines to improve outcomes, it is critical to ensure they are unbiased, scientifically valid, and trustworthy.\n\n【27】The US National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) has established “guidelines for guidelines,” describing the methodology for developing clinical practice guidelines 删除4:<u>( Table )</u>.\n\n【28】Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, Committee on Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical Practice Guidelines\n\n【29】Graham R.

A sed rate test isn't a stand-alone diagnostic tool, but it can help your doctor diagnose or monitor the progress of an inflammatory disease.\n\n【2】When your blood is placed in a tall, thin tube, red blood cells (erythrocytes) gradually settle to the bottom. Inflammation can cause the cells to clump. Because these clumps are denser than individual cells, they settle to the bottom more quickly.\n\n【3】The sed rate test measures the distance red blood cells fall in a test tube in one hour. The farther the red blood cells have descended, the greater the inflammatory response of your immune system.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Sed rate tests might be useful when evaluating unexplained fever, some types of arthritis and symptoms that affect your muscles. Also, they can help confirm a diagnosis of certain conditions, including:\n\n【6】*   Giant cell arteritis\n*   Polymyalgia rheumatica\n*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n\n【7】A sed rate test can also help determine the severity of your inflammatory response and monitor the effect of treatment.\n\n【8】Because a sed rate test can't pinpoint the problem that's causing inflammation in your body, it's usually accompanied by other blood tests, such as the C-reactive protein (CRP) test.\n\n【9】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【10】The sed rate is a simple blood test. You don't need to fast before the test.\n\n【11】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【12】A phlebotomist, nurse or medical assistant will use a needle to draw blood from a vein, most likely a vein in your arm. After the test, the site on your arm might be tender for a few hours, but you'll be able to resume most normal activities.\n\n【13】Results\n-------\n\n【14】Results from your sed rate test will be reported in the distance in millimeters (mm) that red blood cells have descended in one hour (hr). The normal range is 0 to 22 mm/hr for men and 0 to 29 mm/hr for women. The upper threshold for a normal sed rate value may vary somewhat from one medical practice to another.\n\n【15】Your sed rate is one piece of information to help your doctor check your health. Talk to your doctor about what your sed rate results mean in light of your symptoms and the results of your other diagnostic tests.\n\n【16】### Accuracy of test results\n\n【17】A number of conditions can affect the properties of blood, thereby affecting how quickly red blood cells sink in a sample of blood. So information about inflammatory disease — what your doctor intends to learn from the sed rate test — can be obscured by the influence of other conditions. These complicating factors include:\n\n【18】*   Advanced age\n*   Anemia\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Kidney problems\n*   Thyroid disease\n*   Some cancers, such as multiple myeloma\n*   Infection\n\n【19】Your doctor will take into account possible complicating factors when interpreting the results of your sed rate test.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Burnout was measured using validated metrics, and satisfaction with work-life balance was assessed using standard tools.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of the 35,922 physicians who received an invitation to participate, 6880 (19.2%) completed surveys. When assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, 54.4% (n=3680) of the physicians reported at least 1 symptom of burnout in 2014 compared with 45.5% (n=3310) in 2011 ( _P_ <.001). Satisfaction with work-life balance also declined in physicians between 2011 and 2014 (48.5% vs 40.9%; _P_ <.001). Substantial differences in rates of burnout and satisfaction with work-life balance were observed by specialty. In contrast to the trends in physicians, minimal changes in burnout or satisfaction with work-life balance were observed between 2011 and 2014 in probability-based samples of working US adults, resulting in an increasing disparity in burnout and satisfaction with work-life balance in physicians relative to the general US working population. After pooled multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, relationship status, and hours worked per week, physicians remained at an increased risk of burnout (odds ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.80-2.16; _P_ <.001) and were less likely to be satisfied with work-life balance (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.62-0.75; _P_ <.001).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Burnout and satisfaction with work-life balance in US physicians worsened from 2011 to 2014. More than half of US physicians are now experiencing professional burnout.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AMA ( American Medical Association ), MBI ( Maslach Burnout Inventory ), PMF ( Physician Master File ), WLB ( work-life balance )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 months before this admission, when she first noticed a feeling of asthenia that gradually deteriorated. Her past medical history was unremarkable, and the physical examination disclosed no abnormalities. Laboratory tests revealed severe hypercalcemia (13.8 mg/dL; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.25) and acute kidney injury (serum creatinine concentration, 1.7 mg/dL; to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4). Additional laboratory test results included excessive urine calcium excretion, low serum parathormone (PTH) level, low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (12.3 ng/mL; to convert to nmol/L, multiply by 2.496), increased activity of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (211 U/L; to convert to nkat/L, multiply by 16.667), and normal serum level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (25.8 pg/mL; to convert to pmol/L, multiply by 2.4). Interferon-γ release assay and a tuberculin test response were negative.\n\n【7】The diagnostic process was focused on the dangerously high serum calcium concentration. Suppressed PTH levels narrowed the differential diagnosis to malignant disease–related hypercalcemia and ectopic calcitriol production. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) showed no signs of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, bone scintigraphy excluded osteolytic metastases, and normal PTH-related protein levels (<1 pmol/L) ruled out PTH-related protein–secreting malignant neoplasm. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation excluded classic secretory multiple myeloma; nonsecretory multiple myeloma was ruled out by a bone marrow biopsy.\n\n【8】The more likely conditions having been eliminated, the probability of a granulomatous disease refocused the diagnostic work-up. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels coupled with inappropriate normal levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D could suggest a PTH-independent extrarenal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) production by resident granuloma macrophages.\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>*   Tebben P.J.\n*   Singh R.J.\n*   Kumar R.</u>\n\n【10】Vitamin D–mediated hypercalcemia: mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\n【11】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Endocr Rev._ 2016; 37 : 521-547</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (201)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【13】Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was not indicative of an underlying disease, leading us to a diagnostic dead end. This prompted a positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) scan that showed diffuse uptake of  F-fluorodeoxyglucose exclusively throughout the adipose tissue 删除4:<u>( Figure )</u>.

The prognostic value of several variables was examined using Cox proportional hazards models, and the survival time was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis; curves were compared using the log-rank test.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Patients with UA levels greater than 8 mg/dL had a median overall survival of 9 months from diagnosis compared with 20.3 months for the remaining patients ( _P_ <.001). The prognostic value of UA was independent of the known cardiac prognostic markers cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and N-terminal propeptide of brain-type natriuretic peptide (NTProBNP). Addition of UA to these factors allows us to classify patients into 4 groups with significantly different outcomes. Patients with none, 1, 2, or 3 of these risk factors (UA, >8 mg/dL; cTnT, >0.035 ng/mL; and NTProBNP, >332 pg/mL) had a median overall survival of 36.6, 29.2, 11.1, and 3.6 months, respectively ( _P_ <.001). Similarly, UA levels helped predict overall survival in patients undergoing peripheral blood stem cell transplant for AL and added to the value of cTnT and NTProBNP.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】The data confirm the prognostic utility of cTnT and NTProBNP in a large group of patients and highlight the value of serum UA in allowing better forecasting of probable outcomes for patients with AL.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】AL ( amyloidosis ), BNP ( brain-type natriuretic peptide ), CHF ( chronic heart failure ), CI ( confidence interval ), cTnT ( cardiac troponin T ), NTProBNP ( N-terminal propeptide of BNP ), PBSCT ( peripheral blood stem cell transplant ), OS ( overall survival ), UA ( uric acid )\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "d9ca5743-2994-4011-a3fc-efdf1a90e101", "title": "Chest X-rays", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Chest X-rays produce images of your heart, lungs, blood vessels, airways, and the bones of your chest and spine. Chest X-rays can also reveal fluid in or around your lungs or air surrounding a lung.\n\n【2】If you go to your doctor or the emergency room with chest pain, a chest injury or shortness of breath, you will typically get a chest X-ray. The image helps your doctor determine whether you have heart problems, a collapsed lung, pneumonia, broken ribs, emphysema, cancer or any of several other conditions.\n\n【3】Some people have a series of chest X-rays done over time to track whether a health problem is getting better or worse.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Chest X-rays are a common type of exam. A chest X-ray is often among the first procedures you'll have if your doctor suspects heart or lung disease. A chest X-ray can also be used to check how you are responding to treatment.\n\n【6】A chest X-ray can reveal many things inside your body, including:\n\n【7】*   **The condition of your lungs.** Chest X-rays can detect cancer, infection or air collecting in the space around a lung, which can cause the lung to collapse. They can also show chronic lung conditions, such as emphysema or cystic fibrosis, as well as complications related to these conditions.\n*   **Heart-related lung problems.** Chest X-rays can show changes or problems in your lungs that stem from heart problems. For instance, fluid in your lungs can be a result of congestive heart failure.\n*   **The size and outline of your heart.** Changes in the size and shape of your heart may indicate heart failure, fluid around the heart or heart valve problems.\n*   **Blood vessels.** Because the outlines of the large vessels near your heart — the aorta and pulmonary arteries and veins — are visible on X-rays, they may reveal aortic aneurysms, other blood vessel problems or congenital heart disease.\n*   **Calcium deposits.** Chest X-rays can detect the presence of calcium in your heart or blood vessels. Its presence may indicate fats and other substances in your vessels, damage to your heart valves, coronary arteries, heart muscle or the protective sac that surrounds the heart. Calcified nodules in your lungs are most often from an old, resolved infection.\n*   **Fractures.** Rib or spine fractures or other problems with bone may be seen on a chest X-ray.\n*   **Postoperative changes.** Chest X-rays are useful for monitoring your recovery after you've had surgery in your chest, such as on your heart, lungs or esophagus. Your doctor can look at any lines or tubes that were placed during surgery to check for air leaks and areas of fluid or air buildup.\n*   **A pacemaker, defibrillator or catheter.** Pacemakers and defibrillators have wires attached to your heart to help control your heart rate and rhythm. Catheters are small tubes used to deliver medications or for dialysis. A chest X-ray usually is taken after placement of such medical devices to make sure everything is positioned correctly.\n\n【8】Risks\n-----\n\n【9】You may be concerned about radiation exposure from chest X-rays, especially if you have them regularly. But the amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is low — even lower than what you're exposed to through natural sources of radiation in the environment.\n\n【10】Even though the benefits of an X-ray outweigh the risk, you may be given a protective apron if you need multiple images. Tell your doctor if you're pregnant or might be pregnant. The procedure can be performed in a way to protect your abdomen from the radiation.\n\n【11】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【12】Before the chest X-ray, you generally undress from the waist up and wear an exam gown. You'll need to remove jewelry from the waist up, too, since both clothing and jewelry can obscure the X-ray images.\n\n【13】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【14】During the procedure, your body is positioned between a machine that produces the X-rays and a plate that creates the image digitally or with X-ray film. You may be asked to move into different positions in order to take views from both the front and the side of your chest.\n\n【15】During the front view, you stand against the plate, hold your arms up or to the sides and roll your shoulders forward. The X-ray technician may ask you to take a deep breath and hold it for several seconds. Holding your breath after inhaling helps your heart and lungs show up more clearly on the image.\n\n【16】During the side views, you turn and place one shoulder on the plate and raise your hands over your head. Again, you may be asked to take a deep breath and hold it.\n\n【17】Having X-rays taken is generally painless. You don't feel any sensation as the radiation passes through your body. If you have trouble standing, you may be able to have the exam while seated or lying down.\n\n【18】Results\n-------\n\n【19】A chest X-ray produces a black-and-white image that shows the organs in your chest. Structures that block radiation appear white, and structures that let radiation through appear black.\n\n【20】Your bones appear white because they are very dense. Your heart also appears as a lighter area. Your lungs are filled with air and block very little radiation, so they appear as darker areas on the images.\n\n【21】A radiologist — a doctor trained to interpret X-rays and other imaging exams — analyzes the images, looking for clues that may suggest if you have heart failure, fluid around your heart, cancer, pneumonia or another condition.\n\n【22】Your own doctor will discuss the results with you as well as what treatments or other tests or procedures may be necessary.\n\n【23】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Genealogical methods were used to expand the family tree, and family members were screened with an RLS questionnaire. Telephone interviews and personal examinations were performed at Mayo Clinic and during a field trip to Central Indiana. Blood samples were collected for molecular genetic analysis. A follow-up telephone interview was conducted 1 year later.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】The family tree spans 7 generations with 88 living members, 30 of whom meet the criteria for diagnosis of RLS established by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Three affected family members also have Parkinson disease or essential tremor. The mode of RLS inheritance is compatible with an autosomal dominant pattern. The affected family members do not exhibit linkage to the 5 known RLS loci or mutations in the RLS susceptibility genes _MEIS1_ and _BTBD9_ .\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Of 88 members of this single extended family in Central Indiana, 30 were diagnosed as having RLS. Because our analysis shows that the disease is not linked to any of the known RLS loci or risk-associated genes, we postulate that members of this family may carry a gene mutation in a novel genetic locus.\n\n【8】BTBD9 ( BTB (POZ) domain containing 9 ), LOD ( logarithm of the odds ), MEIS1 ( Meis homeobox 1 ), PD ( Parkinson disease ), PLM ( periodic leg movement ), RLS ( restless legs syndrome )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

However, as discussed in our editorial, the data of Czeisler et al are from a nonresident physician population, and extrapolation of the data is difficult.

Regardless of any regulations for physicians during or after training, medical decisions and actions must be made at times when the practitioner is experiencing fatigue. What if a legal stimulant that is shown to be safe could be used to improve medical care during periods of fatigue, regardless of the number of hours worked? Would not the more ethical choice be to promote the reduction of errors—First, do no harm? With publication of original research articles such as that by Czeisler et al in _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , use of prescribed drugs to promote wakefulness in the absence of comorbidities, such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, will undoubtedly move from the military into the public arena. As the debate on duty hours and their effect on physician training, patient care, medical economics, and resident well-being will continue to rage on, these types of discussions need to be held in hopes that we can find a strategy to train the next generation of physicians in the most safe, ethical, and efficient manner possible.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Armonk, New York) and identified patients with cancer from January 1999 to October 2019, with various types of ATE, including myocardial infarction, acute ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, acute mesenteric ischemia, acute renal infarction, and retinal artery occlusion. We investigated the temporal relationship between cancer diagnosis and ATE events by examining the incidence ratio (IR) of ATE before and after diagnosis of cancer.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We identified 305,384 patients with cancer and ATE. The 30-day interval IR of total ATE was elevated shortly before and after cancer diagnosis, which was consistent among different ATE and cancer types. The incidence was highest within a 330-day window (90 days before and 240 days after cancer diagnosis), and IR peaked at 13.9 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 13.6 to 14.2) in the first 30 days following diagnosis of cancer. Compared with patients with cancer who never developed ATE, patients with ATE had more cardiovascular risk factors at baseline. Patients with brain cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer had the highest risk of developing ATE, whereas ATE type was anatomically associated with cancer type.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In this observational study of an aggregated US patient population, those with newly diagnosed cancer had increased risk of ATE events.

The obligation, or opportunity, to write such a closing piece became apparent in the early days of my EIC tenure, through meeting and joining in fellowship with other EICs who led significant journals and approached their jobs with dedication and dignity. Two elements impressed me about these editors: (1) they had an immense knowledge of their journals' history and values and (2) they all would write closing editorials when their terms had ended.\n\n【4】I initially thought that these closing editorials were primarily a tool for the EICs to say thank you to those with whom they had interacted over the years and secondarily a method to publicly review their successes one last time. However, this interpretation changed in late 1999 when the _Proceedings_ publisher suggested that I write an annual January editorial to explain the Journal's current status and mission for the upcoming year. I initially resisted, in part because I had published an introductory tone-setting editorial the previous January,\n\n【5】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【6】Leading _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ into the future.\n\n【7】删除3:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 1999; 74 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 104</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (5)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【9】and I feared that the time spent on writing an introspective editorial each year would be a distraction from the more meaningful ambition of enriching the lives of those served by the Journal—ie, the authors, readers, and ultimately patients.\n\n【10】Nevertheless, for the entirety of my 18 years, I indeed wrote January editorials and soon developed a great respect for their potential utility. (My 2000 editorial was entitled “The Evolution of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ ,”\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【12】The evolution of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ .\n\n【13】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2000; 75 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 8-9</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (12)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【15】and it set the course and tone of Journal actions for almost 2 decades.) I soon learned that the annual editorials were an opportunity to detail for readers how the Journal planned to make meaningful progress each upcoming year, and they would force Journal leadership to continually envision innovations to incrementally improve Journal operations and content. As so formulated, the January editorials also provided an accounting for the promises made 12 months previously. In brief, annually sharing aspirations for Journal improvements with others carried benefits that I never previously anticipated.\n\n【16】Throughout my term as EIC, my teammates (on the editorial board, staff, and elsewhere) and I have conducted _Proceedings_ operations as if the Journal were a _learning laboratory_ , and we have freely shared our challenges, successes, and failures with students who wished to learn along with us. It is in this spirit that I share with you a previously untold aspect of Journal life: the values and philosophy we used to bring about change. This is not a story of publicly shared metrics, even though we teammates knew we would be held accountable for our actions, and we knew how the accounting would be formulated: _There is only one proof of ability - results.

Accessed May 3, 2017.</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【19】I have always assumed that this quote applies equally to men and women, including those who serve as journal leaders.\n\n【20】Many have remarked that the most far-reaching changes at the _Proceedings_ during the period of 1999 to the present reflected a fundamental change in Journal culture. To address this interest, in my final communication as outgoing EIC, I will describe the philosophy behind those cultural changes and many specific actions taken.\n\n【21】### The Values and Motivations That Guided Our Mission\n\n【22】#### Priming the Pump\n\n【23】We sincerely wanted progressive change at the _Proceedings_ , but we needed some tangible asset to _prime the pump of success_ , and we needed to make sure that this asset was immediately visible to all with whom we interacted. We began by fine-tuning staff and editorial board interactions with authors and readers. Efforts were made to redouble, then redouble again, improvements in communications, response times, and many other factors that demonstrated to those we served, “We respect you, and we honor our relationship with you.”\n\n【24】Restated, we attempted to practice servant leadership, in which our sole raison d'être was to serve as a conduit between those authors who contributed manuscripts, the readers who read the articles we published, and eventually the patients served by the new knowledge we disseminated.\n\n【25】#### Restructuring and Redirecting the Staff\n\n【26】During my tenure as EIC, the in-house staff of the _Proceedings_ ranged from 3 to 8 individuals. The larger number coincided with a period during which the Journal was largely self-published: ie, the staff oversaw peer-review logistics, copyediting, layout, and transmission of print-ready articles to the printer. (The publishing company of record during these periods handled circulation, market research, advertising sales, and related matters.) The smaller numbers represent the current era in which the Journal is represented by a full-service publisher, and activities of the local staff members are augmented and complemented by a “virtual office staff” of many more.\n\n【27】One would assume that the larger staff size would provide more opportunity for brainstorming and planning innovations for the Journal's future, but this was not the case. Instead, we discovered, quite by accident, that the larger staff size correlated with a period in which single members or pairs of members of the staff were engaged in highly specialized activities—eg, copyediting, layout—that encouraged, if not demanded, the formation of activity silos within overall staff operations. It was only later—after engaging a full-service medical publisher and outsourcing much of the silo-affiliated activities previously addressed within the office—that we began to more fully engage the staff (functioning as a unit) in creative and operational planning for the future. This shift in staff functions and philosophy also was tremendously influenced by (1) the introduction of electronic manuscript processing and (2) the continuous feeding of accepted manuscripts to our publisher (who, in turn, handled final article preparation and continuous feeding of content to the electronic version of the Journal).\n\n【28】Yes, this new approach to staff functionality still demanded that every single important duty within the Journal must have a chief advocate; however, with time, the increased transparency of the new approach allowed others to help critique and contribute creativity and labor more broadly to all Journal operations.\n\n【29】Staff members were encouraged, and even expected, to represent the Journal outside the confines of the Journal offices, by serving on task forces and committees, interacting with think tanks of creative people, and attending and presenting at local and national meetings. As such, our staff members developed new, previously untapped, relationships with others—ie, authors, reviewers, editorial board members, and many more—who gained a better appreciation for the Journal's mission and brand than they might have otherwise.\n\n【30】#### A Welcoming Working Environment\n\n【31】With the support of Mayo Clinic, we collaborated with workplace designers to create a newsroom environment, and the person serving as primary contact to the outside world (serving as a receptionist in addition to other duties) was positioned in the center of the office, in direct line-of-sight of the entrance doorway. Surrounding this open central space were individual offices, such that a quick verbal request to the staff members could get input from all within seconds. Later, we added a library/conference room with the appropriate electronic gadgets needed to facilitate both local and worldwide teleconferencing. Across the interior hallway, we added a studio for taping podcasts and related video communications.\n\n【32】Since completion of the new office design, we have had a steady flow of authors, reviewers, staff members, board members, business consultants, creative consultants, and many more who have been invited into our space to discuss plans for manuscripts, collections of manuscripts, creative design, budgets, and so much more. Many of these gatherings (including weekly 9 AM Tuesday morning, “no-agenda” creative sessions involving the EIC, staff, some associate editors, and others) are scheduled well in advance, while many other short-notice or impromptu meetings are equally welcomed.\n\n【33】Throughout, we desire to make our workspace a welcoming environment where creative people can gather to share ideas, critique each other, and enhance the quality of the product the Journal produces.\n\n【34】#### The Editorial Board\n\n【35】For most of its life, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ had functioned as a multispecialty journal. During the mid-1990s—and through mutual agreement of the editorial board and publisher—the Journal was redirected toward a general/internal medicine theme; however, the transition was not yet complete by January 1999.\n\n【36】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【37】Celebrating _Mayo Clinic Proceedings'_ 90th anniversary: a story of longevity and progression of mission.\n\n【38】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2016; 91 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 3-9</u></u>\n\n【39】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (7)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【40】In order to recruit and retain an editorial board that was optimally supportive of this redirected mission, we introduced needs-assessment methodologies that began by envisioning the future of the Journal. We then worked backward to fill the editorial board with members who could best make that future possible.\n\n【41】We also added an appropriate mission statement and vision statement to codify our goals and aspirations. The mission statement would read: “ _To promote the best interests of patients by advancing the knowledge and professionalism of the physician community_ .” The vision statement (intended to be used internally to focus the energies and values of our team members) is: “ _Mayo Clinic Proceedings will be the most influential journal in clinical medicine, with editorial content respected for its integrity and its relevance to progressive healthcare_ .”\n\n【42】Individual editorial board members were chosen to help manage peer review and manuscript recruitment in a given area of operations and to embrace and promote the values within the mission and vision statements. Many board members had considerable expertise in more than one area and, as such, could serve the board in diverse ways. We wanted to recruit board members who were stellar in their individual accomplishments and were recognized for their creativity, energy, collegiality, and ability to work well in teams. In my 18 years as EIC, we never appointed a member to the editorial board solely on the basis of his or her name recognition. Instead, board members were valued to the extent that they contributed to the well-being of the Journal.\n\n【43】We quickly learned that the happiest board members were those who were most engaged in journal activities. As such, we tried to assign a challenging but fair amount of responsibilities to those who wished to engage, and we asked them to contribute predominantly in those domains in which they had the greatest expertise. As workloads increased, or journal growth areas became more diverse, we added additional board members to address the workloads.\n\n【44】Of note, we never demanded or contracted with members regarding submission of their own manuscripts, simply because the best board-member candidates often had areas of research that were not ideally suited to the needs of our readers. Such board members had many other ways they could contribute to the Journal, however.\n\n【45】Board member terms were nominally 3 years, but almost no one served for exactly 3 years, and members were informed of this likelihood at the time of their recruitment. The greatest contributors often lasted much longer, but some had abbreviated terms. I had initially envisioned that we would lose many board members well before their 3-year anniversary, and I informed the board accordingly. My reasoning was that in order to get the best board members and compete against others who were desirous of their contributions, it would be important to “discover” the great talents only “moments” before the rest of the world was fully aware of their promise. As such, we fully expected that—as a result of their own professional momentum, added opportunities provided by the _Proceedings_ , or the visibility of _Proceedings_ board membership—many of our appointees would be pulled away from us because of other professional opportunities. Indeed, over the many years, we lost many board members to impressive leadership, investigational, and other activities. On their departures, we always tried to instill in them our pride in their advancement and a sense that they remained, in our hearts if not literally, members of the _Proceedings_ leadership family.\n\n【46】As we focused the Journal on a general/internal medicine mission, there was vigorous discussion at the level of the editorial board as to whether it was wiser to teach superspecialist board members to think like generalists or generalist board members to think like superspecialists. We chose the former but were forever mindful that this approach did not give us permission to focus on a narrow audience (at the expense of our general medical audience). When publishing articles such as those included in our Primer on Medical Genomics,\n\n【47】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lorentz C.P.\n*   Wieben E.D.\n*   Tefferi A.\n*   Whiteman D.A.\n*   Dewald G.W.</u>\n\n【48】Primer on medical genomics part I: history of genetics and sequencing of the human genome.\n\n【49】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2002; 77 : 773-782</u></u>\n\n【50】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (32)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【51】we made sure that each manuscript had both superspecialist and generalist reviewers to ensure that the manuscripts' content was both technically correct and approachable for a broad audience.\n\n【52】#### Board Meetings\n\n【53】With time, board meetings were held every other month, 6 times per year, typically including an annual meeting in which all board members gathered in Rochester, Minnesota, for Friday and Saturday sessions. The other 5 meetings involved meetings of local board members in Rochester, with nonlocal members participating through teleconferencing. During off months, the board's executive committee would meet 6 times per year, with executive committee membership consisting of the EIC, associate editors, staff, business manager, and consultants.\n\n【54】In each of the 12 meetings, the agenda was divided among 3 areas of discussion: (1) reports on actions taken, or progress made, since the last meeting, (2) new Journal initiatives, and (3) novel ideas for growth. The goal was broad input from multiple attendees, as well as the hearing of petitions from outside individuals or groups. The spirited discussions contributed to the sense of teamwork and helped reinforce a common standard for peer review adjudications.\n\n【55】#### Relationship With Authors\n\n【56】We tried our best to develop relationships with authors based on trust and open communications. This effort involved multiple forms of communication—through editorials, face-to-face conversations, phone calls, e-mail messages, presentations to groups, and other means—to inform authors of Journal rules and standards and the fact that all authors (regardless of their beliefs, geography, or institutional affiliation) are treated according to a common standard. These methods provided considerable utility over the 18 years, during which manuscript submissions—once originating primarily from authors affiliated with Mayo Clinic in Rochester—expanded to involve authors from more than 60 nations.\n\n【57】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【58】Celebrating _Mayo Clinic Proceedings'_ 90th anniversary: a story of longevity and progression of mission.\n\n【59】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2016; 91 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 3-9</u></u>\n\n【60】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (7)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【61】One challenge we faced when implementing this aforementioned approach was that the acceptance of individual manuscripts at the _Proceedings_ became progressively more competitive and selective. As such, we challenged authors to progressively increase the quality of their submissions if they desired to be published in our Journal. Many accepted this challenge, to the betterment of their contributions. Perhaps no groups had more impressive success over the years than academic general internal medicine physicians and researchers in education and professionalism. In these instances, it was possible to see meaningful year-to-year improvements in the quality of their scholarship, and their manuscript acceptance rates actually increased as the requirements of the Journal became more demanding. The Journal and its readers were the ultimate beneficiaries.\n\n【62】Yes, we had occasional experiences involving errors in published articles, as well as author misconduct during peer review, and we added discreet mechanisms by which any of these irregularities could be identified and addressed. Errors in Journal content were corrected promptly and without emotion. Fortunately, whether as a result of diligence or luck, we did not have a single article that needed retraction during these 18 years.\n\n【63】#### Changing the Economy of Manuscript Submission and Acceptance\n\n【64】The transition of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ ' focus to general medicine had implications for the Journal's relationship to Mayo Clinic authors. In aggregate, Mayo Clinic authors from Rochester, Jacksonville, Florida, and Phoenix, Arizona, represent the world's third largest contributor to the indexed biomedical literature (written communication, Dr Joseph G. Murphy, Director of the Mayo Clinic Section of Scientific Publications, April 5, 2017), and they have always been—and continue to be—the largest source of articles published in the _Proceedings_ . However, the migration of the _Proceedings_ in a general-medicine direction dictated that many Mayo Clinic–affiliated manuscripts that were once well targeted to publication in the _Proceedings_ would be less competitive under the new Journal focus. The change also meant that Mayo Clinic authors whose publication themes were now consonant with the new interests of the _Proceedings_ would become increasingly competitive at the Journal. The latter included subspecialist and superspecialist authors whose manuscript themes and writing style were targeted to a diverse readership.\n\n【65】With the long-term goal of serving an increasingly global audience and a desire to sample from advances in medicine globally, we introduced an open-market economy whereby manuscripts were recruited from throughout the United States and around the world, and manuscript acceptance was based primarily on priority.\n\n【66】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【67】Celebrating _Mayo Clinic Proceedings'_ 90th anniversary: a story of longevity and progression of mission.\n\n【68】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2016; 91 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 3-9</u></u>\n\n【69】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (7)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【70】Restated, those manuscripts that most closely helped the Journal achieve its stated mission were given priority for publication, regardless of authors' geography or institutional affiliation.\n\n【71】To augment the supply of articles that came from spontaneous submission by authors, the Journal also reorganized and operationalized its manuscript recruitment efforts. Specifically, we introduced a _recruitment grid_ whereby review articles representing the interests and needs of our readership would be recruited on a rotating cycle (eg, every 3-5 years). In addition, we daily sampled the world's scientific and nonscientific media to identify novel and relevant topics in clinical practice, research, humanities, and other areas that might be of interest to our readers.\n\n【72】These collective approaches, and the continuous stream of high-quality manuscripts they accumulated for subsequent peer-review evaluation, allowed us to have far greater issue-to-issue consistency in the quality and novelty of information we passed along to readers.\n\n【73】#### Constantly Updating Our Methods of Communications\n\n【74】It has become a truism at the _Proceedings_ that every single day is viewed as an opportunity to change and improve our methodologies for processing information and communicating with authors and readers. This was the philosophy behind ongoing improvements in our electronic processing of manuscripts, social media platforms, website, and print journal. The philosophy also was influential in our decision to create a new journal, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Innovations, Quality & Outcomes_ (MCP:IQO).\n\n【75】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.\n*   Gerber T.C.</u>\n\n【76】Expanding the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ mission: introducing _Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Innovations, Quality & Outcomes (MCP: IQO)_ .\n\n【77】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2017; 92 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 7-10</u></u>\n\n【78】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【79】We recognized that the world in which we live and work is constantly changing and the expectations of those we serve are constantly evolving, and we wanted to meet those expectations. Thus, members of our team expect daily or weekly conversations, informal gatherings, or formal meetings to meet these goals.\n\n【80】#### Citizenship\n\n【81】We never knowingly passed up an opportunity to share with others what we members of the editorial board and staff had learned in our _working laboratory._ Sharing varied in form, from the coaching of a single person to be more competitive when applying to become an EIC of another journal; to small classes on writing, editing, and interacting with journals; to lectures to large—and sometimes immense—audiences on contemporary challenges in journal publishing and publication ethics. These efforts were accomplished locally, nationally, and internationally in an effort to improve the quality of journal operations worldwide and advance the _Proceedings_ brand 删除4:<u>( Figure )</u>.\n\n【82】Figure Dr William L. Lanier (center) had several visits to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) world headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, to consult on publication issues and lecture to the CDC staff, students, and trainees on biomedical publishing, publication ethics, mentorship, and related topics.

Let me close my story by sharing with you some of those earliest promises. Some of the most important promises I made vis-à-vis my time as EIC were made when interviewing in the fall of 1998 with a selection committee that would eventually choose me to lead the _Proceedings_ .\n\n【86】I closed my interview with the selection committee by telling them this: “I am going to share with you words that have never been spoken on the Mayo Clinic campus before: ‘If you select me as editor-in-chief of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , I will assume the role during the most productive, influential years of my professional life, and I will make this the No. 1 priority in my professional life, for as long as I hold the position’.” It is difficult to recreate my thought processes, but it is amusing that I was 43 years old at the time, had been on the Mayo Clinic staff for slightly more than 14 years, and understood that any EIC appointment would be for 5 years. I often wonder (when attempting to reproduce that 1998 mind-set) how I would react to knowing that by the time I ended my employment with the _Proceedings,_ I would be 62 years old and would have spent more than half of my professional life as the Journal's editor. Certainly I could never have envisioned that I would love the work for so very long. Perhaps my comments, which many might have perceived as hubris at the time, should, in hindsight, be considered insufficiently optimistic.\n\n【87】I told the selection committee that my long-term goal for the _Proceedings_ was “that it will someday be impossible to think of the world's elite general medical journals and not include _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ on that list.” It is difficult to know how far along this arc the Journal has advanced during these 18 years, but it is possible to conclude—based on data within my editorial on the 90th anniversary of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【88】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【89】The evolution of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ .\n\n【90】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2000; 75 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 8-9</u></u>\n\n【91】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (12)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【92】—that the progress has been considerable.\n\n【93】Finally, when asked what metric I would use to best define Journal progress, I told the selection committee this: “I desire that, at the end of my term as editor-in-chief, candidates far more impressive and influential than I will compete to be my replacement, perceiving that becoming the leader of the _Proceedings_ will be the greatest professional opportunity of their lifetime.” When it was time to pick my replacement, the 2016 iteration of the selection committee was as professional and discreet in its activities as the committee that selected me. As such, I only know bits and pieces of the selection process story, and they were told to me largely by the applicants. By piecing together the facts, I will forever have joy and comfort in knowing that the candidates who applied to be my replacement were indeed “far more impressive and influential” than I am, and certainly more than I was during the fall of 1998. I am so very thankful that they allowed themselves to be vetted by the selection committee (and they engaged in the type self-reflection that goes hand-in-hand with the process), not only to fulfill my dreams but also in an attempt to help the Journal achieve new heights. And I am fully convinced, through his own admission, that my successor considers his selection as the new EIC to be the greatest professional opportunity of his lifetime (oral communication, Dr Karl A. Nath, incoming EIC of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings,_ April 14, 2017).\n\n【94】I have until this point intentionally not mentioned the names of specific individuals, in some measure because the list of individuals who have meaningfully contributed to the ongoing success of the Journal is immense. However, I would like to comment on those who currently contribute so much, and so selflessly, to contemporary Journal operations. By extension, readers can infer that there was a generation of contributors before many of these individuals who contributed in their own unique ways.\n\n【95】The current staff of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ consists of managing editor Terry Jopke, editorial processing specialist Kimberly D. Sankey, and editorial assistant Margaret R. (Peg) Wentz. They function seamlessly as a team and provide the first wave of Journal contact with authors, peer reviewers, and many others. Collectively, they daily infuse an aura of collegiality and optimism into all Journal operations. The associate editors are, alphabetically, Drs Thomas J. Beckman, Lori A. Erickson, Thomas C. Gerber, Carl J. (Chip) Lavie, S. Vincent Rajkumar, and Ayalew Tefferi. Each is assigned specific portions of Journal operations to oversee and lead. Collectively, they form the backbone of the Journal's executive committee. They supply the insights and ethical standards to help fuel the Journal's conscience and the energy to propel us forward. There would be no contemporary _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , as we know and love it, without their daily input. Business manager Debbie Eagle serves as our liaison to Mayo Clinic and the publisher. She provides the guidance one would seek in a wise sibling, publicly helping Journal leadership to work more effectively with others and privately counseling us on methods by which we can improve. Bruce A. F. Polsky was retained in 2010 as a part-time consultant to help the Journal locate a new publisher, and he has continued with the team to help us better manage publishing operations and set (and monitor) long-term Journal planning. His long-term value to the _Proceedings_ came as a surprise and has proved indispensible. Pamela Poppalardo, our publisher, has worked tirelessly to understand the mission and culture of the _Proceedings_ and its sponsor, Mayo Clinic, and use that knowledge to help us better become the Journal that we want to be. The ever-expanding international footprint of Journal operations is just one example of her stewardship and that of her colleagues at Elsevier. When the diverse contributions of these individuals are viewed in aggregate, it is impossible to honor or compensate them sufficiently for their professional and personal input. This team has truly functioned as a family, working together to optimally address the Journal's mission and future.\n\n【96】I also want to acknowledge incoming EIC Dr Karl Nath, an impressively accomplished physician, scientist, and scholar and a person who has great integrity and communication skills. It is already amply clear that—consistent with my aforementioned statement to the search committee that selected me—he is “far more impressive” than I was when I assumed the editorship of the Journal. Further, it is already abundantly clear that he possesses a vision, energy, and strategy for improving the Journal that will build on any progress the Journal has experienced during the past 18 years and take the Journal to new heights once unimaginable. And thankfully, the editorial board members, staff, and many others have expressed ongoing excitement about the progress of the Journal and enthusiasm in supporting Dr Nath (as they have so graciously supported me) to help his visions and aspirations become a reality.\n\n【97】And most importantly, I would like to thank my family for their unrelenting support during my tenure as EIC. Notable among them are my beloved wife, best friend, and wisest counselor, Mary Duckworth Lanier; my daughter, E. Brooke Lanier; and my son, Dr W. Hudson Lanier. Without them, this mission would not have been possible and certainly not as meaningful. Their statements of encouragement and coaching were preferred fuels during this fantastic journey. And, offering much-appreciated “counseling assists” were my mother, Dr Nancy J. Lanier, and my sister, Melodie Lanier Mobley, who had sufficient knowledge to keep me humble but practiced sufficient discretion to allow me to explore and grow.\n\n【98】In closing, I would like to reiterate my appreciation to so many who have made my journey with _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ a life-changing experience. I will dearly miss the support, encouragement, critiques, and, yes, friendship that they shared with me daily. I believe that as a team, we have metaphorically taken the Journal's quality and scope of mission through adolescence, but like all adolescences, there were periods in which growth and grace were not always tightly coupled. However, as a result of the transition, the Journal is now positioned to enter a new, exciting phase of adulthood growth—a phase in which the opportunities and potential know no bounds. I look forward to the opportunity to observe this ongoing growth and the stewardship provided by the new EIC, the staff, the editorial board, and others. It is my sincere hope and desire that the future accomplishments of the Journal will become so important and influential that the accomplishments of these past 18 years will become but a distant memory…although a pleasant distant memory.\n\n【99】Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this wonderful adventure, and Godspeed to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ and its stewards.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Benylin For Allergies\n\n【6】### Descriptions\n\n【7】In November 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public health warning regarding phenylpropanolamine (PPA) due to the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The FDA, supported by results of a research program, requested that manufacturers voluntarily discontinue marketing products that contain PPA and that consumers work with their healthcare providers to select alternative products.\n\n【8】Antihistamine and decongestant combinations are used to treat the nasal congestion (stuffy nose), sneezing, and runny nose caused by colds and hay fever.\n\n【9】Antihistamines work by preventing the effects of a substance called histamine, which is produced by the body. Histamine can cause itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes. Antihistamines contained in these combinations are:\n\n【10】*   acrivastine, azatadine, brompheniramine, carbinoxamine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, dexbrompheniramine, diphenhydramine, loratadine, pheniramine, phenyltoloxamine, promethazine, pyrilamine, and triprolidine.\n\n【11】The decongestants, such as phenylephrine, and pseudoephedrine, produce a narrowing of blood vessels. This leads to clearing of nasal congestion, but it may also cause an increase in blood pressure in patients who have high blood pressure.\n\n【12】Some of these combinations are available only with your doctor's prescription. Others are available without a prescription; however, your doctor may have special instructions on the proper dose of the medicine for your medical condition.\n\n【13】Do not give any over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicine to a baby or child under 2 years of age. Using these medicines in very young children might cause serious or possibly life-threatening side effects .\n\n【14】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【15】*   Solution\n*   Tablet, Extended Release\n*   Syrup\n*   Suspension\n*   Elixir\n*   Tablet\n*   Tablet, Chewable\n*   Tablet, Extended Release, 24 HR\n\n【16】Before Using\n------------\n\n【17】### Allergies\n\n【18】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【19】### Pediatric\n\n【20】Very young children are usually more sensitive to the effects of this medicine. Increases in blood pressure, nightmares or unusual excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability may be more likely to occur in children. Before giving any of these combination medicines to a child, check the package label very carefully. Some of these medicines are too strong for use in children. If you are not certain whether a specific product can be given to a child, or if you have any questions about the amount to give, check with your health care professional.\n\n【21】Do not give any over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicine to a baby or child under 2 years of age. Using these medicines in very young children might cause serious or possibly life-threatening side effects .\n\n【22】### Geriatric\n\n【23】Confusion, difficult and painful urination, dizziness, drowsiness, dryness of mouth, or convulsions (seizures) may be more likely to occur in the elderly, who are usually more sensitive to the effects of this medicine. Also, nightmares or unusual excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability may be more likely to occur in elderly patients.\n\n【24】### Pregnancy\n\n【25】The occasional use of antihistamine and decongestant combinations is not likely to cause problems in the fetus or in the newborn baby. However, when these medicines are used at higher doses and/or for a long time, the chance that problems might occur may increase. For the individual ingredients of these combinations, the following apply:\n\n【26】*   Alcohol—Some of these combination medicines contain alcohol. Too much use of alcohol during pregnancy may cause birth defects.\n*   Phenylephrine—Studies on birth defects have not been done in either humans or animals with phenylephrine.\n*   Promethazine—Phenothiazines, such as promethazine (contained in some of these combination medicines \\[e.g. Phenergan-D\\]), have been shown to cause jaundice and muscle tremors in a few newborn infants whose mothers received phenothiazines during pregnancy. Also, the newborn baby may have blood clotting problems if promethazine is taken by the mother within 2 weeks before delivery.\n*   Pseudoephedrine—Studies on birth defects with pseudoephedrine have not been done in humans. In animal studies pseudoephedrine did not cause birth defects but did cause a decrease in average weight, length, and rate of bone formation in the animal fetus when administered in high doses.\n\n【27】### Breastfeeding\n\n【28】Small amounts of antihistamines and decongestants pass into the breast milk. Use is not recommended since the chances are greater for this medicine to cause side effects, such as unusual excitement or irritability, in the nursing baby. Also, since antihistamines tend to decrease the secretions of the body, it is possible that the flow of breast milk may be reduced in some patients. It is not known yet whether loratadine causes these same side effects.\n\n【29】### Drug Interactions\n\n【30】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【37】Using medicines in this class with any of the following is usually not recommended, but may be unavoidable in some cases. If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use your medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【38】*   Grapefruit Juice\n\n【39】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【40】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【41】*   Type 2 diabetes mellitus—The decongestant in this medicine may put diabetic patients at a greater risk of having heart or blood vessel disease\n\n【42】*   Enlarged prostate or\n*   Urinary tract blockage or difficult urination—Some of the effects of antihistamines may make urinary problems worse.\n\n【43】*   Glaucoma—A slight increase in inner eye pressure may occur.\n\n【44】*   Heart or blood vessel disease or\n*   High blood pressure—The decongestant in this medicine may cause the blood pressure to increase and may also speed up the heart rate\n\n【45】*   Kidney disease—Higher blood levels of loratadine may result, which may increase the chance of side effects. The dosage of loratadine-containing combination may need to be reduced\n\n【46】*   Liver disease—Higher blood levels of loratadine may result, which may increase the chance of side effects\n\n【47】*   Overactive thyroid—If the overactive thyroid has caused a fast heart rate, the decongestant in this medicine may cause the heart rate to speed up further\n\n【48】*   Urinary retention—Condition may be worsened with use of pseudoephedrine\n\n【49】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【50】Take this medicine only as directed. Do not take more of it and do not take it more often than recommended on the label, unless otherwise directed by your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.\n\n【51】If this medicine irritates your stomach, you may take it with food or a glass of water or milk, to lessen the irritation.\n\n【52】For patients taking the extended-release capsule or tablet form of this medicine:\n\n【53】*   Swallow it whole.\n*   Do not crush, break, or chew before swallowing.\n*   If the capsule is too large to swallow, you may mix the contents of the capsule with applesauce, jelly, honey, or syrup and swallow without chewing.\n\n【54】### Dosing\n\n【55】The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【56】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【57】There is a large variety of antihistamine and decongestant combination products on the market. Some products are for use in adults only, while others may be used in children. If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.\n\n【58】Follow your doctor's orders if this medicine was prescribed. Or, follow the directions on the box if you are buying this medicine without a prescription\n\n【59】Do not give any over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicine to a baby or child under 2 years of age. Using these medicines in very young children might cause serious or possibly life-threatening side effects .\n\n【60】### Missed Dose\n\n【61】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【62】### Storage\n\n【63】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【64】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【65】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【66】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【67】Before you have any skin tests for allergies, tell the doctor in charge that you are taking this medicine. The results of the test may be affected by the antihistamine in this medicine.\n\n【68】When taking antihistamines (contained in this combination medicine) on a regular basis, make sure your doctor knows if you are taking large amounts of aspirin at the same time (as for arthritis or rheumatism). Effects of too much aspirin, such as ringing in the ears, may be covered up by the antihistamine.\n\n【69】The antihistamine in this medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that slow down the nervous system, possibly causing drowsiness). Some examples of CNS depressants are other antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds; sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine; prescription pain medicine or narcotics; barbiturates; medicine for seizures; muscle relaxants; or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are taking this medicine.\n\n【70】The antihistamine in this medicine may cause some people to become drowsy, dizzy, or less alert than they are normally. Some antihistamines are more likely to cause drowsiness than others (loratadine , for example, rarely produces this effect). Make sure you know how you react before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or are not alert.\n\n【71】The decongestant in this medicine may add to the central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and other effects of diet aids. Do not use medicines for diet or appetite control while taking this medicine unless you have checked with your doctor\n\n【72】The decongestant in this medicine may cause some people to be nervous or restless or to have trouble in sleeping. If you have trouble in sleeping, take the last dose of this medicine for each day a few hours before bedtime. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.\n\n【73】Antihistamines may cause dryness of the mouth, nose, and throat. Some antihistamines are more likely to cause dryness of the mouth than others (loratadine , for example, rarely produces this effect). For temporary relief, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.\n\n【74】For patients using promethazine-containing medicine:\n\n【75】*   This medicine controls nausea and vomiting. For this reason, it may cover up the signs of overdose caused by other medicines or the symptoms of intestinal blockage. This will make it difficult for your doctor to diagnose these conditions. Make sure your doctor knows that you are taking this medicine if you have other symptoms such as stomach or lower abdominal pain, cramping, or soreness. Also, if you think you may have taken an overdose of any medicine, tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine.\n\n【76】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【77】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【78】Although serious side effects occur rarely when this medicine is taken as recommended, they may be more likely to occur if: too much medicine is taken, it is taken in large doses, or it is taken for a long period of time.\n\n【79】Get emergency help immediately if any of the following symptoms of overdose occur:\n\n【80】#### For promethazine only\n\n【81】1.  Muscle spasms (especially of neck and back)\n2.  restlessness\n3.  shuffling walk\n4.  tic-like (jerky) movements of head and face\n5.  trembling and shaking of hands\n\n【82】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【83】#### Rare\n\n【84】1.

These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【86】#### More common\n\n【87】1.  Drowsiness\n2.  thickening of the bronchial secretions\n\n【88】#### Less common\n\n【89】1.

{"seq_id": "30b0d0e1-9779-449b-b368-dba2ad662237", "title": "Varicocele", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】A varicocele (VAR-ih-koe-seel) is an enlargement of the veins within the loose bag of skin that holds the testicles (scrotum). These veins transport oxygen-depleted blood from the testicles. A varicocele occurs when blood pools in the veins rather than circulating efficiently out of the scrotum.\n\n【2】Varicoceles usually form during puberty and develop over time. They may cause some discomfort or pain, but they often result in no symptoms or complications.\n\n【3】A varicocele may cause poor development of a testicle, low sperm production or other problems that may lead to infertility. Surgery to treat varicocele may be recommended to address these complications.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】A varicocele usually occurs on the left side of the scrotum and often produces no signs or symptoms. Possible signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【6】*   **Pain.** A dull, aching pain or discomfort is more likely when standing or late in the day. Lying down often relieves pain.\n*   **A mass in the scrotum.** If a varicocele is large enough, a mass like a \"bag of worms\" may be visible above the testicle. A smaller varicocele may be too small to see but noticeable by touch.\n*   **Differently sized testicles.** The affected testicle may be noticeably smaller than the other testicle.\n*   **Infertility.** A varicocele may lead to difficulty fathering a child, but not all varicoceles cause infertility.\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Annual wellness visits for boys are important for monitoring the development and health of testicles. It's important to schedule and keep these appointments.\n\n【9】A number of conditions could contribute to pain, swelling or a mass in the scrotum. If you experience any of these, see your health care provider to get a timely and accurate diagnosis.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】The testicles receive oxygen-rich blood from two testicular arteries — one artery for each side of the scrotum. Similarly, there are also two testicular veins that transport oxygen-depleted blood back toward the heart. Within each side of the scrotum, a network of small veins (pampiniform plexus) transport the oxygen-depleted blood from the testicle to the main testicular vein. A varicocele is the enlargement of the pampiniform plexus.\n\n【12】The exact cause of a varicocele is unknown. One contributing factor may be the malfunction of valves inside the veins that are intended to keep blood moving in the right direction. Also, the left testicular vein follows a slightly different path than the right vein — a path that makes a problem with blood flow more likely on the left.\n\n【13】When the oxygen-depleted blood gets backed up in the network of veins, they widen (dilate), creating the varicocele.\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】There don't appear to be any significant risk factors for developing a varicocele.\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】Having a varicocele can make it difficult for your body to regulate the temperature of the testicles. Oxidative stress and the buildup of toxins can result. These factors may contribute to the following complications:\n\n【18】*   **Poor testicular health.** For boys going through puberty, a varicocele may inhibit testicle growth, hormone production, and other factors related to the health and function of the testicle. For men, a varicocele may result in gradual shrinkage due to tissue loss.\n*   **Infertility.** A varicocele doesn't necessarily cause infertility. An estimated 10% to 20% of men diagnosed with a varicocele experience difficulty fathering a child. Among men with fertility problems, about 40% have a varicocele.\n\n【19】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The signs and symptoms may be within or beyond the distribution of that peripheral nerve. All other clinical signs and symptoms are identical in CRPS types 1 and 2. Electrodiagnostic testing may identify a major peripheral nerve injury supporting the diagnosis of CRPS type 2 but may be insensitive to lesions of cutaneous sensory nerves (eg, sensory dorsal radial neuralgia/ neuropathy). The other tests of autonomic function may be identical in types 1 and 2. Sympathetically maintained pain can coexist with sympathetically independent pain in both types. Thus, a response to sympathetic blockade is not a distinguishing feature or diagnostic criterion for either type.\n\n【7】Dr Cooney also correctly points out that correction of any reversible underlying pathology is essential. Functional restoration can only occur with adequate rehabilitative modalities, usually physical therapy. As Dr Cooney stated, rehabilitation can be achieved only if adequate analgesia is provided by temporary neural blockade (either sympathetic or somatic), enteral or parenteral medications, neurolysis (release of entrapped nerves), or neuroaugmentation. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment often offers the best hope for reversing the inevitable biopsychosocial deconditioning that occurs with both CRPS type 1 and type 2.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Descriptive statistics were used to analyze patient demographics, clinical features, complications, and therapeutic interventions.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of the 34 patients whose records were reviewed, 25 fulfilled all diagnostic criteria for SCLS. The median age at diagnosis of SCLS was 44 years. Median follow-up of surviving patients was 4.9 years, and median time to diagnosis from symptom onset was 1.1 years (interquartile range, 0.5-4.1 years). Flulike illness or myalgia was reported by 14 patients (56%) at onset of an acute attack of SCLS, and rhabdomyolysis developed in 9 patients (36%). Patients with a greater decrease in albumin level had a higher likelihood of developing rhabdomyolysis ( _p_ \\=.03). Monoclonal gammopathy, predominantly of the IgG-κ type, was found in 19 patients (76%). The progression rate to multiple myeloma was 0.7% per person-year of follow-up. The overall response rate to the different therapies was 76%, and 24% of patients sustained durable (>2 years) complete remission. The estimated 5-year overall survival rate was 76% (95% confidence interval, 59%-97%).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Systemic capillary leak syndrome, a rare disease that occurs in those of middle age, is usually diagnosed after a considerable delay from onset of symptoms. The degree of albumin decrement during an attack correlates with development of rhabdomyolysis. A reduction in the frequency and/or the severity of attacks was seen in nearly three-fourths of patients who were offered empirical therapies. The rate of progression to multiple myeloma appears to be comparable to that of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.\n\n【8】BM ( bone marrow ), IQR ( interquartile range ), MGUS ( monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance ), MM ( multiple myeloma ), OS ( overall survival ), PC ( plasma cell ), SCLS ( systemic capillary leak syndrome ), VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【2】Osteoarthritis causes cartilage — the hard, slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they form a joint — to break down. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the joints, beginning with the lining of joints.\n\n【3】Uric acid crystals, which form when there's too much uric acid in your blood, can cause gout. Infections or underlying disease, such as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis.\n\n【4】Treatments vary depending on the type of arthritis. The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】The most common signs and symptoms of arthritis involve the joints. Depending on the type of arthritis, signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【7】*   Pain\n*   Stiffness\n*   Swelling\n*   Redness\n*   Decreased range of motion\n\n【8】Causes\n------\n\n【9】The two main types of arthritis — osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis — damage joints in different ways.\n\n【10】### Osteoarthritis\n\n【11】The most common type of arthritis, osteoarthritis involves wear-and-tear damage to a joint's cartilage — the hard, slick coating on the ends of bones where they form a joint. Cartilage cushions the ends of the bones and allows nearly frictionless joint motion, but enough damage can result in bone grinding directly on bone, which causes pain and restricted movement. This wear and tear can occur over many years, or it can be hastened by a joint injury or infection.\n\n【12】Osteoarthritis also causes changes in the bones and deterioration of the connective tissues that attach muscle to bone and hold the joint together. If cartilage in a joint is severely damaged, the joint lining may become inflamed and swollen.\n\n【13】### Rheumatoid arthritis\n\n【14】In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system attacks the lining of the joint capsule, a tough membrane that encloses all the joint parts. This lining (synovial membrane) becomes inflamed and swollen. The disease process can eventually destroy cartilage and bone within the joint.\n\n【15】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【16】Risk factors for arthritis include:\n\n【17】*   **Family history.** Some types of arthritis run in families, so you may be more likely to develop arthritis if your parents or siblings have the disorder.\n*   **Age.** The risk of many types of arthritis — including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout — increases with age.\n*   **Your sex.** Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis, while most of the people who have gout, another type of arthritis, are men.\n*   **Previous joint injury.** People who have injured a joint, perhaps while playing a sport, are more likely to eventually develop arthritis in that joint.\n*   **Obesity.** Carrying excess pounds puts stress on joints, particularly your knees, hips and spine. People with obesity have a higher risk of developing arthritis.\n\n【18】Complications\n-------------\n\n【19】Severe arthritis, particularly if it affects your hands or arms, can make it difficult for you to do daily tasks. Arthritis of weight-bearing joints can keep you from walking comfortably or sitting up straight. In some cases, joints may gradually lose their alignment and shape.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "9b9af828-d3af-426b-957f-e90bfb075021", "title": "Chemotherapy", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses powerful chemicals to kill fast-growing cells in your body.\n\n【2】Chemotherapy is most often used to treat cancer, since cancer cells grow and multiply much more quickly than most cells in the body.\n\n【3】Many different chemotherapy drugs are available. Chemotherapy drugs can be used alone or in combination to treat a wide variety of cancers.\n\n【4】Though chemotherapy is an effective way to treat many types of cancer, chemotherapy treatment also carries a risk of side effects. Some chemotherapy side effects are mild and treatable, while others can cause serious complications.\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】Chemotherapy is used to kill cancer cells in people with cancer.\n\n【7】There are a variety of settings in which chemotherapy may be used in people with cancer:\n\n【8】*   **To cure the cancer without other treatments.** Chemotherapy can be used as the primary or sole treatment for cancer.\n*   **After other treatments, to kill hidden cancer cells.** Chemotherapy can be used after other treatments, such as surgery, to kill any cancer cells that might remain in the body. Doctors call this adjuvant therapy.\n*   **To prepare you for other treatments.** Chemotherapy can be used to shrink a tumor so that other treatments, such as radiation and surgery, are possible. Doctors call this neoadjuvant therapy.\n*   **To ease signs and symptoms.** Chemotherapy may help relieve signs and symptoms of cancer by killing some of the cancer cells. Doctors call this palliative chemotherapy.\n\n【9】### Chemotherapy for conditions other than cancer\n\n【10】Some chemotherapy drugs have proved useful in treating other conditions, such as:\n\n【11】*   **Bone marrow diseases.** Diseases that affect the bone marrow and blood cells may be treated with a bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant. Chemotherapy is often used to prepare for a bone marrow transplant.\n*   **Immune system disorders.** Lower doses of chemotherapy drugs can help control an overactive immune system in certain diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【12】Risks\n-----\n\n【13】Side effects of chemotherapy drugs can be significant. Each drug has different side effects, and not every drug causes every side effect. Ask your doctor about the side effects of the particular drugs you'll receive.\n\n【14】### Side effects that occur during chemotherapy treatment\n\n【15】Common side effects of chemotherapy drugs include:\n\n【16】*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Hair loss\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Fatigue\n*   Fever\n*   Mouth sores\n*   Pain\n*   Constipation\n*   Easy bruising\n*   Bleeding\n\n【17】Many of these side effects can be prevented or treated. Most side effects subside after treatment ends.\n\n【18】### Long-lasting and late-developing side effects\n\n【19】Chemotherapy drugs can also cause side effects that don't become evident until months or years after treatment. Late side effects vary depending on the chemotherapy drug but can include:\n\n【20】*   Damage to lung tissue\n*   Heart problems\n*   Infertility\n*   Kidney problems\n*   Nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy)\n*   Risk of a second cancer\n\n【21】Ask your doctor if you have a risk of any late side effects. Ask what signs and symptoms you should be aware of that may signal a problem.\n\n【22】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【23】How you prepare for chemotherapy depends on which drugs you'll receive and how they'll be administered. Your doctor will give you specific instructions to prepare for your chemotherapy treatments. You may need to:\n\n【24】*   **Have a device surgically inserted before intravenous chemotherapy.** If you'll be receiving your chemotherapy intravenously — into a vein — your doctor may recommend a device, such as a catheter, port or pump. The catheter or other device is surgically implanted into a large vein, usually in your chest. Chemotherapy drugs can be given through the device.\n*   **Undergo tests and procedures to make sure your body is ready to receive chemotherapy.** Blood tests to check kidney and liver functions and heart tests to check for heart health can determine whether your body is ready to begin chemotherapy. If there's a problem, your doctor may delay your treatment or select a different chemotherapy drug and dosage that's safer for you.\n*   **See your dentist.** Your doctor may recommend that a dentist check your teeth for signs of infection. Treating existing infections may reduce the risk of complications during chemotherapy treatment, since some chemotherapy may reduce your body's ability to fight infections.\n*   **Plan ahead for side effects.** Ask your doctor what side effects to expect during and after chemotherapy and make appropriate arrangements. For instance, if your chemotherapy treatment will cause infertility, you may wish to consider your options for preserving your sperm or eggs for future use. If your chemotherapy will cause hair loss, consider planning for a head covering.\n*   **Make arrangements for help at home and at work.** Most chemotherapy treatments are given in an outpatient clinic, which means most people are able to continue working and doing their usual activities during chemotherapy. Your doctor can tell you in general how much the chemotherapy will affect your usual activities, but it's difficult to predict exactly how you'll feel.\n\n【25】    Ask your doctor if you'll need time off work or help around your home after treatment. Ask your doctor for the details of your chemotherapy treatments so that you can make arrangements for work, children, pets or other commitments.\n\n【26】*   **Prepare for your first treatment.** Ask your doctor or chemotherapy nurses how to prepare for chemotherapy. It may be helpful to arrive for your first chemotherapy treatment well rested. You might wish to eat a light meal beforehand in case your chemotherapy medications cause nausea.\n\n【27】    Have a friend or family member drive you to your first treatment. Most people can drive themselves to and from chemotherapy sessions. But the first time you may find that the medications make you sleepy or cause other side effects that make driving difficult.\n\n【28】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【29】### Determining which chemotherapy drugs you'll receive\n\n【30】Your doctor chooses which chemotherapy drugs you'll receive based on several factors, including:\n\n【31】*   Type of cancer\n*   Stage of cancer\n*   Overall health\n*   Previous cancer treatments\n*   Your goals and preferences\n\n【32】Discuss your treatment options with your doctor. Together you can decide what's right for you.\n\n【33】### How chemotherapy drugs are given\n\n【34】Chemotherapy drugs can be given in different ways, including:\n\n【35】*   **Chemotherapy infusions.** Chemotherapy is most often given as an infusion into a vein (intravenously). The drugs can be given by inserting a tube with a needle into a vein in your arm or into a device in a vein in your chest.\n*   **Chemotherapy pills.** Some chemotherapy drugs can be taken in pill or capsule form.\n*   **Chemotherapy shots.** Chemotherapy drugs can be injected with a needle, just as you would receive a shot.\n*   **Chemotherapy creams.** Creams or gels containing chemotherapy drugs can be applied to the skin to treat certain types of skin cancer.\n*   **Chemotherapy drugs used to treat one area of the body.** Chemotherapy drugs can be given directly to one area of the body. For instance, chemotherapy drugs can be given directly in the abdomen (intraperitoneal chemotherapy), chest cavity (intrapleural chemotherapy) or central nervous system (intrathecal chemotherapy). Chemotherapy can also be given through the urethra into the bladder (intravesical chemotherapy).\n*   **Chemotherapy given directly to the cancer.** Chemotherapy can be given directly to the cancer or, after surgery, where the cancer once was. As an example, thin disk-shaped wafers containing chemotherapy drugs can be placed near a tumor during surgery. The wafers break down over time, releasing chemotherapy drugs. Chemotherapy drugs may also be injected into a vein or artery that directly feeds a tumor.\n\n【36】### How often you receive chemotherapy treatments\n\n【37】Your doctor determines how often you'll receive chemotherapy treatments based on what drugs you'll receive, the characteristics of your cancer and how well your body recovers after each treatment. Chemotherapy treatment schedules vary. Chemotherapy treatment can be continuous, or it may alternate between periods of treatment and periods of rest to let you recover.\n\n【38】### Where you receive chemotherapy treatments\n\n【39】Where you'll receive your chemotherapy treatments depends on your situation. Chemotherapy treatments can be given:\n\n【40】*   In an outpatient chemotherapy unit\n*   In a doctor's office\n*   In the hospital\n*   At home, such as when taking chemotherapy pills\n\n【41】Results\n-------\n\n【42】You'll meet with your cancer doctor (oncologist) regularly during chemotherapy treatment. Your oncologist will ask about any side effects you're experiencing, since many can be controlled.\n\n【43】Depending on your situation, you may also undergo scans and other tests to monitor your cancer during chemotherapy treatment. These tests can give your doctor an idea of how your cancer is responding to treatment, and your treatment may be adjusted accordingly.\n\n【44】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells — a type of cell within the skin that produces new skin cells as old ones die off.\n\n【2】Basal cell carcinoma often appears as a slightly transparent bump on the skin, though it can take other forms. Basal cell carcinoma occurs most often on areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, such as your head and neck.\n\n【3】Most basal cell carcinomas are thought to be caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight. Avoiding the sun and using sunscreen may help protect against basal cell carcinoma.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Basal cell carcinoma usually develops on sun-exposed parts of your body, especially your head and neck. Less often, basal cell carcinoma can develop on parts of your body usually protected from the sun, such as the genitals.\n\n【6】Basal cell carcinoma appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won't heal. These changes in the skin (lesions) usually have one of the following characteristics:\n\n【7】*   **A shiny, skin-colored bump** that's translucent, meaning you can see a bit through the surface. The bump can look pearly white or pink on white skin. On brown and Black skin, the bump often looks brown or glossy black. Tiny blood vessels might be visible, though they may be difficult to see on brown and Black skin. The bump may bleed and scab over.\n*   **A brown, black or blue lesion** — or a lesion with dark spots — with a slightly raised, translucent border.\n*   **A flat, scaly patch** with a raised edge. Over time, these patches can grow quite large.\n*   **A white, waxy, scar-like lesion** without a clearly defined border.\n\n【8】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【9】Make an appointment with your health care provider if you observe changes in the appearance of your skin, such as a new growth, a change in a previous growth or a recurring sore.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Basal cell carcinoma occurs when one of the skin's basal cells develops a mutation in its DNA.\n\n【12】Basal cells are found at the bottom of the epidermis — the outermost layer of skin. Basal cells produce new skin cells. As new skin cells are produced, they push older cells toward the skin's surface, where the old cells die and are sloughed off.\n\n【13】The process of creating new skin cells is controlled by a basal cell's DNA. The DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutation tells the basal cell to multiply rapidly and continue growing when it would normally die. Eventually the accumulating abnormal cells may form a cancerous tumor — the lesion that appears on the skin.\n\n【14】### Ultraviolet light and other causes\n\n【15】Much of the damage to DNA in basal cells is thought to result from ultraviolet (UV) radiation found in sunlight and in commercial tanning lamps and tanning beds. But sun exposure doesn't explain skin cancers that develop on skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. Other factors can contribute to the risk and development of basal cell carcinoma, and the exact cause may in some cases not be clear.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】Factors that increase your risk of basal cell carcinoma include:\n\n【18】*   **Chronic sun exposure.** A lot of time spent in the sun — or in commercial tanning beds — increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma. The threat is greater if you live in a sunny or high-altitude location, both of which expose you to more ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Severe sunburns also increase your risk.\n*   **Radiation therapy.** Radiation therapy to treat acne or other skin conditions may increase the risk of basal cell carcinoma at previous treatment sites on the skin.\n*   **Fair skin.** The risk of basal cell carcinoma is higher among people who freckle or burn easily or who have very light skin, red or blond hair, or light-colored eyes.\n*   **Increasing age.** Because basal cell carcinoma often takes decades to develop, the majority of basal cell carcinomas occur in older adults. But it can also affect younger adults and is becoming more common in people in their 20s and 30s.\n*   **A personal or family history of skin cancer.** If you've had basal cell carcinoma one or more times, you have a good chance of developing it again. If you have a family history of skin cancer, you may have an increased risk of developing basal cell carcinoma.\n*   **Immune-suppressing drugs.** Taking medications that suppress your immune system, such as anti-rejection drugs used after transplant surgery, significantly increases your risk of skin cancer.\n*   **Exposure to arsenic.** Arsenic, a toxic metal that's found widely in the environment, increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma and other cancers. Everyone has some arsenic exposure because it occurs naturally. But some people may have higher exposure if they drink contaminated well water or have a job that involves producing or using arsenic.\n*   **Inherited syndromes that cause skin cancer.** Certain rare genetic diseases can increase the risk of basal cell carcinoma, including nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin-Goltz syndrome) and xeroderma pigmentosum.\n\n【19】Complications\n-------------\n\n【20】Complications of basal cell carcinoma can include:\n\n【21】*   **A risk of recurrence.** Basal cell carcinomas commonly recur, even after successful treatment.\n*   **An increased risk of other types of skin cancer.** A history of basal cell carcinoma may also increase the chance of developing other types of skin cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma.\n*   **Cancer that spreads beyond the skin.** Very rarely, basal cell carcinoma can spread (metastasize) to nearby lymph nodes and other areas of the body, such as the bones and lungs.\n\n【22】Prevention\n----------\n\n【23】To reduce your risk of basal cell carcinoma you can:\n\n【24】*   **Avoid the sun during the middle of the day.** In many places, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even during winter or when the sky is cloudy.\n*   **Wear sunscreen year-round.** Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or perspiring.\n*   **Wear protective clothing.** Cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs, and a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than does a baseball cap or visor.\n\n【25】    Some companies also sell protective clothing. A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand. Don't forget sunglasses. Look for those that block both types of UV radiation — ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) rays.\n\n【26】*   **Avoid tanning beds.** Tanning beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer.\n*   **Check your skin regularly and report changes to your doctor.** Examine your skin often for new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp.\n\n【27】    Examine your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. Examine both the front and the back of your legs and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes. Also check your genital area and between your buttocks.\n\n【28】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The WKO device was designed for individuals with hyperkyphosis, especially related to osteoporosis. These individuals often have a propensity to falls because of their stooped posturing and related back extensor weakness and/or imbalance. The physician must determine an individual's propensity to falls based on the patient's medical history, talking with the patient, and findings on the physical examination.\n\n【1】Although a backpack does serve to load the spine, we would certainly not advise our fragile, osteoporotic patients to load a backpack with books and strap it to their back. The backpacks that we have seen do not position the weight strategically as the WKO does nor can one scientifically advise the patient on the amount of weight (ie, 1 book, 2 books, etc). One can easily control the position and amount of weight when prescribing the WKO. We have been using this device for scientific studies since 1984. The WKO is not available over the counter and must be prescribed by a physician with proper weight and instructions for application. If a patient describes a propensity to fall backward, perhaps related to an underlying neurologic condition, the WKO would not be prescribed for that individual.\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【4】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/81.1.131-c</u></u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>© 2006 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

{"seq_id": "63d57c92-43e8-4313-a678-435b4833728a", "title": "Dermabrasion", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Dermabrasion is a skin-resurfacing procedure that uses a rapidly rotating device to remove the outer layer of skin. The skin that grows back is usually smoother.\n\n【2】Dermabrasion can decrease the appearance of fine facial lines and improve the look of many skin flaws, including acne scars, scars from surgery, age spots and wrinkles. Dermabrasion can be done alone or in combination with other cosmetic procedures.\n\n【3】During dermabrasion, your doctor numbs your skin with anesthetics. You might also have the option of taking a sedative or receiving general anesthesia, depending on the extent of your treatment.\n\n【4】Skin treated with dermabrasion will be sensitive and blotchy for several weeks. It might take about three months for your skin tone to return to normal.\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】Dermabrasion can be used to treat or remove:\n\n【7】*   Scars caused by acne, surgery or injuries\n*   Fine wrinkles, especially those around the mouth\n*   Sun-damaged skin, including age spots\n*   Tattoos\n*   Swelling and redness of the nose (rhinophyma)\n*   Potentially precancerous skin patches\n\n【8】Risks\n-----\n\n【9】Dermabrasion can cause side effects, including:\n\n【10】*   **Redness and swelling.** After dermabrasion, treated skin will be red and swollen. Swelling will begin to decrease within a few days to one week, but might last for weeks or even months.\n\n【11】    Your new skin will be sensitive and blotchy for several weeks. It might take about three months for your skin tone to return to normal.\n\n【12】*   **Acne.** You might notice tiny white bumps (milia) on treated skin. These bumps usually disappear on their own or with the use of soap or an abrasive pad.\n*   **Enlarged pores.** Dermabrasion might cause your pores to grow larger.\n*   **Changes in skin color.** Dermabrasion often causes treated skin to temporarily become darker than normal (hyperpigmentation), lighter than normal (hypopigmentation) or blotchy. These problems are more common in people with brown or black skin and can sometimes be permanent.\n*   **Infection.** Rarely, dermabrasion can lead to a bacterial, fungal or viral infection, such as a flare-up of the herpes virus, the virus that causes cold sores.\n*   **Scarring.** Dermabrasion that's done too deeply can cause scarring. Steroid medications can be used to soften the appearance of these scars.\n*   **Other skin reactions.** If you often develop allergic skin rashes or other skin reactions, dermabrasion might cause these reactions to flare up.\n\n【13】Dermabrasion isn't for everyone. Your doctor might caution against dermabrasion if you:\n\n【14】*   Have taken the oral acne medication isotretinoin (Myorisan, Claravis, others) during the past year\n*   Have a personal or family history of ridged areas caused by an overgrowth of scar tissue (keloids)\n*   Have acne or another pus-filled skin condition\n*   Have frequent or severe outbreaks of cold sores\n*   Have burn scars or skin that's been damaged by radiation treatments\n\n【15】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【16】Before you have dermabrasion, your doctor will likely:\n\n【17】*   **Review your medical history.** Be prepared to answer questions about current and past medical conditions and any medications you're taking or have taken recently, as well as any cosmetic procedures you've had.\n*   **Do a physical exam.** Your doctor will inspect your skin and the area to be treated to determine what changes can be made and how your physical features — for example, the tone and thickness of your skin — might affect your results.\n*   **Discuss your expectations.** Talk with your doctor about your motivations, expectations and potential risks. Make sure you understand how long your skin will take to heal and what your results might be.\n\n【18】Before dermabrasion, you might also need to:\n\n【19】*   **Stop using certain medications.** Before having dermabrasion, your doctor might recommend not taking aspirin, blood thinners and certain other medications.\n*   **Stop smoking.** If you smoke, your doctor might ask you to stop smoking for a week or two before and after dermabrasion. Smoking decreases blood flow in the skin and can slow the healing process.\n*   **Take an antiviral medication.** Your doctor will likely prescribe an antiviral medication before and after treatment to help prevent a viral infection.\n*   **Take an oral antibiotic.** If you have acne, your doctor might recommend taking an oral antibiotic around the time of the procedure to help prevent a bacterial infection.\n*   **Have onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injections.** These are usually given at least three days before the procedure and help most people achieve better results.\n*   **Use a retinoid cream.** Your doctor might recommend using a retinoid cream such as tretinoin (Renova, Retin-A, others) for a few weeks before treatment to help with healing.\n*   **Avoid unprotected sun exposure.** Too much sun exposure before the procedure can cause permanent irregular pigmentation in treated areas. Discuss sun protection and acceptable sun exposure with your doctor.\n*   **Arrange for a ride home.** If you'll be sedated or receive a general anesthetic during the procedure, arrange for a ride home.\n\n【20】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【21】Dermabrasion is typically done in an office procedure room or outpatient facility. If you're having extensive work done, you might be admitted to a hospital.\n\n【22】On the day of your procedure, wash your face. Do not apply any makeup or facial creams. Wear clothes that you don't have to pull over your head because you'll have a facial dressing after your procedure.\n\n【23】Your care team will give you anesthesia or sedation to decrease sensation. If you have questions about this, ask a member of your care team.\n\n【24】### During the procedure\n\n【25】During the procedure, the doctor moves a small motorized device across the skin with constant, gentle pressure. The device has an abrasive wheel or brush for a tip that removes the outer skin layers.\n\n【26】Dermabrasion can take a few minutes to more than an hour, depending on how much skin is being treated. If you have deep scarring or you're having a large amount of skin treated, you might have dermabrasion done more than once or in stages.\n\n【27】### After the procedure\n\n【28】After dermabrasion, treated skin will be covered with a moist, nonstick dressing. You will receive self-care instructions to follow at home and you might be given prescription pain medication.\n\n【29】You'll likely need to schedule a checkup soon after treatment so that your doctor can examine your skin and change your dressing.\n\n【30】At home, change your dressing as directed by your doctor. Your doctor will also let you know when you can begin regularly cleaning the treated area and applying protective ointments. Your self-care instructions will vary depending on the extent of your procedure.\n\n【31】While you're healing:\n\n【32】*   Treated skin will be red and swollen\n*   You'll likely feel some burning, tingling or aching\n*   A scab or crust will form over treated skin as it begins to heal\n*   The growth of new skin might be itchy\n\n【33】To relieve pain after the procedure, take prescribed pain medication or an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox DS, others). Ask your doctor which pain reliever is best for you.\n\n【34】You might prefer to remain at home while you're healing from dermabrasion, though you can usually return to work after two weeks. Keep treated areas away from chlorinated swimming pool water for at least four weeks. Your doctor might recommend avoiding active sports — especially those involving a ball — for four to six weeks.\n\n【35】Once new skin completely covers the treated area, you can use cosmetics to conceal any redness.\n\n【36】If your treated skin appears to be getting worse — becomes increasingly red, raised and itchy after it has started to heal — contact your doctor. This might be a sign of scarring.\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】After dermabrasion, your new skin will be sensitive and red. Swelling will begin to decrease within a few days to a week, but can last for weeks or even months. It might take about three months for your skin tone to return to normal.\n\n【39】Once the treated area begins to heal, you'll notice that your skin looks smoother. Protect your skin from the sun for six to 12 months to prevent permanent skin color changes.\n\n【40】If your skin tone is blotchy after healing, ask your doctor about prescription hydroquinone — a bleaching agent — to help even out your skin tone.\n\n【41】Keep in mind that dermabrasion results might not be permanent. As you age, you'll continue to get lines from squinting and smiling. New sun damage also can reverse the results of dermabrasion.\n\n【42】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Thus, fosphenytoin can theoretically alter the electrocardiogram by 2 mechanisms: the direct effects of phenytoin on cardiac conduction and on phosphate binding of calcium, which could indirectly alter cardiac conduction as a result of hypocalcemia. We report the case of a 23-year-old man, weight 73 kg, with a known but untreated seizure disorder who was given prophylactic fosphenytoin, 1500-mg phenytoin equivalents over 85 minutes by intravenous infusion. The patient was normocalcemic before drug infusion. Fosphenytoin produced electrocardiographic changes (prolongation of the ST segment and the QT interval and merging of the T and P waves) consistent with hypocalcemia, and these changes were associated with new-onset reductions in both total and ionized serum calcium concentrations. Plasma phenytoin concentrations were within the therapeutic range during the electrocardiographic changes, and the patient's blood pressure was stable.

Consistent with this concept, we describe a patient who developed hypocalcemia-like ECG changes, in association with documented hypocalcemia, after fosphenytoin administration. The origin of the ECG changes and implications for patient management are discussed.\n\n【22】REPORT OF A CASE\n----------------\n\n【23】A 23-year-old man, weight 73 kg, presented for exploratory laparotomy to investigate recurrent abdominal pain. His medical history was remarkable only for 2 seizures, 4 years and 18 months before his presentation for surgery. A preoperative electroencephalogram showed generalized spike-and-wave discharges in the setting of clinically observed myoclonic jerks. Findings on his neurologic examination were otherwise entirely normal. A consulting neurologist recommended that an antiepileptic medication be used in the perioperative period.\n\n【24】The patient had no prior history of drug allergy, anesthetic difficulties, or cardiorespiratory problems. The complete blood cell count, serum creatinine levels, and electrolyte levels on the day of surgery were entirely normal except for a mildly decreased serum potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L (reference range shown parenthetically) (3.6-4.8 mEq/L). His most recent serum albumin measurement, 4.1 mg/dL, was within the reference range (3.5-5.0 mg/dL). The preoperative total calcium level was 9.5 mg/dL (8.9-10.1 mg/dL). His preoperative medications included oral prednisone, 20 mg/d, and a multivitamin supplement.\n\n【25】The patient was brought to the operating room, standard physiologic monitors were applied, and a general anesthetic (consisting of inhaled isoflurane in oxygen and IV morphine) was administered. The abdomen was surgically prepared and draped, and the surgery commenced. The continuously displayed ECG (leads II and V5) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 100 beats/min 删除4:<u>( Figure 1, A )</u>.\n\n【26】Figure 1 Representative electrocardiographic tracings (lead II).

C, Fifteen minutes after fosphenytoin infusion.\n\n【27】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【28】Twenty minutes after induction of anesthesia, fosphenytoin, 1500-mg phenytoin equivalents, was infused intravenously over 85 minutes. Midway through the infusion, it was noted that the morphology of the ECG had changed. Based on the assumption that the changes were possibly related to fosphenytoin, but with no changes in blood pressure, the drug infusion rate was slowed slightly from the initial rate. The ECG changes persisted and exacerbated. Five minutes after completion of the infusion, there was prolongation of the ST segment and merging of the T wave with the P wave of the next cardiac impulse, ie, a markedly prolonged QT interval 删除4:<u>( Figure 1, B )</u>. The changes were noticeable in both of the monitored ECG leads. As earlier, there was no evidence of hemodynamic compromise corresponding to the ECG changes. His blood pressure was 105/50 mm Hg. After cessation of the fosphenytoin infusion, the ECG changes tended to regress. Fifteen minutes after infusion cessation, the QT interval shortened, with separation of the T and P waves, yielding a double-hump appearance to the TP wave 删除4:<u>( Figure 1, C )</u>. The plasma phenytoin concentration at this time was 16.2 µg/mL (10-20 µg/mL). The total serum calcium concentration, 7.5 mg/dL, had decreased, and ionized calcium concentration was 4.52 mg/dL (4.74-5.3 mg/dL). The remainder of the anesthetic and surgical procedure was without incident.\n\n【29】Immediately postoperatively (ie, 95 minutes after completion of the fosphenytoin infusion), a 12-lead ECG obtained in the postanesthesia care unit showed characteristics intermediate between those before fosphenytoin administration 删除4:<u>( Figure 1, A )</u> and after the completion of fosphenytoin administration 删除4:<u>( Figure 1, B and C )</u>. Specifically, there was normal sinus rhythm with a nonspecific T- wave abnormality and a prolonged QT interval (corrected QT interval, 598 ms; the usual adult value, <420 ms). The patient was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic. During his subsequent hospitalization, the patient received 300-mg phenytoin equivalents of fosphenytoin intramuscularly (IM) per day for 5 days without adverse effects, and then he was switched to oral phenytoin.\n\n【30】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【31】After parenteral administration, fosphenytoin metabolism yields equimolar concentrations of phenytoin and inorganic phosphate. Not surprisingly, many of the cardiovascular effects of fosphenytoin are similar to those of phenytoin and can be directly attributed to an increase in blood phenytoin concentrations. For example, although parenteral fosphenytoin causes less hypotension than phenytoin, the timing of fosphenytoin-related reductions in blood pressure coincides with the attainment of clinically important plasma phenytoin concentrations.\n\n【32】无关删除-2:<u>*   Boucher BA\n*   Feler CA\n*   Dean JC\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【33】The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of fosphenytoin after intramuscular and intravenous administration in neurosurgery patients.\n\n【34】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Pharmacotherapy._ 1996; 16 : 638-645</u></u>\n\n【35】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【36】无关删除-2:<u>*   Leppik IE\n*   Boucher BA\n*   Wilder BJ\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【37】Pharmacokinetics and safety of a phenytoin prodrug given i.v. or i.m. in patients.\n\n【38】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Neurology._ 1990; 40 : 456-460</u></u>\n\n【39】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【40】Our patient did not develop hypotension but instead experienced ECG changes after fosphenytoin administration.

Given the fact that, at the time of the most profound ECG changes in our patient, the measured phenytoin concentrations were within the therapeutic range yet he was experiencing acute hypocalcemia, it is likely that inorganic phosphate toxicity, not the direct effects of phenytoin, was the predominant cause of the ECG alterations.\n\n【68】Fosphenytoin-related cardiovascular events (recorded during clinical trials and referenced in the package insert\n\n【69】Cerebyx \\[package insert\\].

Although there are no published reports of hypocalcemia- associated ECG changes after fosphenytoin administration, the drug's package insert hints at the possibility. Specifically, the insert lists hypocalcemia as a possible adverse effect of drug overdosage and recommends that, because of concern for phosphate loading, the dose should be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency or hypoalbuminemia. This warning did not protect our patient from cardiac conduction disturbances related to presumed inorganic phosphate toxicity. He did not receive an overdose of fosphenytoin, as evidenced by the fact that therapeutic concentrations of phenytoin were achieved. Furthermore, our patient had no evidence of renal problems that would have caused the elevation of baseline phosphate concentrations, and he did not have hypoalbuminemia.\n\n【72】Of note, hours after receiving IV fosphenytoin, our patient also received additional maintenance doses of IM fosphenytoin. As a result of this different mode of administration (IM vs IV) and a reduced drug dose (ie, one fifth of the initial IV loading dose), the inorganic phosphate load was smaller and delivered to the systemic circulation at a slower rate. Thus, the postoperative doses were unlikely to have caused as large of calcium or ECG changes as the IV dose. We cannot confirm this, however, because continuous ECG monitoring was not used during the postoperative period.\n\n【73】Because of the many divergent adverse effects involving cardiac conduction, and the fact that adverse effects should be related to rate of drug administration, the fosphenytoin administration guidelines recommend continuous ECG monitoring during IV fosphenytoin infusion.\n\n【74】Cerebyx \\[package insert\\].

L.E.H.) designed an ambulatory clinic specifically to care for patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). None of the hundreds of research reports published to date addressed caring for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the ambulatory setting, and it became clear that one of the first challenges we faced was to gain an understanding of the typical presentation and early natural history of mild and moderate COVID-19 to guide our care during the pandemic.\n\n【1】While we had access to state laboratory real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, concerns regarding false-negative results and delays of up to 5 days made the results impractical for clinical management. Routine laboratory studies, likewise, did not appear to be clinically useful. We focused, instead, on trying to discern patterns from a detailed history and limited physical exam that might distinguish COVID-19 from other similar illnesses.\n\n【2】Initially, some cases of COVID-19 appeared to be identical to influenza, upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, and community-acquired pneumonia. After caring for more than 1000 patients in our COVID-19 clinic, however, we came to suspect that many moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 could be diagnosed by a careful history.\n\n【3】At the outset, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic or experience symptoms indistinguishable from a variety of acute viral and bacterial infections.

We have found these first days after the onset of dyspnea to be critical for monitoring patients frequently by televisits or in-person evaluations. The most useful factors to monitor are work of breathing and oxygen saturation. Oxygen saturation often decreases precipitously with exertion, even in some previously healthy patients.

The classic progression of _Legionella_ pneumonia initially begins with fever and fatigue, followed by cough shortly thereafter — dyspnea would only be expected in cases in which the pneumonia progressed to become more severe. In contrast, in patients with COVID-19 we often see the appearance of cough and fever at the onset with dyspnea occurring a few days later, sometimes even after the fever has abated.\n\n【39】Clinically, COVID-19 respiratory symptoms appear to be most similar to those caused by _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ pneumonia, a pulmonary infection predominantly affecting the alveoli. We have found that, similar to _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia, a precipitous decrease in oxygen saturation level with exertion is highly suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the case of _Pneumocysitis_ pneumonia, however, the dyspnea typically develops insidiously over weeks, not days.\n\n【40】Post-viral pneumonia also has many similarities to COVID-19, but might be distinguishable in some cases by a careful history. Cough and fatigue may be the initial presentation in both, but the next stage is different. Whereas increasing fever and productive cough might be symptoms of post-viral pneumonia, in COVID-19 we typically note worsening dyspnea without productive cough.\n\n【41】Similarly, during the initial days of infection, both influenza and COVID-19 may have identical presentations, but thereafter the progression of the two infections diverges. In uncomplicated influenza, it would be unusual to develop the onset of dyspnea 4 to 10 days after symptoms began. Whereas patients with influenza may develop mild dyspnea, we would expect the dyspnea to improve gradually over the following days or weeks with an uncomplicated influenza infection. In addition, patients with rare viral pneumonia from influenza tend to deteriorate rapidly within the first 2 to 3 days of infection, unlike patients with COVID-19 who do not tend to deteriorate until later in their course of illness.\n\n【42】COVID-19 can also present similarly to streptococcal pharyngitis, viral sinusitis, acute pericarditis, and other common infections, but in each case, the key distinction is the development of dyspnea several days after the onset of infection, even as the other symptoms may be improving.\n\n【43】Given the extensive media attention regarding the serious consequences of COVID-19, there is an understandably high level of anxiety in the community. One common cause of shortness of breath in our clinic has been anxiety combined with viral-type symptoms. Key aspects of anxiety-induced shortness of breath that have helped us distinguish anxiety-induced dyspnea from SARS-CoV-2–induced dyspnea are found at the onset: with anxiety, onset is often immediately after the first symptoms of infection, whereas with SARS-CoV-2, dyspnea occurs several days after the initial symptoms begin. The description of dyspnea is often helpful as well. In our patients with dyspnea due to anxiety, the dyspnea tends to occur at rest or when trying to fall asleep but does not become more pronounced when participating in daily activities. Patients with anxiety often describe the sensation of not being able to get enough air into their lungs, whereas with SARS-CoV-2 infection, dyspnea is consistently worse with exertion. Although dizziness might occur in both conditions, it too is more likely to be present at rest with anxiety and with exertion in COVID-19. When a pulse oximeter is available, a normal oxygen saturation level with ambulation helps confirm one’s clinical suspicion of anxiety-related shortness of breath.\n\n【44】Because current treatment options for COVID-19 are limited, we pay particular attention to identifying treatable etiologies of dyspnea including exacerbations of underlying pulmonary and cardiovascular disease and treat the exacerbation as we would have before the pandemic.\n\n【45】The typical COVID-19 pattern of a nonspecific viral syndrome — often involving the respiratory system but not infrequently the gastrointestinal system — followed by onset of dyspnea several days later, particularly with precipitous decreases in oxygen saturation level especially with exertion, are helpful keys to distinguishing COVID-19 from other similar conditions. A nuanced understanding of the typical presentation and natural history of COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting can help determine the appropriate timing of follow-up — patients who have begun to develop dyspnea should be followed closely in the following 72 hours for evidence of worsening dyspnea particularly with exertion — and permit clinicians to more easily distinguish COVID-19 from other common and treatable illnesses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Eisenmenger syndrome is life-threatening.\n\n【2】In Eisenmenger syndrome, there is irregular blood flow in the heart and lungs. This causes the blood vessels in the lungs to become stiff and narrow. Blood pressure rises in the lungs' arteries (pulmonary arterial hypertension). Eisenmenger syndrome permanently damages the blood vessels in the lungs.\n\n【3】Early diagnosis and repair of congenital heart defects usually prevents Eisenmenger syndrome. If it does develop, treatment involves regular medical visits and medications to improve symptoms.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Symptoms of Eisenmenger syndrome include:\n\n【6】*   Blue or gray skin color due to low oxygen levels (cyanosis)\n*   Chest pain or tightness\n*   Coughing up blood\n*   Dizziness or fainting\n*   Easily tiring and shortness of breath with activity\n*   Headaches\n*   Large, rounded fingernails or toenails (clubbing)\n*   Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes\n*   Shortness of breath while at rest\n*   Skipped or racing heartbeats (palpitations)\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】If you have any symptoms of Eisenmenger syndrome, see your health care provider. Make an appointment even if you have never been diagnosed with a heart problem. Symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain require medical attention.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Eisenmenger syndrome is usually caused by an unrepaired hole (shunt) between the main blood vessels or chambers of the heart. A shunt is a heart problem present at birth (congenital heart defect).\n\n【11】To understand how Eisenmenger syndrome affects the heart and lungs, it's helpful to know how the heart typically works.\n\n【12】### How the heart works\n\n【13】The heart is divided into chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).\n\n【14】*   The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through blood vessels (pulmonary arteries).\n*   In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and then returns to the left side of the heart through the pulmonary veins.\n*   The left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the aorta and out to the rest of the body.\n\n【15】Heart valves control the flow of blood into and out of the chambers of the heart. These valves open to allow blood to move to the next chamber or to one of the arteries, and then close to keep blood from flowing backward.\n\n【16】### How Eisenmenger syndrome develops\n\n【17】Heart problems present at birth (congenital heart defects) that can cause Eisenmenger syndrome include:\n\n【18】*   **Ventricular septal defect.** This is the most common cause of Eisenmenger syndrome. There is a hole (shunt) in the wall of tissue that divides the right and left sides of the heart's main pumping chambers (ventricles).\n*   **Atrioventricular canal defect.** This is a large hole in the center of the heart where the walls between the upper chambers (atria) and lower chambers (ventricles) meet. Some of the valves in the heart also may not work properly.\n*   **Atrial septal defect.** This is a hole in the wall of tissue that divides the right and left sides of the upper chambers of the heart (atria).\n*   **Patent ductus arteriosus.** This is an opening between the pulmonary artery that carries oxygen-poor blood to the lungs and the artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body (aorta).\n\n【19】In any of these heart problems, blood flows in a way it usually doesn't. As a result, pressure rises in the pulmonary artery. Over time, the increased pressure damages the smaller blood vessels in the lungs. The damaged blood vessel walls make it difficult to pump blood to the lungs.\n\n【20】In Eisenmenger syndrome, there's increased blood pressure in the side of the heart that has oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blue blood goes through the hole (shunt) in the heart or blood vessels. Oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood now mix. This causes low blood oxygen levels.\n\n【21】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【22】A family history of congenital heart defects increases the risk of similar heart problems in a baby. If you've been diagnosed with Eisenmenger syndrome, talk to your health care provider about screening other family members for congenital heart defects.\n\n【23】Complications\n-------------\n\n【24】Eisenmenger syndrome is a life-threatening condition. The outlook for people diagnosed with Eisenmenger syndrome depends on the specific cause and if there are other medical conditions.\n\n【25】Without proper treatment and monitoring, complications of Eisenmenger syndrome may include:\n\n【26】*   **Low blood oxygen levels.** The reversed blood flow through the heart reduces oxygen to the body's tissues and organs. Without prompt treatment, the oxygen levels worsen over time.\n*   **Irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias).** Eisenmenger syndrome causes the heart walls to get bigger and thicker. It also causes oxygen levels to lower. These changes may cause irregular heart rhythms. Some arrhythmias increase the risk of blood clots that can cause heart attacks or strokes.\n*   **Sudden cardiac arrest.** This is the sudden loss of heart activity due to an irregular heart rhythm. If not treated immediately, sudden cardiac arrest can quickly lead to death. Survival is possible with fast, appropriate medical care.\n*   **Heart failure.** The increased pressure in the heart can cause the heart muscle to weaken. It becomes harder for the heart to pump blood.\n*   **Bleeding in the lungs.** Eisenmenger syndrome can cause life-threatening bleeding in the lungs and airways. This can cause you to cough up blood and further lower your blood oxygen levels. Bleeding can also occur in other parts of the body.\n*   **Stroke.** If a blood clot travels from the right to left side of the heart, the clot may block a blood vessel in the brain, leading to a stroke.\n*   **Kidney problems.** Low oxygen levels in the blood may lead to problems with the kidneys.\n*   **Gout.** Eisenmenger syndrome can increase the risk of a type of arthritis called gout. Gout causes sudden, severe attacks of pain and swelling in one or more joints, usually the big toe.\n*   **Heart infection.** People with Eisenmenger syndrome have a higher risk of a heart infection called endocarditis.\n*   **Pregnancy risks.** During pregnancy, the heart and lungs have to work harder to support the growing baby. Because of this, pregnancy with Eisenmenger syndrome poses a high risk of death for both you and the baby. If you have Eisenmenger syndrome, talk to your care provider about your specific pregnancy risks.\n\n【27】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Historians trace this milestone to January 1864, when William Worrall Mayo, MD (Dr W.W.), began a solo medical practice in Rochester, Minnesota. In the 1880s, his sons, William James Mayo, MD (Dr Will), and Charles Horace Mayo, MD (Dr Charlie), joined the practice. The brothers, in turn, oversaw operations that involved a growing number of physician partners, supported by a team of nurses, administrators, and others who helped the practice grow into its current status: the world’s largest integrated, not-for-profit, private multispecialty medical practice. Mayo Clinic currently has more than 57,000 employees\n\n【1】无关删除-2:<u>*   Olsen K.D.\n*   Dacy M.D.</u>\n\n【2】Mayo Clinic—150 years of serving humanity through hope and healing.\n\n【3】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2014; 89 : 8-15</u></u>\n\n【4】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (7)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【5】and clinical, educational, and scientific outreach that extends globally. It is truly a marvel of the modern world.\n\n【6】The Role of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ in the Sesquicentennial Celebration\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Although _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is now a general/internal medicine journal with contributions from authors and reviewers worldwide, it would not exist today without Mayo Clinic’s initial nurturing, ongoing sponsorship, and demand for independent peer review and independent editorial content. In many ways, the history of the Journal reflects that of Mayo Clinic itself. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ began in Rochester as a small, local publication targeted to Mayo Clinic physicians and staff. The first issue was published in April 1926 删除4:<u>( Figure )</u>, when the Mayo Clinic practice was in its 63rd year. In the ensuing years, the _Proceedings_ has grown and prospered along with Mayo Clinic, such that today it is one of the world’s largest and most influential medical journals.\n\n【8】Figure Left, The first issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ ’ predecessor, _Bulletin of the Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Foundation_ , published on April 21, 1926.

Specifically, the Journal will share with readers many historical, cultural, and programmatic elements of Mayo Clinic that inform current medical practices as well as inspire us to improve the future of health care.\n\n【11】Readers will notice that the façade of the 2014 print Journal 删除4:<u>( Figure )</u>—as well as the design for select celebratory articles—will pay homage to the Mayo Clinic sesquicentennial. Among the various content elements associated with the sesquicentennial, the Journal will feature 4 special Commentaries placing into perspective the past, present, and future of Mayo Clinic and its role in shaping medicine and health care delivery worldwide. The first of these Commentaries, published in this January 2014 issue, is an overview authored by Kerry D. Olsen, MD, and Matthew D.

In 2014, the website and mobile app for the Journal will present an accumulating number of Historical Vignettes on important milestones within Mayo Clinic departments, divisions, and schools. Other historical elements will focus specifically on the _Proceedings_ ’ 88-year witness to, and participation in, the evolution of Mayo Clinic. On the home page of the _Proceedings_ website, a continually updated feature entitled _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ Legacy will present historical elements that honor both the history of the Journal and seminal medical discoveries that were reported in the pages of the _Proceedings_ . The _Proceedings_ Legacy feature will also include a link to the Mayo Clinic sesquicentennial external website.\n\n【31】As opportunities arise, we will draw your attention to much of the aforementioned print and electronic Journal content through the _Proceedings_ ’ Facebook page, and we will regularly tweet alerts of new additions to content. Additionally, the authors of many sesquicentennial articles published in the print Journal will, along with authors of regular Journal content, provide video interviews that will be featured on the website and archived through our YouTube channel.\n\n【32】In aggregate, these collective _Proceedings_ ’ print and electronic publications in 2014 are intended to educate and entertain all readers, regardless of their familiarity with the rich, instructive history of the institution.\n\n【33】The Importance of Studying the Mayo Clinic Story\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Most who visit or otherwise come into contact with Mayo Clinic quickly learn how extensively the values and vision of Dr W.W. and the Mayo brothers inform current practices. Indeed, as this phenomenon is formally studied, the strength of the connection between the Mayo brothers and the current practices becomes even more apparent. Excellent examples are provided in the 2001 book _The Mayo Brothers’ Heritage: Quotes & Pictures_ by Thomas M. Habermann, MD, Renee E. Ziemer, and Caroline Stickney Beck,\n\n【35】无关删除-2:<u>*   Habermann T.M.\n*   Ziemer R.E.\n*   Beck C.S.</u>\n\n【36】The Mayo Brothers’ Heritage: Quotes & Pictures.\n\n【37】Mayo Clinic Scientific Press , Rochester, MN 2001\n\n【38】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【39】and the 2008 book by Leonard L.

At one of our initial meetings, Professor Berry, whom I’ll attempt to quote from memory, told me: At most large organizations, the founders’ influence usually wanes after they’ve left the organization or died. At Mayo Clinic, it is remarkable that, even though the Mayo brothers died in 1939, their influence remains pervasive. One cannot speak with Mayo Clinic physicians and leaders very long before they invoke the values of Drs Will and Charlie, and, if you do not listen closely to their words, you might get the impression that they had physically met with one brother or the other in the past hour to share a conversation and cup of coffee. Those who lead Mayo Clinic today do not want to fall short of the high standards set by the Mayo brothers many years ago. (Story confirmation and permission for use granted by Leonard L. Berry, PhD, November 17, 2013.)\n\n【45】At Mayo Clinic, the daily revisiting of established values and the telling of stories that highlight not only the Mayos but also the many other brilliant, creative, innovative, and courageous Mayo Clinic personalities (regardless of whether they had a lofty or not-so-lofty role in the organization) serve not to fixate leaders and employees on glories of the past but instead to impart values and vision for progress into the future.\n\n【46】This reflection on historical—or better yet, cultural—values speaks to the very core of many Mayo Clinic employees. I am one such person. As a young boy, I spent many hours at the lunch and dinner table with my paternal grandparents, Thomas Zebedee and Audrie Lanier, who lived a mere 400 yards from my parents’ home in coastal Georgia. My grandparents spoke frequently of important historical figures, many with direct relevance to our homeland and agrarian way of life, and they used the stories to glean lessons of individual challenges, specifically methods to approach life with vigor and proper decorum, whether experiencing victory or defeat. Thus, when I joined the Mayo Clinic faculty in 1984, this same utilization of historical anecdotes seemed very familiar to me, and I too incorporated these methods into my own career, as the following example demonstrates.\n\n【47】In my second decade on the faculty, I was selected by Mayo Clinic to be _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ ’ Editor-in-Chief, to formulate a new Editorial Board, and to contribute to other organizational groups that would eventually redirect the Journal. With the oversight groups and their component members assembled, we began by examining widely divergent views to transform the Journal’s future. Some of these explored a distancing of the Journal from the contemporary Mayo Clinic, and others explored the opposite pole: returning to the core values and practices that made Mayo Clinic a great institution.\n\n【48】A reading of the book, _Aphorisms of Dr. Charles Horace Mayo, 1865-1939, and Dr. William James Mayo, 1861-1939_ ,\n\n【49】无关删除-2:<u>*   Mayo C.H.\n*   Mayo W.J.</u>\n\n【50】Willius F.A.

In the Mayo brothers’ words and concepts, we discovered a treasure trove of observations, speculative synthesis, and guidance that, once embraced, helped inform the current practices of the Journal. Specifically, we discovered that the values, focus, and energy that drove Drs W.W. Will, and Charlie Mayo to turn a small, 3-person medical practice into an expanded, progressive medical practice that would become today’s 57,000-plus-employee Mayo Clinic are the same values, focus, and energy that we would use to transform _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ . If the Mayos could invent the integrated group practice, introduce a new method of recording information (ie, the dossier medical record), and introduce new approaches to logistics, communication, teamwork, and collegiality to produce a better functioning medical organization, then we would use similar techniques to form a better _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ . If the Mayos could travel the world to obtain the best medical information from experts to incorporate into the local medical practice and additionally bring medical practitioners from afar to educate them on Mayo Clinic’s best medial practices, so too would the _Proceedings_ . If the Mayos could operationalize their belief that it is not just advances in science but also advances in medical education, professionalism, humanities, and related fields that produce an optimal health care experience for the individual patient, then so too would the _Proceedings._ And it is through these very methods that we used, and continue to use, the values and practices of the Mayos to direct the new _Proceedings_ .\n\n【53】As such, those of us who today lead the Journal see the _Proceedings_ ’ current status—the world’s fourth-largest-circulation print biomedical journal of any genre, its highly innovative and dynamic website, the breadth of media coverage of the Journal’s articles that reaches billions, the vast expansion of authors and reviewers from within and outside Mayo Clinic each year, and ever more progressive journal metrics (eg, readership, impact factor)—as manifestations of the type of growth and innovation that the founding Mayos would not only approve but encourage (if not demand). More importantly, perhaps, we also believe that the founders of our Clinic would approve of the fact that the sentiments within the Mayo Clinic primary value, “the needs of the patient come first,” are echoed in _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ ’ mission statement: “To promote the best interests of patients by advancing the knowledge and professionalism of the physician community.”\n\n【54】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【55】_Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ 2012: “a new era in journal stewardship.”.\n\n【56】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2012; 87 : 1-6</u></u>\n\n【57】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (5)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【58】Fortunately, the very public activities of the _Proceedings_ are just one of many Mayo Clinic operations that share similar values and energy.

For cases, creatinine clearance and electrolyte levels were required to be measured within 90 days of the SCA event.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Cases of SCA had higher proportions of blacks \\[31 (12%) vs 14 (3%); _P_ <.001\\], diabetes mellitus \\[122 (46%) vs 126 (28%); _P_ <.001\\], and chronic kidney disease \\[102 (38%) vs 73 (16%); _P_ <.001\\] than did controls. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, a 1-unit decrease in Ca levels was associated with a 1.6-fold increase in odds of SCA (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.06-2.51). Blood Ca levels lower than 8.95 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.025) were associated with a 2.3-fold increase in odds of SCA as compared with levels higher than 9.55 mg/dL (odds ratio, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.17-4.61). Cases of SCA had significantly prolonged corrected QT intervals on the 12-lead electrocardiogram than did controls (465±37 ms vs 425±33 ms; _P_ <.001).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Lower serum Ca levels were independently associated with an increased risk of SCA in the community.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CAD ( coronary artery disease ), CrCl ( creatinine clearance ), HMO ( health maintenance organization ), LVEF ( left ventricular ejection fraction ), OR ( odds ratio ), SCA ( sudden cardiac arrest )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Faced with this increase, clinicians need a better understanding of what an elevated serum creatinine level represents and a simple codified approach to evaluating renal failure. Creatinine, a muscle waste product, has an imperfect but predictable association with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Although other markers of GFR exist, including cystatin C, urea, inulin, and radioisotopic methods, their role in estimating GFR remains a matter for debate, especially that of cystatin C. Diagnosis and management of CKD are challenges for the nonspecialist. We describe a systematic approach that can be used by the nonspecialist to identify most but not all causes of renal insufficiency. Although this approach should allow for earlier recognition of treatable causes of CKD, it does not eliminate the involvement of a nephrologist in the care and management of the conditions causing the renal insufficiency. The nonspecialist should also be able to recognize the 9 therapies that are helpful in preservation of renal function in all patients with CKD.\n\n【1】CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), FENa ( fractional excretion of sodium ), GFR ( glomerular filtration rate ), NSAID ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ), RBC ( red blood cell )\n\n【2】**C** hronic kidney disease (CKD), as defined by a reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is increasing in the United States,\n\n【3】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kohli HS\n*   Bhat A\n*   Aravindan\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【4】Spectrum of renal failure in elderly patients.\n\n【5】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Int Urol Nephrol._ 2006; 38 ( Epub 2007 Jan 23. ) : 759-765</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (16)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【7】in part because of the greater prevalence of obesity and hypertension\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>*   Mokdad AH\n*   Serdula MK\n*   Dietz WH\n*   Bowman BA\n*   Marks JS\n*   Koplan JP</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>The spread of obesity epidemic in the United States, 1991-1998.</u>\n\n【10】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 1999; 282 : 1519-1522</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1931)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ostchega Y\n*   Dillon CF\n*   Hughes JP\n*   Carroll M\n*   Yoon S</u>\n\n【13】Trends in hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control in older U.S. adults: data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988 to 2004.\n\n【14】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Am Geriatr Soc._ 2007; 55 : 1056-1065</u></u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (281)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【16】but in greater part because of improved longevity.

To use the serum creatinine level as a marker of renal function, creatinine production and protein intake must be assumed to be constant 删除4:<u>( Figure )</u>. Creatinine excretion is due not only to filtration (90%-95%) by the kidney but also to secretion (5%-10%) by the distal tubule. As GFR decreases, the percentage of creatinine excretion due to secretion increases. In this circumstance, substances that block distal tubule secretion of creatinine (eg, trimethoprim, cimetidine, cefoxitin, flucytosine) may cause the serum creatinine level to increase abruptly, when in fact GFR has not changed at all.\n\n【48】无关删除-2:<u>*   Andreev E\n*   Koopman M\n*   Arisz L</u>\n\n【49】A rise in plasma creatinine that is not a sign of renal failure: which drugs can be responsible?\n\n【50】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Intern Med._ 1999; 246 : 247-252</u></u>\n\n【51】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (139)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【52】Because they can confuse the assessment of kidney function, these agents are often avoided in the patient with CKD.

Their primary clinical function is to help define whether a patient is at end-stage renal disease. All these estimates of renal function are harder to interpret during acute renal failure, which is characterized by an unstable association between creatinine production and renal excretion (changing renal function).\n\n【82】Where does the primary care physician find the previous measurements of serum creatinine levels that are needed to interpret the current value correctly? Sources of baseline serum creatinine values include laboratory work performed during previous physician visits, minor surgeries (appendix, tonsillectomy), physical examinations at the work-place or for purposes of insurance, and school or sports physical examinations, during which routine urinalysis is often performed to help ascertain the onset of kidney disease (proteinuria or microhematuria). Once it has been determined that the elevated serum creatinine level represents CKD, an effective approach is needed for identifying why such an increase occurred.\n\n【83】TYPES OF RENAL FAILURE\n----------------------\n\n【84】The first task in evaluating the patient with an elevated creatinine level is to categorize the patient's clinical presentation as 1 of 3 possible types of renal failure: postrenal failure, prerenal azotemia, or intrinsic renal failure.\n\n【85】### Postrenal Failure\n\n【86】The astute clinician will always start with this mechanism of renal failure because it may be the most reversible form of renal failure and should never go undiagnosed. The first and most common type of postrenal failure is _obstructive uropathy_ . Obstructive uropathy can be caused by _intrinsic_ obstruction of urinary flow (eg, stone, tumor, blood clot, or papillary necrosis) or by _extrinsic_ obstruction (eg, postoperative, prostatic hypertrophy, retroperitoneal fibrosis, retroperitoneal tumor \\[lymphoma or metastatic disease\\]). The second and much less common form of postrenal failure is _renal vein thrombosis._\n\n【87】无关删除-2:<u>*   Wysokinski WE\n*   Gosk-Bierska I\n*   Greene EL\n*   Grill D\n*   Wiste H\n*   McBane II, RD</u>\n\n【88】Clinical characteristics and long-term follow-up of patients with renal vein thrombosis.\n\n【89】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Kidney Dis._ 2008; 51 : 224-232</u></u>\n\n【90】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (55)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【91】Renal vein thrombosis can present as acute kidney failure with flank pain and gross hematuria. Renal vein thrombosis may also present as a chronic condition without the dramatic acute symptoms, often in the setting of glomerulonephritis. In adults, it usually occurs in association with a coagulopathy from an acute illness, such as metastatic malignancy or acute glomerulonephritis. Renal vein thrombosis is more common in children than adults and is associated with diseases that cause volume contraction.\n\n【92】### Prerenal Azotemia\n\n【93】Prerenal azotemia, another of the reversible forms of CKD, results from a reduction in perfusion to the kidney that leads to renal dysfunction and an elevated serum creatinine level. It can be characterized by events such as acute renal artery embolism, dissection, and thrombosis; however, it is more commonly associated with other causes of decreases in effective circulating volume 删除4:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. In many patients with CKD, a prerenal component presents as a furtherincrease in serum creatinine levels from previous baseline values. History and physical examination are critical for identifying prerenal azotemia. The clinician should seek evidence in the patient's history of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, new use or increased dose of diuretics, unexpected resolution of long-standing edema, weight loss, or orthostatic symptoms. During the examination, lying and standing blood pressure and pulse are the most important tools to evaluate for extracellular volume depletion. Chronic heart failure, liver disease, and the nephrotic syndrome have the appearance of volume overload (eg, edema, rales, abdominal fluid wave), yet the kidney behaves as if there were volume depletion, potentially resulting in an elevated serum creatinine level.\n\n【94】TABLE 1 Causes of Prerenal Azotemia\n\n| Low cardiac outputAcute myocardial infarctionChronic heart failureValvular heart diseaseDecreased plasma volumeDiarrheaVomitingSweatingNasogastric suctionBurnsDiureticsDecreased hemoglobin levelsBleedingEndocrine dysfunctionUncontrolled diabetes mellitus (polyuria)Diabetes insipidusAddison diseaseRenal dysfunctionSalt-wasting nephropathyVasodilationSepsis syndromeEndotoxemia |\n| --- |\n\n【96】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【97】A number of urinary markers, among which fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is the most prominent, have been proposed for identifying the patient with _oliguric_ prerenal azotemia.\n\n【98】无关删除-2:<u>*   Espinel CH</u>\n\n【99】The FENa test: use in the differential diagnosis of acute renal failure.\n\n【100】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 1976; 236 : 579-581</u></u>\n\n【101】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (154)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【102】However, in some circumstances, FENa may be falsely low, suggesting prerenal azotemia, when it is not the cause of the elevated serum creatinine level.

Other laboratory findings that may aid in the diagnosis of prerenal azotemia include elevated levels of serum uric acid and serum calcium and an increase in the ratio of blood urea nitrogen to serum creatinine to more than 20.\n\n【108】### Intrinsic Renal Failure\n\n【109】The third and final cause of an elevated serum creatinine level involves disease of the renal tissue itself. There are 3 types of tissue in the kidney: glomerular tissue (primary glomerular disease; secondary glomerular diseases due to other conditions \\[eg, systemic vasculitis, diabetes, hypertension, amyloidosis\\]); vascular tissue, which may be affected by systemic vasculitides, atheroemboli, and thromboemboli; and interstitial tissues, which can be damaged by sickle cell anemia, chronic analgesic use, and certain medications (eg, antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, NSAIDs).\n\n【110】As Table 2 shows, one can begin to identify which type of renal parenchymal problem is present with 4 pieces of simple information: findings on urine microscopy, results of a 24-hour protein excretion test, presence of hypertension, and time course of the elevated serum creatinine level.\n\n【111】TABLE 2 Evaluation of Intrinsic Renal Failure\n\n【112】OFB = oval fat body; RBC = red blood cell.\n\n|  | Glomerular | Vascular | Interstitial |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Urinalysis | RBC cast, OFB ; fatty cast | RBC cast | None |\n| 24-h protein excretion (g/d/1.73m 2 ) | \\>3.5 | 1-5 | <2 |\n| Hypertension | 50% | 75% | Rare |\n| Rate of increase in serum creatinine level | 5-10 y | <1 y | \\>15-20 y |\n\n【114】a OFB = oval fat body; RBC = red blood cell.\n\n【115】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【116】**Urine Microscopy.** Urine microscopy, the “poor man's renal biopsy,” provides valuable information only if the urine specimen is fresh (<20 minutes from voiding) and is analyzed by a physician (ie, a nephrologist) who is able to recognize red blood cell (RBC) casts. At any clinical laboratory, urine samples are analyzed in batch form; by the time a technician looks at the specimen, the cast will have degraded and be undetectable. The presence of more than 25 dysmorphic RBCs is a common surrogate for RBC casts. Red blood cells that have traversed the glomerular basement membrane to reach the urinary space (glomerulonephritis) will have a distorted appearance because of that transit. In contrast, RBCs entering the urine from other parts of the urinary tract will not be distorted and so will be unimorphic. Although the use of this surrogate is accepted practice, careful evaluation shows that dysmorphic RBCs are no more suggestive of glomerulonephritis than is plain hematuria in the presence of substantial proteinuria.\n\n【117】无关删除-2:<u>*   Pollock C\n*   Liu PL\n*   Gyory AZ\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【118】Dysmorphism of urinary red blood cells—value in diagnosis.\n\n【119】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Kidney Int._ 1989; 36 : 1045-1049</u></u>\n\n【120】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (69)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【121】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ward JF\n*   Kaplan GW\n*   Mevorach R\n*   Stock JA\n*   Cilento Jr, BG</u>\n\n【122】Refined microscopic urinalysis for red blood cell morphology in the evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in a pediatric population.\n\n【123】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Urol._ 1998; 160 : 1492-1495</u></u>\n\n【124】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (14)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【125】This point is critical because urinary microscopy aids identification of the type of renal disease only by showing whether RBC casts (nephritis) or oval fat bodies, fatty casts, and free fat (nephrosis) are present.

All other findings of urine microscopy—eg, ropey casts, hyaline casts, waxy casts, renal tubular epithelial cells—are nonspecific reflectors of renal disease and are of no help to the clinician in determining the specific cause of CKD.\n\n【126】**24-Hour Urinary Protein Excretion Test.** By definition, 24-hour urinary protein excretion in patients with glomerular disease (eg, nephrotic syndrome) is at least 3.5 g/d per 1.73 m  but can be much higher. Although substantial proteinuria (1-5 g/d per 1.73 m  ) is often associated with vasculitis, proteinuria is more pronounced in primarily glomerular forms of renal disease. Interstitial renal disease usually presents with little or no proteinuria; however, up to 2 g of urinary protein, primarily tubular or Tamm-Horsfall protein, may be excreted daily.\n\n【127】**Hypertension.** Hypertension, especially when it occurs early in the course of renal failure, can be useful in evaluating intrinsic forms of kidney disease. Most patients with vasculitis of the kidney will have hypertension, often severe. Early in the disease process, patients with glomerulonephritis are slightly less likely to be hypertensive than those with vasculitis. Patients with interstitial forms of renal disease develop hypertension only as they near end-stage renal disease.\n\n【128】**Time Course of Increase in Serum Creatinine Level.** When available, the time course of the increase in the serum creatinine level is very helpful in identifying the type of renal disease causing its elevation. When left untreated, vasculitis of the kidney and diseases such as Goodpasture syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, and lupus vasculitis rapidly progress to renal failure, reaching end stage or requiring dialytic support within weeks or months of the beginning of the disease. Although untreated glomerulonephritis may have a rapid course, renal failure usually develops more slowly, with low levels of GFR reached in a period of 2 to 10 years. Interstitial renal disease has a more indolent course, reaching low levels of GFR only after 10 to 20 years. However, a rapidly increasing serum creatinine level is possible with allergic interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis.\n\n【129】EVALUATION OF THE PATIENT\n-------------------------\n\n【130】### History\n\n【131】In taking the history of a patient with CKD, the clinician should attempt to determine when the onset of proteinuria and hypertension occurred and whether previous serum creatinine tests have been performed. Patients should also be questioned regarding voiding symptoms, such as hesitancy, decreased stream strength, or intermittent large and small voiding amounts, because these symptoms suggest obstructive uropathy. Every patient with an elevated serum creatinine level should be asked if they have a history of diabetes, arthritis, or medication exposure. Almost all NSAIDs, including over-the-counter forms and almost all antibiotics, have been reported to cause renal failure in at least 1 case report.\n\n【132】无关删除-2:<u>*   Perazella MA</u>\n\n【133】Drug-induced renal failure: update on new medications and unique mechanisms of nephrotoxicity.\n\n【134】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Med Sci._ 2003; 325 : 349-362</u></u>\n\n【135】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (182)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【136】In fact, no NSAID can be declared “safe” with regard to renal failure.

First, to test for prerenal azotemia, lying and standing blood pressure and pulse should be recorded. Funduscopic examination for findings of hypertension (Keith-Wagener-Barker\n\n【154】无关删除-2:<u>*   Wagener HP\n*   Keith NM</u>\n\n【155】Diffuse arteriolar disease with hypertension and the associated retinal lesions.\n\n【156】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Medicine._ 1939; 18 : 317-430</u></u>\n\n【157】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (15)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【158】) and diabetic changes should be performed.

Although commonly performed, these tests only rarely reveal a systemic disease thought to be present without the serologic evidence, and even positive serologic findings do not obviate the need for renal biopsy.\n\n【167】无关删除-2:<u>*   Howard AD\n*   Moore Jr, J\n*   Gouge SF\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【168】Routine serologic tests in the differential diagnosis of the adult nephrotic syndrome.\n\n【169】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Kidney Dis._ 1990; 15 : 24-30</u></u>\n\n【170】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (6)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【171】However, positive serologic findings may make physicians more comfortable in recommending a renal biopsy. Although most renal biopsies are without incident, 50% of the patient's GFR could be lost if refractory bleeding requires nephrectomy.\n\n【172】### Radiography\n\n【173】Renal ultrasonography with arterial Doppler studies is the single most important test for evaluating all patients with an elevated creatinine level. First and most importantly, it is the least invasive method for identifying obstructive uropathy, the most reversible form of renal failure. Second, it provides information on renal size. If the kidneys are smaller than 7 to 8 cm, then the likelihood of a reversible form of renal failure is extremely low. Large kidneys (>12-13 cm) have a specific differential diagnosis, including reversible conditions such as acute glomerulonephritis, infiltrative diseases of the kidney (leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, multiple myeloma, and amyloidosis), andconditions without reversibility such as diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease, and obstruction. The Doppler component helps identify patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis, whose renal function would benefit from successful angioplasty.\n\n【174】PRESERVING RENAL FUNCTION IN CKD\n--------------------------------\n\n【175】Regardless of the renal process, patients with renal failure can and should be managed aggressively with a 9-pronged approach 删除4:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. If primary care physicians actively pursue this approach, they can substantially reduce the rate of GFR decline and delay the need for dialysis or renal transplant. Aggressive blood pressure reduction has always been shown to protect the kidney from further damage. The use of antihypertensive agents with antiproteinuric properties is also important but does _not_ supersede the need to reach goal blood pressure. When blood pressure is well controlled, additional therapy (adding an angiotensin receptor blocker to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or increasing doses of either) with resultant reduction in quantitative proteinuria has also been found to benefit patients with CKD and proteinuric renal disease.\n\n【176】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hollenberg NK</u>\n\n【177】Treatment of the patient with diabetes mellitus and risk of nephropathy: what do we know, and what do we need to learn?\n\n【178】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Intern Med._ 2004; 164 : 125-130</u></u>\n\n【179】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (18)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【180】Good diabetes control can slow the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy.

If the renal failure becomes chronic, the primary care physician can help the patient maintain long-term renal function by encouraging adherence to the 9-pronged treatment approach.\n\n【213】CME Materials\n-------------\n\n【214】无关删除-2:<u>*   Download .pdf (.01 MB)\n\n【215】    Help with pdf files</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Splenectomy or diseases associated with functional hyposplenia were scored for all patients. Vaccination status, clinical features, and outcome of patients with a history of splenectomy or functional hyposplenia were analyzed and compared with patients with normal spleen function.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Twenty-four of 965 patients (2.5%) had an abnormal splenic function: 16 had a history of splenectomy and 8 had functional hyposplenia. All patients had pneumococcal meningitis. Pre-illness vaccination status could be retrieved for 19 of 21 patients (90%), and only 6 patients (32%) were adequately vaccinated against pneumococci. Pneumococcal serotype was known in 21 patients; 52% of pneumococcal isolates had a serotype included in the 23-valent vaccine. Vaccine failure occurred in 3 patients. Splenectomized patients more often presented with signs of septic shock compared with patients with a normal spleen (63% vs 24%; _P_ \\=.02). Outcome was unfavorable in 14 patients (58%), and 6 patients died (25%).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Splenectomy or functional hyposplenia is an uncommon risk factor for bacterial meningitis but results in a high rate of mortality and unfavorable outcome.

{"seq_id": "839d1ce4-0191-48d3-9d46-9f7fa66152f4", "title": "Face transplant", "text": "【0】Face transplant\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】A face transplant may be a treatment option for some people with severe damage to their faces or a visible difference in the appearance of their faces. A face transplant replaces all or part of the face with donor tissue from someone who has died.\n\n【2】A face transplant is a complex operation that takes months of planning and multiple surgical teams. The procedure is performed in only a few transplant centers worldwide. Each face transplant candidate is carefully evaluated to help ensure the best possible results in appearance and function.\n\n【3】A face transplant may enhance your life, but it is a high-risk procedure. You and your transplant team can't predict exactly how you will look and how your immune system will respond to the new face. You'll need to take special medications (immunosuppressants) for the rest of your life to reduce the risk of your body rejecting the transplanted face.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】A face transplant is performed to try to improve the quality of life for someone who has experienced severe trauma, burns, disease or birth defects that affected his or her face. It is intended to enhance both appearance and functional abilities, such as chewing, swallowing, talking and breathing through the nose. Some people seek this surgery to reduce the social isolation they experience while living with visible differences in their faces.\n\n【6】Risks\n-----\n\n【7】A face transplant is a challenging procedure. It's fairly new and very complex. Since the first face transplant in 2005, more than 40 people are known to have undergone the surgery, ranging in age from 19 to 60. Several have died because of an infection or rejection.\n\n【8】Complications can result from:\n\n【9】*   The surgery\n*   The body's rejection of the transplant tissue\n*   Side effects of immunosuppressant drugs\n\n【10】Further surgeries or hospital visits may be needed to treat complications.\n\n【11】### Surgical risks\n\n【12】A face transplant is a complicated and lengthy procedure. You could be in surgery for 10 or more hours. Surgical and post-surgical risks can be life-threatening. They include blood loss, blood clots and infection.\n\n【13】### Rejection risks\n\n【14】Your body's immune system may reject the new face and other donor tissues. You could lose part or all of your new face and some function.\n\n【15】You may experience more than one episode of rejection. To control a rejection response, you may need to go to the hospital for an intensive IV dose of anti-rejection drugs. Your health care practitioner may switch the type of anti-rejection drugs you take. Rarely, tissue rejection requires a new transplantation. Rejection that isn't controlled could cause death.\n\n【16】You'll need to learn the symptoms of rejection so that you can take timely and appropriate action. They include swelling and a change in the color of your skin.\n\n【17】### Immunosuppressant risks\n\n【18】The anti-rejection drugs (immunosuppressants) you'll need to take daily for the rest of your life will weaken your immune system. This helps prevent tissue rejection, but it also puts you at risk of a variety of infections. Immunosuppressant drugs are also linked to an increased risk of kidney damage, cancer, diabetes and other serious conditions.\n\n【19】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【20】### Evaluating whether to have a face transplant\n\n【21】Before you receive a face transplant, reflect on these questions:\n\n【22】*   Have you weighed the risks of receiving a face transplant?\n*   Can you be fully committed to intense, lifelong follow-up care?\n*   What benefits do you hope to gain from this surgery?\n*   Have you tried or talked with your health care providers about other treatment options, such as a facial prosthesis or conventional facial reconstruction?\n\n【23】You'll be evaluated by a transplant team. Candidates must:\n\n【24】*   Have severe damage or changes to the face\n*   Have a loss of facial function, such as chewing or talking\n*   Undergo a comprehensive exam that may include X-rays, CT and MRI scans, blood tests, and other measures of physical health\n*   Undergo an evaluation of mental and emotional health, coping skills, family and social support, expectations, communication skills, and ability to manage post-transplant care\n*   Have no history of chronic nerve conditions\n*   Not be pregnant\n*   Have no serious medical problems, such as diabetes, heart disease or untreated cancer\n*   Have had no recent infections\n*   Be nonsmokers\n*   Not abuse alcohol or illegal drugs\n*   Complete a financial evaluation of post-transplant care expenses with a member of the transplant team\n\n【25】### Getting ready for your face transplant\n\n【26】Once you're approved for a face transplant, you'll be placed on a waiting list for a donor face. When matching you with a donor face for a transplant, surgeons consider:\n\n【27】*   Blood type\n*   Tissue type\n*   Skin color\n*   Comparable ages of donor and recipient\n*   Compatible facial size of donor and recipient\n\n【28】Your wait time can be unpredictable because it's usually not known when a donor face that matches your needs will become available.\n\n【29】In the meantime, you can prepare by:\n\n【30】*   **Undergoing pre-surgery evaluations.** You'll need to visit the transplant center periodically so that your transplant team can do blood tests and evaluate whether you're ready for a transplant.\n*   **Arranging for travel and lodging.** Your transplant team will ask you to stay at a location that allows you to arrive at the hospital within a short time once you are contacted about your transplant date. After your surgery, you'll likely be asked to stay near your transplant center for 2 to 3 months. Your transplant team may have recommendations for long-term lodging if you need it.\n*   **Staying in touch with your transplant team.** Let your transplant team know immediately if you have any changes to your medical care, such as starting new medications, having a blood transfusion or receiving a diagnosis of a chronic medical condition.\n\n【31】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【32】### During surgery\n\n【33】The extent and length of your surgery depends on how much of the face and its underlying structures are involved. Your surgical team may transplant various tissues from the donor, such as skin, fat, muscles, tendons, cartilage, bone, nerves and blood vessels.\n\n【34】The transplant will take 10 to 30 hours. Your surgical team will include plastic surgeons highly skilled in microsurgery and craniofacial surgery, anesthesiologists, ophthalmologists, surgical nurses, surgical technicians, imaging experts, and others.\n\n【35】### After surgery\n\n【36】After surgery, you'll likely spend 4 to 8 weeks in the hospital. During this time, you will:\n\n【37】*   Be fed through a tube\n*   Begin taking your daily doses of immunosuppressant drugs to prevent your body from rejecting the transplanted tissue\n*   Be given medications to manage pain\n*   Begin physical therapy and speech therapy, as you are able\n\n【38】Your transplant team — including physicians, a transplant coordinator, social worker, therapist, pharmacists, dietitians and others — will work with you to develop a post-surgery treatment plan and provide the care you need.\n\n【39】### Immunosuppressants\n\n【40】Your daily post-surgical routine will include taking immunosuppressant medications and managing the side effects. These drugs can help stop your immune system from rejecting the donor face.\n\n【41】You can decrease the risk of rejection and medication side effects by:\n\n【42】*   Committing to regularly taking immunosuppressant medications for the rest of your life unless directed to stop by a health care provider\n*   Making regular appointments with your transplant team for blood tests and checkups\n*   Contacting your transplant team or your health care provider if you notice that you're becoming ill with an infection or tissue rejection\n\n【43】Results\n-------\n\n【44】You and your transplant team can't know for sure what the results of your surgery will be. Each previous face transplant recipient has had different experiences with the post-surgical appearance and function.\n\n【45】Most face transplant recipients experienced improved ability to smell, eat, drink, talk, smile and make other facial expressions. Some regained the ability to feel a light touch on the face. Because this surgical technique is still fairly new, the long-term results for face transplant recipients are yet to be determined.\n\n【46】Your results will be affected by:\n\n【47】*   The extent of the operation\n*   Your body's response to the new tissue\n*   Nonphysical aspects of your recovery, such as your emotional and psychological response to living with a new face\n\n【48】You will increase your chance of a positive outcome by carefully following your post-transplant care plan and seeking the support of friends, family and your transplant team.\n\n【49】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "48fc7df5-ec7e-46c3-a36f-b96b3b569bd5", "title": "Combination birth control pills", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Combination birth control pills, also known as the pill, are oral contraceptives that contain estrogen and a progestin. Oral contraceptives are medicines used to prevent pregnancy. They can have other benefits too.\n\n【2】Combination birth control pills keep you from ovulating. This means that the pills keep your ovaries from releasing an egg. They also cause changes to the mucus in the opening of the uterus, called the cervix, and to the lining of the uterus, called the endometrium. These changes keep sperm from joining the egg.\n\n【3】Different types of combination birth control pills contain different doses of estrogen and progestin. Continuous-dosing or extended-cycle pills allow you to reduce the number of periods you have each year.\n\n【4】If you want to use combination birth control pills, your health care provider can help you decide which type is right for you.\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】Combination birth control pills are a reliable form of contraception that's easily reversed. Fertility can return almost right away after you stop taking the pills.\n\n【7】Along with preventing pregnancy, other benefits of these pills include:\n\n【8】*   Lower risk of cancer of the ovaries and the lining of the uterus, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cysts, and noncancerous breast disease\n*   Improvement in acne and excessive face and body hair\n*   Less severe menstrual cramps, called dysmenorrhea\n*   Reduced androgen production caused by polycystic ovary syndrome\n*   Decreased heavy menstrual bleeding from uterine fibroids and other causes, as well as a decrease in iron deficiency anemia related to blood loss\n*   Treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS)\n*   Shorter, lighter periods on an expected schedule or, for some types of combination pills, fewer periods yearly\n*   Better control of the monthly cycle and fewer hot flashes during the time when the body makes the natural transition to menopause, called perimenopause\n\n【9】Combination birth control pills come in different mixtures of active and inactive pills, including:\n\n【10】*   **Conventional pack.** One common type contains 21 active pills and seven inactive pills. Inactive pills do not contain hormones. Formulations containing 24 active pills and four inactive pills, known as a shortened pill-free interval, also are available. Some newer pills may contain only two inactive pills.\n\n【11】    You take a pill every day and start a new pack when you finish the old one. Packs usually contain 28 days of pills. Bleeding may occur every month during the time when you take the inactive pills that are at the end of each pack.\n\n【12】*   **Extended-cycle pack.** These packs typically contain 84 active pills and seven inactive pills. Bleeding generally occurs only four times a year during the seven days you take the inactive pills.\n*   **Continuous-dosing pack.** A 365-day pill also is available. You take this pill every day at the same time. For some people, periods stop altogether. For others, periods become significantly lighter. You do not take any inactive pills.\n\n【13】By decreasing or stopping periods, continuous-dosing and extended-cycle pills might have other benefits. These can include:\n\n【14】*   Preventing and treating heavy bleeding related to uterine fibroids.\n*   Preventing menstrual migraines.\n*   Lessening the worsening effect menstruation can have on certain conditions, including seizures.\n*   Relieving pain related to endometriosis.\n\n【15】Combination birth control pills aren't the best choice for everyone. Your health care provider might suggest that you use another form of birth control if you:\n\n【16】*   Are in the first month of breastfeeding or first few weeks after giving birth.\n*   Are older than 35 and smoke.\n*   Have poorly controlled high blood pressure.\n*   Have a history of or current blood clots, including in your legs — called deep vein thrombosis — or in your lungs — called pulmonary embolism.\n*   Have a history of stroke or heart disease.\n*   Have a history of breast cancer.\n*   Have migraine with aura.\n*   Have diabetes-related complications, such as kidney disease, eye disease or problems with nerve function.\n*   Have certain liver and gallbladder diseases.\n*   Have unexplained uterine bleeding.\n*   Will be confined to bed for an extended period of time after surgery or an injury or during a serious illness.\n\n【17】Risks\n-----\n\n【18】### Pregnancy\n\n【19】Based on typical use, about 9 out of 100 people taking combination birth control pills will get pregnant in the first year of use. With perfect use as directed, the pregnancy rate is less than 1 in 100 people every year.\n\n【20】Although taking combination birth control pills during early pregnancy doesn't increase the risk of birth defects, it's best to stop using the pills as soon as you suspect you're pregnant.\n\n【21】### Sexually transmitted infections\n\n【22】Combination birth control pills won't protect you from sexually transmitted infections. To help protect against these infections, practice safer sex.\n\n【23】### Side effects\n\n【24】Combination birth control pills can cause side effects such as:\n\n【25】*   Bleeding while taking the active pills — called breakthrough bleeding or spotting — that is more common with continuous-dosing or extended-cycle pills.\n*   Breast tenderness.\n*   Headaches.\n*   Nausea.\n*   Bloating.\n*   Increased blood pressure.\n\n【26】Some side effects — including nausea, headaches, breast tenderness, bloating and breakthrough bleeding — might get better after you've taken the pill for a while.\n\n【27】### Possible risks\n\n【28】Combination birth control pills increase the risk of certain conditions, which can be serious. They include:\n\n【29】*   Blood clots in the legs, called deep vein thrombosis.\n*   Heart attack and stroke, especially if you smoke.\n*   Liver disorders.\n\n【30】### When to call your doctor\n\n【31】Contact your health care provider as soon as possible if you're taking combination birth control pills and have:\n\n【32】*   Belly pain, cramping and vomiting.\n*   Chest pain, coughing and trouble breathing.\n*   New or worsening headaches, difficulty speaking, confusion, blurred vision, or loss of vision.\n*   Severe pain, change in skin color and swelling in a leg.\n*   Depression or severe mood swings.\n*   Jaundice, which is yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes.\n*   Two missed periods or symptoms of pregnancy.\n\n【33】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【34】You'll need to request a prescription for combination birth control pills from your health care provider. Your provider measures your blood pressure, checks your weight, and talks with you about your health and any medicines you're taking.\n\n【35】Your provider also asks about your concerns and what you would like from your birth control to help figure out which combination birth control pill is right for you. Health care providers often recommend pills with the lowest dose of hormones that will help prevent pregnancy, give you important benefits other than birth control and cause the fewest side effects.\n\n【36】Although the amount of estrogen in combination pills can be as low as 10 micrograms (mcg) of ethinyl estradiol, most pills contain about 20 to 35 mcg. Low-dose pills can result in more breakthrough bleeding than can pills with more estrogen. Some combined oral contraceptives contain other types of estrogen.\n\n【37】Combination pills are grouped based on whether the dose of hormones stays the same or varies:\n\n【38】*   **Monophasic.** Each active pill contains the same amount of estrogen and progestin.\n*   **Biphasic.** Active pills contain two combinations of estrogen and progestin.\n*   **Triphasic.** Active pills contain three combinations of estrogen and progestin. In some types, the progestin content increases; in others, the progestin dose remains steady and the estrogen content increases.\n\n【39】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【40】To begin a combined oral contraceptive, talk to your health care provider about a starting date:\n\n【41】*   **Quick-start method.** You can take the first pill in the pack right away.\n*   **Sunday-start method.** You take your first pill on the first Sunday after your period starts.\n*   **First-day-start method.** You take your first pill on the first day of your next period.\n\n【42】With quick-start or Sunday-start methods, use a backup contraception method, such as a condom, for the first seven days you take combination birth control pills.\n\n【43】For the first-day-start method, no backup method of contraception is needed.\n\n【44】To use combination birth control pills:\n\n【45】*   **Pick a time to take the pill every day.** Combined oral contraceptives need to be taken every day to be effective. Following a routine might keep you from missing a pill and help you take the pill at the same time every day. For example, consider taking your pill when you brush your teeth in the morning.\n*   **Follow your health care provider's instructions carefully.** Birth control pills only work if you use them correctly, so make sure you understand the instructions. Because there are many different formulas of combined oral contraceptives, check with your health care provider about specific instructions for your pills.\n\n【46】    If you're using the conventional type of combination birth control pills and want to have regular periods, you will take all of the pills in your pack — the active and the inactive ones — and start a new pack the day after you finish your current one.\n\n【47】    If you want to avoid monthly periods, continuous-dosing or extended-dosing options reduce the number of periods in a year. Ask your health care provider about how to take the pills and how many active pill packs you take in a row.\n\n【48】*   **Know what to do when you miss pills.** If you miss one active pill, take it as soon as you remember — even if it means taking two active pills in the same day. Take the rest of the pack as usual. Use a backup method of contraception for seven days if you missed your pill by more than 12 hours.\n\n【49】    If you miss more than one active pill, take the last pill you missed right away. Take the rest of the pack as usual. Use a backup method of contraception for seven days. If you've had unprotected sex, you may consider emergency contraception.\n\n【50】*   **Know what to do if you lose or miss pills due to vomiting.** If you vomit within two hours after taking a combination birth control pill or have severe vomiting and diarrhea for two or more days and can't take the pills, follow the instructions in the same way you would if you missed one or more pills.\n*   **Don't take breaks between packs.** Always have your next pack ready before you finish your current pack.\n\n【51】Talk to your health care provider to decide if combination birth control pills are right for you. Also talk to your provider if you have any concerns or if you'd like to change to another method of birth control.\n\n【52】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

We describe here a case of a 30-year-old mother of 2 children who presented to the Department of Cardiology, Super Speciality Hospital, Nagpur, in November 2016 with symptoms of extrahepatic portal venous hypertension for around 4 years with multiple portosystemic collaterals. The major collateral pathways seen with IVC obstruction include the azygos-hemiazygos, internal and external mammary, lateral thoracic, and vertebral pathways. The superficial collateral pathways include the superficial epigastric vein, the superior epigastric vein, and the inferior epigastric vein, which were visible over the abdomen in this patient, as shown in the Figure , which are a diagnostic hallmark of IVC obstruction. On contrast invasive venogram, chronic total occlusion of the IVC just above the iliac vein extending to the intrahepatic part, with multiple cavernoma retrogradely filling the upper part of IVC above the liver, was seen as shown in the Supplemental Video . She was tested for hypercoagulopathy and was sent to the interventional radiologist for percutaneous angioplasty. However, for financial reasons the patient did not undergo angioplasty and was treated with intravenous heparin. Oral warfarin was prescribed on discharge.

Nubain\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Nalbuphine injection is used to relieve moderate to severe pain. It may also be given before and after a surgery or with a general anesthesia before an operation. It may also be used to relieve pain while giving birth.\n\n【6】Nalbuphine belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.\n\n【7】When a nalbuphine injection is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Solution\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of nalbuphine injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Nubain® in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney, liver, heart, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine.\n\n【19】No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of nalbuphine injection in geriatric patients.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below.

The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【38】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【39】A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. This medicine is given as a shot under your skin or into a muscle or a vein.\n\n【40】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【41】It is very important that your doctor check your progress while you are receiving this medicine. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to use it.\n\n【42】This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that can make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of the other medicines listed above while you are using this medicine.\n\n【43】Symptoms of an overdose include extreme dizziness or weakness, slow heartbeat or breathing, seizures, trouble breathing, and cold, clammy skin. Call your doctor right away if you notice these symptoms.\n\n【44】This medicine may cause sleep-related breathing problems (eg, sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoxemia). Your doctor may decrease your dose if you have sleep apnea (stop breathing for short periods during sleep) while using this medicine.\n\n【45】This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose.\n\n【46】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve dizziness or lightheadedness.\n\n【47】This medicine may make you dizzy, drowsy, or lightheaded.

To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.\n\n【49】Do not change your dose or suddenly stop using this medicine without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want to gradually reduce the amount of medicine given to you before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, such as abdominal or stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, nausea, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble with sleeping.\n\n【50】Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. This medicine may affect the results of certain medical tests.\n\n【51】Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.\n\n【52】Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn babies. Tell your doctor right away if your baby has an abnormal sleep pattern, diarrhea, a high-pitched cry, irritability, shakiness or tremors, weight loss, vomiting, or fails to gain weight.\n\n【53】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.

{"seq_id": "918be6f7-2bae-4f09-b536-af0e2e1284e5", "title": "Hydroxychloroquine (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Hydroxychloroquine (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Plaquenil\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Hydroxychloroquine is used to treat malaria. It is also used to prevent malaria infection in areas or regions where it is known that other medicines (eg, chloroquine) may not work. Hydroxychloroquine may also be used to treat coronavirus (COVID-19) in certain hospitalized patients.\n\n【6】Using this medicine alone or with other medicines (eg, azithromycin) may increase your risk of heart rhythm problems (eg, QT prolongation, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia). Hydroxychloroquine should only be used for COVID-19 in a hospital or during clinical trials. Do not take any medicine that contains hydroxychloroquine unless prescribed by your doctor.\n\n【7】Hydroxychloroquine belongs to a group of medicines known as antimalarials. It works by preventing or treating malaria, a red blood cell infection transmitted by the bite of a mosquito. However, this medicine is not used to treat severe or complicated malaria.\n\n【8】Hydroxychloroquine is used to treat discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus). It is also used to treat acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Tablet\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of hydroxychloroquine to prevent and treat malaria in children. However, use is not recommended in children weighing less than 31 kilograms (kg). Safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to treat lupus and arthritis have not been established in children.\n\n【18】### Geriatric\n\n【19】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of hydroxychloroquine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【29】*   Ampicillin\n*   Digoxin\n\n【30】### Other Interactions\n\n【31】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【32】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【33】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【34】*   Allergy to 4-aminoquinoline compounds (eg, chloroquine)—Should not be used in patients with this condition.\n\n【35】*   Blood or bone marrow problems or\n*   Diabetes or\n*   Eye or vision problems or\n*   Muscle problems or\n*   Nerve problems or\n*   Porphyria (blood disorder) or\n*   Psoriasis (skin disease) or\n*   Stomach or bowel problems–Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【36】*   Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency—May cause hemolytic anemia in patients with this condition.\n\n【37】*   Heart disease (eg, heart attack, heart failure) or\n*   Heart rhythm problems (eg, bradycardia, ventricular dysrhythmia), or history of or\n*   Hypokalemia (low potassium in the blood), uncorrected or\n*   Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium in the blood), uncorrected—Use with caution. May prolong the QT interval.\n\n【38】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of the slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【39】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【40】Take this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.\n\n【41】Swallow the tablet whole. Do not crush, break, or chew it. Take this medicine with meals or milk to lessen stomach upset, unless otherwise directed by your doctor.\n\n【42】Keep using this medicine for the full treatment time, even if you feel better after the first few doses. Your infection may not clear up if you stop using the medicine too soon.\n\n【43】For patients taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent malaria:\n\n【44】*   Your doctor may want you to start taking this medicine 2 weeks before you travel to an area where there is a chance of getting malaria. This will help you to see how you react to the medicine. Also, it will allow time for your doctor to change to another medicine if you have a reaction to this medicine.\n*   Also, you should keep taking this medicine while you are in the area and for 4 weeks after you leave the area. No medicine will protect you completely from malaria. However, to protect you as completely as possible, it is important to keep taking this medicine for the full time your doctor ordered. Also, if fever develops during your travels or within 2 months after you leave the area, check with your doctor immediately.\n\n【45】If you are also taking kaolin or antacids, take them at least 4 hours before or after using hydroxychloroquine.\n\n【46】### Dosing\n\n【47】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【48】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【49】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   For prevention of malaria:\n        *   Adults—400 mg once a week on the same day of each week starting 2 weeks before traveling to an area where malaria occurs, and continued for 4 weeks after leaving the area.\n        *   Children weighing 31 kilograms (kg) or more—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. At first, 6.5 mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight, not to exceed 400 mg, once weekly on the same day of the week starting 2 weeks before traveling to an area where malaria occurs, and continued for 4 weeks after leaving the area.\n        *   Children weighing less than 31 kg—Use is not recommended.\n    *   For treatment of malaria:\n        *   Adults—At first, 800 milligrams (mg) (4 tablets) taken as a single dose. Then, 400 mg taken 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the first dose.\n        *   Children weighing 31 kilograms (kg) or more—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. At first, 13 mg per kg of body weight taken as a single dose. Then, 6.5 mg per kg of body weight taken 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the first dose. However, dose is usually not more than 800 mg for the first dose and not more than 400 mg for the next doses.\n        *   Children weighing less than 31 kg—Use is not recommended.\n    *   For treatment of arthritis:\n        *   Adults—At first, 400 to 600 milligrams (mg) taken as a single dose or in two divided doses per day.

Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For treatment of lupus:\n        *   Adults—200 milligrams (mg) once a day or 400 mg taken once a day or in two divided doses.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【50】### Missed Dose\n\n【51】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【52】### Storage\n\n【53】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【54】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【55】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【56】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【57】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【58】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【59】Check with your doctor immediately if blurred vision, difficulty with reading, or any other change in vision occurs during or after treatment. Your doctor may want your eyes be checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).\n\n【60】Contact your doctor right away if you have any changes to your heart rhythm. You might feel dizzy or faint, or you might have a fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat. Make sure your doctor knows if you had a heart rhythm problem, including QT prolongation.\n\n【61】This medicine may cause muscle and nerve problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have muscle weakness, pain, or tenderness while using this medicine.\n\n【62】Hydroxychloroquine may cause some people to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors. It may also cause some people to have suicidal thoughts and tendencies, or to become more depressed. If you or your caregiver notice any of these side effects, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【63】This medicine may cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This is more common when this medicine is taken together with certain medicines. Low blood sugar must be treated before it causes you to pass out (unconsciousness). People feel different symptoms of low blood sugar. It is important that you learn which symptoms you usually have so you can treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat low blood sugar.\n\n【64】This medicine lowers the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed or get infections more easily. To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever, chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n\n【65】Serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis can occur during treatment with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have black, tarry stools, blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, chest pain, chills, cough, diarrhea, itching, joint or muscle pain, painful or difficult urination, red irritated eyes, red skin lesions, often with a purple center, severe acne or skin rash, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in the mouth or on the lips, swollen glands, unusual bleeding or bruising, or unusual tiredness or weakness while you are using this medicine.\n\n【66】If your symptoms do not improve within a few days (or a few weeks or months for arthritis), or if they become worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【67】Malaria is spread by the bites of certain kinds of infected female mosquitoes. If you are living in or will be traveling to an area where there is a chance of getting malaria, the following mosquito-control measures will help to prevent infection:\n\n【68】*   If possible, avoid going out between dusk and dawn because it is at these times that mosquitoes most commonly bite.\n*   Remain in air-conditioned or well-screened rooms to reduce contact with mosquitoes.\n*   Wear long-sleeved shirts or blouses and long trousers to protect your arms and legs, especially from dusk through dawn when mosquitoes are out.\n*   Apply insect repellant, preferably one containing DEET, to uncovered areas of the skin from dusk through dawn when mosquitoes are out.\n*   If possible, sleep in a screened or air-conditioned room or under mosquito netting preferably netting coated or soaked with pyrethrum, to avoid being bitten by malaria-carrying mosquitoes.\n*   Use mosquito coils or sprays to kill mosquitoes in living and sleeping quarters during evening and nighttime hours.\n\n【69】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines) and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【70】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【71】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【72】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【73】#### Incidence not known\n\n【74】1.

{"seq_id": "4a7372a4-21b6-45a0-a466-e8cab96fb335", "title": "Peritoneal dialysis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Peritoneal dialysis (per-ih-toe-NEE-ul die-AL-uh-sis) is a way to remove waste products from the blood. It's a treatment for kidney failure, a condition where the kidneys can't filter blood well enough any longer.\n\n【2】During peritoneal dialysis, a cleansing fluid flows through a tube into part of the stomach area, also called the abdomen. The inner lining of the abdomen, known as the peritoneum, acts as a filter and removes wastes from blood. After a set amount of time, the fluid with the filtered waste flows out of the abdomen and is thrown away.\n\n【3】Because peritoneal dialysis works inside the body, it's different from a more-common procedure to clean the blood called hemodialysis. That procedure filters blood outside the body in a machine.\n\n【4】Peritoneal dialysis treatments can be done at home, at work or while you travel. But it's not a treatment option for everyone with kidney failure. You need to be able to use your hands in a skillful way and care for yourself at home. Or you need a trusted caregiver to help you with this process.\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】You need dialysis if your kidneys no longer work well enough. Kidney damage often becomes worse over many years due to health issues such as:\n\n【7】*   Diabetes mellitus.\n*   High blood pressure.\n*   A group of diseases called glomerulonephritis, which damage the part of the kidneys that filter blood.\n*   Genetic diseases, including one called polycystic kidney disease that causes many cysts to form in the kidneys.\n*   Use of medicines that could damage the kidneys. This includes heavy or long-term use of pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve).\n\n【8】In hemodialysis, blood is removed from the body and filtered through a machine. Then the filtered blood is returned to the body. This procedure often is done in a health care setting, such as a dialysis center or hospital. Sometimes, it can be done at home.\n\n【9】Both types of dialysis can filter blood. But the benefits of peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis include:\n\n【10】*   **More independence and time for your daily routine.** Often, you can do peritoneal dialysis at home, work or in any other space that is clean and dry. This can be convenient if you have a job, travel or live far from a hemodialysis center.\n*   **A less restricted diet.** Peritoneal dialysis is done in a more continuous way than hemodialysis. Less potassium, sodium and fluid build up in the body as a result. This lets you have a more flexible diet than you could have on hemodialysis.\n*   **Longer-lasting kidney function.** With kidney failure, the kidneys lose most of their ability to function. But they still may be able to do a little bit of work for a time. People who use peritoneal dialysis might keep this leftover kidney function slightly longer than people who use hemodialysis.\n*   **No needles in a vein.** Before you start peritoneal dialysis, a catheter tube is placed in your belly with surgery. Cleansing dialysis fluid enters and exits your body through this tube once you begin treatment. But with hemodialysis, needles need to be placed in a vein at the start of each treatment so the blood can be cleaned outside the body.\n\n【11】Talk with your care team about which type of dialysis might be best for you. Factors to think about include your:\n\n【12】*   Kidney function.\n*   Overall health.\n*   Personal preferences.\n*   Home situation.\n*   Lifestyle.\n\n【13】Peritoneal dialysis may be the better choice if you:\n\n【14】*   Have trouble coping with side effects that may happen during hemodialysis. These include muscle cramps or a sudden drop in blood pressure.\n*   Want a treatment that's less likely to get in the way of your daily routine.\n*   Want to work or travel more easily.\n*   Have some leftover kidney function.\n\n【15】Peritoneal dialysis might not work if you have:\n\n【16】*   Scars in your abdomen from past surgeries.\n*   A large area of weakened muscle in the abdomen, called a hernia.\n*   Trouble caring for yourself, or a lack of caregiving support.\n*   Some conditions that affect the digestive tract, such as inflammatory bowel disease or frequent bouts of diverticulitis.\n\n【17】In time, it's also likely that people using peritoneal dialysis will lose enough kidney function to need hemodialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\n【18】Risks\n-----\n\n【19】Complications of peritoneal dialysis can include:\n\n【20】*   **Infections.** An infection of the abdomen's inner lining is called peritonitis. This is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis. An infection also can start at the site where the catheter is placed to carry the cleansing fluid, called dialysate, into and out of the abdomen. The risk of infection is greater if the person doing the dialysis isn't well trained.\n\n【21】    To lower the risk of an infection, wash your hands with soap and warm water before you touch your catheter. Each day, clean the area where the tube goes into your body — ask your health care provider which cleanser to use. Keep the catheter dry except during showers. Also, wear a surgical mask over your nose and mouth while you drain and refill the cleansing fluid.\n\n【22】*   **Weight gain.** Dialysate contains sugar called dextrose. If your body absorbs some of this fluid, it might cause you to take in hundreds of extra calories daily, leading to weight gain. The extra calories also can cause high blood sugar, especially if you have diabetes.\n*   **Hernia.** Holding fluid in the body for long amounts of time may strain the muscles of the abdomen.\n*   **Treatment becomes less effective.** Peritoneal dialysis can stop working after several years. You may need to switch to hemodialysis.\n\n【23】If you have peritoneal dialysis, you'll need to stay away from:\n\n【24】*   Certain medicines that can damage the kidneys, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n*   Soaking in a bath or hot tub. Or swimming in a pool without chlorine, a lake, pond or river. These things raise the risk of infection.\n\n【25】    It's fine to take a daily shower. It's also okay to swim in a pool with chlorine once the site where your catheter comes out of your skin is completely healed. Dry this area and change into dry clothes right after you swim.\n\n【26】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【27】You'll need surgery to get a catheter placed in your stomach area, often near the bellybutton. The catheter is the tube that carries cleansing fluid in and out of your abdomen. The surgery is done using medicine that keeps you from feeling pain, called anesthesia.\n\n【28】After the tube is placed, your health care provider will probably recommend that you wait at least two weeks before you start peritoneal dialysis treatments. This gives the catheter site time to heal.\n\n【29】You'll also receive training on how to use the peritoneal dialysis equipment.\n\n【30】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【31】During peritoneal dialysis:\n\n【32】*   The cleansing fluid called dialysate flows into the abdomen. It stays there for a certain amount of time, often 4 to 6 hours. This is called the dwell time. Your health care provider decides how long it lasts.\n*   Dextrose sugar in the dialysate helps filter waste, chemicals and extra fluid in the blood. It filters these from tiny blood vessels in the lining of the abdomen.\n*   When the dwell time is over, dialysate — along with waste products drawn from your blood — drains into a sterile bag.\n\n【33】The process of filling and then draining your abdomen is called an exchange. Different types of peritoneal dialysis have different schedules of exchange. The two main types are:\n\n【34】*   Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).\n*   Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD).\n\n【35】### Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)\n\n【36】You fill your abdomen with dialysate, let it remain there for the dwell time, then drain the fluid. Gravity moves the fluid through the catheter and into and out of your abdomen.\n\n【37】With CAPD:\n\n【38】*   You may need 3 to 5 exchanges during the day and one with a longer dwell time while you sleep.\n*   You can do the exchanges at home, work or another clean, dry place.\n*   You're free to do your regular activities while the cleansing fluid is inside your body.\n\n【39】### Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD)\n\n【40】Another name for this is automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). This method uses a machine called an automated cycler. The machine does the exchanges for you at night while you sleep. It fills your abdomen with dialysate and lets it dwell there. Then it drains the fluid into a sterile bag that you empty in the morning.\n\n【41】With CCPD:\n\n【42】*   You must stay attached to the machine while it does exchanges for you at night.\n*   You aren't connected to the machine during the day. But in the morning, you might start one exchange with a dwell time that lasts the entire day. Follow your care team's directions.\n*   You might have a lower risk of the infection peritonitis. This is because you connect and disconnect to the dialysis equipment less often than you do with CAPD.\n\n【43】Your care team helps you choose the method of exchange that's best for you. It depends on your health, lifestyle and personal choices. Your care team might suggest certain changes to tailor the procedure for you.\n\n【44】Results\n-------\n\n【45】Many things affect how well peritoneal dialysis works at removing wastes and extra fluid from the blood. These factors include:\n\n【46】*   Your size.\n*   How quickly the inner lining of your abdomen filters waste.\n*   How much dialysis solution you use.\n*   The number of daily exchanges.\n*   Length of dwell times.\n*   The concentration of sugar in the dialysis solution.\n\n【47】To find out if your dialysis is removing enough waste from your body, you might need certain tests:\n\n【48】*   **Peritoneal equilibration test (PET).** This compares samples of your blood and your dialysis solution during an exchange. The results show whether waste toxins pass quickly or slowly from your blood into the dialysate. That information helps determine whether your dialysis would work better if the cleansing fluid stayed in your abdomen for a shorter or longer time.\n*   **Clearance test.** This checks a blood sample and a sample of used dialysis fluid for levels of a waste product called urea. The test helps find out how much urea is being removed from your blood during dialysis. If your body still produces urine, your care team also may take a urine sample to measure how much urea is in it.\n\n【49】If the test results show that your dialysis routine is not removing enough wastes, your care team might:\n\n【50】*   Increase the number of exchanges.\n*   Increase the amount of dialysate you use for each exchange.\n*   Use a dialysate with a higher concentration of the sugar dextrose.\n\n【51】You can get better dialysis results and boost your overall health by eating the right foods. These include foods that are high in protein and low in sodium and phosphorus. A health professional called a dietitian can make a meal plan just for you. Your diet will likely be based on your weight, personal preferences and how much kidney function you have left.

Sumner (1887-1955) and Wendell M. Stanley (1904-1971), for successfully purifying and crystallizing certain enzymes, thus allowing the chemical nature of these substances to be determined. Stanley crystallized and studied the tobacco mosaic virus, Sumner isolated and crystallized a protein he considered to be urease, and Northrop isolated and identified several enzymes.\n\n【2】Northrop was born on July 5, 1891, in Yonkers, NY. His father was a zoology instructor at Columbia University in New York City, and his mother was a botanist. Just before Northrop was born, his father was killed in a laboratory explosion, and his mother had to resume her position as a botany teacher at HunterCollege in New York City. Northrop attended elementary and secondary schools in New York and graduated from high school in 1908. After graduation, he entered Columbia University and received a BA degree in 1912, an MA degree in 1913, and a PhD degree with a major in chemistry in 1915.\n\n【3】After receiving his doctorate, Northrop was awarded a 1-year traveling fellowship that allowed him to work at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (New York City). Subsequently, he was appointed an assistant at the institute, and in 1917, he became an associate to the faculty.\n\n【4】During World War I (1914-1918), Northrop served as a captain in the US Chemical Warfare Service and conducted research on fermentation processes suitable for the industrial production of acetone and ethyl alcohol. After the war, he returned to the Rockefeller Institute and resumed his investigations on protein. This work led to the study of enzymes.\n\n【5】In 1920, enzymes were relatively mysterious substances, although they had been discovered in 1902 by German chemist Eduard Buchner (1860-1912), who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1907. Northrop's research on enzymes led to the crystallization of pepsin in 1930. In the course of this work, he established that pepsin is a protein, thus resolving the dispute about whether enzymes were proteins. Using the same chemical methods, he also helped to isolate and prepare in crystalline form the inactive precursor of pepsin pepsinogen (which is converted to the active enzyme through a reaction with hydrochloric acid in the stomach), the pancreatic digestive enzymes trypsin (1932) and chy-motrypsin (1935), and their inactive precursors trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. In 1938, he isolated the bacterial virus (bacteriophage) and proved that the virus was anucle-oprotein.\n\n【6】From 1916 to his retirement in 1961, Northrop was associated with the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City. During World War II (1939-1945), he served as a consultant and official investigator for the National Defense Research Committee. His wartime work led to the development of methods for the automatic detection of chemical weapons. From 1949 to 1958, he also served as a visiting professor of bacteriology and biophysics at the University of California at Berkeley and was resident biophysicist at the Donner Laboratory there from 1958 to 1959. Among his many scientific literary efforts was his 1939 book _Crystalline Enzymes._\n\n【7】On May 27, 1987, at the age of 95 years, Northrop died in Wickenburg, Ariz (about 45 miles northwest of Phoenix). He was honored on a stamp issued by Gabon in 1995.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【10】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/75.3.254</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>© 2000 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Hiccups are a form of myoclonus, as are the sudden jerks or \"sleep starts\" that you may feel just before falling asleep. These forms of myoclonus occur in healthy people and usually aren't serious.\n\n【2】Other forms of myoclonus may occur because of a nervous system disorder, such as epilepsy, a metabolic condition, or a reaction to a medicine.\n\n【3】Treating whatever condition causes myoclonus can help control symptoms. Sometimes the cause of myoclonus is unknown or can't be specifically treated. In these cases, the goal of treatment is to reduce the effects of myoclonus on quality of life.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】People with myoclonus often describe their symptoms as jerks, shakes or spasms that are:\n\n【6】*   Sudden\n*   Brief\n*   Involuntary\n*   Shock-like\n*   Variable in intensity and frequency\n*   Occurring in one part of the body or all over the body\n*   Sometimes severe enough to interfere with eating, speaking or walking\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】If your myoclonus symptoms become frequent and persistent, talk to your health care provider about a diagnosis and treatment options.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Myoclonus may be caused by a variety of underlying problems. It is commonly separated into different types based on what is causing it. The cause can help determine treatment.\n\n【11】### Physiological myoclonus\n\n【12】This type of myoclonus occurs in healthy people and rarely needs treatment. Examples include:\n\n【13】*   Hiccups.\n*   Sleep starts.\n*   Shakes or spasms due to anxiety or exercise.\n*   Infant muscle twitching during sleep or after a feeding.\n\n【14】### Essential myoclonus\n\n【15】Essential myoclonus occurs on its own, usually without other symptoms and without being related to any underlying illness. The cause of essential myoclonus is often unknown. In some cases, the cause is hereditary, meaning passed down in families.\n\n【16】### Epileptic myoclonus\n\n【17】This type of myoclonus occurs as part of an epileptic disorder.\n\n【18】### Symptomatic myoclonus\n\n【19】Symptomatic myoclonus results from an underlying medical condition. It is sometimes called secondary myoclonus. Examples include:\n\n【20】*   Head or spinal cord injury.\n*   Infection.\n*   Kidney or liver failure.\n*   Lipid storage disease.\n*   Chemical or drug poisoning.\n*   Prolonged oxygen deprivation.\n*   Medicine reaction.\n*   Autoimmune inflammatory conditions.\n*   Metabolic disorders.\n*   Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n【21】Nervous system conditions that result in secondary myoclonus include:\n\n【22】*   Stroke.\n*   Brain tumor.\n*   Huntington's disease.\n*   Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\n*   Alzheimer's disease.\n*   Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia.\n*   Corticobasal degeneration.\n*   Frontotemporal dementia.\n*   Multiple system atrophy.\n\n【23】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "2d33a550-b3ea-440f-a6e8-1a819eecf0cd", "title": "Asthma attack", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】During an asthma attack, also called an asthma exacerbation, the airways become swollen and inflamed. The muscles around the airways contract and the airways produce extra mucus, causing the breathing (bronchial) tubes to narrow.\n\n【2】During an attack, you may cough, wheeze and have trouble breathing. Symptoms of a minor asthma attack get better with prompt home treatment. A severe asthma attack that doesn't improve with home treatment can become a life-threatening emergency.\n\n【3】The key to stopping an asthma attack is recognizing and treating an asthma flare-up early. Follow the treatment plan you worked out with your doctor ahead of time. Your treatment plan should include what to do when your asthma starts getting worse, and how to deal with an asthma attack in progress.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Asthma attack signs and symptoms include:\n\n【6】*   Severe shortness of breath, chest tightness or pain, and coughing or wheezing\n*   Low peak expiratory flow (PEF) readings, if you use a peak flow meter\n*   Symptoms that fail to respond to use of a quick-acting (rescue) inhaler\n\n【7】Signs and symptoms of an asthma attack vary from person to person. Work with your doctor to identify your particular signs and symptoms of worsening asthma — and what to do when they occur.\n\n【8】If your asthma symptoms don't improve or get worse after you take medication as your doctor directed, you may need emergency treatment. Your doctor can help you learn to recognize an asthma emergency so that you'll know when to get help.\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】If your asthma flares up, immediately follow the treatment steps you and your doctor worked out in your written asthma plan. If your symptoms and peak expiratory flow (PEF) readings improve, home treatment may be all that's needed. If your symptoms don't improve with home treatment, you may need to seek emergency care.\n\n【11】When your asthma symptoms flare up, follow your written asthma plan's instructions for using your quick-acting (rescue) inhaler. PEF readings ranging from 51% to 79% of your personal best are a sign you need to use the quick-acting (rescue) medications prescribed by your doctor.\n\n【12】### Check asthma control steps with your doctor\n\n【13】Asthma can change over time, so you'll need periodic adjustments to your treatment plan to keep daily symptoms under control. If your asthma isn't well controlled, you're more likely to have an asthma attack. Lingering lung inflammation means your asthma could flare up at any time.\n\n【14】Go to all scheduled doctor's appointments. If you have regular asthma flare-ups, or if you have low peak flow readings or other signs your asthma isn't well controlled, make an appointment to see your doctor.\n\n【15】### When to seek emergency medical treatment\n\n【16】Seek medical attention right away if you have signs or symptoms of a serious asthma attack, which include:\n\n【17】*   Severe breathlessness or wheezing, especially at night or in the early morning\n*   The inability to speak more than short phrases due to shortness of breath\n*   Having to strain your chest muscles to breathe\n*   Low peak flow readings when you use a peak flow meter\n*   No improvement after using a quick-acting (rescue) inhaler\n\n【18】Causes\n------\n\n【19】An overly sensitive immune system makes your airways (bronchial tubes) become inflamed and swollen when you're exposed to certain triggers. Asthma triggers vary from person to person. Common asthma attack triggers include:\n\n【20】*   Pollen, pets, mold and dust mites\n*   Upper respiratory infections\n*   Tobacco smoke\n*   Inhaling cold, dry air\n*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n*   Stress\n\n【21】For many people, asthma symptoms get worse with respiratory infections, such as those caused by the common cold. Some people have asthma flare-ups caused by something in their work environment. Sometimes, there isn't an apparent cause for an asthma attack.\n\n【22】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【23】Anyone who has asthma is at risk of an asthma attack. You may be at increased risk of a serious asthma attack if:\n\n【24】*   You've had a severe asthma attack in the past\n*   You've previously been admitted to the hospital or had to go to the emergency room for asthma\n*   You've previously required intubation for an asthma attack\n*   You use more than two quick-acting (rescue) inhalers a month\n*   Your asthma attacks tend to sneak up on you before you notice symptoms have worsened\n*   You have other chronic health conditions, such as sinusitis or nasal polyps, or cardiovascular or chronic lung disease\n\n【25】Complications\n-------------\n\n【26】Asthma attacks can be serious. They can:\n\n【27】*   Interrupt everyday activities such as sleep, school, work and exercise, causing a significant impact on your quality of life — and can disrupt the lives of those around you.\n*   Send you to the emergency room, which can be stressful and costly.\n*   Lead to respiratory arrest and death.\n\n【28】Prevention\n----------\n\n【29】The best way to avoid an asthma attack is to make sure your asthma is well controlled in the first place. This means following a written asthma plan to track symptoms and adjust your medication.\n\n【30】While you may not be able to eliminate your risk of an asthma attack, you're less likely to have one if your current treatment keeps your asthma under control. Take your inhaled medications as prescribed in your written asthma plan.\n\n【31】These preventive medications treat the airway inflammation that causes asthma signs and symptoms. Taken on a daily basis, these medications can reduce or eliminate asthma flare-ups — and your need to use a quick-acting inhaler.\n\n【32】See your doctor if you're following your asthma action plan but still have frequent or bothersome symptoms or low peak flow readings. These are signs your asthma isn't well controlled, and you need to work with your doctor to change your treatment.\n\n【33】If your asthma symptoms flare up when you have a cold or the flu, take steps to avoid an asthma attack by watching your lung function and symptoms and adjusting your treatment as needed. Be sure to reduce exposure to your allergy triggers, and wear a face mask when exercising in cold weather.\n\n【34】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Information on self-reported PA (inactive, occasionally, monthly, weekly) and 11 chronic conditions diagnosed by a physician and reported by the study participants were recorded. Associations are summarized using hazard ratios (HRs) and Cox regression, after adjustment for covariates.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】At baseline, 43.2%, 37.5%, 14.4%, and 4.9% of participants had 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more chronic conditions, respectively. Mean follow-up was 8.9 years (median, 10.8 years; range, 0.02-11.28 years), with 1483 deaths. The HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality in participants with 1, 2, and 3 or more chronic conditions compared with those with none were 1.26 (1.05-1.39), 1.78 (1.51-2.09), and 2.27 (1.79-2.86), respectively.

Participants in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group were instructed to walk at approximately 50% of their peak aerobic capacity for walking, using a pedometer to verify that they took 8000 steps or more per day for 4 or more days per week. Those in the high-intensity interval walking training group, who were monitored by accelerometry, were instructed to repeat 5 or more sets of 3-minute low-intensity walking at 40% of peak aerobic capacity for walking followed by a 3-minute high-intensity walking above 70% of peak aerobic capacity for walking per day for 4 or more days per week. Isometric knee extension and flexion forces, peak aerobic capacity for cycling, and peak aerobic capacity for walking were all measured both before and after training.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】The targets were met by 9 of 25 men and 37 of 59 women in the no walking training group, by 8 of 16 men and 43 of 59 women in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group, and by 11 of 19 men and 31 of 68 women in the high-intensity interval walking training group. In the high-intensity interval walking training group, isometric knee extension increased by 13%, isometric knee flexion by 17%, peak aerobic capacity for cycling by 8%, and peak aerobic capacity for walking by 9% (all, _P_ <.001), all of which were significantly greater than the increases observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group (all, _P_ <.01). Moreover, the reduction in resting systolic blood pressure was higher for the high-intensity interval walking training group ( _P_ \\=.01).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】High-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.\n\n【8】1RM ( one repetition maximum ), BMI ( body mass index ), DBP ( diastolic blood pressure ), HR ( heart rate ), RPE ( rate of perceived exertion ), SBP ( systolic blood pressure ), VO2peak ( peak aerobic capacity )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "2ebc9c75-ffd3-47e7-9bea-43c55135a3a2", "title": "Heart valve surgery", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Heart valve surgery is a procedure to treat heart valve disease. Heart valve disease involves at least one of the four heart valves not working properly. Heart valves keep blood flowing in the correct direction through the heart.\n\n【2】The four heart valves are the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve and aortic valve. Each valve has flaps — called leaflets for the mitral and tricuspid valves and cusps for the aortic and pulmonary valves. These flaps should open and close once during each heartbeat. Valves that don't open or close properly disrupt blood flow through the heart to the body.\n\n【3】In heart valve surgery, a surgeon repairs or replaces the damaged or diseased heart valve or valves. Many surgical approaches can be used to repair or replace heart valves, including open-heart surgery or minimally invasive heart surgery.\n\n【4】The type of heart valve surgery needed depends on various factors, including your age, your health, and the type and severity of heart valve disease.\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】Heart valve surgery is done to treat heart valve disease. There are two basic types of heart valve problems:\n\n【7】*   A narrowing of a valve (stenosis)\n*   A leak in a valve that allows blood to flow backward (regurgitation)\n\n【8】You might need heart valve surgery if you have heart valve disease that is affecting your heart's ability to pump blood.\n\n【9】If you don't have signs or symptoms, or your condition is mild, your doctor might suggest regular monitoring of the heart valve disease. Lifestyle changes and medications might help manage symptoms.\n\n【10】Sometimes, doctors recommend heart valve surgery even for those who don't have symptoms. If you need heart surgery for another condition, doctors might perform heart valve repair or replacement at the same time. Together, you and your doctor should discuss whether heart valve surgery is right for you and if minimally invasive heart surgery is an option.\n\n【11】Eventually, your valve might need to be repaired or replaced. In some cases, doctors recommend heart valve repair or replacement even if you're not having symptoms. If you need heart surgery for another condition, doctors might repair or replace the affected heart valve at the same time.\n\n【12】Your doctor will discuss with you whether heart valve repair or replacement is more appropriate for your condition. Doctors often recommend heart valve repair when possible, as it preserves your heart valve and might preserve heart function. But sometimes valve replacement is necessary and the best option.\n\n【13】Doctors might also evaluate if you're a candidate for minimally invasive heart surgery. Your doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of each procedure.\n\n【14】If you need heart valve surgery, if possible, choose a medical center that has performed many heart valve surgeries.\n\n【15】Risks\n-----\n\n【16】Possible heart valve surgery risks include:\n\n【17】*   Bleeding\n*   Heart attack\n*   Infection\n*   Valve dysfunction affecting replaced valves\n*   Irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia)\n*   Stroke\n*   Death\n\n【18】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【19】Your doctor and treatment team will discuss your heart valve surgery with you and answer any questions. Before being admitted to the hospital for heart valve surgery, talk to your family about your hospital stay and discuss help you'll need when you return home.\n\n【20】### Food and medications\n\n【21】Before you have heart valve surgery, talk to your doctor about:\n\n【22】*   When you can take your regular medications and whether you can take them before your surgery\n*   Allergies or reactions you've had to medications\n*   When you should stop eating or drinking the night before the surgery\n\n【23】### Clothing and personal items\n\n【24】If you're having heart valve surgery, your treatment team might recommend that you bring several items to the hospital, including:\n\n【25】*   A list of your medications\n*   Eyeglasses, hearing aids or dentures\n*   Personal care items, such as a brush, a comb, shaving equipment and a toothbrush\n*   Loose, comfortable clothing\n*   A copy of your advance directive\n*   Items that help you relax, such as portable music players or books\n\n【26】During heart valve surgery, don't wear:\n\n【27】*   Jewelry\n*   Eyeglasses\n*   Contact lenses\n*   Dentures\n*   Nail polish\n\n【28】You may need to have your body hair shaved where the incisions will be made. A special soap might be used to wash your skin to help prevent infection.\n\n【29】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【30】### During the procedure\n\n【31】You'll receive anesthetics to put you in a sleep-like state during the procedure. You'll be connected to a heart-lung bypass machine, which keeps blood moving through your body during the procedure.\n\n【32】Heart valve surgery can be performed using standard open-heart surgery, which involves cutting your chest through your breastbone. Minimally invasive heart surgery involves smaller incisions than those used in open-heart surgery.\n\n【33】Minimally invasive heart surgery includes surgery performed using long instruments inserted through one or more small incisions in the chest (thoracoscopic surgery), surgery performed through a small incision in the chest, or surgery performed by a surgeon using the assistance of a robot (robot-assisted heart surgery).\n\n【34】Minimally invasive heart surgery might involve a shorter hospital stay, quicker recovery and less pain than you'd have with open-heart surgery. Minimally invasive heart surgery ideally should be performed at medical centers with medical teams experienced in performing these types of procedures.\n\n【35】### Heart valve repair\n\n【36】Your doctor may often recommend heart valve repair when possible, as it saves the heart valve and may preserve heart function. Heart valve repair surgery may include:\n\n【37】*   Patching holes in a valve\n*   Reconnecting valve flaps (leaflets or cusps)\n*   Removing excess valve tissue so that the leaflets or cusps can close tightly\n*   Replacing cords that support the valve to repair the structural support\n*   Separating valve flaps that have fused\n*   Tightening or reinforcing the ring around the valve (annulus)\n\n【38】Some heart valve repair procedures are done using a long, thin tube (catheter) and clips, plugs or other devices.\n\n【39】Doctors might treat a valve with a narrowed valve opening with a catheter procedure called balloon valvuloplasty. A doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a balloon on the tip into an artery in your arm or groin and guides it to the affected valve.\n\n【40】The balloon is inflated, which expands the opening of the heart valve. Doctors then deflate the balloon and remove the catheter and balloon.\n\n【41】### Heart valve replacement\n\n【42】If your heart valve can't be repaired and a catheter-based procedure isn't an option, the valve might need to be replaced. To replace a heart valve, your doctor removes the heart valve and replaces it with a mechanical valve or a valve made from cow, pig or human heart tissue (biological tissue valve).\n\n【43】Biological valves often eventually need to be replaced, as they break down over time. If you have a mechanical valve, you'll need to take blood-thinning medications for the rest of your life to prevent blood clots. Doctors will discuss with you the risks and benefits of each type of valve.\n\n【44】A minimally invasive catheter procedure might be used to replace certain heart valves. For example, a catheter procedure might be performed to insert a replacement valve into a biological replacement valve in the heart that is no longer working properly.\n\n【45】### After the procedure\n\n【46】After your heart valve surgery, you'll generally spend a day or more in the intensive care unit (ICU). You'll receive fluids and medications through an IV. Other tubes drain urine from the bladder and fluid and blood from the chest. You might be given oxygen through a mask or nasal prongs in your nose.\n\n【47】After you complete your stay in the ICU, you'll likely be moved to another hospital room for several days. How long you'll stay in the hospital depends on your condition and surgery.\n\n【48】After heart valve surgery, your treatment team will monitor your condition and watch for signs of infection at the incision sites. The team will check your blood pressure, breathing and heart rate. The team will also work with you to manage any pain you have after surgery.\n\n【49】You'll likely be asked to walk regularly to gradually increase your activity, and to cough and to do breathing exercises as you recover.\n\n【50】You'll be given instructions to follow during your recovery, such as:\n\n【51】*   Watching for signs of infection in your incisions\n*   Taking your medications\n*   Properly caring for incisions\n*   Managing pain and other side effects after your surgery\n\n【52】Results\n-------\n\n【53】After heart valve surgery, your doctor will tell you when you can return to activities.\n\n【54】You'll need to attend regular follow-up appointments with your doctor. You might have several tests to evaluate and monitor your condition.\n\n【55】Your doctor may recommend making healthy lifestyle changes to keep your heart working well. Examples of heart-healthy lifestyle changes are:\n\n【56】*   Eating a healthy diet\n*   Getting regular exercise\n*   Managing stress\n*   Avoiding tobacco use\n\n【57】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "818099de-d7a6-4ceb-b460-409958b9f1cb", "title": "Heart murmurs", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Heart murmurs are sounds — such as whooshing or swishing — made by rapid, choppy (turbulent) blood flow through the heart. The sounds can be heard with a device called a stethoscope. A typical heartbeat makes two sounds like \"lubb-dupp\" (sometimes described as \"lub-DUP\") when the heart valves are closing.\n\n【2】Heart murmurs can be present at birth (congenital) or develop later in life (acquired).\n\n【3】Some heart murmurs are harmless (innocent). An innocent heart murmur is not a sign of heart disease and doesn't need treatment. Other heart murmurs may be a sign of a serious heart condition. Tests are needed to check the heart and heart valves. Heart murmur treatment depends on the cause.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Harmless (innocent) heart murmurs usually don't cause any other symptoms.\n\n【6】Symptoms of worrisome heart murmurs depend on the cause. Heart murmur symptoms may include:\n\n【7】*   Blue or gray fingernails or lips\n*   Chest pain\n*   Cough that doesn't go away\n*   Dizziness\n*   Swollen liver\n*   Swollen neck veins\n*   Fainting\n*   Heavy sweating with little or no activity\n*   In infants, poor appetite and lack of growth\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Swelling or sudden weight gain\n\n【8】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【9】Most heart murmurs aren't serious. If you're concerned about a heart murmur, make an appointment to see your primary care provider. Your provider can tell you if follow-up care is needed.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】A heart murmur is caused by rapid, choppy (turbulent) blood flow through the heart. A heart murmur may happen:\n\n【12】*   When the heart is filling with blood (diastolic murmur)\n*   When the heart is emptying (systolic murmur)\n*   Throughout the heartbeat (continuous murmur)\n\n【13】### Harmless (innocent) heart murmurs\n\n【14】A person with an innocent murmur usually has a typical heart. Innocent heart murmurs are common in newborns and children.\n\n【15】Things that might change blood flow and cause an innocent heart murmur include:\n\n【16】*   Fever\n*   Lack of healthy red blood cells that carry oxygen to body tissues (anemia)\n*   Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)\n*   Phases of rapid growth, such as adolescence\n*   Physical activity or exercise\n*   Pregnancy\n\n【17】Innocent heart murmurs may go away over time. Sometimes, heart murmurs continue for life without causing serious health problems.\n\n【18】### Worrisome heart murmurs\n\n【19】In children, worrisome murmurs are usually due to a problem with the heart's structure that's present at birth (congenital heart defect).\n\n【20】Congenital causes of worrisome heart murmurs include:\n\n【21】*   **Holes in the heart.** A hole may form before birth in the wall between the upper or lower heart chambers, or both. Examples are atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect.\n*   **Cardiac shunts.** A heart structure problem present before birth (congenital heart defect) causes irregular blood flow between the heart chambers or blood vessels.\n\n【22】In adults, worrisome heart murmurs are usually due to heart valve problems that develop later in life (acquired heart valve disease). Things that can damage the heart valves include:\n\n【23】*   **Calcium deposits.** Calcium deposits can cause a heart valve — such as the mitral valve or the aortic valve — to become stiff and narrow (valve stenosis). A calcified valve also may not close completely, letting blood flow backward. The changes in blood flow create a murmur. When calcium affects the heart valves, it's called calcific or degenerative valve disease.\n*   **Infection of the inner heart lining and valves (endocarditis).** Bacteria or other germs cause this infection. The germs spread through the blood to the heart from another part of the body, such as the mouth. A murmur may occur if the infection is untreated and affects the heart valves.\n*   **Rheumatic fever.** This is a serious complication of strep throat. It's rare in the United States. Rheumatic fever may occur in those who don't get or complete treatment for strep throat. When rheumatic fever affects the heart valves, it's called rheumatic heart disease. A heart valve problem can cause a murmur.\n\n【24】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【25】Things that increase the risk of heart murmurs in babies includes:\n\n【26】*   Family history of heart problems linked to murmurs\n*   Uncontrolled diabetes in the mother during pregnancy\n*   German measles (rubella) in the mother during pregnancy\n*   Use of certain medications, alcohol or illegal drugs by the mother during pregnancy\n\n【27】Some medical conditions can increase the risk of heart murmurs, including:\n\n【28】*   A rare cancerous tumor that releases certain chemicals into the bloodstream (carcinoid syndrome)\n*   A weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)\n*   An infection of the lining of the heart (endocarditis)\n*   Anemia\n*   Blood disorders marked by a high number of certain white cells, called eosinophils (hypereosinophilic syndrome)\n*   Certain autoimmune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Heart valve disease\n*   High blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension)\n*   History of rheumatic fever\n*   Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)\n\n【29】Prevention\n----------\n\n【30】There's no known prevention for heart murmurs. But healthy lifestyle changes can improve heart health and prevent some conditions linked to murmurs in adults. Many childhood heart murmurs go away on their own as children grow.\n\n【31】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

It began as a back strain after a particularly active weekend of running and lawn care. I had experienced similar pains in the past, and they always seemed to resolve after a few days of limiting my exercise habit. However, after a week of progressive symptoms, I realized that I was dealing with something more portentous and sought the help of a physiatrist and physical therapist. I dutifully carried their book of “lumbar stabilization” exercises with me on our family's annual summer vacation in the north woods of Minnesota. There I obsessively performed each exercise, a task that consumed a fair portion of my day. Hours that I would have normally spent fishing, hiking, and otherwise enjoying myself were being used to undertake various physical contortions on the floor of our rented north woods cabin, and the pain was only getting worse. I panicked. How could I work? How could I finish preparations for the 2 conferences that I was organizing? How could I meet the deadlines for the 2 documents that I was writing? I returned home a week later. Magnetic resonance imaging and myelography identified a lumbar disk protrusion. I decided that the most efficient way of dealing with the problem would be a laminectomy, but I could not convince my neurosurgeon to operate. Instead he referred me to a neurologist.\n\n【1】Although I was to receive a complete neurologic examination, I was dressed in a suit with a nametag that identified me as a staff physician. Such attire was my usual custom any time that I was in the vicinity of the medical institution where I worked. After the evaluation, the resident and staff neurologist spoke together in hushed tones, then asked if my wife or “significant other” had accompanied me to my appointment. With the 4 of us assembled, the discussion took a direction that astonished me. Instead of referring me to a second neurosurgeon, the talk centered on such intangibles as my mood, appetite, and energy level. I was annoyed and slightly offended. “We would like you to see a psychiatrist, suggested the staff neurologist.\n\n【2】The psychiatrist met my wife and me in the same examining room. I knew him. He had done some consultations for me the last time that I had covered the intensive care unit. I liked him. We had similar upbringings, as we had both been born and reared on military bases. “How much have you been sleeping at night?”\n\n【3】“A couple of hours, but this is because of my back and feet pain.”\n\n【4】“Have you found yourself sad lately?”\n\n【5】“Yes, but this is because there is this conference that I'm putting together and these papers that I'm writing and I can't seem to….” ….”\n\n【6】“Have you ever been depressed before?”\n\n【7】“Am I depressed?”\n\n【8】“Has anyone in your family been depressed or committed suicide?”\n\n【9】I paused.\n\n【10】“I think that you are severely depressed and that it would be safest for you to enter the hospital. Maybe just over the weekend just to get you stabilized. I really think that would be best.”\n\n【11】I realized that I was being “charmed.” I had done the same many times during my career as an intensivist, especially when I wanted a patient to accept some aggressive diagnostic modality or treatment. I looked to my wife who was sitting next to me, holding my right hand. She and the rest of our family had been affected by my illness as much as I had. They deserved a break. “OK,” I said.\n\n【12】My wife pushed the buzzer and negotiated our admittance past the locked door of the “closed” psychiatric unit. The first person to greet us was a nurse whom I had worked with as an intern 20 years ago. “Hello Dr Plevak,” she said cheerfully. “Which patient are you here to see?”\n\n【13】“You don't understand I am the patient.” I watched her welcoming expression rapidly transform into embarrassment. “That's OK,” I said. “I'm just getting used to it myself.”\n\n【14】“Here, let me introduce you to your primary nurse who will admit you.”\n\n【15】I was escorted down a hallway of patient rooms. About halfway down, we encountered a young woman in her 20s. She was dressed in regular clothes. When I was introduced as her new patient, she enthusiastically stuck out her right hand and exclaimed, “Hi Dave!”\n\n【16】Had she not seen my nametag identifying me as a staff physician? I immediately perceived my change of status. I felt embarrassed and ashamed. Why was I here? Why couldn't I have handled all this myself, like most people do when they have “bad days”?\n\n【17】My hospital room appeared to be normal, until I noticed that the window overlooking the courtyard was secured tightly. My room had no overhangs from which heavy objects could be suspended, and the corners and edges of all furnishings were smoothed to cushion the impact from any possible fall, intended or unintended. My dental floss was taken from me with the instruction that a modest strip would be rationed on request. When my nighttime medications arrived, I promptly chewed my sleeping pill. The bolus sedative effect put me to sleep.\n\n【18】I awoke the next morning to the cries of Bernie, the patient directly across the hall. (The names of patients have been changed to protect their privacy.) Bernie believed that he was internally hemorrhaging and was screaming to warn the staff. His nurse, although not ignoring his appeal for help, was busy getting him out of bed and dressed. Besides Bernie, most of the commotion was coming from a room down a second hallway on the other side of the unit. Earlier that morning, Louis had been transferred from a nursing home. Louis resembled a “street person.” He was unshaven and generally unkempt. His matted silvery hair made him look at least 60 years old, but I later found out that he was in his mid- 40s. Louis was loud and was objecting to being transferred by wheelchair for breakfast. I knew from my previous medical training that Louis was suffering from some major psychiatric disorder. I kept my distance. I did not want to be identified with him or with any of the patients like him.\n\n【19】Taking a seat at the far end of the dining area, I had hoped to eat breakfast alone. Only 1 patient sat at my table. Fred was a business executive. He seemed fairly “normal.” Fred volunteered that he had depression and that he was also feeling a bit out of place in a psychiatric ward. Fred seemed impressed that I was a physician.\n\n【20】The first week passed, but did so with agony. The medication was not working. Everything and everybody were in slow motion. During the day, I watched the clock, hoping that evening would come. During the night, I felt fear and loneliness and longed for the daylight. Each morning I was again devastated by the realization of what had happened to me. Initially I tried to maintain some of my prehospital activities. I corresponded daily with my secretary. Unable to jog, I obsessively paced the hallways. I dutifully performed my back-strengthening exercises on the floor of my hospital room. But as the week passed, these activities became more difficult. “You have severe depression. It takes time for these medications to work,” said my psychiatrist.\n\n【21】Fred was improving. He was becoming more talkative and animated. He moved more easily among our fellow patients, speaking to them and encouraging them. Fred did not always choose to sit with me during meals, and I was forced to sit alone sometimes or with some of the other patients. I identified more with the staff than with the patients, and what little socializing I did was with them. Almost every morning I met with Lynn, one of the male nurses, at the nurses' station. Since I was a physician, I believed that I could have such access. Lynn would listen to my story of sadness, emptiness, and hopelessness. I would usually cry, and he would comfort me.\n\n【22】Father Jim visited me daily. We had known each other for several years, since the time that he was an associate pastor at my parish. We had become best friends.\n\n【23】“Jim, where does religion fit in all this?”\n\n【24】“All this may not make sense right now. You just have to hang in there.”\n\n【25】One day he left me with a quote from a 16th century mystic, “Hence the dark night with its aridities and voids is the means to the knowledge of both God and self.”\n\n【26】Sometime during my second week of hospitalization, I ate lunch with Louis. I had no choice. I was sitting alone in the dining area, and Louis passed by all the other tables and sat down next to me. He no longer required a wheelchair. His silvery hair was now washed and combed.\n\n【27】“Would you mind?”\n\n【28】“No, please go ahead.”\n\n【29】“My name is Louis. I'm from a small town near here.\n\n【30】Boy.I'm not sure what happened to me. They tell me it is September. Last I remember it was June. Man I feel I feel good. It was scary. It is good to have my mind back again.” Louis had been receiving electroconvulsive therapy, and the improvement was remarkable.\n\n【31】In the days that followed, Louis and I ate together on several occasions. He later invited some of the other patients to our table. We began to share the pain of our stories. We talked about what we had been doing before we became ill, the effect that our illnesses had on our families, and how we first realized that we needed help. We took turns listening as we each expressed our hopes for the future.\n\n【32】We did not choose this illness. If given a choice, we all would have opted for something more socially acceptable or surgically amenable or an ailment with established treatment end points and better rates of long-term cure. We had depression, a multiorgan systemic disease. It was affecting our emotions, our thinking, and the way we ate, slept, digested our food, and experienced noxious stimuli. We had now accepted the shame of our diagnosis and hospitalization. We were all beginning to benefit from treatment.\n\n【33】My back ailment resolved. At the end of 3 weeks, I was discharged from the hospital. I was not cured of my depression; this would be a long-term process. However, I learned to accept my disease and to identify with others who are afflicted with mental illness. Understanding their daily struggles, I am proud of the millions of people who battle with depression and other psychiatric disorders. Their courageous living is an example of hope to the millions of people who will be diagnosed with mental illness this year. Their message is, “Don't be ashamed. You are not alone. Effective treatment is available.”\n\n【34】无关删除-1:<u>Acknowledgment\n--------------</u>\n\n【35】无关删除-1:<u>I thank Drs Katherine M. Moore and William F.

From July 2003 through January 2004, 2 physician reviewers compared the Master Sheet Index text with the SNOMED CT terms that were automatically mapped by a vocabulary server or that they identified using a vocabulary browser and rated the “correctness” of the match. If the 2 reviewers disagreed, a third reviewer adjudicated. We evaluated the specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value of SNOMED CT.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of the 4996 problems in the test set, SNOMED CT correctly identified 4568 terms (true-positive results); 36 terms were true negatives, 9 terms were false positives, and 383 terms were false negatives. SNOMED CT had a sensitivity of 92.3%, a specificity of 80.0%, and a positive predictive value of 99.8%.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】SNOMED CT, when used as a compositional terminology, can exactly represent most (92.3%) of the terms used commonly in medical problem lists.

Gently pull the ear lobe up and back for adults (down and back for children) to straighten the ear canal. Drop the medicine into the ear canal. Keep the ear facing up for several (about 5) minutes to allow the medicine to run to the bottom of the ear canal. A sterile cotton plug may be gently inserted into the ear opening to prevent the medicine from leaking out. At first, your doctor may want you to put more medicine on the cotton plug during the day to keep it moist.\n\n【37】To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, avoid touching the dropper or applicator tip to any surface as much as possible (including the ear). Also, always keep the container tightly closed.\n\n【38】For patients using hydrocortisone and acetic acid ear drops:\n\n【39】*   Do not wash the dropper or applicator tip, because water may get into the medicine and make it weaker. If necessary, you may wipe the dropper or applicator tip with a clean tissue.\n\n【40】Do not use corticosteroids more often or for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.\n\n【41】Do not use any leftover medicine for future ear problems without first checking with your doctor. This medicine should not be used if certain kinds of infections are present. To do so may make the infection worse.\n\n【42】### Dosing\n\n【43】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【44】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【45】#### For hydrocortisone and acetic acid\n\n【46】*   For ear drops dosage form:\n    *   For ear infections:\n        *   Adults and children over 3 years of age—Use 3 to 5 drops in the affected ear every four to six hours for the first twenty-four hours, then 5 drops three to four times daily.\n        *   Children under 3 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【47】### Missed Dose\n\n【48】If you miss a dose of this medicine, apply it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule.\n\n【49】Do not stop treatment abruptly.\n\n【50】### Storage\n\n【51】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【52】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【53】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【54】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【55】If your condition does not improve within 5 to 7 days, or if it becomes worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【56】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【57】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【58】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【59】#### Less common\n\n【60】1.  Anorexia, weakness, weight loss (in children)\n2.  stinging, itching, irritation, or burning of the ear\n\n【61】There have not been any other side effects reported with this medicine. However, if you notice any other effects, check with your doctor.\n\n【62】Portions of this document last updated: Aug. 01, 2023\n\n【63】删除3:<u>Original article: https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/hydrocortisone-and-acetic-acid-otic-route/description/drg-20061688</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Blood, urine, and other laboratory tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects. If your or your child's condition does not improve, or if it becomes worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【67】Tell your doctor if you have Asian relatives, such as Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Taiwanese. You may need a lower dose of this medicine to treat erosive esophagitis.\n\n【68】Do not use omeprazole if you are also using medicines containing rilpivirine (Edurant®, Complera®). Using these medicines together may cause unwanted side effects.\n\n【69】This medicine is sometimes given together with other medicines to treat ulcers. Be sure you understand about the risks and proper use of any other medicine your doctor gives you or your child together with omeprazole.\n\n【70】Omeprazole may cause a serious type of allergic reaction when used in patients with conditions treated with antibiotics. Call your doctor right away if you or your child has itching, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth.\n\n【71】Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has a change in frequency of urination or amount of urine, blood in the urine, fever, joint pain, loss of appetite, skin rash, swelling of the body, feet, or ankles, unusual tiredness or weakness, or unusual weight gain after receiving this medicine. These could be symptoms of a serious kidney problem called acute tubulointerstitial nephritis.\n\n【72】Taking this medicine for a long time may make it harder for your body to absorb vitamin B12. Tell your doctor if you have concerns about vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n【73】Serious stomach conditions may occur while taking this medicine alone or together with antibiotics. Check with your doctor immediately if you or your child has stomach cramps, bloated feeling, watery and severe diarrhea which may also be bloody sometimes, fever, nausea or vomiting, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【74】This medicine may increase your risk of having fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine. This is more likely if you are 50 years of age and older, if you receive high doses of this medicine, or use it for one year or more. Call your doctor right away if you have severe bone pain or are unable to walk or sit normally.\n\n【75】This medicine may cause serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Check with your doctor right away if you have black, tarry stools, blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, chest pain, chills, cough, diarrhea, itching, joint or muscle pain, painful or difficult urination, red irritated eyes, red skin lesions, often with a purple center, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in the mouth or on the lips, swollen glands, unusual bleeding or bruising, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【76】This medicine may cause hypomagnesemia (low magnesium in the blood). This is more likely to occur if you are taking this medicine for more than 1 year, or if you are taking this medicine together with digoxin (Lanoxin®) or certain diuretics or \"water pills\". Check with your doctor right away if you have convulsions (seizures), fast, racing, or uneven heartbeat, muscle spasms (tetany), tremors, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【77】Cutaneous or systemic lupus erythematosus may occur or get worse in patients receiving a PPI. Call your doctor right away if you have joint pain or a skin rash on your cheeks or arms that gets worse when exposed to the sun.\n\n【78】This medicine may increase your risk for fundic gland polyps (abnormal tissue growth in the upper part of your stomach). This is more likely if you are receiving this medicine for more than 1 year. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.\n\n【79】Do not stop taking this medicine without first checking with your doctor, or unless told to do so by your doctor.\n\n【80】Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. You may need to stop using this medicine several days before you have medical tests.\n\n【81】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription (eg, atazanavir, nelfinavir, Reyataz®, Viracept®) or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal (eg, St. John's wort) or vitamin supplements.\n\n【82】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【83】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【84】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【85】#### Rare\n\n【86】1.

Our one-stop-shop check-up enabled us to diagnose 892 (72.9%) patients; 330 (27.0%) patients required additional examinations, such as mass spectrometry and/or a cardiac biopsy. This subset notably included 112 patients with amyloid light chain amyloidosis. More than 64% of the patients with transthyretin amyloidosis or another type of amyloidosis were diagnosed during the one-stop shop visit. Sensitivity and specificity of BS for transthyretin amyloidosis diagnosis was 99% and 96%, respectively. For amyloid light chain diagnosis, sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 76%, respectively, for GT and 54% and 100%, respectively, for SGB. Of 910 transthyretin genetic tests, 205 (17%) detected mutations.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The results of our real-life cohort study confirmed the ability of a one-stop-shop approach with a modified Gillmore algorithm to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis and the interest of simultaneous testing for earlier diagnosis. The SGB has diagnostic value because it is easy, quick, and less invasive than a cardiac biopsy.\n\n【9】Graphical abstract\n------------------\n\n【10】Graphical Abstract\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>\n\n【12】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【13】AL ( amyloid light chain ), ATTR ( transthyretin amyloidosis ), BS ( bone scintigraphy ), CA ( cardiac amyloidosis ), GT ( gammopathy test ), SGB ( salivary gland biopsy ), TTR ( transthyretin )\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【20】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【21】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "8bd287bb-49b9-453d-aab3-cdf5fe2ad78c", "title": "Avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis)", "text": "【0】Avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis)\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】Avascular necrosis is the death of bone tissue due to a lack of blood supply. Also called osteonecrosis, it can lead to tiny breaks in the bone and cause the bone to collapse. The process usually takes months to years.\n\n【2】A broken bone or dislocated joint can stop the blood flow to a section of bone. Avascular necrosis is also associated with long-term use of high-dose steroid medications and too much alcohol.\n\n【3】Anyone can be affected. But the condition is most common in people between the ages of 30 and 50.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Some people have no symptoms in the early stages of avascular necrosis. As the condition worsens, affected joints might hurt only when putting weight on them. Eventually, you might feel the pain even when you're lying down.\n\n【6】Pain can be mild or severe. It usually develops gradually. Pain associated with avascular necrosis of the hip might center on the groin, thigh or buttock. Besides the hip, the shoulder, knee, hand and foot can be affected.\n\n【7】Some people develop avascular necrosis on both sides, such as in both hips or in both knees.\n\n【8】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【9】See your health care provider for ongoing pain in any joint. Seek immediate medical attention for a possible broken bone or dislocated joint.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Avascular necrosis occurs when blood flow to a bone is interrupted or reduced. Reduced blood supply can be caused by:\n\n【12】*   **Joint or bone trauma.** An injury, such as a dislocated joint, might damage nearby blood vessels. Cancer treatments involving radiation also can weaken bone and harm blood vessels.\n*   **Fatty deposits in blood vessels.** The fat (lipids) can block small blood vessels. This can reduce blood flow to bones.\n*   **Certain diseases.** Medical conditions, such as sickle cell anemia and Gaucher's disease, also can lessen blood flow to bone.\n\n【13】Sometimes the cause of avascular necrosis not brought on by trauma isn't fully understood. Genetics combined with overuse of alcohol, certain medications and other diseases likely play a role.\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】Risk factors for developing avascular necrosis include:\n\n【16】*   **Trauma.** Injuries, such as hip dislocation or fracture, can damage nearby blood vessels and reduce blood flow to bones.\n*   **Steroid use.** Use of high-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone, is a common cause of avascular necrosis. The reason is unknown, but some experts believe that corticosteroids can increase lipid levels in the blood, reducing blood flow.\n*   **Drinking too much alcohol.** Having several alcoholic drinks a day for several years also can cause fatty deposits to form in blood vessels.\n*   **Bisphosphonate use.** Long-term use of medications to increase bone density might contribute to developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. This rare complication has occurred in some people treated with high doses of these medications for cancers, such as multiple myeloma and metastatic breast cancer.\n*   **Certain medical treatments.** Radiation therapy for cancer can weaken bone. Organ transplants, especially kidney transplants, also are associated with avascular necrosis.\n\n【17】Medical conditions associated with avascular necrosis include:\n\n【18】*   Pancreatitis\n*   Gaucher's disease\n*   HIV/AIDS\n*   Systemic lupus erythematosus\n*   Sickle cell anemia\n*   Decompression sickness, also known as divers' disease or the bends\n*   Certain types of cancer, such as leukemia\n\n【19】Complications\n-------------\n\n【20】Untreated, avascular necrosis worsens. Eventually, the bone can collapse. Avascular necrosis also causes bone to lose its smooth shape, possibly leading to severe arthritis.\n\n【21】Prevention\n----------\n\n【22】To reduce the risk of avascular necrosis and improve general health:\n\n【23】*   **Limit alcohol.** Heavy drinking is one of the top risk factors for developing avascular necrosis.\n*   **Keep cholesterol levels low.** Tiny bits of fat are the most common substance blocking blood supply to bones.\n*   **Monitor steroid use.** Make sure your health care provider knows about your past or present use of high-dose steroids. Steroid-related bone damage appears to worsen with repeated courses of high-dose steroids.\n*   **Don't smoke.** Smoking narrows blood vessels, which can reduce blood flow.\n\n【24】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Snoring, restless legs symptoms, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and prior overnight oximetry testing were more prevalent in 2004 than in 2003 ( _P_ \\=.05, _P_ \\=.01, _P_ <.001, _P_ \\=.003, _P_ \\=.02, respectively). In contrast, insomnia and parasomnia complaints were less common in 2004 ( _P_ <.001). The mean apnea-hypopnea index, minimum oxygen saturation, and percentage of time with oxygen saturation less than 90% were all more severe in 2004 ( _P_ \\=.01, _P_ \\=.001, _P_ <.001, respectively). Sleep-related breathing disorders were more commonly diagnosed in 2004 (83.2% vs 67.2%; _P_ \\=.02), whereas the diagnoses of nonbreathing disorders declined.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】The insurance policy changes that resulted in larger empolyee co-payments shifted the spectrum of diagnoses seen at the Sleep Disorders Center toward more symptomatic patients, with more associated comorbidities, and patients who had more severe sleep-related breathing disorders.

Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【39】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【40】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   For chorea:\n        *   Adults—At first, 12.5 milligrams (mg) in the morning once a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 100 mg per day.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【41】### Missed Dose\n\n【42】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【43】### Storage\n\n【44】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【45】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【46】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【47】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【48】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【49】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to see if the medicine is working properly and to allow for changes in the dose.\n\n【50】Tetrabenazine may cause some people to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors. It may also cause some people to have suicidal thoughts and tendencies, or to become more depressed. If you or your caregiver notice any of these side effects, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【51】Do not take this medicine if you are also taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor such as isocarboxazid (Marplan®), phenelzine (Nardil®), selegiline (Eldepryl®), or tranylcypromine (Parnate®). If you have questions, check with your doctor.\n\n【52】Do not take this medicine if you are also taking reserpine (Harmonyl®). Wait at least 20 days after stopping reserpine before starting tetrabenazine. If you have questions, check with your doctor.\n\n【53】Check with your doctor right away if you have more than one of these symptoms while taking this medicine: convulsions (seizures), difficulty with breathing, a fast heartbeat, a high fever, high or low blood pressure, increased sweating, loss of bladder control, severe muscle stiffness, unusually pale skin, or tiredness. These could be symptoms of a serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\n\n【54】This medicine may cause drowsiness, trouble with thinking, or trouble with controlling movements. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert or able to think well.\n\n【55】Make sure your doctor knows if you are using chlorpromazine (Thorazine®), thioridazine (Mellaril®), ziprasidone (Geodon®), moxifloxacin (Avelox®), quinidine, procainamide (Pronestyl®), amiodarone (Cordarone®), or sotalol (Betapase®). Using any of these medicines together with tetrabenazine may cause serious side effects.\n\n【56】This medicine may cause tardive dyskinesia (a movement disorder). This may not go away after you stop using the medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms while taking this medicine: lip smacking or puckering, puffing of the cheeks, rapid or worm-like movements of the tongue, uncontrolled chewing movements, or uncontrolled movements of the arms and legs.\n\n【57】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. If the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【58】This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. CNS depressants are medicines that slow down the nervous system, which may cause drowsiness or make you less alert. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, allergies, or colds; sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine; prescription pain medicine or narcotics; barbiturates (used for seizures); muscle relaxants; or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics.

{"seq_id": "085973d1-7717-4391-be04-ab0a1329063d", "title": "Autism spectrum disorder", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that impacts how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication. The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns of behavior. The term \"spectrum\" in autism spectrum disorder refers to the wide range of symptoms and severity.\n\n【2】Autism spectrum disorder includes conditions that were previously considered separate — autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and an unspecified form of pervasive developmental disorder. Some people still use the term \"Asperger's syndrome,\" which is generally thought to be at the mild end of autism spectrum disorder.\n\n【3】Autism spectrum disorder begins in early childhood and eventually causes problems functioning in society — socially, in school and at work, for example. Often children show symptoms of autism within the first year. A small number of children appear to develop normally in the first year, and then go through a period of regression between 18 and 24 months of age when they develop autism symptoms.\n\n【4】While there is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, intensive, early treatment can make a big difference in the lives of many children.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder in early infancy, such as reduced eye contact, lack of response to their name or indifference to caregivers. Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. Signs usually are seen by age 2 years.\n\n【7】Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity — from low functioning to high functioning.\n\n【8】Some children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty learning, and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. Other children with the disorder have normal to high intelligence — they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations.\n\n【9】Because of the unique mixture of symptoms in each child, severity can sometimes be difficult to determine. It's generally based on the level of impairments and how they impact the ability to function.\n\n【10】Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder.\n\n【11】### Social communication and interaction\n\n【12】A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction and communication skills, including any of these signs:\n\n【13】*   Fails to respond to his or her name or appears not to hear you at times\n*   Resists cuddling and holding, and seems to prefer playing alone, retreating into his or her own world\n*   Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression\n*   Doesn't speak or has delayed speech, or loses previous ability to say words or sentences\n*   Can't start a conversation or keep one going, or only starts one to make requests or label items\n*   Speaks with an abnormal tone or rhythm and may use a singsong voice or robot-like speech\n*   Repeats words or phrases verbatim, but doesn't understand how to use them\n*   Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions\n*   Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings\n*   Doesn't point at or bring objects to share interest\n*   Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive\n*   Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice\n\n【14】### Patterns of behavior\n\n【15】A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have limited, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, including any of these signs:\n\n【16】*   Performs repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand flapping\n*   Performs activities that could cause self-harm, such as biting or head-banging\n*   Develops specific routines or rituals and becomes disturbed at the slightest change\n*   Has problems with coordination or has odd movement patterns, such as clumsiness or walking on toes, and has odd, stiff or exaggerated body language\n*   Is fascinated by details of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car, but doesn't understand the overall purpose or function of the object\n*   Is unusually sensitive to light, sound or touch, yet may be indifferent to pain or temperature\n*   Doesn't engage in imitative or make-believe play\n*   Fixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity or focus\n*   Has specific food preferences, such as eating only a few foods, or refusing foods with a certain texture\n\n【17】As they mature, some children with autism spectrum disorder become more engaged with others and show fewer disturbances in behavior. Some, usually those with the least severe problems, eventually may lead normal or near-normal lives. Others, however, continue to have difficulty with language or social skills, and the teen years can bring worse behavioral and emotional problems.\n\n【18】### When to see a doctor\n\n【19】Babies develop at their own pace, and many don't follow exact timelines found in some parenting books. But children with autism spectrum disorder usually show some signs of delayed development before age 2 years.\n\n【20】If you're concerned about your child's development or you suspect that your child may have autism spectrum disorder, discuss your concerns with your doctor. The symptoms associated with the disorder can also be linked with other developmental disorders.\n\n【21】Signs of autism spectrum disorder often appear early in development when there are obvious delays in language skills and social interactions. Your doctor may recommend developmental tests to identify if your child has delays in cognitive, language and social skills, if your child:\n\n【22】*   Doesn't respond with a smile or happy expression by 6 months\n*   Doesn't mimic sounds or facial expressions by 9 months\n*   Doesn't babble or coo by 12 months\n*   Doesn't gesture — such as point or wave — by 14 months\n*   Doesn't say single words by 16 months\n*   Doesn't play \"make-believe\" or pretend by 18 months\n*   Doesn't say two-word phrases by 24 months\n*   Loses language skills or social skills at any age\n\n【23】Causes\n------\n\n【24】Autism spectrum disorder has no single known cause. Given the complexity of the disorder, and the fact that symptoms and severity vary, there are probably many causes. Both genetics and environment may play a role.\n\n【25】*   **Genetics.** Several different genes appear to be involved in autism spectrum disorder. For some children, autism spectrum disorder can be associated with a genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome. For other children, genetic changes (mutations) may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Still other genes may affect brain development or the way that brain cells communicate, or they may determine the severity of symptoms. Some genetic mutations seem to be inherited, while others occur spontaneously.\n*   **Environmental factors.** Researchers are currently exploring whether factors such as viral infections, medications or complications during pregnancy, or air pollutants play a role in triggering autism spectrum disorder.\n\n【26】### No link between vaccines and autism spectrum disorder\n\n【27】One of the greatest controversies in autism spectrum disorder centers on whether a link exists between the disorder and childhood vaccines. Despite extensive research, no reliable study has shown a link between autism spectrum disorder and any vaccines. In fact, the original study that ignited the debate years ago has been retracted due to poor design and questionable research methods.\n\n【28】Avoiding childhood vaccinations can place your child and others in danger of catching and spreading serious diseases, including whooping cough (pertussis), measles or mumps.\n\n【29】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【30】The number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder is rising. It's not clear whether this is due to better detection and reporting or a real increase in the number of cases, or both.\n\n【31】Autism spectrum disorder affects children of all races and nationalities, but certain factors increase a child's risk. These may include:\n\n【32】*   **Your child's sex.** Boys are about four times more likely to develop autism spectrum disorder than girls are.\n*   **Family history.** Families who have one child with autism spectrum disorder have an increased risk of having another child with the disorder. It's also not uncommon for parents or relatives of a child with autism spectrum disorder to have minor problems with social or communication skills themselves or to engage in certain behaviors typical of the disorder.\n*   **Other disorders.** Children with certain medical conditions have a higher than normal risk of autism spectrum disorder or autism-like symptoms. Examples include fragile X syndrome, an inherited disorder that causes intellectual problems; tuberous sclerosis, a condition in which benign tumors develop in the brain; and Rett syndrome, a genetic condition occurring almost exclusively in girls, which causes slowing of head growth, intellectual disability and loss of purposeful hand use.\n*   **Extremely preterm babies.** Babies born before 26 weeks of gestation may have a greater risk of autism spectrum disorder.\n*   **Parents' ages.** There may be a connection between children born to older parents and autism spectrum disorder, but more research is necessary to establish this link.\n\n【33】Complications\n-------------\n\n【34】Problems with social interactions, communication and behavior can lead to:\n\n【35】*   Problems in school and with successful learning\n*   Employment problems\n*   Inability to live independently\n*   Social isolation\n*   Stress within the family\n*   Victimization and being bullied\n\n【36】Prevention\n----------\n\n【37】There's no way to prevent autism spectrum disorder, but there are treatment options. Early diagnosis and intervention is most helpful and can improve behavior, skills and language development. However, intervention is helpful at any age. Though children usually don't outgrow autism spectrum disorder symptoms, they may learn to function well.\n\n【38】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

One sector cannot respond to a hurricane; neither can one sector respond to COVID-19. Here, we describe how we used LHS principles to lower boundaries across sectors, promote collaborative sense-making, and grow coordinated infrastructure.\n\n【55】Developing a Learning Health System for a Regional COVID-19 Response\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】### Design Principles\n\n【57】Our pre-existing regional emergency preparedness coalition defined Greater Cincinnati as including 14 counties in three states, with 22 hospitals and 17 local health departments serving more than 2 million people. Although response plans existed across jurisdictions and institutions, they were insufficiently linked. Thus, we quickly saw a need to use design and change management strategies, and a network organizational model,\n\n【58】无关删除-2:<u>*   Fjeldstad O.D.\n*   Snow C.C.\n*   Miles R.E.\n*   Lettl C.</u>\n\n【59】The architecture of collaboration.\n\n【60】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Strategic Manag J._ 2012; 33 : 734-750</u></u>\n\n【61】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (286)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【62】to catalyze an LHS “team of teams” to empower stakeholders to act with shared purpose. We applied the following guiding principles:\n\n【63】#### Engage Stakeholders to Co-Design Goals, Measures of Effectiveness, and Theory of Action\n\n【64】Initial discussions focused on pressing problems of hospital surge capacity and personal protective equipment availability. By delineating scope, scale, and boundaries that made sense epidemiologically and pragmatically, decision-makers came to understand cross-sector interconnections. The result was goals, measures, and a recognition of critical stakeholders not yet connected to the response (eg, congregate care leaders).\n\n【65】#### Integrate Data Streams to Create a Single Source for Measures\n\n【66】Widely available data streams provided the foundation for a complete, holistic, and accurate regional picture, beyond its component parts. By bringing together data into a single community-wide report, stakeholders developed a more holistic view of the pandemic. For instance, they were able to observe the relationship of community incidence to hospital and congregate care facility admission, not one or the other.\n\n【67】#### Use Data to Build Shared Purpose and Overcome Competition\n\n【68】In normal circumstances, stakeholders compete — hospitals for patients, social service agencies and universities for grant dollars. System-level measures revealed opportunities for learning, catalyzing alignment, and collective action.\n\n【69】#### Unleash Community Members’ Inherent Motivation, Insight, and Expertise\n\n【70】The pandemic resulted in a spontaneous outpouring of contributions by scientists, organizations, and citizens. Harnessing such expertise added capacity and accelerated innovation (eg, voluntary participation of media companies in developing communication strategies).\n\n【71】#### Facilitate Rapid Learning\n\n【72】What was appropriate on day 1 was not on day 30. Structured improvement methods facilitated adaptation to rapidly changing context and identification of answers to emerging questions (eg, how to establish outdoor testing sites in cold weather, where to locate sites to optimize equitable access, and how to communicate to diverse populations). Small-scale testing and cross-sector learning generated the know-how needed to identify and scale up solutions.\n\n【73】### Developing an Aim and a Theory for Action\n\n【74】Aims and theory emerged from these principles. In mid-March 2020, a coalition of health care, public health, and community leaders came together, convened by the Regional Health Information Organization that serves as the hub for health information exchange and emergency preparedness. A team with expertise in design, change management, improvement, epidemiology, analytics, and community health was recruited from local academic medical centers to help assembled stakeholders create regional situational awareness and strategy. Initial participants were hospital leaders, but participation evolved and grew over time, ultimately becoming a regional multi-agency coalition (MAC) composed of leaders from stakeholder organizations and sectors.\n\n【75】Within ∼10 days of Greater Cincinnati’s first SARS-CoV-2 case, our situational awareness and strategy team worked with the growing MAC to 1) develop and agree on a shared aim — to suppress regional SARS-CoV-2 transmission to reduce disease burden while maintaining economic productivity; 2) delineate scope of activities by defining populations, geographies, and partners; and 3) identify drivers of a successfully networked system comprised of effective health care delivery, public health-driven prevention, and coordinated cross-sector planning and service delivery 删除4:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【76】Figure 1 Simplified early iteration of system-level key driver diagram showing the aim and theory for action for the regional response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The left side shows the oft-separate, siloed sectors. To connect these related but disconnected sectors for a region such as Greater Cincinnati (map in the center), there are a series of challenges (middle-top) that can be met through the identified solutions (middle-bottom). For the current pandemic, this resulted in the MAC depicted on the right. The MAC is co-chaired by the chief executive officer (CEO) of a large adult health care system and the CEO of the organization serving as both the convener of the regional disaster preparedness coalition and the Regional Health Information Organization. The MAC includes appointed representatives of regional health care systems, two public health commissioners representing regional public health jurisdictions, and a leader of the Council on Aging and CEO of a long-term care facility representing congregate care facilities (including skilled nursing facilities, jails, halfway houses, shelters, etc). Support teams include representation of infectious disease specialists, a chair of pathology representing laboratory operations, communications (linked to the Chamber of Commerce and business community), and our situational awareness and strategy team. Since the formation of the MAC, additional sectors and their representatives have been added, including those from schools and universities. Together, the MAC and teams that support the MAC focus on aims relating to disease containment, testing and tracing, nonpharmaceutical interventions, communications across sectors and with the public, and supply chain (eg, hospital beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment). Such a structure could have lasting ramifications as we seek population health situational awareness and action to outlast COVID-19.\n\n【106】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【107】Figure 3 Annotated chart depicting daily case incidence, measured per 100,000 population, with a 7-day moving average.

In the pandemic’s initial surge phase, data about stable hospital capacity informed a decision to not open Cincinnati’s convention center as a field hospital, saving tens of millions of dollars. Identification of increasing case incidence following reopening in May and June directly stimulated community-wide “mask on” communication campaigns supported by the regional Chamber of Commerce and business community. Granular depictions of geographic case clusters helped detect outbreaks in congregate care facilities and emergent racial or ethnic inequities. Geospatial analytics informed decisions about locations for community testing. Networked leaders also began using the data to drive improvement. Health departments reduced lags in contact tracing. Community testing teams worked with partnered organizations and community centers to increase demand for and accessibility of tests. Schools brought data to decisions about re-opening and improvement methods to efforts to maximize students reached while on virtual instruction.\n\n【134】COVID-19.

As possible, we used existing infrastructure. Continuous measure reviews helped identify and mitigate reporting errors and unearth immediate needs.\n\n【156】In parallel, we provided coaching in systems improvement, knowledge sharing, and community connection. We facilitated rapid learning cycles where stakeholder organizations learned from small-scale tests of changes and from one another. We continuously identified best practices from other regions, sharing knowledge back with regional partners. We identified contextual realities within neighborhoods and on the front lines, facilitating the co-design of tailored solutions.

{"seq_id": "534d96ee-f2a9-4477-a18f-834074f86df5", "title": "The Physician-Administrator Partnership at Mayo Clinic", "text": "【0】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【1】One hundred years ago, Dr Will and Dr Charlie Mayo were seeing their medical practice grow at a rate that required business practices to match. Mr William Graham, an elder brother of Edith Mayo (Mrs Charlie) and the brother of one of the original partners, Dr Christopher Graham, was asked by Dr Will to make some sense out of the partnership's books. The year was 1901, and it was rumored that the finances of the partnership were in disarray. Mr Graham, a semiretired businessman in Rochester, was then in his late 50s. From then on, Mr Graham continued to come to the business office almost daily until his death at age 93 in 1940.\n\n【2】In 1908, Dr Will decided the clinic had reached a state of organization that required more sophisticated business management. He was impressed by a 19-year-old man who had recently moved to Rochester from Winona to work at the First National Bank of Rochester. He hired young Harry Harwick, and the two of them formed the first physician-administrator partnership, a model that has served this institution well for more than 90 years.\n\n【3】In 1910, Harry Harwick married William Graham's daughter, Margaret. Their son, J. William Harwick, joined the section of administration after graduating from Dartmouth in 1935, and their daughter, Margaret, married a young internist on the Mayo staff, Dr Wallace E. Herrell. Bill Harwick became secretary of the Board of Governors in 1953, the year Harry Harwick retired after 44 years as Mayo's first chief administrative officer. Bill Harwick served the Board of Governors as secretary until he retired in 1976 as well as a brief stint as chief administrative officer from 1972 to 1976 after the retirement of Mr Slade Schuster.\n\n【4】Dr Wallace and Margaret Harwick Herrell's son, John, joined the administrative department in 1968 after a 3-year banking career in Chicago, following his graduation from the Harvard Business School. He was named chief administrative officer in 1993 and steps down from that role in 2001, 100 years after his great-grandfather first joined the Mayo partnership.\n\n【5】This obviously is the history of my family. I do not know of any other non–family-owned enterprise where one family has served in the business affairs of that enterprise for 100 continuous years. I never knew my greatgrandfather, William Graham, but I spent a great deal of time with my grandfather, Harry Harwick, and worked with my uncle, Bill Harwick, for 8 years before his retirement. These family ties bring a unique perspective to the Mayo tradition of the physician-administrator partnership model.\n\n【6】To understand the uniqueness of this physician-administrator model, it is necessary to understand the uniqueness of the Mayo business model. The professional staff at Mayo Clinic is salaried. There are no incentive pay schemes, and this is true for both physicians and professional administrators. Thus, the financial incentives of the physicians and the professional administrators are aligned. Both groups can focus on what is best for the patient without one group profiting from the other. This structure also has allowed us to set aside capital over the years to meet the institution's long-term financial needs. The practice of medicine in a not-for-profit setting will never be highly profitable because we are a group of professionals who have bonded together to conduct our professional lives within this model. If the practice is highly profitable, it will be reflected in the staff salaries. However, salaries are determined for the year, and there is no expectation of more in a given year, which would not be possible in a setting in which staff are incentivized. The lack of incentive pay allows for a margin to be saved and reinvested.\n\n【7】Another aspect of the Mayo business model that sets us apart from others in health care, particularly other academic medical centers, is the concept of physician leadership. Physician leadership does not necessarily mean physician management of everything, but physician leadership is an essential element in the direction of everything. I believe strongly that physicians are and must be responsible for what happens in the care of patients. This is true regardless of the business model. What differentiates Mayo Clinic is the structure that makes the physician accountable for what happens throughout the institution. If the institution fails, the physicians have only themselves to blame. This fact affects physician behavior at Mayo Clinic in a positive way. They must keep the institution's interests in mind because those interests are aligned with their own.\n\n【8】In the typical academic medical center, administrators and physicians are constantly jockeying for position and advantage. Their relationship appears to be adversarial, and their interests are often not aligned. Prior to 1986, Mayo Clinic suffered from some characteristics of such a misalignment when Saint Marys and Rochester Methodist hospitals were separately managed and governed. Because of the closed staff nature of these hospitals and the unique character of the Sisters of Saint Francis, however, alignment of interests was not as bad as may typically be found in other settings, but it was far from perfect. The integration of Mayo Clinic with Saint Marys and Rochester Methodist hospitals in 1986 was a watershed event in the history of the institution. At that point, we brought the cooperative physician-administrator model, which had existed in the outpatient setting for 78 years, to the inpatient setting, beginning with the relationship developed by my grandfather and Dr Will. We now manage our hospital environments with a triumvirate of a physician leader, a nurse leader, and a senior administrator. This team ensures that the nursing staff has input into management of the hospital in a way seldom if ever seen at other medical institutions.\n\n【9】We now can focus all our attention on what is best for the patient, both clinically and financially. We now consciously blur the distinction between outpatient and inpatient care, again with the only consideration being the best interest of the patient. Sadly many medical centers spend too much time and energy protecting their separate inpatient and outpatient turfs.\n\n【10】The last distinguishing feature of the Mayo business model is the centralized purse. Fees and salaries are set centrally and not by each department, as is typical of most major medical centers. Department chairs are asked to concentrate on quality, the efficient use of resources, and the personal development of their colleagues. Mayo is a meritocracy. There are no haves and have-nots. Research ideas are funded based on their merits, not on how much revenue a department can generate. Capital is allocated to the greatest clinical need. The integrated practice is reinforced by integrated finances.\n\n【11】It is this integrated financial structure that allows for and fosters cooperation among the members of the staff. No one loses when a patient is referred to a colleague, and the patient wins, with the assurance that the clinician with the best expertise in a given area is the one focused on the patient's problem. Human beings are economic animals and respond to economic stimuli. We have worked very hard at Mayo to remove the stimuli that work against the patient's interest and the interests of our colleagues. If there is a weakness, it is the lack of incentive to work harder and longer. However, I have always marveled at the dedication and selfless effort Mayo staff bring to their jobs. I cannot explain it with economic theory, but I believe it is the result of the peer review and peer interactions inherent in the integrated practice. All of us interact to an unusual degree with our colleagues, and the pride of belonging to a successful team is the prime motivator.\n\n【12】Having said all this, I would like to focus on the physician-administrator partnership that has developed at Mayo Clinic and make some observations about how it developed and where it is heading. The administrative people who have served this institution for 100 years have shared a common attribute: They have all believed deeply in the values of the institution and have taken great pride in its accomplishments. The pursuit of personal wealth is certainly not high on anyone's list, or we would not be here. Just as our physician colleagues, we are salaried with no bonuses, no profit sharing, and no stock options. Most of my classmates from the Harvard Business School have done a little better financially than I have. But I, like many of my administrative colleagues, was attracted to a higher calling. I was working for a Chicago commercial bank in 1968 and mentioned to my mother that working at the Mayo Clinic must be gratifying, given the noble purpose of the institution. I never considered actually doing it. She obviously talked with her brother, Bill Harwick, and shortly thereafter I received a call from Slade Schuster saying they needed someone in finance within the Mayo Department of Administration. After a period of introspection, I dragged my poor wife, kicking and screaming, from Chicago to Rochester. The rest is history. All the chief administrative officers of Mayo after my grandfather, except Bob Fleming, were born in Rochester and all understood the culture and values of this great institution. Bob Fleming came to Rochester in his early 20s to play hockey for the Mustangs, a local semiprofessional team, got a job in the business office, and spent more than 40 years at Mayo Clinic. We all believed in the greatness of Mayo Clinic and were motivated by a desire to be part of it. It is remarkable that H. J. Harwick has had only 5 successors: Slade Schuster, Bill Harwick, Bob Roesler, Bob Fleming, and me.\n\n【13】The great disappointment I have had as an administrator at Mayo Clinic is that occasionally I encounter an attitude among my physician colleagues that assumes that I have an agenda different from theirs. At times, some of the physicians seem to assume that administrators only care about money and do not share the physician's values. If we cared only about money, we would not be here. Administrators do not receive a bonus if the institution makes more money. The business model I described earlier is carefully designed to align our interests, not to create competing forces. The physicians have as much at stake as administrators do to ensure that the institution prospers financially. Administrators have as much at stake as the physicians do to ensure that the patients are well cared for and that our research and education programs are second to none. As I said earlier, the physicians are responsible and accountable for the success of the institution. Administrators are responsible and accountable to our physician colleagues to help make that happen. We have knowledge and skills they may not have and play a vital role in this institution's success, but the measures of success are identical for both groups.\n\n【14】As Mayo Clinic becomes larger and more complex, the management skills of people trained in management and its allied professions will become even more important in ensuring the future of the institution, which is too complex to be managed by amateurs. I would entreat my physician colleagues not to become overly enamored with becoming business managers. Trust your administrative colleagues to have your best interests at heart. The practicing physician acting in a part-time management capacity with an educated, experienced, and trained administrative colleague is a model that works best for this institution. It ensures that everything we do is done with a physician's perspective in an efficient and effective way.\n\n【15】At the end of this year, I will step down as chief administrative officer, and for the first time in 100 years, no member of my family will be engaged in the management of Mayo Clinic's business affairs. I hope the Graham-Harwick-Herrell family will be remembered as one that has contributed in a remarkable way to this great institution. It has been good to us, and I believe we have earned our keep. The future is truly exciting to behold. The information revolution and the genomic revolution are waiting for Mayo to take a leadership role, and we are in a great position to do so. The physicians, other scientists, and administrators on our staff have the talent and ability to take this institution to greater heights. Mayo has the financial, intellectual, cultural, and physical resources to make that happen, and I am proud that my family and I have played a role in the creation of that potential.\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【18】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/76.1.107</u></u>\n\n【19】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【20】无关删除-1:<u>© 2001 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

For this reason, Vogt et al undertook an analysis of the large database of patients screened for the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) to determine whether simple self-reported items among these women could predict whether prevalent vertebral fractures would be found on radiographic screening. Based on these data from FIT, the authors developed a Prevalent Vertebral Fracture Index (PVFI) consisting of only 5 questions. The calculation of the PVFI included 1 to 3 points for height loss, diagnosis of osteoporosis, age, and history of nonvertebral fractures and 6 points for a history of vertebral fracture. Since the presumed purpose of the PVFI is to predict who might have undiagnosed vertebral fractures, the last component of the calculation seems to be of questionable clinical utility. However, when the 7.5% of patients who had a history of vertebral fracture were removed from the analysis, a score based only on the other 4 questions was still highly predictive. More importantly, the predictive value of the PVFI was independent of bone mineral density (BMD) measured at the femoral neck in this population. These 4 survey questions remained significant predictors of vertebral fracture in the final multiple variable logistic regression model that included the femoral neck BMD with age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.7 to 3.0. A history of vertebral fractures yielded an OR of 10.9. Several of the other “traditional” risk factors were found to be associated with an increased likelihood of radiographic vertebral compression in this population, including current smoking, lack of exercise, and a history of falls, although none had an age-adjusted OR greater than 1.4. Nevertheless, these still represent risk factors for osteoporotic fractures that clinicians should consider.</u>\n\n【6】How might these data help the clinician, patient, and health care policy maker deal with the clinical, social, and economic issues surrounding osteoporosis screening? Before considering this question, it is important to recognize that this large study, which involved 13,372 patients in whom radiographs were analyzed, has 2 limitations: the population was selected for its interest in a clinical trial in osteoporosis and the femoral bone density T scores were −1.6 or lower. Hence the data may not be applicable to an un selected population. Nonetheless, this study emphasizes a point that has received increasing recognition in recent years, BMD. T scores are not the only determinants of fracture risk.

(1) Who should have a BMD measurement and which sites should be measured? (2) How should a prevention and treatment program be planned for the individual patient based not only on the BMD but also on an analysis of all relevant risk factors for fracture? The current data on vertebral fracture prevalence in FIT point to a third question. (3) Should patients at high risk have radiographs to assess vertebral fractures?

What has not been established is how different screening instruments should be used. The most difficult decision is in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have not had a fragility fracture and are not taking estrogen. In these women, a family history of osteoporosis, low body weight, or some aspect of their lifestyle may increase their risk and lead to further evaluation. These factors, combined with height loss, might justify lateral spine films. However, these films are costly and must be interpreted by an experienced radiologist. Moreover, the presence of asymptomatic fractures may have relatively little effect on patient management. Finally, a key factor in determining the extent of diagnostic effort is patient and public concern.\n\n【71】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kazanjian A\n*   Green CJ\n*   Bassett K\n*   Brunger F</u>\n\n【72】Bone mineral density testing in social context.\n\n【73】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Int J Technol Assess Health Care._ 1999; 15 : 679-685</u></u>\n\n【74】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【75】Many postmenopausal women today are so concerned about their risk of osteoporosis that they demand BMD measurements.

This should be anticipated and publicly acknowledged to prevent panic. However, these conditions do not mean that epidemic or, especially, pandemic human disease is imminent, considering that since 2003 more than 100 million domestic and wild birds have been infected throughout Asia and these birds lived among several billion humans, including many rural farmers who have been in direct contact with infected birds. Despite this, less than 130 human cases have been reported to date, nearly all in individuals with very close and prolonged contact with birds. Moreover, there have been no documented human cases outside of the cluster of affected Southeast Asian countries. It must be reemphasized that major genetic alterations in the virus will have to occur before rapid human-to-human spread-vis-à-vis epidemic and, ultimately, pandemic disease-is likely to occur.\n\n【128】With the approaching influenza season in the United States, the media are giving avian influenza enormous attention and, with the recent outbreak of SARS fresh in the public mind,\n\n【129】无关删除-2:<u>*   Sampathkumar P\n*   Temesgen Z\n*   Smith TF\n*   Thompson RL</u>\n\n【130】SARS: epidemiology, clinical presentation, management, and infection control measures.\n\n【131】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2003; 78 : 882-890</u></u>\n\n【132】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (68)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【133】there is growing anxiety about avian influenza and what we can do as individuals to protect ourselves and our families. We offer the following suggestions to practicing physicians that may help in answering questions that patients are asking.\n\n【134】1. WILL Getting A Flu Shot Protect Me From Avian Influenza?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【135】No, the annual flu shot will not provide any protection against the new avian H5N1 influenza strain that originated in Asia. However, the current endemic strains that predictably cause epidemic disease each winter kill 30,000 to 50,000 individuals in the United States each year, and getting the 2005–2006 flu shot remains as important this year as ever. This shot is especially important for the elderly, the immunocompromised, pregnant women, children, and all who come in contact with these high-risk groups, including other family members, household contacts, and health care workers. Being immunized greatly reduces elderly or otherwise vulnerable persons' risk of becoming so ill with flu caused by these strains that they have to be hospitalized or die.\n\n【136】2. What Can I Do To Protect Myself Against Influenza-Especially If I Travel Frequently?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【137】Travelers to countries where avian influenza is endemic in bird populations should avoid contact with poultry or contact with surfaces that may have been contaminated by poultry or their feces or secretions. This includes visits to poultry farms or visiting “wet markets” where live birds are sold or places where wild birds congregate in large numbers. Consumption of uncooked poultry or poultry products from these countries should also be avoided. Freezing and refrigeration do not substantially reduce the concentration or virulence of these viruses in meat; thus, it is essential to follow safe food-handling procedures 删除4:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【138】TABLE 2 Avian Influenza and Safe Food-Handling Practices\n\n| Separate raw meat from cooked or ready-to-eat foods. Do not use same chopping board or knife, do not place cooked meat back on same surface it was on before cookingDo not use raw or soft-boiled eggs in food preparations that will not subsequently be cookedWash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling frozen or thawed poultry. Wash or disinfect surfaces and utensils that have been in contact with raw poultryCook food thoroughly. Ensure that poultry meat reaches 70°C (158°F) or that the meat is no longer pink. Eggs should not be runny |\n| --- |\n\n【140】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【141】It must be emphasized that there is no evidence whatsoever that domestic poultry products purchased in North America pose any risk. However, all foods of avian origin-eggs and poultry meat-must be cooked well, mainly to prevent infection caused by enteric bacteria such as _Salmonella_ and _Campylobacter_ . The avian influenza virus is rapidly killed by heat; hence, eating adequately cooked poultry products, even if they were contaminated by avian influenza virus, would not pose a health hazard.\n\n【142】These precautions may be especially important for persons who hunt and eat wild waterfowl. The evidence suggests that the H5N1 avian influenza virus is being spread beyond Asia by migratory water birds, especially ducks. It is likely that the Asian H5N1 strain will be detected in North American birds before long, having spread from Siberia on flyways through Alaska and Canada, and wild ducks or geese are likely to be the first North American birds to be infected.\n\n【143】Practicing consistent hand hygiene reduces the risk of transmission of most respiratory infections. This can be done by conventional hand washing with soap and water or by using alcohol-based, waterless hand sanitizers when hands are not visibly soiled. Hand sanitizers, especially in the convenient travel-size personal containers, are often a more practical option for the traveler.\n\n【144】At this time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not recommended that the general public avoid travel to any country affected by avian influenza. However, checking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention travel Web site  for the most current information before a future trip is prudent.\n\n【145】3. Do Antivirals Work? Should I Have My Own Supply Of Antivirals?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【146】The H5N1 virus is resistant to the oldest class of antivirals effective against the influenza A virus, the adamantanes-amantadine and rimantadine. In contrast, the neuraminidase inhibitors-oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza)-have been shown to have good activity against most of the H5N1 strains.\n\n【147】Giving prescriptions for these drugs to individual patients in advance of a pandemic, with no justifiable immediate clinical indication, means that the limited supplies of these medications may be diverted from persons who need them, especially elderly and other compromised persons with acute influenza, and will create an even greater shortage of these drugs. Widespread, inappropriate use of these drugs may also promote drug resistance. Many health care centers, including the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, have preemptively restricted prescribing of oseltamivir, limiting it to patients with clear indications for treatment of probable influenza or its prevention. The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society of Healthcare Epidemiologists of America recently issued a joint position statement urging very restricted use of this class of anti-influenza drugs, and many state health departments have followed suit. The manufacturer recently halted shipments of oseltamivir.\n\n【148】From a public health standpoint, it is extremely important that any suspected human cases of Asian H5N1 influenza be immediately reported to the local and state public health authorities, and self-treatment may delay or prevent such reporting.\n\n【149】For all these reasons, we do not recommend giving prescriptions for oseltamivir or alternative antivirals to travelers to countries with current avian influenza outbreaks.\n\n【150】For the latest updates on avian influenza, see the following Web sites:\n\n【151】Tabled 1\n\n删除3:<u>| Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | www.cdc.gov/flu.avian |</u>\n| --- | --- |\n删除3:<u>| Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Travelers' Health | www.cdc.gov/travel |</u>\n删除3:<u>| World Health Organization | www.who.int/csr/disease/avian\\_influenza |</u>\n删除3:<u>| New Scientist Bird Flu | www.newscientist.com/channel/health/bird-flu |</u>\n\n【153】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Omic platforms such as expression arrays and mass spectrometry, with their exquisite selectivity, sensitivity, and specificity, are unrivaled technologies for detection, quantitation, and identification of DNA, messenger RNA, proteins, and metabolites derived from complex body tissue and fluids. More recently, attempts have been made to capture the utility of these platform technologies and combine them under the umbrella of systems biology, also referred to as pathway, network, or integrative biology. Applied systems biology is the integrated analysis of genetic, genomic, protein, metabolite, cellular, and pathway events that are in flux and interdependent. It necessitates the use of a variety of analytic platforms as well as biostatistics, bioinformatics, data integration, computational biology, modeling, and knowledge assembly protocols. Such sophisticated analyses may provide new insight into the understanding of disease processes and mechanisms of action of pharmaceutical agents. Ultimately, this requires a perspective on how complex systems behave and are modulated. In this regard, systems biology, more appropriately considered as a process containing a series of modules, aims to provide tools and capabilities to carry out such tasks. We describe the essentials required to carry out systems biology experiments, the method in which integrated data in the form of a systems biology correlation network affords new insight into understanding disease, and the vista of developing more efficient biomarkers and therapeutic agents.\n\n【1】L-FABP ( liver fatty acid-binding protein ), mRNA ( messenger RNA )\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

If you or your child will be receiving midazolam during surgery, your doctor or anesthesiologist will give you the medicine.\n\n【41】After you receive midazolam, you or your child will be watched closely to make sure this medicine is working. Your breathing, blood pressure, nervous system, and heart will also be watched closely to make sure the medicine is not causing unwanted side effects.\n\n【42】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【43】If you will be receiving midazolam before surgery, your doctor will give you the medicine and closely follow your progress, to make sure this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【44】Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby.

He was known to deprive himself of sleep for days so that he would have more time to paint the images of hallucinations that crept through his head and on the walls of his studio. His personal style was labeled _bimorphic abstraction_ because his designs are curvicular and fluid and have more organic than geometric formations.\n\n【2】The forms of his paintings, often whimsical and playful, are organized against flat neutral backgrounds in a range of brilliant colors, especially blue, red, yellow, green, and black. Amorphous amoebic shapes alternate with sharply drawn lines, spots, and curlicues, all positioned on the canvas with seeming nonchalance.\n\n【3】The series of large lithographs by Miró that hang on the rear wall of the Desk C reception area in the Hilton Building suggest Miró's work during the late 1920s and early 1930s. With his unique style of brightly colored abstracted forms, childlike in their simplicity and informal use of space, Miró combined stars, moons, and creatures with human or animal-like characteristics.\n\n【4】These lithographs were a gift to Mayo Foundation in December 1991 from Mr and Mrs Miles Q.

{"seq_id": "351232cf-1f20-4a91-a841-df7fd4df43d2", "title": "Heat rash", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Heat rash — also known as prickly heat and miliaria — isn't just for babies. It affects adults, too, especially in hot, humid conditions.\n\n【2】Heat rash occurs when sweat is trapped in the skin. Symptoms can range from small blisters to deep, inflamed lumps. Some forms of heat rash are very itchy.\n\n【3】Heat rash usually goes away once the skin cools down. Severe forms of the condition might need treatment from a health care provider.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Adults usually develop heat rash in skin folds and where clothing rubs against the skin. In infants, the rash is mainly found on the neck, shoulders and chest. It can also show up in the armpits, elbow creases and groin.\n\n【6】### Types of heat rash\n\n【7】The types of heat rash are classified according to how deep the sweat is trapped in the skin. Signs and symptoms for each type vary.\n\n【8】*   The mildest form of heat rash is called miliaria crystallina. It occurs when the opening of the sweat duct on the surface of the skin (sweat pore) is blocked. This form is marked by tiny, clear, fluid-filled bumps that break easily.\n*   A type that occurs deeper in the skin is called miliaria rubra. It is sometimes called prickly heat. Signs and symptoms include small, inflamed blister-like bumps and itching or prickling in the affected area.\n*   Occasionally, the inflamed bumps of miliaria rubra fill with pus. This form is called miliaria pustulosa.\n*   A less common form of heat rash is called miliaria profunda. It affects the deepest layer of the skin (dermis). It causes firm, painful or itchy inflamed bumps that look like goose bumps and may break open.\n\n【9】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【10】Heat rash usually heals by cooling the skin and avoiding exposure to the heat that caused it. See your health care provider if you or your child has symptoms that last longer than a few days or the rash seems to be getting worse.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】Heat rash develops when a duct that leads from a sweat gland to the surface of the skin is blocked or inflamed. This then blocks the opening of the sweat duct on the surface of the skin (sweat pore). Instead of evaporating, sweat is trapped beneath the skin, causing irritation and bumps on the skin.\n\n【13】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【14】Factors that increase the risk of heat rash include:\n\n【15】*   Being a newborn, as newborns have immature sweat ducts\n*   Living in a hot, humid climate\n*   Being physically active\n*   Being on bedrest for a long time and having a fever\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】Heat rash usually heals without scarring. People with brown or Black skin are at risk of spots of skin that get lighter or darker in response to inflammatory skin conditions (postinflammatory hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation). These changes usually go away within weeks or months.\n\n【18】A common complication is infection with bacteria, causing inflamed and itchy pustules.\n\n【19】Prevention\n----------\n\n【20】To help protect yourself or your child from heat rash:\n\n【21】*   In hot weather, dress in loose, lightweight clothing that wicks moisture away from the skin. Don't wrap newborns in too many layers.\n*   In hot weather, limit physical activity. Stay in the shade or in an air-conditioned building. Or use a fan to circulate the air.\n*   Keep your sleeping area cool and well ventilated.\n*   Avoid creams and ointments that can block pores.\n*   Avoid drugs that cause sweating, such as clonidine, beta blockers and opioids.\n\n【22】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

New users of febuxostat and allopurinol between April 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 were identified, and the two groups were 1:1 matched by propensity score, benzbromarone use history, renal impairment, and time of drug initiation. The risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), venous thromboembolism (VTE), heart failure (HF) hospitalization, atrial fibrillation hospitalization, cardiovascular (CV) death, and all-cause mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. The dose-response relationship between xanthine oxidase inhibitor use and adverse CV outcomes were also determined.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 44,111 patients were included for each group, and all baseline covariates were well matched. Febuxostat users were at a significantly higher risk for HF hospitalization (hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.13-1.33), atrial fibrillation hospitalization (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05-1.36), and CV death (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03-1.36) than allopurinol users, whereas no difference was found for the major adverse cardiac events composite endpoint, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and all-cause mortality. The elevated risk of HF hospitalization was consistent throughout the primary and sensitivity analyses. In addition, febuxostat increased the risk of adverse CV outcomes in a dose-dependent manner.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The use of febuxostat, compared with allopurinol, was associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse CV events. Higher febuxostat doses had a greater impact. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms linking febuxostat to adverse CV outcomes.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AF ( atrial fibrillation ), CV ( cardiovascular ), DDD ( defined daily dose ), HF ( heart failure ), MACE ( major adverse cardiovascular event ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), PS ( propensity score ), VTE ( venous thromboembolism ), XOI ( xanthine oxidase inhibitor )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Most children outgrow it.\n\n【2】Kids who continue toe walking beyond the toddler years often do so out of habit. As long as your child is growing and developing normally, toe walking is unlikely to be a cause for concern.\n\n【3】Toe walking sometimes can result from certain conditions, including cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and autism spectrum disorder.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Toe walking is walking on the toes or the ball of the foot.\n\n【6】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【7】If your child is still toe walking after age 2, talk to your doctor about it. Make an appointment sooner if your child also has tight leg muscles, stiffness in the Achilles tendon or a lack of muscle coordination.\n\n【8】Causes\n------\n\n【9】Typically, toe walking is a habit that develops when a child learns to walk. In a few cases, toe walking is caused by an underlying condition, such as:\n\n【10】*   **A short Achilles tendon.** This tendon links the lower leg muscles to the back of the heel bone. If it's too short, it can prevent the heel from touching the ground.\n*   **Cerebral palsy.** Toe walking can be caused by a disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture caused by injury or abnormal development in the parts of the immature brain that control muscle function.\n*   **Muscular dystrophy.** Toe walking sometimes occurs in this genetic disease in which muscle fibers are unusually prone to damage and weaken over time. This diagnosis might be more likely if your child initially walked normally before starting to toe walk.\n*   **Autism.** Toe walking has been linked to autism spectrum disorders, which affect a child's ability to communicate and interact with others.\n\n【11】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【12】Toe walking out of habit, also known as idiopathic toe walking, sometimes runs in families.\n\n【13】Complications\n-------------\n\n【14】Persistent toe walking can increase a child's risk of falling.

We considered AF diagnosed at 30 days or fewer before or any time after GD and de novo HFrEF not explained by ischemia, valve disorder, or other cardiomyopathy at/after GD diagnosis.

{"seq_id": "46f2ba6e-cce4-42b1-a52e-e1178e6cfdaf", "title": "Chronic exertional compartment syndrome", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Chronic exertional compartment syndrome is an exercise-induced muscle and nerve condition that causes pain, swelling and sometimes disability in the affected muscles of the legs or arms. Anyone can develop the condition, but it's more common in young adult runners and athletes who participate in activities that involve repetitive impact.\n\n【2】Chronic exertional compartment syndrome may respond to nonsurgical treatment and activity modification. If nonsurgical treatment doesn't help, your doctor might recommend surgery. Surgery is successful for many people and might allow you to return to your sport.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Your limbs have specific areas of muscle (compartments). Your lower leg, for example, has four compartments. Chronic exertional compartment syndrome often occurs in the same compartment of an affected limb on both sides of the body, usually the lower leg.\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms can include:\n\n【6】*   Aching, burning or cramping pain in a compartment of the affected limb\n*   Tightness in the affected limb\n*   Numbness or tingling in the affected limb\n*   Weakness of the affected limb\n*   Foot drop, in severe cases, if legs are affected\n*   Occasionally, swelling or bulging as a result of a muscle hernia\n\n【7】Pain caused by chronic exertional compartment syndrome typically follows this pattern:\n\n【8】*   Begins consistently after a certain time, distance or intensity of exertion after you start exercising the affected limb\n*   Progressively worsens as you exercise\n*   Becomes less intense or stops completely within 15 minutes of stopping the activity\n*   Over time, recovery time after exercise may increase\n\n【9】Taking a complete break from exercise or performing only low-impact activity might relieve your symptoms, but relief is usually only temporary. Once you take up running again, for instance, those familiar symptoms usually come back.\n\n【10】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【11】If you have recurring unusual pain, swelling, weakness, loss of sensation or soreness while exercising or participating in sports activities, talk to your doctor.\n\n【12】Sometimes chronic exertional compartment syndrome is mistaken for shin splints, a more common cause of leg pain in young people who do a lot of vigorous weight-bearing activity, such as running. If you think you have shin splints and the pain doesn't get better with self-care, talk to your doctor.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】The cause of chronic exertional compartment syndrome isn't completely understood. When you exercise, your muscles expand in volume. If you have chronic exertional compartment syndrome, the tissue that encases the affected muscle (fascia) doesn't expand with the muscle, causing pressure and pain in a compartment of the affected limb.\n\n【15】Some experts suggest that how you move while exercising might have a role in causing chronic exertional compartment syndrome. Other causes might include having muscles that enlarge excessively during exercise, having an especially inflexible fascia surrounding the affected muscle compartment or having high pressure within your veins.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】Certain factors increase your risk of developing chronic exertional compartment syndrome, including:\n\n【18】*   **Age.** Although people of any age can develop chronic exertional compartment syndrome, the condition is most common in male and female athletes under age 30.\n*   **Type of exercise.** Repetitive impact activity — such as running — increases your risk of developing the condition.\n*   **Overtraining.** Working out too intensely or too frequently also can raise your risk of chronic exertional compartment syndrome.\n\n【19】Complications\n-------------\n\n【20】Chronic exertional compartment syndrome isn't a life-threatening condition and usually doesn't cause lasting damage if you get appropriate treatment. However, pain, weakness or numbness associated with chronic exertional compartment syndrome may prevent you from continuing to exercise or practice your sport at the same level of intensity.\n\n【21】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Non-Somali Olmsted County residents served as controls.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】For Somali males and females, age-adjusted proportions (per 1000 population) were 209 and 123 for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), 644 and 541 for hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), and 99 and 66 for anti-HCV. The comparative proportions in non-Somalis were 20 and 9 for HBsAg, 126 and 97 for HBcAb, and 32 and 17 for anti-HCV.

Somalia is in a high prevalence region for HBV but has not been reported to have a high prevalence of HCV infection. No studies on the epidemiology of viral hepatitis in Somalia have been reported since 1992, and few data are available on HBV and HCV prevalence among Somalis who have immigrated to Europe and North America.

Therefore, we studied a sample of Somali immigrants in Minnesota to determine the proportions with chronic HBV infection or prior exposure (as determined by HbsAg and HBcAb serologic testing) and with chronic HCV infection (as determined by anti-HCV serologic testing and HCV RNA testing) and the associations of these infections with HCC. We also investigated the proportion of patients who were diagnosed as having viral hepatitis at the time of HCC diagnosis and the proportion of patients who were in a surveillance program at the time of diagnosis of HCC. The goals of the study were (1) to estimate the proportion of Somali immigrants seen at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, who had positive HBV and HCV test results and (2) to determine the association of HBV and HCV infection with HCC in Somali immigrants and the timing of HBV, HCV, and HCC diagnosis among HCC patients in the Somali immigrant population.\n\n【89】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【90】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification of Study Participants</u>\n\n【91】无关删除-1:<u>We searched the Mayo Clinic Life Sciences System (MCLSS) database from July 1, 1996, through October 31, 2009, to identify all Somali patients seen at Mayo Clinic who had tests performed for HBV or HCV infection or who were diagnosed as having HCC during the study period. We used Boolean combinations, namely conjunction (AND), disjunction (OR), and negation (NOT), to detect the different combinations of the _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision_ codes for HBsAg, HBcAb, anti-HCV, and HCC. The MCLSS was then used to query the medical record database to detect the words _Somali_ , _Somalian,_ or _Somalia_ in the patients' clinical notes. The medical records of patients included in this study were compiled by 3 of the authors (A.M.S. J.K.K. and D.S.S.). To further confirm the ethnicity of identified patients, medical records of these patients were screened by 2 authors (A.M.S. and N.H.G.), who are both of Somali heritage.

Consequently, HCV seropositivity was found to have the strongest association with HCC in Somalis (OR, 31.3), making HCV the primary viral cause of HCC in this Somali sample. Although the OR had wide CIs due to the relatively small number of HCC cases, the association is so strong that it is likely to be validated in larger studies. Because of unavailability of HCV genotype in all 30 Somali HCC patients, it could not be conclusively determined whether a particular HCV genotype was more closely associated with HCC in Somalis.

Our new data show a high proportion of anti-HCV positivity, confirmed by HCV RNA, in Somali immigrants in Minnesota and a strong association with HCC in this population. In a substantial proportion of cases the diagnosis of HCV infection was made at the time of HCC diagnosis, and the opportunity to enroll patients in a surveillance program to allow detection of HCC at an early stage was missed. Consequently, only a few HCCs were detected during surveillance in this population. Significant differences were also observed in the HCV genotypes isolated from Somalis vs non-Somalis. Because there are a growing number of newly identified chronic HCV cases each year in Minnesota, it is important to confirm our observations in additional studies. In particular, this study is subject to potential selection bias because of the likelihood that individuals with clinically concerning elevations in levels of liver enzymes would preferentially be subject to screening. These individuals would also be more likely to have severe disease and a higher risk of HCC. It is important to perform population-based studies with random screening of the immigrant Somali population using both anti-HCV and HCV RNA testing to determine the true prevalence of HCV infection in the population. These additional studies could address other potentially significant factors not addressed in this study, including the relevance of time spent in Somalia or in refugee camps in neighboring states in determining the risk of HCV infection and the importance of aflatoxin exposure in determining risk of HCC. The Institute of Medicine also made 4 major recommendations to address the persistent transmission of HBV and HCV within the population and the incomplete identification and medical treatment of individuals with chronic viral hepatitis: (1) improvements in surveillance for HBV and HCV infections; (2) programs to improve knowledge and awareness, especially for at-risk individuals; (3) improvements in HBV vaccine coverage; and (4) improvements in access to services for viral hepatitis patients.</u>\n\n【189】无关删除-1:<u></u>\n\n【190】无关删除-2:<u>无关删除-1:<u>*   Mitchell A.E.\n*   Colvin H.M.\n*   Palmer Beasley R.</u></u>\n\n【191】无关删除-1:<u>Institute of Medicine recommendations for the prevention and control of hepatitis B and C.</u>\n\n【192】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>_Hepatology._ 2010; 51 : 729-733</u></u>\n\n【193】无关删除-2:<u>无关删除-1:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (156)\n*   Google Scholar</u></u>\n\n【194】无关删除-1:<u>If our findings are confirmed, it would be appropriate to recommend that immigrants and refugees from high-risk regions be screened for HCV on entry into the United States and that appropriate therapy for anti-HCV–positive individuals and/or regular surveillance for those at risk for HCC be instituted to reduce the long-term morbidity and mortality due to this virus.</u>\n\n【195】无关删除-1:<u>Conclusion\n----------</u>\n\n【196】无关删除-1:<u>This retrospective, clinic- and hospital-based pilot study of HBV and HCV infection among Somalis conducted at Mayo Clinic produced important evidence of high frequencies of chronic HBV and HCV among this new immigrant population to the United States.

He suggests that this model should supplant traditional fee for service. We concur that a fixed annual payment would be one good model for providing health care to a defined group of patients who receive all their care from 1 provider or provider-based system. Kaiser Permanente is certainly a good example of how this model can offer high-quality health care through a capitated model. However, many patients obtain care from multiple providers. We envision a more pluralistic model in which patients can choose coordinated networks for care or can choose their own providers—as long as the patient is willing to bear any potential additional cost. In addition, recent evidence suggests that large integrated multispecialty group practices exhibit efficiencies similar to those shown by prepaid group practices such as Kaiser.\n\n【2】无关删除-2:<u>*   Goodman DC\n*   Stukel TA\n*   Chang CH\n*   Wennberg JE</u>\n\n【3】End-of-life care at academic medical centers: implications for future workforce requirements.\n\n【4】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Health Aff (Millwood)._ 2006; 25 : 521-531</u></u>\n\n【5】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (32)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【6】Thus, the integrated multispecialty organization of care may be more important than whether the group is in a capitated or a fee-for-service environment. The reform principles we espouse, based on the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan model, allow patients to choose the type of insurance coverage best suited to their needs and to pay any resulting attendant costs. With a “Learning Organization for Health Care” as the system vision, patient care will become better coordinated than in today's version of fee for service.\n\n【7】Economy of scale is one way to enhance efficiency. Dr Murro believes that administrative costs would be lower if private health care insurance was eliminated. We assume his alternative would then be a single-payer model. Although some administrative efficiency may occur in a single-payer model, we believe that such a model is antithetic to a market-based system. When there is only 1 payer, that payer sets prices and makes the rules. We do not believe that this model would foster the innovation and competition we envision in a national learning organization for health care, which would likely result in more integration of care, enhanced efficiency, and lower cost.\n\n【8】We agree that health insurance tax policy needs to be addressed. The current system tilts toward employer-provided insurance and against individual insurance or self-pay. Furthermore, the greater benefit goes to those with higher incomes. We have recommended a model in which those with financial need will receive government assistance with health insurance premiums, either through vouchers or refundable tax credits. A logical next step would be to limit the tax exclusion of employer-provided insurance. This would help level the playing field. It would also generate revenue to help the government provide financial assistance for lower-income individuals to purchase private health care insurance through a Federal Employees Health Benefits plan model.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

His father was a wealthy landholder, and his mother came from a family of eminent scientists who instilled in Albert the love of science. His maternal grandfather and great-grandfather were professors of anatomy and physiology in Vienna (Austria), and his uncle Michael (Mih´ly) von Lenhossék (1863–1937) was a well-known histologist.\n\n【2】Szent-Györgyi entered the University of Budapest Medical School, and his first scientific paper was on the epithelium of the anus. He became disenchanted with histology and entered the Medical Corps during World War I (1914–1918). He was awarded the Silver Medal for valor and was returned to Budapest. In 1917, he received his MD degree and served in the army's bacteriological laboratories, where he criticized experiments of questionable value performed on Italian prisoners of war. Subsequently, he worked in a pharmaceutical laboratory in Pozsony (Bratislava), studied electrophysiology in Prague (Czechoslovakia) and physical chemistry in Berlin (Germany), joined the Institute for Tropical Hygiene in Hamburg (Germany), and obtained a position at the Institute of Pharmacology of the University of Leiden (the Netherlands). He moved to the Physiological Institute in Groningen (the Netherlands), where he produced experimental fistulas in dogs. During this time, he became interested in the mechanism of respiration in living cells. While working on plant tissue, he noted that the addition of peroxide to a mixture of peroxidase and benzidine produced a blue color from the oxidation of the benzidine. The addition of a peroxidase-rich plant such as cabbage or an orange caused a delay in that reaction. He reasoned that an agent present in the plant inhibited the oxidation of benzidine.\n\n【3】Szent-Györgyi wrote an article on the respiratory mechanism in the potato, but the new chair of physiology at the Physiological Institute was interested primarily in animal physiology and suggested that Szent -Györgyi toss the manuscript into a wastebasket because it was totally irrelevant. However, a little-known journal accepted the article, and at the International Physiological Congress in Stockholm in 1926, British biochemist Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins (1861–1947) mentioned the potato paper no fewer than 3 times in his presidential address. Szent-Györgyi introduced himself to Professor Hopkins, who suggested that Szent-Györgyi come to Cambridge (England) and join his department of physiology. At Cambridge, Szent-Györgyi sought to isolate from oranges, lemons, and cabbages the ingredient that inhibited oxidation. His thesis on this substance, which he named _hexuronic acid_ , earned him his PhD degree. Because he could obtain only a few milligrams of this compound from plants, he attempted to extract it from adrenal glands.\n\n【4】Dr Edward C. Kendall (1886–1972), director of the Division of Biochemistry at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, invited Szent-Györgyi to spend a year working with him at Mayo. Szent-Györgyi found Minnesota “not especially interesting but the people very nice.” He readily obtained adrenal glands from the stockyard in St Paul (Minn) and returned to Cambridge University with 25 g of hexuronic acid.\n\n【5】In 1930, Szent-Györgyi was asked by the Hungarian minister of education to return to Hungary and revitalize the scientific community there. He became chair of medical chemistry at the University of Szeged (southern Hungary). He and his colleagues determined that hexuronic acid was identical to vitamin C. In Birmingham (England), he and Walter N. Haworth (1883–1950) renamed the substance _ascorbic acid_ . Szent-Györgyi found that paprika, a sweet red pepper grown in Hungary, contained large amounts of ascorbic acid. His laboratory produced more than 3 kg of the substance and distributed it to investigators throughout the world. He became interested in myosin and noted that muscles contracted with the addition of “myosin B.” One of his laboratory colleagues identified the active substance as actin and demonstrated that it contained all the properties of myosin B; thus, it was named _actomyosin_ .\n\n【6】Szent-Györgyi an antifascist, was placed under house arrest during World War II but escaped to the Swedish Embassy in Budapest. He was smuggled out of the embassy in the trunk of a car and remained in hiding until the Soviet troops arrived. After a short visit in Russia, he returned to reorganize the Academy of Science in Hungary. Through the intervention of US scientists, he entered the United States in 1947 and went to work at Woods Hole, Mass, where he continued his research on muscle contraction and became interested in cancer. He obtained support from the National Foundation for Cancer Research for his “bioelectronic” theory of cancer and with the use of electron spin resonance, began the search for free radicals.\n\n【7】Szent-Györgyi died of kidney failure on October 22, 1986, at the age of 93 years. He was honored on a stamp issued by Hungary in 1988.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【10】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/75.7.722</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>© 2000 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times — such as when exercising — or have symptoms all the time.\n\n【6】Asthma signs and symptoms include:\n\n【7】*   Shortness of breath\n*   Chest tightness or pain\n*   Wheezing when exhaling, which is a common sign of asthma in children\n*   Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing\n*   Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu\n\n【8】Signs that your asthma is probably worsening include:\n\n【9】*   Asthma signs and symptoms that are more frequent and bothersome\n*   Increasing difficulty breathing, as measured with a device used to check how well your lungs are working (peak flow meter)\n*   The need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often\n\n【10】For some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations:\n\n【11】*   **Exercise-induced asthma,** which may be worse when the air is cold and dry\n*   **Occupational asthma,** triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases or dust\n*   **Allergy-induced asthma,** triggered by airborne substances, such as pollen, mold spores, cockroach waste, or particles of skin and dried saliva shed by pets (pet dander)\n\n【12】### When to see a doctor\n\n【13】#### Seek emergency treatment\n\n【14】Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Work with your doctor to determine what to do when your signs and symptoms worsen — and when you need emergency treatment. Signs of an asthma emergency include:\n\n【15】*   Rapid worsening of shortness of breath or wheezing\n*   No improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler\n*   Shortness of breath when you are doing minimal physical activity\n\n【16】#### Contact your doctor\n\n【17】See your doctor:\n\n【18】*   **If you think you have asthma.** If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and help keep the condition from getting worse over time.\n*   **To monitor your asthma after diagnosis.** If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control. Good long-term control helps you feel better from day to day and can prevent a life-threatening asthma attack.\n*   **If your asthma symptoms get worse.** Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn't seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often.\n\n【19】    Don't take more medication than prescribed without consulting your doctor first. Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse.\n\n【20】*   **To review your treatment.** Asthma often changes over time. Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments.\n\n【21】Causes\n------\n\n【22】It isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and inherited (genetic) factors.\n\n【23】### Asthma triggers\n\n【24】Exposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies (allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include:\n\n【25】*   Airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander or particles of cockroach waste\n*   Respiratory infections, such as the common cold\n*   Physical activity\n*   Cold air\n*   Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke\n*   Certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve)\n*   Strong emotions and stress\n*   Sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages, including shrimp, dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer and wine\n*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat\n\n【26】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【27】A number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. They include:\n\n【28】*   Having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling\n*   Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis — which causes red, itchy skin — or hay fever — which causes a runny nose, congestion and itchy eyes\n*   Being overweight\n*   Being a smoker\n*   Exposure to secondhand smoke\n*   Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution\n*   Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing\n\n【29】Complications\n-------------\n\n【30】Asthma complications include:\n\n【31】*   Signs and symptoms that interfere with sleep, work and other activities\n*   Sick days from work or school during asthma flare-ups\n*   A permanent narrowing of the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs (bronchial tubes), which affects how well you can breathe\n*   Emergency room visits and hospitalizations for severe asthma attacks\n*   Side effects from long-term use of some medications used to stabilize severe asthma\n\n【32】Proper treatment makes a big difference in preventing both short-term and long-term complications caused by asthma.\n\n【33】Prevention\n----------\n\n【34】While there's no way to prevent asthma, you and your doctor can design a step-by-step plan for living with your condition and preventing asthma attacks.\n\n【35】*   **Follow your asthma action plan.** With your doctor and health care team, write a detailed plan for taking medications and managing an asthma attack. Then be sure to follow your plan.\n\n【36】    Asthma is an ongoing condition that needs regular monitoring and treatment. Taking control of your treatment can make you feel more in control of your life.\n\n【37】*   **Get vaccinated for influenza and pneumonia.** Staying current with vaccinations can prevent flu and pneumonia from triggering asthma flare-ups.\n*   **Identify and avoid asthma triggers.** A number of outdoor allergens and irritants — ranging from pollen and mold to cold air and air pollution — can trigger asthma attacks. Find out what causes or worsens your asthma, and take steps to avoid those triggers.\n*   **Monitor your breathing.** You may learn to recognize warning signs of an impending attack, such as slight coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath.\n\n【38】    But because your lung function may decrease before you notice any signs or symptoms, regularly measure and record your peak airflow with a home peak flow meter. A peak flow meter measures how hard you can breathe out. Your doctor can show you how to monitor your peak flow at home.\n\n【39】*   **Identify and treat attacks early.** If you act quickly, you're less likely to have a severe attack. You also won't need as much medication to control your symptoms.\n\n【40】    When your peak flow measurements decrease and alert you to an oncoming attack, take your medication as instructed. Also, immediately stop any activity that may have triggered the attack. If your symptoms don't improve, get medical help as directed in your action plan.\n\n【41】*   **Take your medication as prescribed.** Don't change your medications without first talking to your doctor, even if your asthma seems to be improving. It's a good idea to bring your medications with you to each doctor visit. Your doctor can make sure you're using your medications correctly and taking the right dose.\n*   **Pay attention to increasing quick-relief inhaler use.** If you find yourself relying on your quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol, your asthma isn't under control. See your doctor about adjusting your treatment.\n\n【42】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "1cf468c8-432c-4334-b20f-7e9741ac0221", "title": "Acute liver failure", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Acute liver failure is loss of liver function that occurs quickly — in days or weeks — usually in a person who has no preexisting liver disease. It's most commonly caused by a hepatitis virus or drugs, such as acetaminophen. Acute liver failure is less common than chronic liver failure, which develops more slowly.\n\n【2】Acute liver failure, also known as fulminant hepatic failure, can cause serious complications, including bleeding and increased pressure in the brain. It's a medical emergency that requires hospitalization.\n\n【3】Depending on the cause, acute liver failure can sometimes be reversed with treatment. In many situations, though, a liver transplant may be the only cure.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of acute liver failure may include:\n\n【6】*   Yellowing of your skin and eyeballs (jaundice)\n*   Pain in your upper right abdomen\n*   A swollen belly (ascites)\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n*   A general sense of feeling unwell (malaise)\n*   Disorientation or confusion\n*   Sleepiness\n*   Breath may have a musty or sweet odor\n*   Tremors\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Acute liver failure can develop quickly in an otherwise healthy person, and it is life-threatening. If you or someone you know suddenly develops a yellowing of the eyes or skin; tenderness in the upper abdomen; or any unusual changes in mental state, personality or behavior, seek medical attention right away.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Acute liver failure occurs when liver cells are damaged significantly and are no longer able to function. Potential causes include:\n\n【11】*   **Acetaminophen overdose.** Taking too much acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. Outside of the United States, acetaminophen is known as paracetamol. Acute liver failure can occur after one very large dose of acetaminophen, or after higher than recommended doses every day for several days.\n\n【12】    If you or someone you know has taken an overdose of acetaminophen, seek medical attention as quickly as possible. Treatment may prevent liver failure. Don't wait for the signs of liver failure.\n\n【13】*   **Prescription medications.** Some prescription medications, including antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticonvulsants, can cause acute liver failure.\n*   **Herbal supplements.** Herbal drugs and supplements, including kava, ephedra, skullcap and pennyroyal, have been linked to acute liver failure.\n*   **Hepatitis and other viruses.** Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis E can cause acute liver failure. Other viruses that can cause acute liver failure include Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus.\n*   **Toxins.** Toxins that can cause acute liver failure include the poisonous wild mushroom Amanita phalloides, which is sometimes mistaken for one that is safe to eat. Carbon tetrachloride is another toxin that can cause acute liver failure. It is an industrial chemical found in refrigerants and solvents for waxes, varnishes and other materials.\n*   **Autoimmune disease.** Liver failure can be caused by autoimmune hepatitis — a disease in which your immune system attacks liver cells, causing inflammation and injury.\n*   **Diseases of the veins in the liver.** Vascular diseases, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, can cause blockages in the veins of the liver and lead to acute liver failure.\n*   **Metabolic disease.** Rare metabolic diseases, such as Wilson's disease and acute fatty liver of pregnancy, infrequently cause acute liver failure.\n*   **Cancer.** Cancer that either begins in or spreads to your liver can cause your liver to fail.\n*   **Shock.** Overwhelming infection (sepsis) and shock can severely reduce blood flow to the liver, causing liver failure.\n*   **Heat stroke.** Extreme physical activity in a hot environment can trigger acute liver failure.\n\n【14】Some cases of acute liver failure have no obvious cause.\n\n【15】Complications\n-------------\n\n【16】Acute liver failure often causes complications, including:\n\n【17】*   **Too much fluid in the brain (cerebral edema).** Too much fluid causes pressure to build up in your brain, which can lead to disorientation, severe mental confusion and seizures.\n*   **Bleeding and bleeding disorders.** A failing liver cannot make enough clotting factors, which help blood to clot. Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is common with this condition. It may be difficult to control.\n*   **Infections.** People with acute liver failure are more likely to develop infections, particularly in the blood and in the respiratory and urinary tracts.\n*   **Kidney failure.** Kidney failure often occurs after liver failure, especially if you had an acetaminophen overdose, which damages both your liver and your kidneys.\n\n【18】Prevention\n----------\n\n【19】Reduce your risk of acute liver failure by taking care of your liver.\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>*   **Follow instructions on medications.** If you take acetaminophen or other medications, check the package insert for the recommended dosage, and don't take more than that. If you already have liver disease, ask your health care provider if it is safe to take any amount of acetaminophen.\n*   **Tell your provider about all your medicines.** Even over-the-counter and herbal medicines can interfere with prescription drugs you're taking.\n*   **Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all.** If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.\n*   **Avoid risky behavior.** Get help if you use illicit intravenous drugs. Don't share needles. Use condoms during sex. If you get tattoos or body piercings, make sure the shop you choose is clean and safe. Don't smoke.\n*   **Get vaccinated.** If you have chronic liver disease, a history of any type of hepatitis infection or an increased risk of hepatitis, talk to your provider about getting the hepatitis B vaccine. A vaccine also is available for hepatitis A.\n*   **Avoid contact with other people's blood and body fluids.** Accidental needle sticks or improper cleanup of blood or body fluids can spread hepatitis viruses. Sharing razor blades or toothbrushes also can spread infection.\n*   **Don't eat wild mushrooms.** It can be difficult to tell the difference between a poisonous mushroom and one that is safe to eat.\n*   **Take care with aerosol sprays.** When you use an aerosol cleaner, make sure the room is ventilated, or wear a mask. Take similar protective measures when spraying insecticides, fungicides, paint and other toxic chemicals. Follow product instructions carefully.\n*   **Watch what gets on your skin.** When using insecticides and other toxic chemicals, cover your skin with gloves, long sleeves, a hat and a mask.\n*   **Maintain a healthy weight.** Obesity can cause a condition called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which may include fatty liver, hepatitis and cirrhosis.</u>\n\n【21】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Median patient age was 29.0 years (range, 5.0-34.9 years), and 23 patients (51%) were male. Clinical diagnoses included the following: stroke, 30 (67%); transient ischemic attack, 13 (29%); myocardial infarction, 1 (2%); and renal infarct, 1 (2%). Overall, 42 patients (93%) had a PFO, and 3 (7%) had an ASD. Seventeen patients had known cardiovascular disease risk factors: tobacco use (10 patients), hypercoagulable states (7 patients), systemic hypertension (3 patients), and hyperlipidemia (2 patients). No major procedural complications occurred. Median follow-up evaluation was performed at 5.3 months (range, 2.5-40.0 months).

More benign forms of idiopathic VT can also occur in the absence of structural heart disease. Treatment of VT involves both emergent management and prevention of recurrence with medical and device therapy.\n\n【16】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Related Articles\n----------------</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Hide Caption Download See figure in Article</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-1:<u>Toggle Thumbstrip</u>\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>无关删除-1:<u>*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download .PPT</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Tekturna HCT\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide combination is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure will reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.\n\n【6】Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor. It works by blocking an enzyme in the body that is necessary to produce a substance that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, the blood vessels relax and decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen is increased to the heart.\n\n【7】Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

{"seq_id": "d33b25f8-9ced-4a91-8cc8-f875a1b46218", "title": "Wilms tumor", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Wilms tumor is a rare kidney cancer that mainly affects children. Also known as nephroblastoma, it's the most common cancer of the kidneys in children. Wilms tumor most often affects children ages 3 to 4. It becomes much less common after age 5, but it can affect older children and even adults.\n\n【2】Wilms tumor mostly occurs in just one kidney. But it can sometimes be in both kidneys at the same time.\n\n【3】Over the years, progress in the diagnosis and treatment of Wilms tumor has greatly improved the prognosis for children with this disease. With treatment, the outlook for most children with Wilms tumor is good.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Symptoms of Wilms tumor vary a lot. Some children don't seem to have any symptoms. But others with Wilms tumor have one or more of these symptoms:\n\n【6】*   A mass in the stomach area that can be felt.\n*   Swelling in the stomach area.\n*   Pain in the stomach area.\n\n【7】Other symptoms might include:\n\n【8】*   Fever.\n*   Blood in the urine.\n*   Low red blood cell level, also known as anemia.\n*   High blood pressure.\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】Make an appointment with your child's health care provider if you see symptoms that worry you. Wilms tumor is rare. So it's likely that something else is causing symptoms. But it's important to check out any concerns.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】It's not clear what causes Wilms tumor.\n\n【13】Cancer begins when cells develop changes in their DNA. Cells' DNA holds the instructions that tell the cells what to do. The changes tell the cells to grow and multiply quickly. The cancer cells live while healthy cells die as part of their natural life cycle. With Wilms tumor, the changes make extra cells in the kidney that form the tumor.\n\n【14】Rarely, DNA changes passed from parents to children can increase the risk of Wilms tumor.\n\n【15】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【16】Factors that may increase the risk of Wilms tumor include:\n\n【17】*   **Being Black.** In North America and Europe, Black children have a slightly higher risk of getting Wilms tumor than do children of other races. Asian-American children appear to have a lower risk than children of other races.\n*   **Having a family history of Wilms tumor.** Having someone in the family who's had Wilms tumor increases the risk of getting the disease.\n\n【18】Wilms tumor occurs more often in children who have certain conditions present at birth, including:\n\n【19】*   **Aniridia.** In aniridia (an-ih-RID-e-uh), the colored portion of the eye, known as the iris, forms only in part or not at all.\n*   **Hemihypertrophy.** Hemihypertrophy (hem-e-hi-PUR-truh-fee) means one side of the body or a part of the body is larger than the other side.\n\n【20】Wilms tumor can occur as part of rare syndromes, including:\n\n【21】*   **WAGR syndrome.** This syndrome includes Wilms tumor, aniridia, genital and urinary system problems, and intellectual disabilities.\n*   **Denys-Drash syndrome.** This syndrome includes Wilms tumor, kidney disease and male pseudohermaphroditism (soo-do-her-MAF-roe-dit-iz-um). In male pseudohermaphroditism, a boy's genitals aren't clearly male.\n*   **Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.** Children with this syndrome tend to be much larger than what is typical, known as macrosomia. This syndrome might cause organs in the stomach area to jut into the base of the umbilical cord, a large tongue, large internal organs and ears that are formed unusually.\n\n【22】Prevention\n----------\n\n【23】Wilms tumor can't be prevented.\n\n【24】If a child has any of the conditions that increase the risk for Wilms tumor, a health care provider might suggest doing kidney ultrasounds at times to look for anything unusual in the kidneys. Although this screening can't prevent Wilms tumor, it may help find the disease at an early stage.\n\n【25】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "5f8aa451-7fdb-49f3-a88c-736e63d56889", "title": "Canker sore", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Canker sores, also called aphthous ulcers, are small, shallow lesions that develop on the soft tissues in your mouth or at the base of your gums. Unlike cold sores, canker sores don't occur on the surface of your lips and they aren't contagious. They can be painful, however, and can make eating and talking difficult.\n\n【2】Most canker sores go away on their own in a week or two. Check with your doctor or dentist if you have unusually large or painful canker sores or canker sores that don't seem to heal.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Most canker sores are round or oval with a white or yellow center and a red border. They form inside your mouth — on or under your tongue, inside your cheeks or lips, at the base of your gums, or on your soft palate. You might notice a tingling or burning sensation a day or two before the sores actually appear.\n\n【5】There are several types of canker sores, including minor, major and herpetiform sores.\n\n【6】### Minor canker sores\n\n【7】Minor canker sores are the most common and:\n\n【8】*   Are usually small\n*   Are oval shaped with a red edge\n*   Heal without scarring in one to two weeks\n\n【9】### Major canker sores\n\n【10】Major canker sores are less common and:\n\n【11】*   Are larger and deeper than minor canker sores\n*   Are usually round with defined borders, but may have irregular edges when very large\n*   Can be extremely painful\n*   May take up to six weeks to heal and can leave extensive scarring\n\n【12】### Herpetiform canker sores\n\n【13】Herpetiform canker sores are uncommon and usually develop later in life, but they're not caused by herpes virus infection. These canker sores:\n\n【14】*   Are pinpoint size\n*   Often occur in clusters of 10 to 100 sores, but may merge into one large ulcer\n*   Have irregular edges\n*   Heal without scarring in one to two weeks\n\n【15】### When to see a doctor\n\n【16】Consult your doctor if you experience:\n\n【17】*   Unusually large canker sores\n*   Recurring sores, with new ones developing before old ones heal, or frequent outbreaks\n*   Persistent sores, lasting two weeks or more\n*   Sores that extend into the lips themselves (vermilion border)\n*   Pain that you can't control with self-care measures\n*   Extreme difficulty eating or drinking\n*   High fever along with canker sores\n\n【18】See your dentist if you have sharp tooth surfaces or dental appliances that seem to trigger the sores.\n\n【19】Causes\n------\n\n【20】The precise cause of canker sores remains unclear, though researchers suspect that a combination of factors contributes to outbreaks, even in the same person.\n\n【21】Possible triggers for canker sores include:\n\n【22】*   A minor injury to your mouth from dental work, overzealous brushing, sports mishaps or an accidental cheek bite\n*   Toothpastes and mouth rinses containing sodium lauryl sulfate\n*   Food sensitivities, particularly to chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, cheese, and spicy or acidic foods\n*   A diet lacking in vitamin B-12, zinc, folate (folic acid) or iron\n*   An allergic response to certain bacteria in your mouth\n*   Helicobacter pylori, the same bacteria that cause peptic ulcers\n*   Hormonal shifts during menstruation\n*   Emotional stress\n\n【23】Canker sores may also occur because of certain conditions and diseases, such as:\n\n【24】*   Celiac disease, a serious intestinal disorder caused by a sensitivity to gluten, a protein found in most grains\n*   Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis\n*   Behcet's disease, a rare disorder that causes inflammation throughout the body, including the mouth\n*   A faulty immune system that attacks healthy cells in your mouth instead of pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria\n*   HIV/AIDS, which suppresses the immune system\n\n【25】Unlike cold sores, canker sores are not associated with herpes virus infections.\n\n【26】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【27】Anyone can develop canker sores. But they occur more often in teens and young adults, and they're more common in females.\n\n【28】Often people with recurrent canker sores have a family history of the disorder. This may be due to heredity or to a shared factor in the environment, such as certain foods or allergens.\n\n【29】Prevention\n----------\n\n【30】Canker sores often recur, but you may be able to reduce their frequency by following these tips:\n\n【31】*   **Watch what you eat.** Try to avoid foods that seem to irritate your mouth. These may include nuts, chips, pretzels, certain spices, salty foods and acidic fruits, such as pineapple, grapefruit and oranges. Avoid any foods to which you're sensitive or allergic.\n*   **Choose healthy foods.** To help prevent nutritional deficiencies, eat plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\n*   **Follow good oral hygiene habits.** Regular brushing after meals and flossing once a day can keep your mouth clean and free of foods that might trigger a sore. Use a soft brush to help prevent irritation to delicate mouth tissues, and avoid toothpastes and mouth rinses that contain sodium lauryl sulfate.\n*   **Protect your mouth.** If you have braces or other dental appliances, ask your dentist about orthodontic waxes to cover sharp edges.\n*   **Reduce your stress.** If your canker sores seem to be related to stress, learn and use stress-reduction techniques, such as meditation and guided imagery.\n\n【32】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

R.Y.G.), we have seen many patients in our practice who simply refuse to take a prescribed statin, our first drug class of choice, or other prescription medications for their hyperlipidemia for reasons that range from valid to irrational. Our goal was to test an alternative regimen to statins that would meet the needs of this subset of patients who require and deserve treatment of their hyperlipidemia. Many of these patients prefer an alternative or holistic approach to lowering their cholesterol, so we chose to evaluate a combined program of red yeast rice (RYR), fish oil, and therapeutic lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, and stress management) on the basis of their promise in the literature.\n\n【2】Carter and O'Keefe apparently did not appreciate the critical point that our study was directed to serve a particular target population for which there is currently no agreed upon therapeutic approach. We clearly stated the population most likely to benefit from our study results in the conclusion of the abstract: “\\[T\\]his multifactorial, alternative approach to lipid lowering has promise for a subset of patients unwilling or unable to take statins.” We also stated it in the second paragraph of our Discussion: “\\[T\\]he regimen…could offer an option for patients who refuse therapy with statins.” We welcome the opportunity to reinforce this point again for the readership of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ and regret that Carter and O'Keefe offer no specific alternatives in their letter to meet the needs of patients who refuse statin therapy.\n\n【3】We also disagree with 2 of their comments. First, it is unclear that statins are less expensive than our alternative regimen. Generic simvastatin, pravastatin, and lovastatin are inexpensive (as little as $10 for a 3-month supply) for patients with a prescription plan or when purchased at large chain stores. However, brand name lipid-lowering medications (fenofibrate, ezetimibe, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin, among others) are aggressively marketed to patients and physicians through direct-to-consumer advertising, pharmaceutical representatives, sampling, and drug dinners. Millions of patients pay high copays and up to $120 per month out-of-pocket for these medications. Second, statin-associated myalgias are a problem for many users of statins,\n\n【4】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ballantyne CM\n*   Corsini A\n*   Davidson MH\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【5】Risk for myopathy with statin therapy in high-risk patients.\n\n【6】删除3:<u>删除3:<u>_Arch Intern Med._ 2003; 163 : 553-564 https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.163.5.553</u></u>\n\n【7】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (393)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ucar M\n*   Mjörndal T\n*   Dahlqvist R</u>\n\n【9】HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and myotoxicity.\n\n【10】删除3:<u>删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Drug Saf._ 2000; 22 : 441-457 https://doi.org/10.2165/00002018-200022060-00003</u></u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (258)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>*   Thompson PD\n*   Clarkson P\n*   Karas RH</u>\n\n【13】Statin-associated myopathy.\n\n【14】删除3:<u>删除3:<u>_JAMA._ 2003; 289 : 1681-1690 https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.289.13.1681</u></u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1242)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【16】but our article did not specifically address this common reason for discontinuation of statin therapy.

However, the RYR we used in our study was analyzed by an independent laboratory for monacolin (a compound in RYR known to inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) and citrinin (a potential toxin) content; it contained active product and therefore was likely safe for ingestion. We firmly believe that the FDA needs to take a more active role in regulating the manufacture of RYR products.\n\n【51】Third, we agree that fish oil supplementation and therapeutic lifestyle changes, including diet, exercise, and stress reduction, should be strongly endorsed for all patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or patients at high risk of cardiac disease. We also agree that fish oil supplementation helped to reduce triglyceride levels in the RYR group compared with the simvastatin group. However, we think that the significantly lower triglyceride levels in the RYR group were also due to the impressive weight loss in that group (approximately 4.7 kg in the course of 12 weeks), which was due to the therapeutic lifestyle changes program.\n\n【52】In summary, our small, single-site study requires confirmation in larger, multicenter trials. However, we do offer statistically significant outcome data that offer hope to patients who refuse statin therapy and prefer an alternative or holistic approach to lowering serum lipids.

To do this, you may need to have a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan.\n\n【36】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【37】Your doctor will want to check your progress at 3 months and 6 months after the first injection, then every 6 months after that. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【38】This medicine may increase your risk of developing infections, including a rare and serious brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This is more likely to occur if you have had JCV infection, have been receiving natalizumab for a long time (longer than 2 years), or if you have been using medicine that weakens your immune system (eg, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, mycophenolate mofetil, or steroid medicine) before receiving this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have vision changes, loss of coordination, clumsiness, memory loss, difficulty speaking or understanding what others say, or weak legs.\n\n【39】Natalizumab may cause a rare condition called immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). This may occur after a person stops receiving this medicine after developing PML during treatment. Tell your doctor right away if you have an inflammatory reaction to an infection that includes mild burning, stinging, or tingling of the skin, or a feeling of heat, redness, or swelling of the skin.\n\n【40】Natalizumab may increase the risk of developing encephalitis, meningitis, or acute retinal necrosis caused by herpes and varicella viruses. Check with your doctor if you have a fever, headache, eye pain or redness, sensitivity of the eyes to the sun, or confusion.\n\n【41】Check with your doctor right away if you pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.\n\n【42】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after receiving this medicine.\n\n【43】This medicine may lower the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed or get infections more easily. To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers.\n\n【44】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【45】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【46】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【47】#### More common\n\n【48】1.

Here, we present the first description and associated imaging of percutaneous mechanical circulatory support in the setting of cardiogenic shock secondary to Ebstein anomaly.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ECMO ( extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ), LV ( left ventricular ), PA ( pulmonary artery ), PVR ( pulmonary vascular resistance ), RA ( right atrial ), RV ( right ventricular ), RVAD ( right ventricular assist device )\n\n【4】A 31-year-old man presented with worsening dyspnea in the context of Ebstein anomaly with severe tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. He was admitted for acute decompensated heart failure. He denied any other notable history and had been active up to 3 months before presentation. On admission, the heart rate was 102 beats/min, blood pressure was 110/74 mm Hg with a respiratory rate of 34 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Physical examination revealed 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex and 2+ bilateral edema in the lower extremities. The 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, low voltage QRS complex, right bundle branch block, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Massive right heart enlargement was documented by chest radiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging . The echocardiogram exhibited significant left ventricular (LV) and LV outflow tract compression by the distended RV .\n\n【5】Figure 1 A, Anteroposterior chest radiograph exhibiting cardiomegaly.

Mixed venous blood gas was noted to be 42%, resulting in a cardiac index of 1.2 L/min per meter squared, measured by direct Fick method. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was elevated at 14.2 Wood units. Later that day, the patient had a narrow complex tachycardia at 170 beats/min. Amiodarone bolus and infusion at 1 mg/min resulted in cardioversion, but persistent mottling and peripheral vasoconstriction prompted extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) consultation.\n\n【10】Given severe enlargement of the patient’s right heart and his hemodynamic collapse, central ECMO was felt to be too dangerous to pursue. Right atrial and RV size further precluded any off-the-shelf percutaneous right ventricular assist device (RVAD) options. As such, using a balloon wedge catheter with a steerable Storq wire (Cordis), access to the PA was secured via the internal jugular vein . After serial dilation, a single-stage 17-F venous cannula (Medtronic) was positioned over the Storq wire into the main PA as guided by fluoroscopy 删除4:<u>( Figure 3 A)</u>. Right femoral venous access was used for positioning of a 25-F multistage venous cannula (Medtronic) positioned with the tip in the superior vena cava 删除4:<u>( Figure 3 A)</u>. The lines were de-aired and then connected to CentriMag (Abbott) tubing. Flow was slowly augmented to 3 L, with a precipitous decrease in RA pressure and increase in systemic blood pressure from 110’s systolic to 160’s systolic, suggesting resuscitation of LV preload and thus stroke volume. However, because of large size of the RA and RV, this flow resulted in the PA cannula falling back into the RV, prompting repositioning the device further into the PA by approximately 5 cm and reducing the flow rate to 2.5 L/min. With support, the patient’s clinical condition stabilized. Conventional surgical replacement of the tricuspid valve vs cardiac transplantation were considered, but ultimately transplant was the chosen option because of the high mortality risks associated with conventional surgery.\n\n【11】Figure 3 A, Chest radiograph after percutaneous right ventricular assist device (RVAD) placement with the pulmonary artery (PA) cannula (red) and super vena cava–right atrium junction cannula (blue) highlighted.

We hypothesized that many physicians are apprehensive about discussing ICD deactivation with their dying patients. Thus, we conducted an anonymous survey of all the physicians in the Department of Medicine at Unity Health System in Rochester, NY. The survey collected information about the knowledge and preferences of these physicians regarding the medical, ethical, and legal issues involved in caring for patients with an ICD and terminal illness. Of the 204 surveys distributed, 87 (43%) were returned. Among the physicians who responded, 64 (74%) reported experience caring for a patient with an ICD and terminal illness. Forty physicians (46%) either thought it was illegal or were not sure if it was legal to deactivate an ICD in these circumstances. However, if reassured about the legality of discontinuing ICD therapy, 79 (91%) of these same respondents said that they would be willing to discuss voluntary ICD deactivation with their dying patients. With increased knowledge about managing the withdrawal of this potentially life-prolonging therapy, physicians are likely to become more skilled at caring for dying patients with an ICD.\n\n【1】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Because of the abnormal placement of the mitral valve (Panel A, asterisk), we did not feel that we would be able to relieve the subvalvar stenosis even with myectomy.\n\n【12】An apicoaortic conduit (Panel C, arrow) was constructed between the left ventricular apex (LVA) and the descending thoracic aorta (DTA) via a left thoracotomy. Normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass was achieved by cannulation of the left common femoral artery and vein. The left ventricle was small and hypertrophied with a very small cavity. Two separate pieces of a 16-mm Dacron tube graft (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, MN) were anastomosed to the left ventricular apex (LVA) and the descending thoracic aorta (DTA) (Panel B, white arrows). A 20-mm Dacron graft was interposed between these 2 grafts (Panel B, gray arrow), and a 17-mm bileaflet mechanical valve (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) was interposed between these conduits. Hence, the combined effective orifice area index was 1.11 cm  /m  . The patient experienced marked symptomatic improvement at dismissal and was counseled regarding strict adherence to therapeutic anticoagulation, as he had 3 mechanical valves in situ.\n\n【13】We demonstrate that this procedure is useful for the management of patients with complex left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

Women who have problems with orgasms and who feel significant distress about those problems may be diagnosed with anorgasmia.\n\n【2】Among all women, the frequency and intensity of orgasms vary. Also, for any individual, orgasms can be different from one time to the next. The type and amount of stimulation needed to have an orgasm also varies.\n\n【3】Multiple factors may lead to anorgasmia. These include relationship or intimacy issues, cultural factors, physical or medical conditions, and medications. Treatments can include education about sexual stimulation, sexual enhancement devices, individual or couple therapy, and medications.\n\n【4】Female orgasmic disorder is another term for the spectrum of problems with orgasms. The word \"anorgasmia\" specifically refers to not being able to have an orgasm, but it's also used as shorthand for female orgasmic disorders.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】An orgasm is a peak feeling of intense pleasure in response to stimulating sexual activity.\n\n【7】Vaginal penetration during sex indirectly stimulates the clitoris. But this may not be enough stimulation for orgasm. Many women may also need direct manual or oral stimulation of the clitoris to reach orgasm.\n\n【8】Anorgasmia, or female orgasmic disorder, is defined as experiencing any of these in a significant way:\n\n【9】*   Delayed orgasm\n*   Absence of orgasm\n*   Fewer orgasms\n*   Less-intense orgasms\n\n【10】Anorgasmia can also be:\n\n【11】*   **Lifelong,** if you've never had an orgasm\n*   **Acquired,** if you have new problems with having orgasms\n*   **Situational,** if you have problems with orgasm only in certain situations, with certain kinds of stimulation or with certain partners\n*   **Generalized,** if you have problems with orgasm in any situation\n\n【12】Women who don't always reach orgasm during sexual encounters may not find it distressing. In that case, the lack of an orgasm is not considered a disorder.\n\n【13】### When to see a doctor\n\n【14】Talk to your health care provider if you have concerns about your sex life, especially if you're concerned about your ability to have an orgasm.\n\n【15】Causes\n------\n\n【16】Sexual arousal and orgasms are complex reactions to various physical, emotional, sensory and psychological factors. Difficulties in any of these areas can affect your ability to have an orgasm.\n\n【17】### Personal and psychological factors\n\n【18】Past experiences, behaviors, background or mental well-being may contribute to problems with orgasms. These include:\n\n【19】*   Past sexual or emotional abuse\n*   Lack of knowledge about sexual stimulation or interactions\n*   Poor body image\n*   Guilt or embarrassment about sex\n*   Cultural or religious beliefs about sex\n*   Stressors, such as financial problems or loss of a loved one\n*   Mental health conditions, such as anxiety or depression\n\n【20】### Relationship factors\n\n【21】Problems with your sex partner may be contributing factors to problems with orgasms. These may include:\n\n【22】*   Lack of emotional intimacy\n*   Unresolved conflicts\n*   Poor communication of sexual needs and preferences\n*   Infidelity or breach of trust\n*   Intimate partner violence\n*   Partner's sexual dysfunction, such a male partner with erectile dysfunction\n\n【23】### Physical causes\n\n【24】A wide range of illnesses, physical changes and medications can interfere with orgasms:\n\n【25】*   **Health conditions.** Long-term conditions — such as diabetes, overactive bladder or multiple sclerosis — may be contributing or complicating factors in orgasm disorders.\n*   **Gynecological treatments.** Tissue damage from gynecologic surgeries, such as hysterectomy or cancer surgery, may affect the ability to have an orgasm.\n*   **Medications.** Many prescription and nonprescription medications can inhibit orgasm, including blood pressure medications, antipsychotic drugs, antihistamines and antidepressants — particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n*   **Alcohol and smoking.** Alcohol suppresses the nervous system and may hamper the ability to have an orgasm. Smoking can limit blood flow to your sexual organs, affecting your ability to have an orgasm.\n*   **Age-related changes to the body.** Changes to the body after menopause or later in life may contribute to various types of sexual dysfunction.\n\n【26】### Related sexual disorders\n\n【27】Women experiencing anorgasmia may have one or more related sexual problems. These may contribute to or complicate the problem with having orgasms. These conditions include:\n\n【28】*   Problems with sexual arousal\n*   Little or no desire for sex\n*   Pain from sexual intercourse or other sexual stimulation\n*   Dryness of the vagina or vulva\n*   Involuntary tightening of the vagina (vaginismus)\n\n【29】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "79cc551e-460b-4c53-b0cb-7c1da1527c02", "title": "Indapamide (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Indapamide (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Lozol\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Indapamide is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.\n\n【6】Indapamide is also used to treat salt and fluid retention (edema) caused by congestive heart failure.\n\n【7】Indapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of indapamide in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of indapamide in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving indapamide.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

At 3 months, smoking-abstinent study participants were randomized to their initial medications or placebo. Participants who were smoking at 3 months were randomized to an alternative treatment regimen or placebo. This study was conducted from July 2001 to January 2003.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】A total of 1700 smokers were randomized to treatment (phase 1) for 3 months. Among the 941 study participants eligible for randomization to the phase 2 trial, 837 continued in the study. For the phase 2 trial, 405 smoking-abstinent participants were randomized to relapse prevention for 9 additional months, and 432 smokers were randomized to re-treatment for an additional 3 months. At the end of the initial 3 months of treatment (phase 1), 82 (14%) of 566, 145 (26%) of 567, and 194 (34%) of 567 study participants receiving a nicotine inhaler, bupropion, or both, respectively, were abstinent from smoking. Of the 405 smoking-abstinent participants at the end of 3 months, the bupropion group had more smokers than the placebo group (mean No. of smokers, 1.5 vs 1.1; _P_ <.001), and the nicotine inhaler group had higher smoking abstinence rates at 12 months than the placebo group. Those receiving combination therapy had reduced rates of relapse to smoking for the first 3 months of relapse prevention, but this difference disappeared after the initial 3 months. Of the 432 study participants who were smoking at the end of 3 months and who received an alternative treatment regimen, the 223 smokers initially assigned to a nicotine inhaler were more likely to stop smoking at 6 months if they were re-treated with bupropion instead of placebo (8 \\[7%\\] of 111 vs 0 \\[0%\\] of 112; _P_ \\=.003), and the 209 smokers initially treated with bupropion and re-treated with a nicotine inhaler did not have significantly higher smoking abstinence rates (6 \\[6%\\] of 104 vs 3 \\[3%\\] of 105; _P_ \\=.50).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Combined therapy with a nicotine inhaler and bupropion increased smoking abstinence rates. Continuation of the initial combination therapy does not appear to prevent relapse to smoking. Timing of re-treatment and alternative approaches to relapse prevention should be further examined.\n\n【8】FTND ( Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence ), HSQ ( Health Status Questionnaire ), NCCTG ( North Central Cancer Treatment Group )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "404ef16c-5f8f-4cfd-beaa-f3c02f3463d1", "title": "Interstitial cystitis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Interstitial cystitis (in-tur-STISH-ul sis-TIE-tis) is a chronic condition causing bladder pressure, bladder pain and sometimes pelvic pain. The pain ranges from mild discomfort to severe pain. The condition is a part of a spectrum of diseases known as painful bladder syndrome.\n\n【2】Your bladder is a hollow, muscular organ that stores urine. The bladder expands until it's full and then signals your brain that it's time to urinate, communicating through the pelvic nerves. This creates the urge to urinate for most people.\n\n【3】With interstitial cystitis, these signals get mixed up — you feel the need to urinate more often and with smaller volumes of urine than most people.\n\n【4】Interstitial cystitis most often affects women and can have a long-lasting impact on quality of life. Although there's no cure, medications and other therapies may offer relief.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】The signs and symptoms of interstitial cystitis vary from person to person. If you have interstitial cystitis, your symptoms may also vary over time, periodically flaring in response to common triggers, such as menstruation, sitting for a long time, stress, exercise and sexual activity.\n\n【7】Interstitial cystitis signs and symptoms include:\n\n【8】*   Pain in your pelvis or between the vagina and anus in women\n*   Pain between the scrotum and anus (perineum) in men\n*   Chronic pelvic pain\n*   A persistent, urgent need to urinate\n*   Frequent urination, often of small amounts, throughout the day and night (up to 60 times a day)\n*   Pain or discomfort while the bladder fills and relief after urinating\n*   Pain during sex\n\n【9】Symptoms severity is different for everyone, and some people may experience symptom-free periods.\n\n【10】Although signs and symptoms of interstitial cystitis may resemble those of a chronic urinary tract infection, there's usually no infection. However, symptoms may worsen if a person with interstitial cystitis gets a urinary tract infection.\n\n【11】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【12】If you're experiencing chronic bladder pain or urinary urgency and frequency, contact your health care provider.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】The exact cause of interstitial cystitis isn't known, but it's likely that many factors contribute. For instance, people with interstitial cystitis may also have a defect in the protective lining (epithelium) of the bladder. A leak in the epithelium may allow toxic substances in urine to irritate your bladder wall.\n\n【15】Other possible but unproven contributing factors include an autoimmune reaction, heredity, infection or allergy.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】These factors are associated with a higher risk of interstitial cystitis:\n\n【18】*   **Your sex.** Women are diagnosed with interstitial cystitis more often than men. Symptoms in men may mimic interstitial cystitis, but they're more often associated with an inflammation of the prostate gland (prostatitis).\n*   **Your age.** Most people with interstitial cystitis are diagnosed during their 30s or older.\n*   **Having a chronic pain disorder.** Interstitial cystitis may be associated with other chronic pain disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome or fibromyalgia.\n\n【19】Complications\n-------------\n\n【20】Interstitial cystitis can result in a number of complications, including:\n\n【21】*   **Reduced bladder capacity.** Interstitial cystitis can cause stiffening of the bladder wall, which allows your bladder to hold less urine.\n*   **Lower quality of life.** Frequent urination and pain may interfere with social activities, work and other activities of daily life.\n*   **Sexual intimacy problems.** Frequent urination and pain may strain your personal relationships, and sexual intimacy may suffer.\n*   **Emotional troubles.** The chronic pain and interrupted sleep associated with interstitial cystitis may cause emotional stress and can lead to depression.\n\n【22】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The overall response rate was 49%. We examined the unadjusted effect of each independent variable on the likelihood of future participation in health-related surveys using univariate logistic regression and discerned the relative contribution of the different variables with multivariate logistic regression analysis.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Respondents were asked to complete an average of 4.5 different surveys in the year before the current survey; approximately a quarter of the respondents perceived these surveys to be burdensome. The likelihood of future participation in health-related surveys was negatively related to good health status, a busy schedule, and perceptions that the surveys were too long. Respondents were more than twice as likely to indicate that they would participate in a future health-related survey if they knew the organization doing the survey.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】For health-related surveys, investigators should remain mindful of people's busy schedules and keep their surveys as short as possible. Further research is needed to clarify whether the decision to participate in a survey hinges more on knowing the organization paying to have a survey performed (the sponsor) or the survey vendor collecting the data.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Detection was by aerodynamic particle spectrometry. Both reusable cloth masks and disposable paper masks were studied. Transmission was simulated indoors during a 3-minute interval to eliminate the effect of variable ventilation rate on aerosol exposure. The study commenced on September 16, 2020, and concluded on December 15, 2020.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Compared with a baseline of 1-foot separation with no masks employed, particle count was reduced by 84% at 3 feet of separation and 97% at 6 feet. A modest decrease in particle count was observed when only the receiver was masked. The most substantial exposure reduction occurred when the aerosol source was masked (or both parties were masked). When both the source and target were masked, particle count was reduced by more than 99.5% of baseline, regardless of separation distance or which type of mask was employed.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】These results support the principle of layered protection to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, and other respiratory viruses and emphasize the importance of controlling the spread of aerosol at its source. The combination of masking and distancing reduced the exposure to exhaled particulates more than any individual measure. Combined measures remain the most effective way to combat the spread of respiratory infection.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】APS ( aerodynamic particle sizer ), COVID-19 ( coronavirus disease 2019 ), HCP ( health care personnel ), PSL ( polystyrene latex ), SARS-CoV-2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ), SLPM ( standard liter per minute )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Three weeks before presentation, she had started taking oral contraceptives (OCPs), which were prescribed to control dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The bleeding was thought to be secondary to a newly discovered uterine fibroid. The patient's daily bleeding had stopped completely 4 days before admission. Her symptoms had begun 1 day before admission, when she woke up feeling nauseated and could not stop vomiting. She thought she had the flu and postponed coming to the hospital. The patient described lower quadrant abdominal pain and several bloody, soft stools the day before admission. She denied any fevers or diarrhea. Her medical history was unremarkable, and she reported only osteoarthritis and a prior tubal ligation. She denied taking any daily medications except for the OCPs, which she had also taken at the age of 19 years with no problems. The patient had a clinically relevant smoking history, having smoked 1 to 2 packs per day since the age of 14 years. She drank wine socially.\n\n【1】In the 3 months preceding her recent uterine bleeding, the patient had had no vaginal bleeding or menstrual cycles. Up until that time, she had been having regular cycles with normal flow. She had also been having hot flashes for about a year before admission. The patient had regularly undergone Papanicolaou smears and mammography, with no abnormalities identified. She had never undergone an endometrial biopsy and had not yet undergone a screening colonoscopy.\n\n【2】On presentation, the patient was writhing in severe pain, seemingly unable to find a comfortable position. Her abdominal examination was notable for hypoactive bowel sounds and tenderness, most prominent in the left lower quadrant. Peritoneal signs were absent. Her presentation was markedly out of proportion with the findings on physical examination. Findings on the remainder of the examination, including the neurologic and peripheral arterial examinations, were unremarkable.\n\n【3】*   1.\n\n【4】    **_Which one of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's presentation?_**\n\n【5】    *   a.\n\n【6】        _Diverticulitis_\n\n【7】    *   b.\n\n【8】        _Cerebellar infarction_\n\n【9】    *   c.\n\n【10】        _Acute mesenteric ischemia_\n\n【11】    *   d.\n\n【12】        _Nephrolithiasis_\n\n【13】    *   e.\n\n【14】        _Ischemic colitis_\n\n【15】Diverticulitis is high in the differential diagnosis of a patient with abdominal pain localizing to the left lower quadrant. However, the presence of bloody stools and the absence of fever argue against this diagnosis. Diverticulitis becomes more prevalent with increasing age; however, with the current obesity epidemic, this demographic may include much younger people. A cerebellar infarction should always be considered in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors, particularly one presenting with nausea and vomiting. However, the lack of associated neurologic signs and symptoms, as well as the presence of bloody stools and abdominal tenderness, argues strongly against the diagnosis in this case. In a case series of 15 patients with missed cerebellar infarctions, gastritis and gastroenteritis were common alternative diagnoses in those with symptoms of nausea and vomiting.\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>*   Savitz SI\n*   Caplan LR\n*   Edlow JA</u>\n\n【17】Pitfalls in the diagnosis of cerebellar infarction.\n\n【18】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Acad Emerg Med._ 2007; 14 : 63-68</u></u>\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【20】Many of these patients had normal findings on computed tomography (CT) of the head, which is a highly insensitive study for the detection of early posterior fossa ischemia. Acute mesenteric ischemia is the most likely diagnosis, given the clinical context in this case. The patient had several immediate risk factors for clot formation, including her age, smoking status, and recent initiation of OCPs. Further, her symptoms were disproportionate to her examination findings. Nephrolithiasis, which is a reasonable differential diagnosis given lower quadrant writhing abdominal pain, is often associated with nausea and vomiting. However, the presence of abdominal tenderness on examination and history of bloody stooling make this diagnosis unlikely. This presentation has many features consistent with ischemic colitis, which is a consequence of small-vessel atherosclerosis and a transient decrease in blood flow to the colon. Ischemic colitis typically occurs in adults older than 60 years and presents with left-sided abdominal pain and bloody stools. The history is typically more protracted, and the pain less intense, than would be seen with acute mesenteric ischemia. It is critical to exclude acute mesenteric ischemia first because it carries considerable mortality, which can be affected by an early invasive approach.\n\n【21】The patient was given intravenous hydration, began receiving fentanyl patient-controlled analgesia, and was given intravenous antiemetic agents. Her laboratory examination revealed the following (reference ranges provided parenthetically): leukocyte count, 27.6 × 10  /L (3.5-10.5 × 10  /L), with a predominant neutrophilia; hemoglobin, 12.5 g/dL (12.0-15.5 g/dL); and platelet count, 311 × 10  /L (150-450 × 10  /L). The electrolyte panel returned the following results: sodium, 134 mEq/L (135-145 mEq/L); potassium, 3.4 mmol/L (3.6-4.8 mmol/L); chloride, 102 mmol/L (100-108 mmol/L); bicarbonate, 18 mEq/L (22-29 mEq/L); creatinine, 0.5 mg/dL (0.7-1.2 mg/dL); and blood urea nitrogen, 6 mg/dL (6-21 mg/dL). Also noted was 1.4 mmol/L of lactate (0.6-2.3 mmol/L). A panel of abdominal markers revealed the following: alkaline phosphatase, 71 U/L (41-108 U/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 31 U/L (8-43 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 12 U/L (7-45 U/L); lipase, 69 U/L (10-73 U/L); and total bilirubin, 0.4 mg/dL (0.1-1.0 mg/dL).\n\n【22】*   2.\n\n【23】    **_Which one of the following is the most appropriate next diagnostic test?_**\n\n【24】    *   a.\n\n【25】        _Abdominal flat-plate and upright radiography_\n\n【26】    *   b.\n\n【27】        _D-dimer assay_\n\n【28】    *   c.\n\n【29】        _CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis_\n\n【30】    *   d.\n\n【31】        _Abdominal ultrasonography with Doppler imaging_\n\n【32】    *   e.\n\n【33】        _Repeated urgent lactate assays_\n\n【34】In the setting of an abdominal emergency, plain abdominal radiography is most useful for diagnosing bowel obstruction, pneumoperitoneum, and occasionally ureteral calculi. However, with a high clinical suspicion for bowel ischemia and laboratory identification of low bicarbonate levels, plain radiography would not be the best next test. The preclinical probability for thrombosis in our patient was high, meaning that findings on D-dimer assay would not affect management. The best next test would be CT angiography, which could identify an occluded vessel, would be better at characterizing potentially ischemic or necrotic intestinal tissue, and might identify a source for embolization. Abdominal ultrasonography with Doppler imaging is a potentially useful study in this setting; however, it is not as sensitive as CT angiography would be. Lactic acid levels can be very useful in the diagnosis of intestinal ischemia but are not a perfect screening tool. Lactate has been reported to have a sensitivity of 96% to 100%, with a specificity of only 38% to 42%. Normal lactate levels may be seen, especially early in establishing or ruling out the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia.\n\n【35】无关删除-2:<u>*   Brandt LJ\n*   Boley SJ</u>\n\n【36】AGA Technical Review on Intestinal Ischemia.\n\n【37】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Gastroenterology._ 2000; 118 : 954-968</u></u>\n\n【38】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (471)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【39】Given the patient's age, smoking history, recent initiation of OCPs, and examination findings, urgent CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed. An occlusive thrombus of the celiac trunk was identified with distal splenic arterial occlusions, massive splenic infarcts, and a wedge-shaped hepatic infarct. A nonocclusive thrombus in the superior mesenteric artery was also present. No bowel wall thickening, fat stranding, or pneumatosis was noted. On CT angiography, a small (subcentimeter), mobile thrombus in the ascending aorta was identified in an area of an atherosclerotic plaque. Scattered, mild plaques were noted throughout the aorta. An emergent consultation was sought with vascular and general surgery.\n\n【40】*   3.\n\n【41】    **_Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?_**\n\n【42】    *   a.\n\n【43】        _Thrombolytic therapy_\n\n【44】    *   b.\n\n【45】        _Surgical embolectomy_\n\n【46】    *   c.\n\n【47】        _Emergent bowel resection_\n\n【48】    *   d.\n\n【49】        _Invasive mesenteric angiography_\n\n【50】    *   e.\n\n【51】        _Continuous heparin infusion and serial abdominal examinations_\n\n【52】Thrombolytic therapy could be an appropriate intervention for an acute arterial thrombosis or embolism. However, in our patient both the recent history of menorrhagia and the risk of dislodging the ascending aortic thrombus preclude the use of thrombolytic agents. Surgical embolectomy and emergent bowel resection would be appropriate if peritoneal signs or a major embolus in the absence of peritoneal signs was present. The presence of peritoneal signs is thought to be a surrogate of underlying bowel infarction. Mesenteric revascularization, possibly by embolectomy, should typically precede bowel resection in an effort to preserve potentially viable intestinal segments and spare resection of more bowel than is necessary. Invasive mesenteric angiography is the criterion standard imaging test for suspected acute mesenteric ischemia. Had this technique been used in our patient, a catheter could have been left in place for continuous infusion of papaverine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Papaverine acts as a vasodilator and can potentially help rescue salvageable bowel. Because our patient did not have clinical evidence of infarcted bowel, major embolism, multiorgan failure, or hemodynamic instability, she was initially managed conservatively with a continuous heparin infusion and careful clinical monitoring.\n\n【53】Transesophageal echocardiography was performed, revealing no evidence of atrial septal defects or intracardiac thrombi. Early in the morning after admission, the patient had an episode of dark, red hematemesis and was found to have voluntary guarding on examination. She was taken emergently to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. During the course of back-to-back operations, the patient underwent resection of 129 cm of jejunum and subsequently an additional 62 cm of ileum. The patient was left with approximately 210 cm of viable small bowel.\n\n【54】*   4.\n\n【55】    **_Given the case information up to this point, which one of the following is the least likely precipitant of the patient's condition?_**\n\n【56】    *   a.\n\n【57】        _Smoking, OCPs, and perimenopausal state alone_\n\n【58】    *   b.\n\n【59】        _Thrombophilia_\n\n【60】    *   c.\n\n【61】        _Occult malignancy_\n\n【62】    *   d.\n\n【63】        _Mesenteric vasculitis_\n\n【64】    *   e.\n\n【65】        _Median arcuate ligament variant_\n\n【66】Evaluation of a patient with an arterial clot should include consideration of both vascular and thrombotic etiologies.

Screening for thrombophilia, especially measurement of antiphospholipid antibodies, should be performed because the diagnosis establishes a need for indefinite anticoagulation. Occult malignancy is always a consideration in an older person with a substantial clot burden; however, arterial events are much less frequent than venous ones. Mesenteric vasculitis is typically a manifestation of a systemic vasculitis, and the mechanism of ischemia may include luminal narrowing, thrombosis, or spontaneous dissection. Median arcuate ligament variant occurs as a result of a normal anatomic variant, in which the celiac axis becomes indented. A small number of persons with this variant will be clinically affected. This diagnosis would not explain the presence of thrombosis and typically evolves more gradually.\n\n【72】The patient tested negative for thrombophilia; however, this testing was performed during the acute phase and may be misleading. The patient underwent uterine ultrasonography, which revealed an endometrial thickness less than 5 mm, and an endometrial biopsy was not pursued. Follow-up laboratory studies revealed a resolved leukocytosis (leukocyte count, 7.4 × 10  /L \\[3.5-10.5 × 10  /L\\]), a stable hemoglobin (13.3 g/dL \\[12.0-15.5 g/dL\\]), and marked thrombocytosis (platelet count, 962 × 10  /L \\[150-450 × 10  /L\\]).\n\n【73】*   5.\n\n【74】    **_Which one of the following is necessary to complete the medical management of our patient?_**\n\n【75】    *   a.\n\n【76】        _Prophylactic splenectomy_\n\n【77】    *   b.\n\n【78】        _Vaccinations for_ Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hae mophilus influenzae B, _and_ Neisseria meningitidis\n\n【79】    *   c.\n\n【80】        _Initiation of long-term total parenteral nutrition_\n\n【81】    *   d.\n\n【82】        _Recommendation for indefinite anticoagulation_\n\n【83】    *   e.\n\n【84】        _Initiation of progesterone-only tablets_\n\n【85】Most of the patient's spleen was infarcted, accounting for her marked thrombocytosis. A small percentage of patients with infarcted spleens develop an abscess, which may require splenectomy, especially if multifocal in nature. However, there is no role for routine, prophylactic splenectomy. In the setting of a functional splenectomy, prophylactic vaccinations for _S pneumoniae, H influenzae B_ , and _N meningitidis_ are indicated. The risk of postsplenectomy sepsis is approximately 1% to 2% in adults, but the mortality may exceed 50% if it does occur. Acute mesenteric ischemia, along with Crohn disease, is a leading risk factor for short-bowel syndrome. Patients with more than a 50% reduction or less than 200 cm of functional small bowel are at risk of developing this syndrome of malabsorption and malnutrition. Many patients require long-term total parenteral nutrition; however, on the basis of the amount of bowel removed, our patient was not at high risk. If our patient had met criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome, indefinite anticoagulation would have been indicated. However, treatment for 3 to 6 months with follow-up imaging would be an appropriate recommendation at this time. In terms of the patient's fibroid, progesterone-only tablets could be considered but are not necessary. Given that she had a stable hemoglobin level, expectant management would be a reasonable approach. Endometrial ablation or even hysterectomy could be considered depending on her subsequent clinical course, in the setting of required anticoagulation.\n\n【86】The patient was able to tolerate oral intake and was bridged to a therapeutic international normalized ratio with coumadin and heparin; uterine bleeding did not recur. Anticoagulation for 3 months was recommended, with follow-up CT angiography before discontinuation of therapy to evaluate both the aortic arch and mesenteric thrombi.\n\n【87】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【88】Arterial emboli are the most frequent etiology of acute mesenteric ischemia, followed by arterial thrombosis, nonocclusive disease, and rarely, venous thrombosis.\n\n【89】无关删除-2:<u>*   Oldenburg WA\n*   Lau LL\n*   Rodenberg TJ\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【90】Acute mesenteric ischemia: a clinical review.\n\n【91】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Intern Med._ 2004; 164 : 1054-1062</u></u>\n\n【92】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (500)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【93】The former 2 conditions classically present abruptly, whereas the latter 2 have a more gradual onset and protracted course; all are associated with a nonspecific set of symptoms. A history of postprandial abdominal pain, nausea, and weight loss can help in differentiating a decomposition of a long-standing problem from a new embolic or thrombotic event. Clinical history and imaging findings may help in differentiating between acute thrombosis and embolism. However, as in our case, this distinction can be difficult. Regardless, all 4 etiologies of acute mesenteric ischemia can progress to bowel infarction, which may manifest clinically as an acute abdomen, with a sepsis-type picture. Establishing the diagnosis early, before the development of bowel infarction, has been a major factor in reducing mortality. In a recent series of 77 patients with acute intestinal ischemia managed surgically, the 30-day mortality rate was 30.0% for patients with arterial occlusive disease, 67.9% for those with nonocclusive disease, and 10.5% for those with mesenteric venous thrombosis.\n\n【94】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hsu HP\n*   Shan YS\n*   Hsieh YH\n*   Sy ED\n*   Lin PW</u>\n\n【95】Impact of etiologic factors and APACHE II and POSSUM scores in management and clinical outcome of acute intestinal ischemic disorders after surgical treatment.\n\n【96】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_World J Surg._ 2006; 30 : 2152-2162</u></u>\n\n【97】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (20)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【98】Thus, establishing the etiology is useful in assessing prognosis.\n\n【99】Arterial embolism may be suspected clinically in the setting of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, ventricular aneurysm, aortic mural thrombi, and certain valvular diseases. Paradoxical emboli should be considered if a patent foramen ovale is identified. The major risk factors for arterial thrombosis include atherosclerosis, estrogen replacement therapy, and hypercoagulability. The distinction is also important in that a diagnosis of acute mesenteric thrombosis should prompt an early invasive approach because of the high in-hospital mortality associated with this etiology.\n\n【100】无关删除-2:<u>*   Brandt LJ\n*   Boley SJ</u>\n\n【101】AGA Technical Review on Intestinal Ischemia.\n\n【102】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Gastroenterology._ 2000; 118 : 954-968</u></u>\n\n【103】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (471)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【104】Regardless of etiology, an early invasive approach should be adopted in the presence of hemodynamic instability or peritoneal signs or if the clot completely occludes the superior mesenteric artery or resides in the superior mesenteric artery above the origin of the ileocolic artery.\n\n【105】无关删除-2:<u>*   Brandt LJ\n*   Boley SJ</u>\n\n【106】AGA Technical Review on Intestinal Ischemia.\n\n【107】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Gastroenterology._ 2000; 118 : 954-968</u></u>\n\n【108】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (471)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【109】The pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis is complex and often involves an interaction among atherosclerotic disease, rheology, and thrombophilia, a concept embodied in the Virchow triad.\n\n【110】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rauch U\n*   Osende JI\n*   Fuster V\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【111】Thrombus formation on atherosclerotic plaques: pathogenesis and clinical consequences.\n\n【112】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 2001; 134 : 224-238</u></u>\n\n【113】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (266)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【114】The high lipid content of advanced atheromatous lesions is very thrombogenic, largely because of a high content of tissue factor.

{"seq_id": "c663ef31-7730-4206-8168-ba8b7e58a9a9", "title": "Myelofibrosis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Myelofibrosis is an uncommon type of bone marrow cancer that disrupts your body's normal production of blood cells.\n\n【2】Myelofibrosis causes extensive scarring in your bone marrow, leading to severe anemia that can cause weakness and fatigue. Bone marrow scarring can also cause you to have a low number of blood-clotting cells called platelets, which increases the risk of bleeding. Myelofibrosis often causes an enlarged spleen.\n\n【3】Myelofibrosis is considered to be a chronic leukemia — a cancer that affects the blood-forming tissues in the body. Myelofibrosis belongs to a group of diseases called myeloproliferative disorders.\n\n【4】Myelofibrosis can happen on its own (primary myelofibrosis) or it can develop from another bone marrow disorder (secondary myelofibrosis).\n\n【5】Some people with myelofibrosis have no symptoms and might not need treatment right away. Others with more-serious forms of the disease might need aggressive treatments right away. Treatment for myelofibrosis, which focuses on relieving symptoms, can involve a variety of options.\n\n【6】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【7】Myelofibrosis usually develops slowly. In its very early stages, many people don't experience signs or symptoms.\n\n【8】As disruption of normal blood cell production increases, signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【9】*   Feeling tired, weak or short of breath, usually because of anemia\n*   Pain or fullness below your ribs on the left side, due to an enlarged spleen\n*   Easy bruising\n*   Easy bleeding\n*   Excessive sweating during sleep (night sweats)\n*   Fever\n*   Bone pain\n\n【10】### When to see a doctor\n\n【11】Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】Myelofibrosis occurs when bone marrow stem cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. The stem cells have the ability to replicate and divide into the multiple specialized cells that make up your blood — red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.\n\n【14】It's not clear what causes the genetic mutations in bone marrow stem cells.\n\n【15】As the mutated blood stem cells replicate and divide, they pass along the mutations to the new cells. As more and more of these mutated cells are created, they begin to have serious effects on blood production.\n\n【16】The end result is usually a lack of red blood cells — which causes the anemia characteristic of myelofibrosis — and an overabundance of white blood cells and varying levels of platelets. In people with myelofibrosis, the normally spongy bone marrow becomes scarred.\n\n【17】Several specific gene mutations have been identified in people with myelofibrosis. The most common is the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene mutation. Other less common mutations include CALR and MPL. Some people with myelofibrosis don't have any identifiable gene mutations. Knowing whether these gene mutations are associated with your myelofibrosis helps determine your prognosis and your treatment.\n\n【18】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【19】Although the cause of myelofibrosis often isn't known, certain factors are known to increase your risk:\n\n【20】*   **Age.** Myelofibrosis can affect anyone, but it's most often diagnosed in people older than 50.\n*   **Another blood cell disorder.** A small portion of people with myelofibrosis develop the condition as a complication of essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera.\n*   **Exposure to certain chemicals.** Myelofibrosis has been linked to exposure to industrial chemicals such as toluene and benzene.\n*   **Exposure to radiation.** People exposed to very high levels of radiation have an increased risk of myelofibrosis.\n\n【21】Complications\n-------------\n\n【22】Complications that may result from myelofibrosis include:\n\n【23】*   **Increased pressure on blood flowing into your liver.** Normally, blood flow from the spleen enters your liver through a large blood vessel called the portal vein. Increased blood flow from an enlarged spleen can lead to high blood pressure in the portal vein (portal hypertension). This in turn can force excess blood into smaller veins in your stomach and esophagus, potentially causing these veins to rupture and bleed.\n*   **Pain.** A severely enlarged spleen can cause abdominal pain and back pain.\n*   **Growths in other areas of your body.** Formation of blood cells outside the bone marrow (extramedullary hematopoiesis) may create clumps (tumors) of developing blood cells in other areas of your body. These tumors may cause problems such as bleeding in your gastrointestinal system, coughing or spitting up of blood, compression of your spinal cord, or seizures.\n*   **Bleeding complications.** As the disease progresses, your platelet count tends to drop below normal (thrombocytopenia) and platelet function becomes impaired. An insufficient number of platelets can lead to easy bleeding — an issue that you and your doctor will want to discuss if you're contemplating any type of surgical procedure.\n*   **Acute leukemia.** Some people with myelofibrosis eventually develop acute myelogenous leukemia, a type of blood and bone marrow cancer that progresses rapidly.\n\n【24】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "aed257ce-0a59-4f94-8fc5-32a9f4945a81", "title": "Acupuncture", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Acupuncture involves the insertion of very thin needles through your skin at strategic points on your body. A key component of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is most commonly used to treat pain. Increasingly, it is being used for overall wellness, including stress management.\n\n【2】Traditional Chinese medicine explains acupuncture as a technique for balancing the flow of energy or life force — known as chi or qi (chee) — believed to flow through pathways (meridians) in your body. By inserting needles into specific points along these meridians, acupuncture practitioners believe that your energy flow will re-balance.\n\n【3】In contrast, many Western practitioners view the acupuncture points as places to stimulate nerves, muscles and connective tissue. Some believe that this stimulation boosts your body's natural painkillers.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Acupuncture is used mainly to relieve discomfort associated with a variety of diseases and conditions, including:\n\n【6】*   Chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting\n*   Dental pain\n*   Fibromyalgia\n*   Headaches, including tension headaches and migraines\n*   Labor pain\n*   Lower back pain\n*   Neck pain\n*   Osteoarthritis\n*   Menstrual cramps\n*   Respiratory disorders, such as allergic rhinitis\n*   Tennis elbow\n\n【7】Risks\n-----\n\n【8】The risks of acupuncture are low if you have a competent, certified acupuncture practitioner using sterile needles. Common side effects include soreness and minor bleeding or bruising where the needles were inserted. Single-use, disposable needles are now the practice standard, so the risk of infection is minimal. Not everyone is a good candidate for acupuncture.\n\n【9】Before having acupuncture treatment, be sure to tell the practitioner if you:\n\n【10】*   **Have a bleeding disorder.** Your chances of bleeding or bruising from the needles may be increased if you have a bleeding disorder or if you're taking blood thinners.\n*   **Have a pacemaker.** Acupuncture that involves applying mild electrical pulses to the needles may potentially interfere with a pacemaker's operation.\n*   **Are pregnant.** Some acupuncture points are thought to stimulate labor, which could result in a premature delivery.\n\n【11】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【12】No special preparation is required before acupuncture treatment.\n\n【13】### Choosing a practitioner\n\n【14】If you're considering acupuncture, take the same steps you would to choose a doctor:\n\n【15】*   Ask people you trust for recommendations.\n*   Check the practitioner's training and credentials. Most states require that nonphysician acupuncturists pass an exam conducted by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.\n*   Interview the practitioner. Ask what's involved in the treatment, how likely it is to help your condition and how much it will cost.\n*   Find out whether your insurance covers the treatment.\n\n【16】Tell your doctor that you're considering acupuncture. He or she may be able to tell you about the success rate of using acupuncture for your condition or recommend an acupuncture practitioner.\n\n【17】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【18】Each person who performs acupuncture has a unique style, often blending aspects of Eastern and Western approaches to medicine. To determine the type of acupuncture treatment that will help you the most, your practitioner may ask you about your symptoms, behaviors and lifestyle. He or she may also closely examine:\n\n【19】*   The parts of your body that are painful\n*   The shape, coating and color of your tongue\n*   The color of your face\n*   The strength, rhythm and quality of the pulse in your wrist\n\n【20】An acupuncture session may take up to 60 minutes, although some appointments may be much shorter. A common treatment plan for a single complaint would typically involve one or two treatments a week. The number of treatments will depend on the condition being treated and its severity. In general, it's common to receive 6 to 8 treatments.\n\n【21】### During the procedure\n\n【22】Acupuncture points are situated in all areas of the body. Sometimes the appropriate points are far removed from the area of your pain. Your acupuncture practitioner will tell you the general site of the planned treatment and whether you need to remove any clothing. A gown, towel or sheet will be provided. You lie on a padded table for the treatment, which involves:\n\n【23】*   **Needle insertion.** Acupuncture needles are inserted to various depths at strategic points on your body. The needles are very thin, so insertion usually causes little discomfort. People often don't feel them inserted at all. A typical treatment uses 5 to 20 needles. You may feel a mild aching sensation when a needle reaches the correct depth.\n*   **Needle manipulation.** Your practitioner may gently move or twirl the needles after placement or apply heat or mild electrical pulses to the needles.\n*   **Needle removal.** In most cases, the needles remain in place for 10 to 15 minutes while you lie still and relax. There is usually no discomfort when the needles are removed.\n\n【24】### After the procedure\n\n【25】Some people feel relaxed and others feel energized after an acupuncture treatment. But not everyone responds to acupuncture. If your symptoms don't begin to improve within a few weeks, acupuncture may not be right for you.\n\n【26】Results\n-------\n\n【27】The benefits of acupuncture are sometimes difficult to measure, but many people find it helpful as a means to control a variety of painful conditions.\n\n【28】Several studies, however, indicate that some types of simulated acupuncture appear to work just as well as real acupuncture. There's also evidence that acupuncture works best in people who expect it to work.\n\n【29】Acupuncture has few side effects, so it may be worth a try if you're having trouble controlling pain with more-conventional methods.\n\n【30】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

There are also insufficient medical clinicians to meet the demand for health services. A shrinking workforce, an aging population, financial pressures, and increased consumer demand will translate into severe personnel deficits in the future. Similarly, family fragmentation and the trend toward bureaucratization of long-term care have reduced the availability of informal caregivers. Younger workers should be considered a scarce resource for health care organization and planning purposes. The ability of the United States to meet its entitlement promises is likely to be compromised by a reduced labor pool and simultaneous budgetary constraints. Because good geriatric care is often labor-intensive, meeting this goal poses an increasing challenge.\n\n【1】CAQ ( Certificate of Added Qualifications ), CNA ( certified nurse assistant ), LPN ( licensed practical nurse ), PA ( physician assistant ), RN ( registered nurse )\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "0d72b8b3-4890-4f6b-b6e8-c6726697a3f9", "title": "Mosquito bites", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Mosquito bites are the itchy bumps that form on the skin after mosquitoes feed on your blood. The bumps usually go away without treatment in a few days. Some mosquito bites may get very swollen, sore and inflamed. This type of reaction, sometimes called skeeter syndrome, is most common in children.\n\n【2】Mosquito bites can cause severe illnesses if the insects carry certain viruses or parasites. Infected mosquitoes can spread West Nile virus, Zika virus, and the viruses that cause malaria, yellow fever and some types of brain infection.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Mosquito bites often happen on parts of the body that aren't covered by clothing. Symptoms include:\n\n【5】*   An itchy, inflamed bump that forms a few minutes after a bite\n*   A painful spot that looks like a hive and forms within 24 hours after a bite\n*   Small blisters\n\n【6】A severe reaction to mosquito bites can cause:\n\n【7】*   A large, swollen, inflamed area\n*   A hive-like rash\n*   Swelling around the eyes\n\n【8】Children are more likely to have a severe reaction than are adults.\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】Contact your health care provider if the mosquito bites seem to occur with warning signs of a serious condition. These might include a high fever, severe headache, body aches and signs of infection.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】Mosquito bites are caused by female mosquitoes feeding on your blood. As a biting mosquito fills itself with blood, it injects saliva into your skin. The saliva triggers an immune system reaction that results in the classic itching and bump.\n\n【13】Mosquitoes are attracted to smells, such as from sweat, floral scents and exhaled carbon dioxide.\n\n【14】Complications\n-------------\n\n【15】Scratching bites can lead to infection.\n\n【16】Mosquitoes can carry the viruses that cause certain diseases, such as West Nile virus and the viruses that cause malaria, yellow fever and dengue fever. The mosquito gets a virus or parasite by biting an infected person or animal. Then when it's biting you, the mosquito can transfer that virus or parasite to you through its saliva. West Nile, dengue fever and some types of encephalitis occur in the United States. Other diseases, such as malaria and yellow fever, are far more common in tropical areas of the world.\n\n【17】Prevention\n----------\n\n【18】Mosquitos bite during both day and night, and they can live indoors. You can take several steps to protect yourself from mosquito bites.\n\n【19】### Avoid and exclude mosquitoes\n\n【20】Limit exposure to mosquitoes by:\n\n【21】*   Repairing any tears in the screens on windows, doors and camping gear\n*   Using mosquito netting over strollers and cribs\n*   Using mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors\n*   Selecting self-care products that don't have scents\n\n【22】### Use insect repellent\n\n【23】Use insect repellent when mosquitoes are active. The most effective insect repellents in the United States include one of these active ingredients:\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>*   DEET\n*   Icaridin, also called picaridin\n*   Oil of lemon eucalyptus\n*   IR3535\n*   Para-menthane-diol (PMD)\n*   2-Undecanone</u>\n\n【25】These ingredients temporarily repel mosquitoes and ticks. DEET may offer longer lasting protection. Whichever product you choose, read the label before you apply it. If you're using a spray repellent, apply it outdoors and away from food. You may need to reapply it 6 to 8 hours later if you're still in an area where mosquitoes are active.\n\n【26】If you're also using sunscreen, put it on first, about 20 minutes before applying the repellent. Avoid products that have both sunscreen and repellent, because you'll likely need to reapply sunscreen more often than repellent. And it's best to use only as much repellent as you need and to wash your hands after applying it.\n\n【27】Used according to package directions, these products are generally safe for children and adults, with a few exceptions:\n\n【28】*   Don't use DEET-containing products on infants younger than 2 months.\n*   Don't use icaridin on infants younger than 6 months\n*   Check the labels of products with oil of lemon eucalyptus — some aren't suitable for children under 3 years old.\n*   Don't use para-menthane-diol on children under 3 years old\n*   Don't let young children get insect repellent on their hands, as they might get it in their mouths.\n*   Don't apply repellent near the eyes and mouth.\n*   Don't apply repellent under clothing.\n*   Don't apply repellent over sunburns, cuts, wounds or rashes.\n*   When the risk of mosquito bites has passed, wash repellent off the skin with soap and water.\n\n【29】### Treat clothing and outdoor gear\n\n【30】Permethrin is an insecticide and insect repellent used for added protection. This product is made to use on clothing and outdoor gear, not skin. Check the product label for instructions. Some sporting goods stores sell clothing pretreated with permethrin. Don't wash bed nets or set them in sunlight, as this breaks down permethrin. Clothing sprayed with permethrin can offer protection for two washings and up to two weeks.\n\n【31】### Use protective clothing and gear\n\n【32】Weather permitting, wear a hat, long-sleeved shirts and long pants.\n\n【33】### Take preventive medicine\n\n【34】Get vaccinations or take preventive medicine that your health care provider has suggested.\n\n【35】Think about whether you tend to have large or severe reactions to mosquito bites — skeeter syndrome. You might want to take a nondrowsy, nonprescription antihistamine when you know you'll be exposed to mosquitoes.\n\n【36】### Reduce mosquitoes around your home\n\n【37】Get rid of standing water, which mosquitoes need to breed. Take these steps to keep your house and yard free of mosquito pools:\n\n【38】*   Unclog roof gutters.\n*   Empty children's wading pools at least once a week, and preferably more often.\n*   Change water in birdbaths at least weekly.\n*   Get rid of old tires in your yard.\n*   Empty outdoor flower pots regularly or store them upside down so that they can't collect water.\n*   Drain your fire pit if water collects there.\n\n【39】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

In addition, other persons living in your household should not get live vaccines (eg, nasal flu virus vaccine). Try to avoid persons who have taken live vaccines. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long.

Oral warfarin, typically given to a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0, is prescribed for secondary thromboprophylaxis in patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, acute coronary syndromes, stroke, and peripheral arterial thrombosis.\n\n【1】无关删除-2:<u>*   Deitcher SR\n*   Carman TL</u>\n\n【2】Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.\n\n【3】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med._ 2002; 4 : 223-238</u></u>\n\n【4】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【5】Warfarin is prescribed almost universally for primary thromboprophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation and mechanical prosthetic heart valves and for the preservation of peripheral arterial bypass graft patency. For most patients, parenteral agents are used for initial, immediate anticoagulation and as a “bridge” until a stable, target-range INR is achieved with warfarin. In lone atrial fibrillation, initiation of oral warfarin therapy without a parenteral bridge seems prudent and is widely accepted as a standard of care.\n\n【6】Historically, parenteral anticoagulation has required hospitalization for continuous administration of intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) and frequent venipuncture for laboratory monitoring by the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay. Because of the unique pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral warfarin therapy, at least 4 days of UFH and warfarin overlap was required before a patient could be given only oral anticoagulation medication and be dismissed from the hospital.\n\n【7】无关删除-2:<u>*   Choueiri T\n*   Deitcher SR</u>\n\n【8】Why shouldn't we use warfarin alone to treat acute venous thrombosis?\n\n【9】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Cleve Clin J Med._ 2002; 69 : 546-548</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (5)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【11】In fact, more than 4 days of hospitalization were often needed to achieve a stable, target-range INR.

Even if hospitalization is not avoided completely, accelerated discharge to complete outpatient bridging is attractive. A reduced length of stay has merits beyond the ability of a hospital to handle a larger patient volume for a given period of time. Less time in the hospital can promote patient ambulation and return to normal activities including work. The use of LMWH for outpatient bridging to oral warfarin in other patient groups (eg, after cardioversion, valve replacement, and vascular surgery) is certainly feasible and may be as effective and safe as inpatient use of UFH. Trials confirming the efficacy and safety of outpatient use of LMWH bridging to warfarin in these settings in which oral anticoagulation medication is used are unfortunately lacking.\n\n【30】删除7:<u>In the current issue of the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings,_ Dunn et al</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-2:<u>*   Dunn A\n*   Bioh D\n*   Beran M\n*   Capasso M\n*   Siu A</u>\n\n【32】Effect of intravenous heparin administration on duration of hospitalization.\n\n【33】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2004; 79 : 159-163</u></u>\n\n【34】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (11)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【35】present thought-provoking results from their retrospective study of the effect of intravenous heparin administration on duration of hospitalization. This article highlights the utilization, and primarily the underutilization, of LMWH as a means to accelerate hospital discharge and minimize hospital length of stay. A delay in discharge was defined as hospitalization solely to facilitate administration of intravenous UFH and associated therapeutic monitoring. The investigators used predefined criteria to classify noted discharge delays as appropriate or potentially avoidable. Not surprisingly, discharges were delayed in 24% of patients who received at least 1 dose of oral warfarin in the hospital and in 12% of patients taking long-term warfarin anticoagulation medications who were admitted for reasons unrelated to thromboembolism or bleeding. Of these delayed discharges, 48% and 56%, respectively, were deemed avoidable. Eleven (31%) of 36 completely evaluable patients admitted with an acute DVT who were not taking oral anticoagulation medications before admission had an avoidable discharge delay. Certainly, many patients could have benefited from outpatient therapy with LMWH. Although this study involved the assessment of practice behavior in 1997, when LMWH had less overall acceptance and the pressures to discharge patients were less, the results help illuminate persistent challenges and new opportunities pertaining to anticoagulation management.\n\n【36】删除7:<u>Two questions remain to be considered. What should be considered an avoidable delay in discharge related to anticoagulant management, and who should decide when outpatient anticoagulation should be used? Patient “comfort” with home-administration (and often self-administration) of an injectable drug, ability to afford the medication, and willingness to self-monitor for serious bleeding complications must be considered. A particular patient's delay in discharge may be viewed as avoidable by a physician, clinical investigator, hospital administrator, and third-party payer but not by the patient. Financially, the patient is unlikely to benefit the most from outpatient LMWH bridging. If a patient were to demand outpatient LMWH therapy but be deemed a poor candidate by his or her physician, it is unlikely that the physician would simply heed the wishes of the patient and send the patient “out the door” with a prescription for LMWH. Similarly, if a physician demands outpatient LMWH therapy but the patient is uncomfortable with the plan, we should not be surprised if the patient refuses to be forced out of the hospital. As physicians, we must appreciate a patient's right to be a vital part of his or her own discharge planning and not succumb to undue pressure from administrators to practice less than ideal medicine. I agree with Dunn et al that systems must be in place to facilitate outpatient use of LMWH so that patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes are optimized.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

We also reviewed their medical charts to record age and estrogen use in the women. The primary aim of our study was to determine whether gonadotropin levels were elevated in 134 patients with AD compared with levels from 45 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and 105 cognitively normal controls.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Although overlap between LH and FSH levels was considerable, LH ( _P_ \\=.046) and FSH ( _P_ \\=.007) were significantly elevated in estrogen-free women with AD (LH: median, 26.3 IU/L; interquartile range, 14.9–34.6 IU/ L; FSH: median, 62.0 IU/L; interquartile range, 45.9–78.5 IU/L) compared with normal controls (LH: median, 20.1 IU/L; interquartile range, 13.7–25.3 IU/L; FSH: median, 47.7 IU/L; interquartile range, 34.1–57.5 IU/L). Levels of LH were also significantly higher ( _P_ \\=.03) in estrogen-free women with AD compared with women with FTD (LH: median, 20.7 IU/L; interquartile range, 19.0–28.5 IU/L; FSH: median, 53.3 IU/L; interquartile range, 27.6–77.9 IU/L). When we controlled for age, no differences in LH and FSH were observed in men with AD compared with normal controls.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Gonadotropin levels are elevated in some patients with AD, ie, women not taking estrogen. Elevated gonadotropin levels may have a role in the production of amyloid-β protein, which is related to formation of senile plaques. Therefore, elevated gonadotropin levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】Aβ ( amyloid-β protein ), AD ( Alzheimer disease ), apo E ( apolipoprotein E ), APP ( amyloid-β precursor protein ), FSH ( follicle-stimulating hormone ), FTD ( frontotemporal dementia ), LH ( luteinizing hormone ), LRP ( low-density lipo-protein receptor-related protein ), MMSE ( Mini-Mental State Examination )\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

This will help prevent kidney problems and keep your kidneys working well.\n\n【40】This medicine often causes nausea and vomiting. However, it is very important that you continue to receive this medicine even if you begin to feel ill. Other medicines may be given to you to help with the nausea and vomiting. Ask your doctor for other ways to lessen these effects.\n\n【41】### Missed Dose\n\n【42】This medicine needs to be given on a fixed schedule. If you miss a dose, call your doctor, home health caregiver, or treatment clinic for instructions.\n\n【43】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【44】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【45】Receiving this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you are female and able to get pregnant, your doctor may give you a pregnancy test before you start using this medicine to make sure you are not pregnant. Female patients should use an effective form of birth control during treatment and for at least 14 months after the last dose. Male patients who have female partners should use effective birth control during treatment and for at least 11 months after the last dose. If you think a pregnancy has occurred while receiving this medicine, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【46】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, diarrhea, a fever or chills, hives, hoarseness, itching, lightheadedness or dizziness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after you receive the medicine.\n\n【47】Cisplatin may cause serious kidney problems. Tell you doctor right away if you have blood in urine, change in frequency of urination or amount of urine, difficulty in breathing, drowsiness, increased thirst, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, swelling of the feet or lower legs, or weakness.\n\n【48】Check with your doctor right away if you are having burning, numbness, tingling, or painful sensations in the arms, hands, legs, or feet. These could be symptoms of a condition called peripheral neuropathy. These symptoms may occur 3 to 8 weeks after the last dose of this medicine.\n\n【49】Cisplatin can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【50】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【51】Check with your doctor right away if you have dizziness, loss of balance, loss of hearing, ringing or buzzing in the ears, or troubled hearing. These could be symptoms of hearing or ear problems.\n\n【52】Call your doctor right away if blurred vision, difficulty with reading, or any other change in vision occurs during or after treatment. These could be symptoms of eye problems (eg, optical neuritis, papilledema, cortical blindness).\n\n【53】This medicine may increase your risk for other cancers, including leukemia. Tell your doctor right away if you have bone or joint pain, fever, pale skin, unusual bleeding or bruising, unusual tiredness or weakness, weight loss, or swollen lymph glands in the neck, armpit, groin, or stomach.\n\n【54】If cisplatin accidentally seeps out of the vein into which it is injected, it may damage some tissues and cause scarring. Tell the doctor or nurse right away if you notice redness, pain, or swelling at the place of injection.\n\n【55】Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children. Some men and women who use this medicine have become infertile (unable to have children).\n\n【56】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【57】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【58】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【59】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【60】#### More common\n\n【61】1.

{"seq_id": "ac97258a-efe7-451b-a68a-dec3700d4864", "title": "Upper endoscopy", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】An upper endoscopy, also called an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, is a procedure used to visually examine your upper digestive system. This is done with the help of a tiny camera on the end of a long, flexible tube. A specialist in diseases of the digestive system (gastroenterologist) uses an endoscopy to diagnose and sometimes treat conditions that affect the upper part of the digestive system.\n\n【2】The medical term for an upper endoscopy is esophagogastroduodenoscopy. You may have an upper endoscopy done in your health care provider's office, an outpatient surgery center or a hospital.\n\n【3】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【4】An upper endoscopy is used to diagnose and sometimes treat conditions that affect the upper part of the digestive system. The upper digestive system includes the esophagus, stomach and beginning of the small intestine (duodenum).\n\n【5】Your provider may recommend an endoscopy procedure to:\n\n【6】*   **Investigate symptoms.** An endoscopy can help determine what's causing digestive signs and symptoms, such as heartburn, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing and gastrointestinal bleeding.\n*   **Diagnose.** An endoscopy offers an opportunity to collect tissue samples (biopsy) to test for diseases and conditions that may be causing anemia, bleeding, inflammation or diarrhea. It can also detect some cancers of the upper digestive system.\n*   **Treat.** Special tools can be passed through the endoscope to treat problems in your digestive system. For example, an endoscopy can be used to burn a bleeding vessel to stop bleeding, widen a narrow esophagus, clip off a polyp or remove a foreign object.\n\n【7】An endoscopy is sometimes combined with other procedures, such as an ultrasound. An ultrasound probe may be attached to the endoscope to create images of the wall of your esophagus or stomach. An endoscopic ultrasound may also help create images of hard-to-reach organs, such as your pancreas. Newer endoscopes use high-definition video to provide clearer images.\n\n【8】Many endoscopes are used with technology called narrow band imaging. Narrow band imaging uses special light to help better detect precancerous conditions, such as Barrett's esophagus.\n\n【9】Risks\n-----\n\n【10】An endoscopy is a very safe procedure. Rare complications include:\n\n【11】*   **Bleeding.** Your risk of bleeding complications after an endoscopy is increased if the procedure involves removing a piece of tissue for testing (biopsy) or treating a digestive system problem. In rare cases, such bleeding may require a blood transfusion.\n*   **Infection.** Most endoscopies consist of an examination and biopsy, and risk of infection is low. The risk of infection increases when additional procedures are performed as part of your endoscopy. Most infections are minor and can be treated with antibiotics. Your provider may give you preventive antibiotics before your procedure if you are at higher risk of infection.\n*   **Tearing of the gastrointestinal tract.** A tear in your esophagus or another part of your upper digestive tract may require hospitalization, and sometimes surgery to repair it. The risk of this complication is very low — it occurs in an estimated 1 of every 2,500 to 11,000 diagnostic upper endoscopies. The risk increases if additional procedures, such as dilation to widen your esophagus, are performed.\n*   **A reaction to sedation or anesthesia.** Upper endoscopy is usually performed with sedation or anesthesia. The type of anesthesia or sedation depends on the person and the reason for the procedure. There is a risk of a reaction to sedation or anesthesia, but the risk is low.\n\n【12】You can reduce your risk of complications by carefully following your health care provider's instructions for preparing for an endoscopy, such as fasting and stopping certain medications.\n\n【13】### Symptoms that could mean a complication\n\n【14】Symptoms to watch for after your endoscopy include:\n\n【15】*   Fever\n*   Chest pain\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Bloody, black or very dark colored stool\n*   Difficulty swallowing\n*   Severe or persistent abdominal pain\n*   Vomiting, especially if your vomit is bloody or looks like coffee grounds\n\n【16】Call your provider immediately or go to an emergency room if you experience any of these symptoms.\n\n【17】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【18】Your provider will give you specific instructions to prepare for your endoscopy. You may be asked to:\n\n【19】*   **Fast before the endoscopy.** You'll typically need to stop eating solid food for eight hours and stop drinking liquids for four hours before your endoscopy. This is to ensure your stomach is empty for the procedure.\n*   **Stop taking certain medications.** You'll need to stop taking certain blood-thinning medications in the days before your endoscopy, if possible. Blood thinners may increase your risk of bleeding if certain procedures are performed during the endoscopy. If you have ongoing conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease or high blood pressure, your provider will give you specific instructions regarding your medications.\n\n【20】Tell your provider about all the medications and supplements you're taking before your endoscopy.\n\n【21】### Plan ahead for your recovery\n\n【22】Most people undergoing an upper endoscopy will receive a sedative to relax them and make them more comfortable during the procedure. Plan ahead for your recovery while the sedative wears off. You may feel mentally alert, but your memory, reaction times and judgment may be impaired. Find someone to drive you home. You may also need to take the day off from work. Don't drive or make any important personal or financial decisions for 24 hours.\n\n【23】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【24】### During an endoscopy\n\n【25】During an upper endoscopy procedure, you'll be asked to lie down on a table on your back or on your side. As the procedure gets underway:\n\n【26】*   **Monitors often are attached to your body.** This allows your health care team to monitor your breathing, blood pressure and heart rate.\n*   **You may receive a sedative medication.** This medication, given through a vein in your forearm, helps you relax during the endoscopy.\n*   **An anesthetic may be used in your mouth.** An anesthetic spray numbs your throat in preparation for insertion of the long, flexible tube (endoscope). You may be asked to wear a plastic mouth guard to hold your mouth open.\n*   **Then the endoscope is inserted in your mouth.** Your provider may ask you to swallow as the scope passes down your throat. You may feel some pressure in your throat, but you shouldn't feel pain.\n\n【27】You can't talk after the endoscope passes down your throat, though you can make noises. The endoscope doesn't interfere with your breathing.\n\n【28】As the endoscope travels down your esophagus:\n\n【29】*   **A tiny camera at the tip transmits images to a video monitor in the exam room.** Your provider watches this monitor to look for anything out of the ordinary in your upper digestive tract. If something unusual is found in your digestive tract, images can be taken for later examination.\n*   **Gentle air pressure may be fed into your esophagus to inflate your digestive tract.** This allows the endoscope to move freely. And it allows the folds of your digestive tract to be examined more easily. You may feel pressure or fullness from the added air.\n*   **Your provider will pass special surgical tools through the endoscope to collect a tissue sample or remove a polyp.** This is done with the help from a video monitor to guide the tools.\n\n【30】When the exam is finished, the endoscope is slowly retracted through your mouth. An endoscopy typically takes 15 to 30 minutes.\n\n【31】### After the endoscopy\n\n【32】You'll be taken to a recovery area to sit or lie quietly after your endoscopy. You may stay for an hour or so. During this time, your health care team can monitor you as the sedative begins to wear off.\n\n【33】Once you're at home, you may experience some mildly uncomfortable symptoms after endoscopy, such as:\n\n【34】*   Bloating and gas\n*   Cramping\n*   Sore throat\n\n【35】These signs and symptoms will improve with time. If you're concerned or quite uncomfortable, call your health care provider.\n\n【36】Take it easy for the rest of the day after your endoscopy. After receiving a sedative, you may feel alert, but your reaction times are affected and judgment is delayed.\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】When you receive the results of your endoscopy will depend on your situation. If, for instance, the endoscopy was performed to look for an ulcer, you may learn the findings right after your procedure. If a tissue sample (biopsy) was collected, you may need to wait a few days to get results from the testing laboratory. Ask your provider when you can expect the results of your endoscopy.\n\n【39】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Patients were seen from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2018. Injuries were categorized into 3 groups: (1) soft tissue injury, (2) axial nonbony injury, and (3) bony injury. Patients underwent evaluation and were counseled to modify exercise activity.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We identified 89 patients for inclusion in the study. Within the soft tissue group, 66 patients (74.2%) had mechanical myofascial pain due to overuse. Rotator cuff injury was seen in 6 (6.7%), and trochanteric bursopathy was observed in 1 (1.1%). In the axial group, exacerbation of pain in degenerative joint disease (46 patients \\[51.7%\\]) and facet arthropathy (n=34 \\[38.2%\\]) were observed. Radiculopathy was seen in 5 patients (5.6%). Within the bony injury category, kyphoscoliosis was seen on imaging in 15 patients (16.9%). Spondylolisthesis was present in 15 patients (16.9%). Anterior wedging was seen in 16 (18.0%), and compression fractures were present in 13 (14.6%). The poses that were most commonly identified as causing the injuries involved hyperflexion and hyperextension of the spine. We correlated the kinesiologic effect of such exercises on specific musculoskeletal structures.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Yoga potentially has many benefits, but care must be taken when performing positions with extreme spinal flexion and extension. Patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis may have higher risk of compression fractures or deformities and would benefit from avoiding extreme spinal flexion. Physicians should consider this risk when discussing yoga as exercise.\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

However, several investigators have recently reported positive skin test results in patients with both immediate and nonimmediate hypersensitivity reactions after contrast media exposure. The tests were often positive to only certain incriminated contrast media but were negative to others. These findings suggest immune mechanisms in a substantial part of such reactions.\n\n【1】无关删除-2:<u>*   Romano A\n*   Artesani MC\n*   Andriolo M\n*   Viola M\n*   Pettinato R\n*   Vecchioli-Scaldazza A</u>\n\n【2】Effective prophylactic protocol in delayed hypersensitivity to contrast media: report of a case involving lymphocyte transformation studies with different compounds.\n\n【3】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Radiology._ 2002; 225 : 466-470</u></u>\n\n【4】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (50)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-2:<u>*   Vernassiere C\n*   Trechot P\n*   Commun N\n*   Schmutz JL\n*   Barbaud A</u>\n\n【6】Low negative predictive value of skin tests in investigating delayed reactions to radio-contrast media.\n\n【7】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Contact Dermatitis._ 2004; 50 : 359-366</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (100)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kanny G\n*   Pichler W\n*   Morisset M\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【10】T cell-mediated reactions to iodinated contrast media: evaluation by skin and lymphocyte activation tests.\n\n【11】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Allergy Clin Immunol._ 2005; 115 : 179-185</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (117)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>*   Christiansen C\n*   Dreborg S\n*   Pichler WJ\n*   Ekeli H</u>\n\n【14】Macular exanthema appearing 5 days after x-ray contrast medium administration.\n\n【15】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Eur Radiol._ 2002; 12 ( Epub 2002 Sep 7. ) : S94-S97</u></u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>*   Arnold AW\n*   Häusermann P\n*   Bach S\n*   Bircher AJ</u>\n\n【18】Recurrent flexural exanthema (SDRIFE or baboon syndrome) after administration of two different iodinated radio contrast media.\n\n【19】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Dermatology._ 2007; 214 : 89-93</u></u>\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (57)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【21】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kvedariene V\n*   Martins P\n*   Rouanet L\n*   Demoly P</u>\n\n【22】Diagnosis of iodinated contrast media hypersensitivity: results of a 6-year period.\n\n【23】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin Exp Allergy._ 2006; 36 : 1072-1077</u></u>\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (84)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【25】无关删除-2:<u>*   Laroche D\n*   Dewachter P\n*   Mouton-Faivre C\n*   Clément O\n*   CIRTACI Group</u>\n\n【26】Immediate reactions following ICM injection: results of a 3-year prospective multicenter survey.\n\n【27】删除3:<u>_Contrast Media Mol Imaging._ 2006; 1 : 81</u>\n\n【28】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【29】无关删除-2:<u>*   Brockow K\n*   Romano A\n*   Aberer W\n*   European Network of Drug Allergy and the EAACI Interest Group on Drug Hypersensitivity\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【30】Skin testing in patients with hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast media—a European multicenter study.\n\n【31】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Allergy._ 2009; 64 : 234-241</u></u>\n\n【32】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (266)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【33】Interestingly, about 50% of patients with positive skin test results were found to have a reaction on primary exposure, which may be best explained by preexistent sensitization to drug-independent, cross-reactive antigens.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Advate\n2.  Adynovate\n3.  Afstyla\n4.  Altuviiio\n5.  Eloctate\n6.  Esperoct\n7.  Helixate FS\n8.  Hemofil-M\n9.  HyateC\n10.  Jivi\n11.  Koate DVI\n12.  Obizur\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Antihemophilic factor (AHF) injection is used to treat and control serious bleeding episodes in patients with a bleeding problem called hemophilia A (congenital Factor VIII deficiency). The bleeding episode may be related to an injury (trauma) or a surgical procedure. It is also used to reduce the number of bleeding episodes in patients when used regularly. AHF injection is also used to prevent bleeding during a surgical procedure.\n\n【6】Antihemophilic factor (AHF) is a protein that is produced naturally in the body. It helps the blood form clots to stop bleeding and prevents bleeding problems from happening as often.\n\n【7】Hemophilia A, also called classical hemophilia, is a condition where the body does not make enough AHF. If you do not have enough AHF and you become injured, your blood will not form clots properly. You might bleed into and damage your muscles and joints. AHF injection is given to increase the levels of AHF in the blood.\n\n【8】There are several different types of AHF. They are made from human blood or artificially by a man-made process (recombinant). AHF made from human blood has been treated and is not likely to contain harmful viruses, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The man-made AHF products do not contain these viruses.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Powder for Solution\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of antihemophilic factor injection in children.\n\n【18】No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of Hemofil® M in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【19】### Geriatric\n\n【20】Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of Advate®, Adynovate®, Eloctate™, Kogenate® FS, Kovaltry®, Novoeight®, Xyntha®, and Xyntha® Solofuse® have not been performed in the geriatric population, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related medical problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving Advate®, Adynovate®, Eloctate™, Kogenate® FS, Kovaltry®, Novoeight®, and Xyntha®.\n\n【21】No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of antihemophilic factor injection in geriatric patients.\n\n【22】### Breastfeeding\n\n【23】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【24】### Drug Interactions\n\n【25】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【26】### Other Interactions\n\n【27】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【28】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【29】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【30】*   Allergy to hamster or mouse proteins, history of or\n*   von Willebrand disease (blood clotting disorder)—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【31】*   Heart or blood vessel disease—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【32】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【33】A doctor or other trained health professional will give you or your child this medicine in a hospital or clinic setting. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins.\n\n【34】This medicine may also be given at home to patients who do not need to be in a hospital or clinic. If you or your child is using this medicine at home, your doctor will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Make sure you understand all of the instructions before giving yourself an injection. Your dose may change based on where you are bleeding. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.\n\n【35】Use only the brand of this medicine that your doctor prescribed. Not all brands are prepared in the same way and the dose may be different.\n\n【36】Every package of medicine comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【37】To prepare the medicine using 2 bottles (vials) or containers:\n\n【38】*   Take the bottles of powder medicine and liquid (diluent) out of the refrigerator and warm them to room temperature.\n*   Wipe the rubber surface of the bottles with an alcohol swab and allow them to dry.\n*   Follow the specific directions for your brand of medicine when you prepare the injection.\n*   Add the liquid to the powder using the special transfer needle or transfer device that comes with the package.\n*   When injecting the liquid into the dry medicine, aim the stream of liquid against the wall of the container of dry medicine to prevent foaming.\n*   Swirl the bottle gently to dissolve the medicine. Do not shake the bottle. Shaking will create foam in the mixture.\n*   Check the mixture to make sure it is clear. Do not use the medicine if you can see anything solid in the mixture or if the mixture is cloudy.\n*   Use a plastic disposable syringe to remove the mixture from the bottle. Use a special filter needle if your brand of medicine provides one.\n*   Give the injection as directed by your doctor.\n*   If you are using more than one bottle of medicine for your dose, prepare the second bottle the same way. Add the mixture from the second bottle to the same syringe.\n\n【39】To prepare the medicine using a prefilled dual-chamber syringe (Xyntha® and Xyntha® Solofuse®):\n\n【40】*   Take the prefilled dual-chamber syringe out of the refrigerator and warm it to room temperature.\n*   The dual-chamber syringe has the powder medicine in one part and the liquid (diluent) in the second part of the syringe.\n*   Attach the plunger rod to the syringe according to the directions. Keep the syringe pointed up to prevent leaking of the liquid.\n*   Remove the white seal and the grey rubber tip cap. Put the blue vented cap on the syringe. Do not touch the open ends of the syringe and the blue cap.\n*   Slowly push the plunger until the 2 stoppers inside the syringe are together. This will push all of the liquid into the chamber with the powder medicine.\n*   Keep the syringe pointed up and gently swirl the syringe to mix the liquid and powder.\n*   Check the mixture to make sure it is clear. Do not use the medicine if you can see anything solid in the mixture or if the mixture is cloudy.\n*   Keep the syringe pointed up and push the plunger until most of the air is removed.\n*   A special infusion set comes with the package. Remove the blue cap and attach the infusion set to the syringe.\n*   Give the injection as directed by your doctor.\n*   If you are using more than one syringe of medicine for your dose, prepare the second dual-chamber syringe the same way. The mixture from each syringe will be combined together in a separate syringe before your injection. Your doctor will show you how to do this.\n\n【41】Use the mixture within 3 or 4 hours after it is prepared. It must not be stored and used later. Do not put the mixture in the refrigerator.\n\n【42】Do not reuse syringes and needles. Put used syringes and needles in a puncture-resistant disposable container, or dispose of them as directed by your doctor.\n\n【43】Talk to your doctor before traveling. You should plan to bring enough medicine for your treatment when traveling.\n\n【44】### Dosing\n\n【45】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【46】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【47】*   For injection dosage form (injection):\n    *   For bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A:\n        *   Adults and teenagers—Dose is based on body weight and the type of bleeding episode. The dose must be determined by your doctor.\n        *   Children—Dose is based on body weight and the type of bleeding episode. The dose must be determined by your child's doctor.\n\n【48】### Missed Dose\n\n【49】Call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions.\n\n【50】### Storage\n\n【51】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【52】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【53】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【54】The AHF products should be stored in the original container in the refrigerator. Do not let the packages freeze. They can also be kept at room temperature for short periods of time, such as 3 to 12 months. Store the medicine as directed by your doctor or by the manufacturer of the brand you are using. Protect the container from heat and direct light.\n\n【55】If you move the medicine from the refrigerator to room temperature, write the date you take it from the refrigerator on the container. The length of time the medicine can remain at room temperature will depend on the brand you use. If you have already stored the medicine at room temperature, do not return it to the refrigerator. If you do not use the medicine within the time recommended by the manufacturer, you must destroy the medicine.\n\n【56】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【57】It is very important that your doctor check you or your child closely while you are receiving this medicine to make sure it is working properly. Blood tests may be needed.\n\n【58】This medicine may cause serious types of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, lightheadedness or dizziness, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after you receive this medicine.\n\n【59】It is recommended that you carry an identification (ID) card or letter stating that you have hemophilia A and the type of medicine you are using. If you have any questions about what kind of identification to carry, check with your doctor.\n\n【60】Check with your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of parvovirus infection: fever, chills, drowsiness, runny nose, and followed by a rash or joint pain.\n\n【61】Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.\n\n【62】This medicine is made from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them, although the risk is low. Human donors and donated blood are both tested for viruses to keep the transmission risk low. Talk with your doctor about this risk if you are concerned.\n\n【63】The stopper of the bottle (vial) contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before you start using this medicine.\n\n【64】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【65】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【66】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【67】#### More common\n\n【68】1.

The test can help determine if the cause is related to heart rate or blood pressure.\n\n【3】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【4】A health care provider might recommend a tilt table test to try to trigger signs and symptoms — lightheadedness, dizziness or fainting — while monitoring heart rate and blood pressure.\n\n【5】The nervous system controls heart rate and blood pressure. It may suddenly lower the heart rate and blood pressure for a short time when moving to an upright position during the tilt table test. As a result, less blood flows to the brain, possibly causing fainting.\n\n【6】Risks\n-----\n\n【7】A tilt table test is generally safe. Complications are rare. But, as with any medical procedure, it does carry some risk.\n\n【8】Potential complications of a tilt table test include:\n\n【9】*   Weakness that can last several hours\n*   Continued low blood pressure after the test\n\n【10】These complications usually go away when the table is returned to a horizontal position.\n\n【11】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【12】You might be asked not to eat or drink for two hours or more before a tilt table test. You can take your medications as usual unless your health care provider tells you otherwise.\n\n【13】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【14】Before the test, your health care provider:\n\n【15】*   **Has you lie flat on a table** that has a footboard and places straps around you to hold you in place.\n*   **Places sticky patches (electrodes) on your chest, legs and arms.** Wires connect the electrodes to an electrocardiogram machine that monitors your heart rate.\n*   **Places a blood pressure monitor or cuff on your finger, on your arm or on both** to check your blood pressure during the test.\n*   **Places an IV line into a vein in your arm** for delivering drugs, if needed.\n\n【16】### During a tilt table test\n\n【17】*   You lie flat on your back on the motorized table for about five minutes.\n*   You're then moved to a nearly vertical position, where you'll remain from 5 to 45 minutes, depending on the reason for the test. While in this position, stay as still as possible and report signs and symptoms such as nausea, sweating, lightheadedness or irregular heartbeats.\n*   If you don't faint or have other symptoms after 45 minutes, you might receive the drug isoproterenol (Isuprel) through an IV line in your arm. The drug might prompt the reflex that causes you to faint.\n*   You then remain in the upright position for another 15 to 20 minutes.\n\n【18】Your heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored in each position to evaluate your body's response to the change in position.\n\n【19】### After a tilt table test\n\n【20】If you faint while upright, the table will be returned to a horizontal position immediately and you'll be monitored. Most people regain consciousness almost immediately.\n\n【21】When the test is complete, you can return to your regular activities.\n\n【22】Results\n-------\n\n【23】The results of a tilt table test are based on whether you faint during the test and what happens to your blood pressure and heart rate.\n\n【24】*   **Positive result.** Blood pressure decreases, causing dizziness or fainting during the test.\n*   **Negative result.** Heart rate increases only slightly, blood pressure doesn't drop significantly, and there are no signs or symptoms of fainting.\n\n【25】Depending on the results, your care provider might recommend more tests to rule out other causes of fainting.\n\n【26】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "e5c16228-03f6-4112-aa25-0959d30d5f31", "title": "Fetal alcohol syndrome", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Fetal alcohol syndrome is a condition in a child that results from alcohol exposure during the mother's pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome causes brain damage and growth problems. The problems caused by fetal alcohol syndrome vary from child to child, but defects caused by fetal alcohol syndrome are not reversible.\n\n【2】There is no amount of alcohol that's known to be safe to consume during pregnancy. If you drink during pregnancy, you place your baby at risk of fetal alcohol syndrome.\n\n【3】If you suspect your child has fetal alcohol syndrome, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. Early diagnosis may help to reduce problems such as learning difficulties and behavioral issues.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The severity of fetal alcohol syndrome symptoms varies, with some children experiencing them to a far greater degree than others. Signs and symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome may include any mix of physical defects, intellectual or cognitive disabilities, and problems functioning and coping with daily life.\n\n【6】### Physical defects\n\n【7】Physical defects may include:\n\n【8】*   Distinctive facial features, including small eyes, an exceptionally thin upper lip, a short, upturned nose, and a smooth skin surface between the nose and upper lip\n*   Deformities of joints, limbs and fingers\n*   Slow physical growth before and after birth\n*   Vision difficulties or hearing problems\n*   Small head circumference and brain size\n*   Heart defects and problems with kidneys and bones\n\n【9】### Brain and central nervous system problems\n\n【10】Problems with the brain and central nervous system may include:\n\n【11】*   Poor coordination or balance\n*   Intellectual disability, learning disorders and delayed development\n*   Poor memory\n*   Trouble with attention and with processing information\n*   Difficulty with reasoning and problem-solving\n*   Difficulty identifying consequences of choices\n*   Poor judgment skills\n*   Jitteriness or hyperactivity\n*   Rapidly changing moods\n\n【12】### Social and behavioral issues\n\n【13】Problems in functioning, coping and interacting with others may include:\n\n【14】*   Difficulty in school\n*   Trouble getting along with others\n*   Poor social skills\n*   Trouble adapting to change or switching from one task to another\n*   Problems with behavior and impulse control\n*   Poor concept of time\n*   Problems staying on task\n*   Difficulty planning or working toward a goal\n\n【15】### When to see a doctor\n\n【16】If you're pregnant and can't stop drinking, ask your obstetrician, primary care doctor or mental health professional for help.\n\n【17】Because early diagnosis may help reduce the risk of long-term problems for children with fetal alcohol syndrome, let your child's doctor know if you drank alcohol while you were pregnant. Don't wait for problems to arise before seeking help.\n\n【18】If you have adopted a child or are providing foster care, you may not know if the biological mother drank alcohol while pregnant — and it may not initially occur to you that your child may have fetal alcohol syndrome. However, if your child has problems with learning and behavior, talk with his or her doctor so that the underlying cause might be identified.\n\n【19】Causes\n------\n\n【20】When you're pregnant and you drink alcohol:\n\n【21】*   Alcohol enters your bloodstream and reaches your developing fetus by crossing the placenta\n*   Alcohol causes higher blood alcohol concentrations in your developing baby than in your body because a fetus metabolizes alcohol slower than an adult does\n*   Alcohol interferes with the delivery of oxygen and optimal nutrition to your developing baby\n*   Exposure to alcohol before birth can harm the development of tissues and organs and cause permanent brain damage in your baby\n\n【22】The more you drink while pregnant, the greater the risk to your unborn baby. However, any amount of alcohol puts your baby at risk. Your baby's brain, heart and blood vessels begin to develop in the early weeks of pregnancy, before you may know you're pregnant.\n\n【23】Impairment of facial features, the heart and other organs, including the bones, and the central nervous system may occur as a result of drinking alcohol during the first trimester. That's when these parts of the fetus are in key stages of development.

In some studies, 20% to 30% of postmenopausal women and more than 50% of men with osteoporosis have a secondary cause. There are numerous causes of secondary bone loss, including adverse effects of drug therapy, endocrine disorders, eating disorders, immobilization, marrow-related disorders, disorders of the gastrointestinal or biliary tract, renal disease, and cancer. Patients who have undergone organ transplantation are also at increased risk for osteoporosis. In many cases, the adverse effects of osteoporosis are reversible with appropriate intervention. Because of the many treatment options that are now available for patients with osteoporosis and the tremendous advances that have been made in understanding the pathogenesis and diagnosis of the condition, it is important that medical disorders are recognized and appropriate interventions are undertaken.

Glucocorticoid excess results in diffuse bone loss and may affect trabecular bone more than cortical bone. Bone loss is due to suppression of osteoblast function, inhibition of intestinal calcium absorption leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism, and increased osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Bone loss is also promoted by direct stimulation of renal excretion of calcium by glucocorticoids. Hypogonadism may occur with the suppressive effects of glucocorticoids on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.\n\n【45】Bone density is reduced in 40% to 60% of patients with an endogenous glucocorticoid excess, and pathologic fractures have been observed in 16% to 67%.

Although physiologic concentrations of glucocorticoids enhance the function of osteoblasts, prolonged exposure to superphysiologic doses inhibits collagen synthesis and differentiation of osteoblasts, reducing bone formation. In the osteoclast, physiologic concentrations of glucocorticoids enhance late stages of differentiation and function. In the presence of high doses of glucocorticoids or prolonged exposure, apoptosis of new osteoclasts occurs. The effect of glucocorticoids on bone resorption may also be mediated in part by secondary hyperparathyroidism. The long-term increase in PTH levels enhances osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, resulting in bone loss. Other effects of glucocorticoids include alterations in the production of prostaglandins, cytokines, and growth factors.

Methotrexate has been implicated as a cause of bone loss, but in most studies, other drugs have been administered or the gonadal status of the patients has been altered, making definitive conclusions difficult. The administration of excessive exogenous thyroid hormone has been associated with osteopenia. Clinical relevance of osteoporosis associated with iatrogenic hyperthyroidism has been examined in terms of development of fractures, but the data remain controversial. Heparin has been implicated in the suppression of bone formation. Bile acid binding resins, such as cholestyramine and colestipol, have the potential to interfere with vitamin D absorption. Aluminum is a well-known inhibitor of bone mineralization and phosphate absorption. Aluminum-induced osteomalacia can be present in patients who are undergoing hemodialysis or taking total parenteral nutrition. Antacids are used to control serum phosphate levels in patients with renal failure, and aluminum contamination of various components can occur during total parenteral nutrition. In patients with aluminum-induced osteomalacia, normal or even high serum phosphate levels and low 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D levels occur.\n\n【199】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bikle DD</u>\n\n【200】Drug-induced osteomalacia.\n\n【201】无关删除-2:<u>in: Favus MJ Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism. 4th ed.

Thyroid hormone increases the creation of new bone remodeling units with an enhancement of remodeling activity. Thyroid hormones directly stimulate production of osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, and IGFs. In patients with thyrotoxicosis, increased serum levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase may be seen. Despite the increase in osteoblast activity, there are also thyroid hormone-induced increases in bone resorption. The bone resorption is associated with increased levels of hydroxyproline and collagen cross-links in thyrotoxic patients. The overall increase in bone turnover in the presence of excessive levels of thyroid hormone is characterized by an increase in the number of osteoclasts, the number of resorption sites, and the ratio of resorptive to formative surfaces. In the thyrotoxic patient, the bone remodeling cycle is shortened because of a decrease in the length of the bone formation and, overall, there is failure to replace resorbed bone completely, leading to bone loss.\n\n【218】无关删除-2:<u>*   Mosekilde L\n*   Eriksen EF\n*   Charles P</u>\n\n【219】Effects of thyroid hormone on bone and mineral metabolism.\n\n【220】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am._ 1990; 19 : 35-63</u></u>\n\n【221】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【222】In patients with thyrotoxicosis, BMD is reduced.\n\n【223】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rosen CJ\n*   Alder RA</u>\n\n【224】Longitudinal changes in lumbar bone density among thyrotoxic patients after attainment of euthyroidism.\n\n【225】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Endocrinol Metab._ 1992; 75 : 1531-1534</u></u>\n\n【226】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (73)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【227】Several studies\n\n【228】无关删除-2:<u>*   Cummings SR\n*   Nevitt MC\n*   Browner WS\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【229】Risk factors for hip fracture in white women: study of Osteoporotic Fractures Research Group.\n\n【230】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1995; 332 : 767-773</u></u>\n\n【231】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2311)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【232】have indicated that individuals with a history of thyrotoxicosis have an increased risk of fracture and may sustain fracture at an earlier age compared with patients who have never had an increase in thyroid hormone levels.

These disorders include osteitis fibrosa cystica in which subperiosteal resorption of the distal phalanges, tapering of the distal clavicles, a “salt and pepper” appearance of the skull, brown tumors, and bone cysts of the long bones occur. With screening of the patients for asymptomatic hypercalcemia, the incidence of bone disease of this type is rare. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are also recognized as bone diseases associated with excess PTH.\n\n【266】The pathophysiology of primary hyperparathyroidism relates to the loss of normal feedback control of PTH by extracellular calcium. The parathyroid cell loses its normal sensitivity to calcium, and this is the major mechanism in parathyroid adenomas. In primary hyperparathyroidism due to hyperplasia, the set point for calcium is not changed for a given parathyroid cell, but an increased number of cells gives rise to hypercalcemia. The increase in circulating levels of PTH in primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with increased bone turnover. There is an increase in both osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and osteoblast activity. Overall, there is loss in both cortical and cancellous bone. In mild hyperparathyroidism, however, BMD may be increased in areas that are primarily cancellous, whereas bone is lost in the cortical areas.\n\n【267】无关删除-2:<u>*   Dempster DW\n*   Parisien M\n*   Silverberg SJ\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【268】On the mechanism of cancellous bone preservation in postmenopausal women with mild primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\n【269】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Endocrinol Metab._ 1999; 84 : 1562-1566</u></u>\n\n【270】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【271】This anabolic effect is the basis for intermittent administration of PTH as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis, because bone formation occurs at a more rapid rate than bone resorption.\n\n【272】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rosen CJ\n*   Rackoff PJ</u>\n\n【273】Emerging anabolic treatment for osteoporosis.\n\n【274】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Rheum Dis Clin North Am._ 2001; 27 ( viii. ) : 215-233</u></u>\n\n【275】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【276】无关删除-2:<u>*   Neer RM\n*   Arnaud CD\n*   Zanchetta JR\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【277】Effect of parathyroid hormone (1-34) on fractures and bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.\n\n【278】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 2001; 344 : 1434-1441</u></u>\n\n【279】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2086)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【280】In addition, PTH has clear-cut effects on osteoclast differentiation.

There are several metabolic disorders associated with anorexia nervosa that may adversely affect the skeleton. These include estrogen deficiency, endogenous cortisol excess, reduced IGF-1 levels, protein-energy malnutrition, and secondary hyperparathyroidism due to low dietary calcium intake or vitamin D deficiency.

Total alkaline phosphatase activity may be elevated, but liver enzyme levels are also elevated, suggesting hepatic function may be altered. Osteocalcin, a marker of bone turnover, has been noted to be very low in women with anorexia nervosa and may be due to the excess endogenous cortisol levels. Markers of bone resorption, such as pyridinoline and N- telopeptide excretion, are usually increased and inversely correlated with BMD. The reduction in bone formation parameters and increase in levels of bone resorption markers suggest that bone remodeling is uncoupled. Serum vitamin D concentrations are highly variable and are affected by reduced dietary intake and diminished hepatic synthesis or binding capacity of vitamin D binding proteins in patients with estrogen deficiency. Elevated serum and urinary cortisol levels are common in women with anorexia nervosa. Hypercortisolism results from both increased production and decreased cortisol clearance as a result of the enhanced activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\n\n【437】无关删除-2:<u>*   Casper RC</u>\n\n【438】The pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.\n\n【439】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Annu Rev Nutr._ 1986; 6 : 299-316</u></u>\n\n【440】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【441】Elevated growth hormone and suppressed IGF-1 levels have been described in these patients and may be due to prolonged nutritional deprivation and be responsible for the enhanced bone loss.\n\n【442】无关删除-2:<u>*   Friedman EJ</u>\n\n【443】Neuroendocrine aspects of bulimia.\n\n【444】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Adolesc Psychiatry._ 1986; 13 : 422-427</u></u>\n\n【445】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【446】### Immobilization\n\n【447】Immobilization causes a rapid and diffuse bone loss.

Abnormalities of the hepatogastrointestinal tract may impair absorption of vitamins and minerals, resulting in bone disease. Intestinal calcium absorption occurs throughout the intestine, but the highest rates of absorption are in the duodenum. The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, controls the transcellular pathway of calcium absorption. At low calcium intakes, the transcellular pathway dominates and is highly efficient. If calcium intake increases, non- saturable but less efficient pathways, such as the para- cellular pathway, become important. Gastrointestinal disease leads to abnormalities in bone primarily due to the malabsorption of vitamin D and calcium, although the presence of the disease itself may lead to reduced intake or limited exposure to sunlight.\n\n【531】Protein and other micronutrient deficiencies may contribute to bone loss in gastrointestinal tract disorders. Secondary hyperparathyroidism may be a consistent feature in these vitamin D-deficient patients with accelerated loss of cortical bone. When secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs, it is characterized by increased bone turnover with an increased surface area and volume of unmineralized tissue.\n\n【532】Osteoporosis, pseudofractures, and fractures have been noted in patients after gastrectomy.

Thus, it may be an older patient who presents with manifestations of post- gastrectomy bone disease. Laboratory assessment reveals reductions in serum calcium and phosphate levels (although they may be within the normal range) and an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin levels. Urinary calcium excretion tends to be low. The PTH levels may be normal or slightly elevated. In most studies, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were reduced. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D levels may be slightly elevated, and the profile suggests mild hyperparathyroidism secondary to early vitamin D and calcium deficiency. Pseudofractures and fractures of the hip are less common but may occur. A mixed picture of both osteoporosis and osteomalacia may be present. Treatment of the bone disease can be complex, and the osteomalacic component should be treated with vitamin D and calcium supplements. Bone biopsy specimens can distinguish between the 2 diseases, but if no biopsy specimen is obtained, a clinical trial with vitamin D and calcium is warranted. Serum levels of 25-hydroxy- vitamin D can be used for monitoring.\n\n【553】### Bone Disease and Celiac Disease\n\n【554】Bone disease associated with celiac disease can present as osteoporosis, osteomalacia, or both.

A bone biopsy specimen is the only way to distinguish with certainty between osteomalacia and osteoporosis.\n\n【590】In Crohn disease, there are multiple reasons for the development of bone disease, because malabsorption results in the reduction of vitamin D and calcium absorption. The resection of part of the intestine may also result in reduced vitamin D absorption. Vitamin D metabolites that are undergoing enterohepatic circulation cannot be reabsorbed if the ileum is diseased or resected. Steatorrhea may occur, decreasing both calcium and vitamin D absorption. Glucocorticoid therapy is frequently used for active disease and can also contribute to calcium malabsorption and bone loss. Treatment is usually in the form of cholecalciferol (4000-12,000 U/d), although calcifediol may be better absorbed than cholecalciferol in patients with steatorrhea. Dietary counseling and/or supplementation of calcium is warranted.\n\n【591】### Jejunoileal Bypass\n\n【592】Jejunoileal bypass is used to treat massive obesity, and the subsequent development of bone disease is becoming better recognized. Reductions in serum calcium and magnesium levels with an increase in alkaline phosphatase level is observed in many patients within 3 months of operation and may persist. Osteomalacia or reduced trabecular bone volume apparent on bone biopsy specimens has been found in up to 60% of unselected individuals, although osteoporosis or osteopenia may not be found.

Parathyroid hormone levels may be normal, and reduction in bone density is generally not found. Malabsorption of vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium has been demonstrated, and fatty infiltration of the liver may be present. Calcium supplementation to normalize urine calcium levels and cholecalciferol have been used successfully to treat bone disease following jejunoileal bypass.\n\n【598】DISEASES OF THE PANCREAS Pancreatic Insufficiency\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【599】Clinically significant bone disease in patients with pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis or total pancreatectomy is not unusual.

Steatorrhea probably has the most impact on vitamin D and calcium malabsorption. In a patient with bone disease secondary to pancreatic insufficiency, other complicating features, such as alcohol abuse, cholestasis, cirrhosis, or intrinsic small bowel involvement, should be evaluated. Patients with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels should be treated with sufficient amounts to restore serum levels to normal. Either dietary or supplementary calcium is also an important adjuvant therapy.\n\n【609】DISEASES OF THE LIVER\n---------------------\n\n【610】Liver diseases may cause bone disease because of the inability of the liver to convert vitamin D to 25-hydroxy-vitamin D. The role of vitamin D depends on hepatically produced vitamin D transport proteins, albumin, and vitamin D binding protein. The development of bone disease also depends on the transport of vitamin D metabolites to the target tissues, the degree to which enterohepatic circulation of vitamin D as metabolites contributes to the maintenance of bone, and the role of bile in promoting vitamin D and calcium absorption, all of which may be affected by liver diseases.\n\n【611】### Chronic Cholestatic Diseases\n\n【612】Primary biliary cirrhosis is the best-studied chronic cholestatic disease. It occurs most frequently in middle- aged women, an age at which postmenopausal osteoporosis is common and may be difficult to distinguish from the osteoporosis associated with liver disease. In primary biliary cirrhosis, both osteoporosis and osteomalacia can occur concurrently.\n\n【613】Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are often asymptomatic, although they may present with bone pain and have osteoporosis or osteomalacia apparent on bone biopsy specimens. Serum and urine calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium levels may be normal or slightly reduced. In this setting, PTH levels may be low, but reports of elevated PTH levels have also been found.\n\n【614】无关删除-2:<u>*   Fonseca V\n*   Epstein O\n*   Gill DS\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【615】Hyperparathyroidism and low serum osteocalcin despite vitamin D replacement in primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\n【616】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Endocrinol Metab._ 1987; 64 : 873-877</u></u>\n\n【617】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【618】Alkaline phosphatase activity may be elevated due to liver isoenzymes.

Forty- seven percent of patients with chronic active hepatitis due to glucocorticoid hormones have osteopenia, but the prevalence of bone disease in the absence of treatment has not been established.\n\n【626】无关删除-2:<u>*   Stellon AJ\n*   Davies A\n*   Compston J\n*   Williams R</u>\n\n【627】Bone loss in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis on maintenance corticosteroid therapy.\n\n【628】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Gastroenterology._ 1985; 89 : 1078-1083</u></u>\n\n【629】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【630】Bone disease is usually asymptomatic. Patients with chronic active hepatitis tend to have 25- hydroxyvitamin D levels below normal and a reduction in vitamin D binding protein levels, suggesting that free 25- hydroxyvitamin D may be normal. Osteomalacia is uncommon. Scarcity of data makes it problematic to suggest a pathogenic mechanism for bone disease in chronic active hepatitis. Vitamin D deficiency secondary to malabsorption or impaired hepatic conversion of vitamin D to 25- hydroxyvitamin D may be implicated. Glucocorticoid therapy is likely to be the most important player in the pathogenesis of bone disease in these patients. Limiting the use of glucocorticoid therapy, providing adequate nutrition, and encouraging sunlight exposure are the first treatment modalities. The role of cholecalciferol and calcium supplementation must be individualized.\n\n【631】### Alcohol-Related Liver Disease\n\n【632】Bone disease due to alcoholism is not restricted to patients who develop cirrhosis. Alcohol abuse is a major cause of liver disease, and cirrhosis contributes to the severity of bone disease. Spinal osteopenia may be observed in up to 50% of ambulatory patients with alcoholism, and fractures of the ribs or vertebrae occur in 30% of this population.\n\n【633】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lindsell DR\n*   Wilson AG\n*   Maxwel JD</u>\n\n【634】Fractures on the chest radiograph in detection of alcoholic liver disease.\n\n【635】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Br Med J (Clin Res Ed)._ 1982; 285 : 597-599</u></u>\n\n【636】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【637】无关删除-2:<u>*   Israel Y\n*   Orrego H\n*   Holt S\n*   Macdonald DW\n*   Meema HE</u>\n\n【638】Identification of alcohol abuse: thoracic fractures on routine chest X-rays as indicators of alcoholism.\n\n【639】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Alcohol Clin Exp Res._ 1980; 4 : 420-422</u></u>\n\n【640】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【641】The clinical picture may be complicated by past partial gastrectomy in some patients.

Serum concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium tend to be in the low normal range, but in binge drinkers, the serum levels of these minerals may be sufficiently reduced to cause neuromuscular disturbances and rhabdomyolysis requiring hospitalization. Poor nutrition contributes to the picture, with a reduction in serum albumin levels. Serum PTH levels may be elevated or high normal and may be due to short-term administration of alcohol or the low calcium and magnesium levels. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels are usually low, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels have been reported as low, normal, or high. Cancellous bone is more affected than cortical bone when evaluating BMD.\n\n【647】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bikle DD\n*   Genant HK\n*   Cann C\n*   Recker RR\n*   Halloran BP\n*   Strewler GJ</u>\n\n【648】Bone disease in alcohol abuse.\n\n【649】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 1985; 103 : 42-48</u></u>\n\n【650】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【651】Fractures are common and pseudofractures are rare. Although initially it was thought that these patients presented with osteomalacia, the fact that osteoporosis is predominant has led to the hypothesis that the prime offender is alcohol or one of its metabolites. Alcohol directly inhibits bone cell activity, resulting in reduced bone formation and bone resorption. Cessation of alcohol consumption can reverse or at least stop progression of disease. If 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are low, cholecalciferol therapy should be considered. Malabsorption is usually fairly mild, and ensuring adequate nutrition is appropriate. It is unclear how reversible the osteoporosis is in the disorder.\n\n【652】TRANSPLANTATION OSTEOPOROSIS\n----------------------------\n\n【653】Organ transplantation has become an effective therapy for end-stage renal, hepatic, cardiac, and pulmonary disease.\n\n【654】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rodino MA\n*   Shane E</u>\n\n【655】Osteoporosis after organ transplantation.\n\n【656】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Med._ 1998; 104 : 459-469</u></u>\n\n【657】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (179)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【658】One-year patient survival is excellent, averaging 98% for living donor kidney, 87% for liver, and 85% for cardiac transplant recipients.\n\n【659】UNOS Transplant Patient DataSource.\n\n【660】删除3:<u>Available at: www.patients.unos.org/tpd/default.asp</u>\n\n【661】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【662】Many patients now live for more than 10 years. Unfortunately, many transplant patients demonstrate a propensity to fracture, which greatly aggravates their quality of life. The pathogenesis of transplantation osteoporosis is incompletely understood, but risk factors include white race, older age, postmenopausal status, vitamin D deficiency, physical inactivity, dietary calcium deficiency, and excessive use of tobacco and alcohol. Patients who are candidates for transplantation are often exposed to loop diuretics, anticoagulants, or corticosteroids, which are associated with bone loss. Transplant recipients require immunosuppressant therapy, which inhibits T-cell function. Glucocorticoids are often prescribed in high doses immediately after transplantation and during episodes of rejection. Cyclosporine is another commonly used immunosuppressant, which, in animal models, causes severe trabecular bone loss and acceleration of bone turn- over.\n\n【663】无关删除-2:<u>*   Katz I\n*   Li M\n*   Joffe I\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【664】Influence of age on cyclosporin A-induced alterations in bone mineral metabolism in the rat in vivo.\n\n【665】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Bone Miner Res._ 1994; 9 : 59-67</u></u>\n\n【666】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【667】Another commonly used immunosuppressant, tacrolimus, also causes severe bone loss in the rat model.\n\n【668】无关删除-2:<u>*   Romero DF\n*   Buchinsky FJ\n*   Rucinski B\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【669】Rapamycin: a bone sparing immunosuppressant?\n\n【670】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Bone Miner Res._ 1995; 10 : 760-768</u></u>\n\n【671】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【672】Since both drugs are prescribed concurrently with glucocorticoids, it is often difficult to assess the individual contribution of each medication to the metabolic bone disease associated with transplantation.\n\n【673】### Kidney Transplantation\n\n【674】The kidney is the most commonly transplanted organ.

These include acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and low serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Parathyroid hormone levels may remain elevated immediately after transplantation and may never normalize. Hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia related to persistent parathyroid hyperplasia may occur in the first few months. This is usually mild and may resolve within the first year. Most patients have elevated markers of bone formation, which is surprising in view of their high doses of glucocorticoids, which would be expected to suppress bone formation. This finding is thought to be due to the persistently increased PTH levels, which may overcome the depressive effects of glucocorticoids. Thus, bone turnover is increased after renal transplantation.\n\n【689】### Cardiac Transplantation\n\n【690】Bone mineral density may be lower in patients who need heart transplants than in healthy individuals, and low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D are common in patients with severe heart failure. Prerenal azotemia may result in secondary hyperparathyroidism. As a result, osteoporosis is common in cardiac transplant recipients. Markers of bone formation and resorption are elevated and correlate with intact PTH. Lumbar spine BMD decreases by 6% to 10% within the first 6 months after transplantation with stabilization thereafter. Hip BMD declines throughout the first year and is often 10% to 15% below baseline levels.\n\n【691】无关删除-2:<u>*   Shane E\n*   Rivas M\n*   McMahon DJ\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【692】Bone loss and turnover after cardiac transplantation.\n\n【693】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Endocrinol Metab._ 1997; 82 : 1497-1506</u></u>\n\n【694】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【695】A longitudinal study\n\n【696】无关删除-2:<u>*   Shane E\n*   Rivas M\n*   Staron RB\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【697】Fracture after cardiac transplantation: a prospective longitudinal study.\n\n【698】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Endocrinol Metab._ 1996; 81 : 1740-1746</u></u>\n\n【699】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (100)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【700】demonstrated that 36% of patients (54% of women and 29% of men) sustained 1 or more fractures during the first year after transplantation, despite supplementation with calcium and cholecalciferol.

Bone mineral density of the hip and spine is an important measurement to assess. Although pretransplantation BMD does not reliably predict fractures, low pretransplantation BMD is associated with increased fracture risk, particularly in postmenopausal women. Anti- resorptive therapy increases BMD and reduces fracture rate in other patients, so this is the general approach, even though there are few studies showing that this therapy is useful after transplantation. Radiographic evaluation of the thoracic and lumbar spine is important because the risk of future fracture is greater in patients with prevalent vertebral fractures. Biochemical evaluation should include measurement of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, thyroid function tests, and (in men) testosterone. Bone markers of formation or resorption are most useful in a research setting. Patients should receive a minimum of 400 IU of cholecalciferol (800 IU for patients receiving =5 mg/d of prednisone) and elemental calcium (1000-1500 mg, depending on calcium intake, urinary calcium excretion, and menopausal status). Hormone replacement therapy is recommended for postmenopausal and pre- menopausal amenorrheic women. Hormone replacement therapy should also be given to hypogonadal men who do not have a contraindication. Since pretransplantation waiting time may be long, aggressive treatment with an antiresorptive agent may result in significant improvement in bone mass before transplantation.\n\n【782】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rodino MA\n*   Shane E</u>\n\n【783】Osteoporosis after organ transplantation.\n\n【784】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Med._ 1998; 104 : 459-469</u></u>\n\n【785】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (179)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【786】无关删除-2:<u>*   Stein B\n*   Takizawa M\n*   Katz I\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【787】Salmon calcitonin prevents cyclosporin-A-induced high turnover bone loss.\n\n【788】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Endocrinology._ 1991; 129 : 92-98</u></u>\n\n【789】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【790】无关删除-2:<u>*   Grotz WH\n*   Rump LC\n*   Niessen A\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【791】Treatment of osteopenia and osteoporosis after kidney transplantation.\n\n【792】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Transplantation._ 1998; 66 : 1004-1008</u></u>\n\n【793】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (83)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【794】无关删除-2:<u>*   Garcia-Delgado I\n*   Prieto S\n*   Gil-Fraguas L\n*   Robles E\n*   Rufilanchas JJ\n*   Hawkins F</u>\n\n【795】Calcitonin, etidronate, and calcidiol treatment in bone loss after cardiac transplantation.\n\n【796】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Calcif Tissue Int._ 1997; 60 : 155-159</u></u>\n\n【797】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (60)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【798】### CARE OF THE PATIENT AFTER TRANSPLANTATION\n\n【799】Since bone loss occurs most rapidly in the first 3 to 6 months after transplantation and fragility fractures occur within this same period, preventive strategies should be instituted immediately.

Other benefits of testosterone include increased muscle mass and hemoglobin levels. Risks include abnormal liver enzyme levels, acceleration of hyperlipidemia, and prostatic hypertrophy requiring monitoring of serum lipid and liver enzyme levels as well as regular prostate examination.\n\n【860】TARGETING INTERVENTIONS OF AN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENT POPULATION\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【861】There is much controversy regarding the best work-up for patients who have been diagnosed as having osteoporosis based on BMD. The problem with attempting to apply strict diagnostic criteria regarding who may have a secondary or reversible cause of osteoporosis is that few data exist to provide adequate guidance. Most of the information that has been gathered has either been from subspecialty clinics, which would have an inherent bias (such as a rheumatology clinic where glucocorticoid treatment may be prevalent), or the clinical and biochemical evaluation may not be thorough enough to rule out most existing causes of bone loss. Some interesting data are available in patients who have already experienced a fracture, another category that does not help the outpatient evaluation of an otherwise unaffected patient with osteoporosis.\n\n【862】It is difficult to decide where interventions should be targeted both from a patient's perspective and for cost- effectiveness. The WHO definitions of osteopenia (T score, −1.0 to −2.5) and osteoporosis (T score, =2.5) were never intended to be used as diagnostic criteria for disease, and arbitrary cutoffs may miss many individuals. It is also clear that secondary causes of osteoporosis are not considered in many patients. In a study sample of 142 female patients with abnormal BMD referred by internists or gynecologists, in those diagnosed as having osteoporosis, 20.4% had no further investigations and 27.8% underwent only mammography. Most of these patients (71.8%) received a combination of calcium and cholecalciferol only as treatment. Thus, even a bone densitometry measurement did not alter treatment in a substantial number of patients, and many patients did not undergo further investigation to rule out a secondary cause of bone loss.\n\n【863】无关删除-2:<u>*   Economides PA\n*   Kaklamani VG\n*   Karavas I\n*   Papaioannou GI\n*   Supran S\n*   Mirel RD</u>\n\n【864】Assessment of physician responses to abnormal results of bone densitometry studies.\n\n【865】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Endocr Pract._ 2000; 6 : 351-356</u></u>\n\n【866】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【867】Secondary causes of bone loss can be observed with high frequency in patients with hip fracture.

This recommendation is highly problematic because there is no evidence that patients with a certain reduction in T score are more likely to have a secondary cause of bone loss. In addition, the WHO criteria for BMD T scores were never intended to be used as diagnostic criteria and represent the prevalence of disease in a population. With the myriad factors that make up BMD, relying on this criterion alone is fraught with problems. Clinical judgment is an important additional factor in assessment of the osteoporotic patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【28】*   Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection—Use with caution. May increase risk for more serious side effects.\n\n【29】*   Infection (e.g. bacteria, fungus, virus, or protozoa)—May decrease your body's ability to fight infection.\n\n【30】*   Tuberculosis infection—Should be treated before starting therapy with this medicine.\n\n【31】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【32】A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins. The medicine must be injected slowly, so the needle will need to stay in place for at least 30 minutes.\n\n【33】This medicine comes with a Medication Guide. It is very important that you read and understand this information. Be sure to ask your doctor about anything you do not understand.\n\n【34】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【35】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects. Be sure to keep all appointments.\n\n【36】It is important to tell your doctor if you become pregnant. Your doctor may want you to join a pregnancy registry for patients using this medicine.\n\n【37】Do not receive this medicine if your doctor says you are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) negative. Your doctor will test you for EBV.\n\n【38】Using this medicine may increase your risk of having serious conditions called post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The risk of developing PTLD is higher in patients who are EBV negative, have cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, or have received treatments for transplant rejections. Check with your doctor right away if you have changes in mood or usual behavior, confusion, problems with thinking, loss of memory, decreased strength on one side of the body, or changes in vision, walking, or talking.\n\n【39】This medicine may increase your risk of getting certain types of cancer, especially of the skin. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.\n\n【40】Use sunscreen or sunblock lotions with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 on a regular basis when you are outdoors. Wear protective clothing and hats, and stay out of direct sunlight between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Avoid sunlamps and tanning beds.\n\n【41】This medicine may increase your risk of developing infections. Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections while you are using this medicine. Wash your hands often. Tell your doctor if you have any kind of infection before you start using this medicine. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had an infection that would not go away or an infection that kept coming back.\n\n【42】You will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.\n\n【43】This medicine may increase your risk for developing a rare and serious virus infection called polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN). PVAN is caused by BK virus. The BK virus may affect how your kidneys work and cause a transplanted kidney to fail. Check with your doctor right away if you are having more than one of these symptoms: bloody urine; a decreased frequency or amount of urine; increased thirst; loss of appetite; lower back or side pain; nausea; swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs; trouble with breathing; unusual tiredness or weakness; vomiting; or weight gain.\n\n【44】While you are being treated with belatacept, and after you stop using it, it is important to talk to your doctor about the immunizations (vaccines) you should receive. Do not get any vaccine without your doctor's approval. Belatacept may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not receive certain vaccines since there is a chance they could pass the infection on to you. Talk to your doctor if you have questions about this.\n\n【45】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【46】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【47】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【48】#### More common\n\n【49】1.  Abdominal or stomach pain\n2.  agitation\n3.  black, tarry stools\n4.  bladder pain\n5.  bloating or swelling of the face, arms, hands, lower legs, or feet\n6.  bloody or cloudy urine\n7.  blurred vision\n8.  bone pain\n9.  burning while urinating\n10.  chest pain\n11.  chills\n12.  coma\n13.  confusion\n14.  convulsions\n15.  cough or hoarseness\n16.  decreased frequency or amount of urine\n17.  decreased urine output\n18.  depression\n19.  difficult or labored breathing\n20.  difficult, burning, or painful urination\n21.  dizziness\n22.  dizziness, faintness, or lightheadedness when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting position\n23.  drowsiness\n24.  dry mouth\n25.  fainting\n26.  fast or irregular heartbeat\n27.  fever\n28.  frequent urge to urinate\n29.  headache\n30.  hostility\n31.  inability to move the arms and legs\n32.  increased blood pressure\n33.  increased thirst\n34.  irritability\n35.  itching in other skin areas\n36.  lethargy\n37.  loss of appetite\n38.  loss of bladder control\n39.  lower back or side pain\n40.  mood or mental changes\n41.  muscle pain or cramps\n42.  muscle spasms (tetany) or twitching\n43.  nausea or vomiting\n44.  nervousness\n45.  numbness or tingling in the hands, feet, or lips\n46.  pale skin\n47.  pounding in the ears\n48.  rapid weight gain\n49.  scaling\n50.  shortness of breath\n51.  slow or fast heartbeat\n52.  sore throat\n53.  sores, ulcers, or white spots on the lips or in the mouth\n54.  stupor\n55.  sudden decrease in the amount of urine\n56.  sudden numbness and weakness in the arms and legs\n57.  sweating\n58.  swelling of the face, ankles, or hands\n59.  swollen glands\n60.  tightness in the chest\n61.  trembling\n62.  troubled breathing\n63.  troubled breathing with exertion\n64.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n65.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n66.  unusual weight gain or loss\n67.  weakness or heaviness of the legs\n68.  weight gain\n69.  wheezing\n\n【50】#### Less common\n\n【51】1.

We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which any drug had been evaluated vs placebo and sleep had been assessed. We collectively referred to insomnia-related outcomes as _sleep disturbance_ . We also searched the _PDR_ to identify any insomnia symptoms listed for drugs with RCT evidence available.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Seventy-four Cochrane systematic reviews corresponding to 274 RCTs assessed 88 drugs in 27 different conditions, providing evidence on 109 drug-condition pairs. Of these 88 drugs, 5 decreased sleep problems and 19 increased sleep problems; 64 drugs had no nominally statistically significant effect on sleep. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, dopamine agonists, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were the drug classes most importantly associated with sleep disturbance. Of 35 drugs that included disturbed sleep as an adverse effect in the _PDR_ , only 14 had RCT evidence supporting such effect, and 2 had evidence of increasing and decreasing sleep problems in RCTs, although this was not shown in the _PDR_ . We identified weak concordance between the _PDR_ and RCTs (weighted κ=0.31; _P_ <.001).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The RCTs offer substantial evidence about the common effects of drugs on the risk of sleep disturbance; currently, prescription information only partially agrees with the available randomized evidence.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AE ( adverse event ), CDSR ( Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews ), COMTI ( catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor ), DOPA ( dopamine ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), GABA ( γ-aminobutyric acid ), GnRH ( gonadotropin-releasing hormone ), IQR ( interquartile range ), MAOI ( monoamine oxidase inhibitor ), NA ( number of events is not applicable because the outcome is continuous ), NL ( drug is not listed in the PDR ), NMDA ( N-methyl-d-aspartic acid ), NSAID ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ), OR ( odds ratio ), PDR ( Physicians' Desk Reference ), RCT ( randomized controlled trial ), SNRI ( serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ), SSRI ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ), TCA ( tricyclic antidepressant )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "459c8489-908f-4693-9196-faa1830bf121", "title": "Desmopressin (Nasal Route)", "text": "【0】Desmopressin (Nasal Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  DDAVP\n2.  DDAVP Rhinal Tube\n3.  Minirin\n4.  Noctiva\n5.  Stimate\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Desmopressin nasal spray is used to treat central cranial diabetes insipidus. This is a condition that causes the body to lose too much fluid and become dehydrated. It is also used to control frequent urination and increased thirst caused by certain types of brain injury or brain surgery. The Stimate® nasal spray is used to treat bleeding in patients with hemophilia A or von Willebrand disease (Type I).\n\n【6】Noctiva™ nasal spray is used to treat nocturnal polyuria in adults who awaken two or more times to urinate at night. Nocturnal polyuria is a condition where your body makes too much urine at night. Your doctor will need to measure your urine and the times that you urinate for 24 hours to determine if you have nocturnal polyuria.\n\n【7】Desmopressin is similar to a hormone that is produced in the body. It acts on the kidneys to reduce the flow of urine. For bleeding, desmopressin increases the blood levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. This results in less bleeding for patients who have low levels of these agents.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Spray\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of desmopressin nasal spray to treat central diabetes insipidus in children 3 months of age and older for desmopressin acetate or in children 4 years of age and older for DDAVP®. Safety and efficacy have been established.\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Stimate® to treat hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease in children 11 months of age and older. However, use is not recommended in children younger than 11 months of age.\n\n【18】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Noctiva™ in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【19】### Geriatric\n\n【20】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of desmopressin nasal spray in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving desmopressin.\n\n【21】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Noctiva™ in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood), which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving Noctiva™.\n\n【22】### Breastfeeding\n\n【23】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【24】### Drug Interactions\n\n【25】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【26】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Patient outcomes were followed through 2013. The BMI intraindividual variability between visits was measured.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】During mean ± SD follow-up of 47.4±3.9 months, 1959 patients (1.1%) developed new-onset AF. Overweight or obesity (BMI ≥25) had a greater risk of new-onset AF compared with BMI of 20 to 22.5, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.10-1.41; _P_ <.001). In underweight or normal-weight participants (initial BMI <25), a 1-kg/m  increase of BMI variability increased the risk of new-onset AF, with an adjusted HR (aHR) of 1.13 (95% CI, 1.01-1.25; _P_ \\=.02). Weight gain increased the risk of new-onset AF (aHR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.01-1.71; _P_ \\=.04) and myocardial infarction (aHR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.06-2.18; _P_ \\=.02) but not stroke. In this group, blood pressure, glucose level, and total cholesterol level were higher in individuals with the greatest BMI variability compared with those with stable BMI.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In the underweight and normal-weight Asian population, BMI variability, especially weight gain, was related to increased risk of new-onset AF and myocardial infarction. Avoiding weight gain is important to improve CV outcomes.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AF ( atrial fibrillation ), ASV ( average successive variability ), BMI ( body mass index ), CV ( cardiovascular ), HR ( hazard ratio ), ICD-10 ( International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), NHIS-HealS ( National Health Insurance Service–Health Screening )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

The telemedicine model included a navigator to facilitate patient encounters (referrals, electronic records, and scheduling) and a subscription billing contract. Between January 1 and December 31, 2011, 60 consultations were provided to the Alaska Native Medical Center. A survey of a sample of 15 women demonstrated overall patient satisfaction of 98% pertaining to the experience, technology, and medical consultation. The referring physician satisfaction, from 11 visit surveys and 8 referring physicians, revealed 99% satisfaction with the service. In this telemedicine pilot study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a telemedicine program to provide integrated specialty care that resulted in a positive effect on patient satisfaction.

As increasing numbers of new chemicals are produced and new manufacturing processes are introduced, the variety of environments in which individuals may become exposed to respiratory sensitizers and irritants makes diagnosing and treating this illness even more challenging. In addition to adverse pulmonary effects, the diagnosis of occupational asthma may bring with it negative social and financial implications that may ultimately affect the patient's quality of life. For this reason, it is important for clinicians to recognize work-related respiratory symptoms early on in their course, maintain a high clinical suspicion for an occupational cause in the diagnostic work-up of asthma, and have a high degree of certainty in the diagnosis. While a number of classification schemes have been proposed to simplify the diagnostic approach to occupational asthma, the inciting factors typically involve sensitization (often by an IgE mechanism), direct airway inflammation, various pharmacologic responses, or irritant reflex pathways. Clinicians must first document the presence of asthma, then establish a relationship between asthma and the workplace. The occupational history is the key diagnostic tool, and clinical suspicions may be evaluated further by serial peak expiratory flow measurements, nonspecific hypersensitivity challenges with histamine or methacholine, collaboration with industrial/occupational hygienists to obtain workplace exposure measurements, and specific challenge testing at tertiary referral centers providing specialized laboratories. Removal from the inciting exposure is the mainstay of therapy, and pharmacologic treatment of patients with occupational asthma is similar to the treatment of patients with other forms of asthma.\n\n【1】OSHA ( Occupational Safety and Health Administration ), PEFR ( peak expiratory flow rate ), PEL ( permissible exposure limit ), TLV ( threshold limit value )\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

The medicine is good for only 45 days once the pouch is opened.\n*   The Twisthaler® has a small window on the side with numbers showing. This is the dose counter. It keeps track of how many more times you can use the inhaler before you need to open a new one. When the dose counter reaches \"00\", the Twisthaler® will lock itself. If the dose counter is not working correctly, do not use the Twisthaler® and return it to your pharmacy or doctor.\n*   Remove the cap while it is in upright position to make sure you get the right amount of medicine with each dose.\n*   Hold the Twisthaler® upright and twist the cap in a counterclockwise direction to open it. The dose counter should change to a lower number when you take off the cap. The arrow on the Twisthaler® should be pointing to the dose counter.\n*   To inhale this medicine, breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible. Put the mouthpiece fully into your mouth and close your lips around it. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue.\n*   Breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath.\n*   Take the Twisthaler® out of your mouth. Hold your breath for about 10 seconds, then breathe out slowly.\n*   Do not breathe out into the inhaler.\n*   Wipe the mouthpiece dry with a cloth or tissue. Do not wash it with water. Put the cap back on right away and twist it in a clockwise direction. You should hear a \"click\" when the cap is fully closed.\n*   Gargle and rinse your mouth with water after each dose. This will help prevent hoarseness, throat irritation, and infection in the mouth. Do not swallow the water after rinsing.\n\n【48】To use the Asmanex® HFA inhaler:\n\n【49】*   This medicine comes in 2 strengths. Your doctor will decide which dosage strength is best for you.\n*   The Asmanex® HFA aerosol canister provides about 124 inhalations, depending on the size of the canister your doctor ordered.\n*   The Asmanex® HFA inhaler has a small window on the side with numbers showing. This is the dose counter. It keeps track of how many more times you can use the inhaler before you need to open a new one.\n*   Before using this medicine, remove the cap from the mouthpiece.\n*   When you use the inhaler for the first time, or if you have not used it in a while, test or prime it by releasing 4 test sprays into the air, away from the face.\n*   Shake well before each spray.\n*   To inhale this medicine, breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible. Put the mouthpiece fully into your mouth and close your lips around it. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue.\n*   Breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath.\n*   Do not use Asmanex® HFA canister or actuator with any other medicines.

Serum CA 125 was also measured in 4 patients with chronic renal failure before and after initiation of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.\n\n【3】### Results\n\n【4】Levels of CA 125 were elevated in patients with all forms of liver disease, especially in those with cirrhotic ascites irrespective of the etiology of cirrhosis or the presence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Levels of CA 125 did not change significantly 1 month after initiation of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Cancer antigen 125 is elevated in patients with acute and chronic liver disease, especially in those with cirrhotic ascites. This elevation in CA 125 is not because of a nonspecific response of the peritoneum to fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Awareness of the association of elevated CA 125 in patients with cirrhotic ascites can prevent unnecessary surgical intervention.\n\n【7】CA ( cancer antigen ), CAPD ( continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ), CLD ( chronic liver disease ), MELD ( Model for End-Stage Liver Disease ), SBP ( spontaneous bacterial peritonitis )\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Arzerra\n2.  Kesimpta\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Ofatumumab injection is used in combination with chlorambucil to treat a type of cancer of the white blood cells called chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in patients who have not received any treatments in the past. It is also used in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to treat patients with relapsed CLL. This medicine is also used in patients with CLL who have already been treated with other medicines (eg, alemtuzumab, fludarabine) that did not work well.\n\n【6】Ofatumumab injection is also used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. This medicine will not cure MS, but it may slow some of the disabling effects and decrease the number of relapses of the disease.\n\n【7】Ofatumumab interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by ofatumumab, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Some unwanted effects, such as a skin rash, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some of the unwanted effects do not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.\n\n【8】Before you begin treatment with ofatumumab, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.\n\n【9】Arzerra® is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor. Kesimpta® is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Solution\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ofatumumab injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【18】### Geriatric\n\n【19】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ofatumumab injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted side effects (eg, neutropenia, pneumonia) which may require caution.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

Normally, your vocal cords open and close smoothly, forming sounds through their movement and vibration.\n\n【3】But with laryngitis, your vocal cords become inflamed or irritated. This makes the vocal cords swell, which distorts the sounds produced by air passing over them. As a result, your voice sounds hoarse. In some cases of laryngitis, your voice can become almost undetectable.\n\n【4】Laryngitis may be short-lived (acute) or long lasting (chronic). Most cases of laryngitis are triggered by a temporary viral infection and aren't serious. Persistent hoarseness can sometimes signal a more serious underlying medical condition.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】In most cases laryngitis symptoms last less than a couple of weeks and are caused by something minor, such as a virus. Less often, laryngitis symptoms are caused by something more serious or long lasting. Laryngitis signs and symptoms can include:\n\n【7】*   Hoarseness\n*   Weak voice or voice loss\n*   Tickling sensation and rawness in your throat\n*   Sore throat\n*   Dry throat\n*   Dry cough\n\n【8】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【9】You can manage most acute cases of laryngitis with self-care steps, such as resting your voice and drinking plenty of fluids. Strenuous use of your voice during an episode of acute laryngitis can damage your vocal cords.\n\n【10】Make an appointment with a doctor if your laryngitis symptoms last more than two weeks.\n\n【11】### Seek immediate medical attention if you:\n\n【12】*   Have trouble breathing\n*   Cough up blood\n*   Have a fever that won't go away\n*   Have increasing pain over weeks\n\n【13】### Seek immediate medical attention if your child:\n\n【14】*   Makes noisy, high-pitched breathing sounds when inhaling (stridor)\n*   Drools more than usual\n*   Has trouble swallowing\n*   Has difficulty breathing\n*   Has a fever\n\n【15】These signs and symptoms may indicate croup — inflammation of the larynx and the airway just beneath it. Although croup can usually be treated at home, severe symptoms require medical attention. These symptoms can also indicate epiglottitis, an inflammation of the tissue that acts as a lid (epiglottis) to cover the windpipe (trachea), which can be life-threatening for children and adults.\n\n【16】Causes\n------\n\n【17】### Acute laryngitis\n\n【18】Most cases of laryngitis are temporary and improve after the underlying cause gets better. Causes of acute laryngitis include:\n\n【19】*   Viral infections similar to those that cause a cold\n*   Vocal strain, caused by yelling or overusing your voice\n*   Bacterial infections, although these are less common\n\n【20】### Chronic laryngitis\n\n【21】Laryngitis that lasts longer than three weeks is known as chronic laryngitis. This type of laryngitis is generally caused by exposure to irritants over time. Chronic laryngitis can cause vocal cord strain and injuries or growths on the vocal cords (polyps or nodules). Chronic laryngitis can be caused by:\n\n【22】*   Inhaled irritants, such as chemical fumes, allergens or smoke\n*   Acid reflux, also called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n*   Chronic sinusitis\n*   Excessive alcohol use\n*   Habitual overuse of your voice (such as in singers or cheerleaders)\n*   Smoking\n\n【23】Less common causes of chronic laryngitis include:\n\n【24】*   Bacterial or fungal infections\n*   Infections with certain parasites\n\n【25】Other causes of chronic hoarseness include:\n\n【26】*   Cancer\n*   Vocal cord paralysis, which can result from nerve injury due to surgery, injury to the chest or neck, cancer, nerve disorders, or other health conditions\n*   Bowing of the vocal cords\n\n【27】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【28】Risk factors for laryngitis include:\n\n【29】*   **Having a respiratory infection,** such as a cold, bronchitis or sinusitis\n*   **Exposure to irritating substances,** such as cigarette smoke, excessive alcohol intake, stomach acid or workplace chemicals\n*   **Overusing your voice,** by speaking too much, speaking too loudly, shouting or singing\n\n【30】Complications\n-------------\n\n【31】In some cases of laryngitis caused by infection, the infection may spread to other parts of the respiratory tract.\n\n【32】Prevention\n----------\n\n【33】To prevent dryness or irritation to your vocal cords:\n\n【34】*   **Avoid smoking and stay away from secondhand smoke.** Smoke dries your throat. It can also cause your vocal cords to become irritated.\n*   **Limit alcohol and caffeine.** These cause you to lose total body water.\n*   **Drink plenty of water.** Fluids help keep the mucus in your throat thin and easy to clear.\n*   **Keep spicy foods out of your diet.** Spicy foods can cause stomach acid to go into the throat or esophagus. This can lead to heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n*   **Include a variety of healthy foods in your diet.** Eat fruits, vegetables and whole grains. These have several vitamins, such as vitamins A, E and C, that are important for overall health. These foods can also help keep the mucous membranes in the throat healthy.\n*   **Avoid clearing your throat.** This does more harm than good, because it causes an abnormal vibration of your vocal cords and can increase swelling. Clearing your throat also causes your throat to secrete more mucus and feel more irritated, making you want to clear your throat again.\n*   **Avoid upper respiratory infections.** Wash your hands often, and avoid contact with people who have upper respiratory infections such as colds.\n\n【35】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "8b089ad6-6738-4531-b9a3-49d61b1d9edb", "title": "Liver hemangioma", "text": "【0】Liver hemangioma\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】A liver hemangioma (he-man-jee-O-muh) is a noncancerous (benign) mass in the liver made up of a tangle of blood vessels. Also known as hepatic hemangiomas or cavernous hemangiomas, these liver masses are common and are estimated to occur in up to 20% of the population.\n\n【2】Most cases of liver hemangiomas are discovered during an imaging study done for some other condition. People who have a liver hemangioma rarely experience signs and symptoms and typically don't need treatment.\n\n【3】It may be unsettling to know you have a mass in your liver, even if it's a benign mass. However, there's no evidence that an untreated liver hemangioma can lead to liver cancer.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】In most cases, a liver hemangioma doesn't cause any signs or symptoms.\n\n【6】When a liver hemangioma causes signs and symptoms, they may include:\n\n【7】*   Pain in the upper right abdomen\n*   Feeling full after eating only a small amount of food (early satiety)\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n\n【8】However, these symptoms are nonspecific and in most instances are due to something else even if you have a liver hemangioma, as these tend to be asymptomatic.\n\n【9】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【10】Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】It's not clear what causes a liver hemangioma to form. Doctors believe liver hemangiomas are present at birth (congenital).\n\n【13】A liver hemangioma usually occurs as a single abnormal collection of blood vessels that is less than about 1.5 inches (about 4 centimeters) wide. Occasionally liver hemangiomas can be larger or occur in multiples. Large hemangiomas can occur in young children, but this is rare.\n\n【14】In most people, a liver hemangioma will never grow and never cause any signs and symptoms. But in a small number of people, a liver hemangioma will grow to cause symptoms and require treatment. It's not clear why this happens.\n\n【15】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【16】Factors that can increase the risk that a liver hemangioma will be diagnosed include:\n\n【17】*   **Your age.** A liver hemangioma can be diagnosed at any age, but it's most commonly diagnosed in people ages 30 to 50.\n*   **Your sex.** Women are more likely to be diagnosed with a liver hemangioma than are men.\n*   **Pregnancy.** Women who have been pregnant are more likely to be diagnosed with a liver hemangioma than women who have never been pregnant. It's believed the hormone estrogen, which rises during pregnancy, may play a role in liver hemangioma growth.\n*   **Hormone replacement therapy.** Women who use hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms may be more likely to be diagnosed with a liver hemangioma than women who do not.\n\n【18】Complications\n-------------\n\n【19】Women who have been diagnosed with liver hemangiomas face a risk of complications if they become pregnant. The female hormone estrogen, which increases during pregnancy, is believed to cause some liver hemangiomas to grow larger.\n\n【20】Very rarely, a growing hemangioma can cause signs and symptoms that may require treatment, including pain in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, abdominal bloating or nausea. Having a liver hemangioma doesn't mean you can't become pregnant. However, discussing the possible complications with your doctor can help you make a more informed choice.\n\n【21】Medications that affect hormone levels in your body, such as birth control pills, could cause an increase in size and complications if you've been diagnosed with a liver hemangioma. But this is controversial. If you're considering this type of medication, discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor.\n\n【22】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Recombivax HB PediatricAdolescent\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Hepatitis B vaccine recombinant is used to prevent infection by the hepatitis B virus. The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.\n\n【6】Hepatitis B vaccine recombinant is made without any human blood or blood products or any other substances of human origin. It cannot give you the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\n【7】HBV infection is a major cause of serious liver diseases, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis, and a type of liver cancer called primary hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n【8】Pregnant women who have hepatitis B infection or are carriers of hepatitis B virus can give the disease to their babies when they are born. These babies often suffer serious long-term illnesses from the disease.\n\n【9】Immunization against hepatitis B disease is recommended for all newborn babies, infants, children, and adolescents up to 19 years of age. It is also recommended for adults who live in areas that have a high rate of hepatitis B disease or who may be at increased risk of infection from hepatitis B virus. These adults include:\n\n【10】*   Sexually active homosexual and bisexual males, including those with HIV infection.\n*   Sexually active heterosexual persons with multiple partners.\n*   Persons who may be exposed to the virus by means of blood, blood products, or human bites, such as health care workers, employees in medical facilities, patients and staff of live-in facilities and daycare programs for the developmentally disabled, morticians and embalmers, police and fire department personnel, and military personnel.\n*   Persons who have kidney disease or who undergo blood dialysis for kidney disease.\n*   Persons with blood clotting disorders who receive transfusions of clotting-factor concentrates.\n*   Household and sexual contacts of HBV carriers.\n*   Persons in areas with high risk of HBV infection \\[in the population\\], such as Alaskan Eskimos, Pacific Islanders, Haitian and Indochinese immigrants, and refugees from areas that have a high rate of hepatitis B disease; persons accepting orphans or adoptees from these areas; and travelers to these areas.\n*   Persons who use illegal injection drugs.\n*   Prisoners.\n\n【11】This vaccine is available only from your doctor or other authorized health care professional.\n\n【12】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【13】*   Suspension\n\n【14】Before Using\n------------\n\n【15】In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this vaccine, the following should be considered:\n\n【16】### Allergies\n\n【17】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【18】### Pediatric\n\n【19】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of hepatitis B vaccine recombinant in children.\n\n【20】### Geriatric\n\n【21】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of hepatitis B vaccine recombinant in the elderly.\n\n【22】### Breastfeeding\n\n【23】Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.\n\n【24】### Drug Interactions\n\n【25】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this vaccine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【26】Receiving this vaccine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【27】*   Elivaldogene Autotemcel\n*   Teplizumab-mzwv\n*   Ublituximab-xiiy\n\n【28】### Other Interactions\n\n【29】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【30】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【31】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this vaccine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【32】*   Allergy to yeast—Should not be used in patients with this condition.\n\n【33】*   Bleeding problems (e.g. hemophilia)—Use with caution. May have an increased risk of bleeding at the injection site.\n\n【34】*   Multiple sclerosis—Use with caution. May make this condition worse.\n\n【35】*   Severe illness with a fever—Your dose may need to be given at a later time.\n\n【36】*   Weak immune system from a disease or medicine—May not work as well in patients with this condition.\n\n【37】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【38】A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this vaccine. This vaccine is given as a shot into one of your muscles. If you have bleeding problems such as hemophilia, the vaccine may be given as a shot under your skin.\n\n【39】This vaccine is usually given as 3 doses. After the first dose, two more doses are given 1 month and 6 months after the first dose, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.\n\n【40】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【41】It is very important that you or your child return to your doctor’s office at the right time for the second and third dose. Be sure to notify your doctor of any unwanted effects that occur after you or your child receive this vaccine.\n\n【42】This vaccine may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child have a rash, itching, swelling of the tongue and throat, or trouble breathing after you get the injection.\n\n【43】Tell your doctor if you or your child are allergic to latex. The needle cover and the rubber plunger of the prefilled syringe contain dry natural latex rubber, which may cause an allergic reaction in people with a latex allergy.\n\n【44】This vaccine may not protect you against hepatitis B infection if you are already infected with the virus at the time you receive the shot.\n\n【45】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【46】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【47】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【48】#### More common\n\n【49】1.  Fever of 37.7 degrees C (100 degrees F) or higher\n\n【50】#### Rare\n\n【51】1.  Aches or pain in the joints, fever, or skin rash or welts (may occur days or weeks after receiving the vaccine)\n2.  blurred vision or other vision changes\n3.  confusion\n4.  difficulty with breathing or swallowing\n5.  dizziness, faintness, or lightheadedness when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting position\n6.  hives\n7.  itching, especially of the feet or hands\n8.  muscle weakness\n9.  numbness or tingling of the arms and legs\n10.  reddening of the skin, especially around the ears\n11.  sweating\n12.  swelling of the eyes, face, or inside of the nose\n13.  unusual tiredness or weakness (sudden and severe)\n\n【52】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention.

The condition isn't painful or itchy. But it can cause thick white or yellow scales that aren't easy to remove.\n\n【2】Cradle cap usually clears up on its own in weeks or a few months. Home care measures include washing your baby's scalp daily with a mild shampoo. This can help you loosen and remove the scales. Don't scratch cradle cap.\n\n【3】If cradle cap persists or seems severe, your doctor may suggest a medicated shampoo, lotion or other treatment.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Common signs of cradle cap include:\n\n【6】*   Patchy scaling or thick crusts on the scalp\n*   Oily or dry skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales\n*   Skin flakes\n*   Possibly mild redness\n\n【7】Similar scales may also be present on the ears, eyelids, nose and groin.\n\n【8】Cradle cap is common in newborns.

The aortic valve is located between the left lower heart chamber (left ventricle) and the body's main artery (aorta). If the valve doesn't open correctly, blood flow from the heart to the body is reduced.\n\n【2】TAVR can help restore blood flow and reduce the signs and symptoms of aortic valve stenosis — such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting and fatigue.\n\n【3】TAVR may be an option for people who are at risk of complications from surgical aortic valve replacement (open-heart surgery). The decision to treat aortic stenosis with TAVR is made after a discussion with a team of heart and heart surgery specialists, who work together to determine the best treatment option for you.\n\n【4】Transcatheter aortic valve replacement may also be called transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a treatment for aortic valve stenosis. Aortic valve stenosis — or aortic stenosis — occurs when the heart's aortic valve thickens and becomes stiff (calcifies). As a result, the valve can't fully open and blood flow to the body is reduced.\n\n【7】TAVR is an alternative to open-heart aortic valve replacement surgery. People who have TAVR often have a shorter hospital stay than those who have surgical aortic valve replacement.\n\n【8】Your doctor may recommend TAVR if you have:\n\n【9】*   Severe aortic stenosis that causes signs and symptoms.\n*   A biological tissue aortic valve that isn't working as well as it should.\n*   Another health condition, such as lung or kidney disease, that makes open-heart valve replacement surgery too risky.\n\n【10】Risks\n-----\n\n【11】All surgeries and medical procedures come with some type of risk. Potential risks of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may include:\n\n【12】*   Bleeding\n*   Blood vessel complications\n*   Problems with the replacement valve, such as the valve slipping out of place or leaking (regurgitation)\n*   Stroke\n*   Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) and the need for a pacemaker\n*   Kidney disease\n*   Heart attack\n*   Infection\n*   Death\n\n【13】Studies have found that the risks of disabling stroke and death are similar among those who have TAVR and surgical aortic valve replacement.\n\n【14】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【15】The treatment team will provide instructions on how to prepare for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about the procedure.\n\n【16】### Food and medications\n\n【17】Talk to your doctor about:\n\n【18】*   When you can take your regular medications and whether you can take them before a TAVR procedure\n*   When you should stop eating or drinking before the procedure\n*   Any drug allergies that you have\n\n【19】### Clothing and personal items\n\n【20】Your treatment team may recommend that you bring several items to the hospital, including:\n\n【21】*   A list of all the medications you take, including those bought without prescriptions\n*   Eyeglasses, hearing aids or dentures\n*   Personal care items, such as a brush or comb, toothbrush, and shaving equipment\n*   Loose-fitting, comfortable clothing\n*   Items that may help you relax, such as portable music players or books\n\n【22】During your procedure, avoid wearing:\n\n【23】*   Contact lenses\n*   Dentures\n*   Eyeglasses\n*   Jewelry\n*   Nail polish\n\n【24】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【25】### Before the procedure\n\n【26】A specialist will insert an IV into your forearm or hand and may give you a medication called a sedative to help you relax. Medication to prevent blood clots may also be given through the IV. You may also receive medication to reduce the risk of infection.\n\n【27】Hair may be shaved off at the location on your body where the procedure will take place.\n\n【28】### During the procedure\n\n【29】Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) involves replacing a damaged aortic valve with one made from cow or pig heart tissue (biological tissue valve). Sometimes, the biological tissue valve is placed into an existing biological tissue valve that is no longer working.\n\n【30】Unlike surgical aortic valve replacement, which requires a long incision down the chest (open-heart surgery), TAVR is done using smaller incisions and a thin, flexible tube (catheter) to reach the heart.\n\n【31】To perform TAVR, a doctor inserts a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the groin or chest area, and guides it into the heart. Moving X-ray images or echocardiogram pictures help the doctor place the catheter into the correct position.\n\n【32】A replacement valve made of cow or pig tissue is passed through the hollow catheter and placed in the area of the aortic valve. A balloon on the catheter tip inflates to press the new valve into place. Some valves expand without the use of a balloon.\n\n【33】The doctor removes the catheter once the new valve is securely in place.\n\n【34】During the TAVR procedure, the treatment team will carefully monitor your vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm, and breathing.\n\n【35】### After the procedure\n\n【36】You may spend the night in the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring after your procedure. How long you need to stay in the hospital after TAVR depends on many things. Some people who have TAVR go home the next day.\n\n【37】Before you leave the hospital, your treatment team will explain how to care for any incisions and how to watch for signs and symptoms of infection. Warning signs of infection include fever, increased pain, and redness, swelling, draining or oozing at the catheter site.\n\n【38】Several medications may be prescribed after TAVR, including:\n\n【39】*   **Blood thinners (anticoagulants).** Blood-thinning medication is prescribed to prevent blood clots. Your doctor will explain how long you may need to take this medicine. Always take medications as prescribed.\n*   **Antibiotics.** Artificial heart valves can become infected with bacteria. Most bacteria that cause heart valve infections come from the bacteria in the mouth. Excellent dental hygiene, including routine dental cleanings, can help prevent these infections. Antibiotics are prescribed for use before certain dental procedures.\n\n【40】Regular doctor's checkups and imaging tests are needed after TAVR to make sure the new valve is working properly. Let your doctor know if you have any new or worsening signs or symptoms, including:\n\n【41】*   Dizziness or light-headedness\n*   Swelling of the ankles\n*   Sudden weight gain\n*   Extreme tiredness with activity\n*   Signs or symptoms of infection\n\n【42】Seek emergency medical help if you have:\n\n【43】*   Chest pain, pressure or tightness\n*   Severe, sudden shortness of breath\n*   Fainting\n\n【44】Results\n-------\n\n【45】Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may relieve the signs and symptoms of aortic valve stenosis, which may help improve quality of life.\n\n【46】Following a heart-healthy lifestyle is important as you recover and to help prevent further heart problems. After TAVR:\n\n【47】*   Don't smoke.\n*   Eat a heathy diet rich in fruits and veggies and low in salt (sodium) and saturated and trans fats.\n*   Get regular exercise — talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise routine.\n*   Maintain a healthy weight.\n\n【48】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

If you have foot drop, the front of your foot might drag on the ground when you walk.\n\n【2】Foot drop isn't a disease. Rather, it is a sign of an underlying neurological, muscular or anatomical problem.\n\n【3】Sometimes foot drop is temporary, but it can be permanent. If you have foot drop, you might need to wear a brace on your ankle and foot to support the foot and hold it in position.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Foot drop makes it difficult to lift the front part of the foot, so it might drag on the floor when you walk. To help the foot clear the floor, a person with foot drop may raise the thigh more than usual when walking, as though climbing stairs. This unusual kind of walking, called steppage gait, might cause the foot to slap down onto the floor with each step. In some cases, the skin on the top of the foot and toes feels numb.\n\n【6】Depending on the cause, foot drop can affect one or both feet.\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】If your toes drag on the floor when you walk, consult your doctor.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Foot drop is caused by weakness or paralysis of the muscles involved in lifting the front part of the foot. Causes of foot drop might include:\n\n【11】*   **Nerve injury.** The most common cause of foot drop is compression of a nerve in the leg that controls the muscles involved in lifting the foot. This nerve is called the peroneal nerve. A serious knee injury can lead to the nerve being compressed. It can also be injured during hip or knee replacement surgery, which may cause foot drop.\n\n【12】    A nerve root injury — \"pinched nerve\" — in the spine also can cause foot drop. People who have diabetes are more susceptible to nerve disorders, which are associated with foot drop.\n\n【13】*   **Muscle or nerve disorders.** Various forms of muscular dystrophy, an inherited disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, can contribute to foot drop. So can other neurologic disorders, such as polio or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.\n*   **Brain and spinal cord disorders.** Disorders that affect the spinal cord or brain — such as stroke, multiple sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) — may cause foot drop.\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】The peroneal nerve controls the muscles that lift the foot. This nerve runs near the surface of the skin on the side of the knee closest to the hand. Activities that compress this nerve can increase the risk of foot drop. Examples include:\n\n【16】*   **Leg crossing.** People who habitually cross their legs can compress the peroneal nerve on their uppermost leg.\n*   **Prolonged kneeling.** Occupations that involve prolonged squatting or kneeling — such as picking strawberries or laying floor tile — can result in foot drop.\n*   **Wearing a leg cast.** Plaster casts that enclose the ankle and end just below the knee can exert pressure on the peroneal nerve.\n\n【17】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "38997e9d-6f16-4130-bb97-5c62c91a4b23", "title": "CT scan", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】A computerized tomography (CT) scan combines a series of X-ray images taken from different angles around your body and uses computer processing to create cross-sectional images (slices) of the bones, blood vessels and soft tissues inside your body. CT scan images provide more-detailed information than plain X-rays do.\n\n【2】A CT scan has many uses, but it's particularly well-suited to quickly examine people who may have internal injuries from car accidents or other types of trauma. A CT scan can be used to visualize nearly all parts of the body and is used to diagnose disease or injury as well as to plan medical, surgical or radiation treatment.\n\n【3】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【4】Your doctor may recommend a CT scan to help:\n\n【5】*   Diagnose muscle and bone disorders, such as bone tumors and fractures\n*   Pinpoint the location of a tumor, infection or blood clot\n*   Guide procedures such as surgery, biopsy and radiation therapy\n*   Detect and monitor diseases and conditions such as cancer, heart disease, lung nodules and liver masses\n*   Monitor the effectiveness of certain treatments, such as cancer treatment\n*   Detect internal injuries and internal bleeding\n\n【6】Risks\n-----\n\n【7】### Radiation exposure\n\n【8】During a CT scan, you're briefly exposed to ionizing radiation. The amount of radiation is greater than you would get during a plain X-ray because the CT scan gathers more-detailed information. The low doses of radiation used in CT scans have not been shown to cause long-term harm, although at much higher doses, there may be a small increase in your potential risk of cancer.\n\n【9】CT scans have many benefits that outweigh any small potential risk. Doctors use the lowest dose of radiation possible to obtain the needed medical information. Also, newer, faster machines and techniques require less radiation than was previously used. Talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of your CT scan.\n\n【10】### Harm to unborn babies\n\n【11】Tell your doctor if you're pregnant. Although the radiation from a CT scan is unlikely to injure your baby, your doctor may recommend another type of exam, such as ultrasound or MRI, to avoid exposing your baby to radiation. At the low doses of radiation used in CT imaging, no negative effects have been observed in humans.\n\n【12】### Reactions to contrast material\n\n【13】In certain cases, your doctor may recommend that you receive a special dye called contrast material. This can be something that you are asked to drink before your CT scan, or something that is given through a vein in your arm or inserted into your rectum. Although rare, the contrast material can cause medical problems or allergic reactions.\n\n【14】Most reactions are mild and result in a rash or itchiness. In rare instances, an allergic reaction can be serious, even life-threatening. Tell your doctor if you've ever had a reaction to contrast material.\n\n【15】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【16】Depending on which part of your body is being scanned, you may be asked to:\n\n【17】*   Take off some or all of your clothing and wear a hospital gown\n*   Remove metal objects, such as a belt, jewelry, dentures and eyeglasses, which might interfere with image results\n*   Refrain from eating or drinking for a few hours before your scan\n\n【18】### Contrast material\n\n【19】A special dye called contrast material is needed for some CT scans to help highlight the areas of your body being examined. The contrast material blocks X-rays and appears white on images, which can help emphasize blood vessels, intestines or other structures.\n\n【20】Contrast material might be given to you:\n\n【21】*   **By mouth.** If your esophagus or stomach is being scanned, you may need to swallow a liquid that contains contrast material. This drink may taste unpleasant.\n*   **By injection.** Contrast agents can be injected through a vein in your arm to help your gallbladder, urinary tract, liver or blood vessels stand out on the images. You may experience a feeling of warmth during the injection or a metallic taste in your mouth.\n*   **By enema.** A contrast material may be inserted in your rectum to help visualize your intestines. This procedure can make you feel bloated and uncomfortable.\n\n【22】### Preparing your child for a scan\n\n【23】If your infant or toddler is having a CT scan, the doctor may recommend a sedative to keep your child calm and still. Movement blurs the images and may lead to inaccurate results. Ask your doctor how to prepare your child.\n\n【24】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【25】You can have a CT scan done in a hospital or an outpatient facility. CT scans are painless and, with newer machines, take only a few minutes. The whole process typically takes about 30 minutes.\n\n【26】### During the procedure\n\n【27】CT scanners are shaped like a large doughnut standing on its side. You lie on a narrow, motorized table that slides through the opening into a tunnel. Straps and pillows may be used to help you stay in position. During a head scan, the table may be fitted with a special cradle that holds your head still.\n\n【28】While the table moves you into the scanner, detectors and the X-ray tube rotate around you. Each rotation yields several images of thin slices of your body. You may hear buzzing and whirring noises.\n\n【29】A technologist in a separate room can see and hear you. You will be able to communicate with the technologist via intercom. The technologist may ask you to hold your breath at certain points to avoid blurring the images.\n\n【30】### After the procedure\n\n【31】After the exam you can return to your normal routine. If you were given contrast material, you may receive special instructions. In some cases, you may be asked to wait for a short time before leaving to ensure that you feel well after the exam. After the scan, you'll likely be told to drink lots of fluids to help your kidneys remove the contrast material from your body.\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】CT images are stored as electronic data files and are usually reviewed on a computer screen. A radiologist interprets these images and sends a report to your doctor.\n\n【34】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Hematologic and organ responses were assessed at 100 days and 1 year. Transplantation-related mortality (TRM) was assessed at day 30 after HSCT. A multivariate analysis assessed factors that influenced overall survival.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Improvement at day 100 was seen in 1 or more amyloidosis-affected sites (bone marrow, kidney, liver, and/or heart) in 28 (36%) of 77 patients; the 1-year responses included complete response (16%), partial response (16%), stable disease (31%), and disease progression (10%). With a median follow-up of 30 months, the 1- and 3-year survival rates were 66% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 56%-75%) and 56% (95% CI, 45%-66%), respectively. The day 30 TRM was 18% (95% CI, 11%-26%). In the multivariate analysis, only the year of transplantation (patients who most recently underwent transplantation) was associated with post-HSCT survival ( _P_ \\= .02).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】In this multi-institutional CIBMTR study, the 3-year survival rate was comparable to single-center results, with patients who more recently underwent transplantation faring better. Of note, the TRM was higher than that reported by single centers, which may reflect differences in patient selection and/or experience in treating this challenging disease. We hope that a better understanding of the recently recognized prognostic factors and more stringent patient selection will result in lower TRM and improved survival.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】CI ( confidence interval ), CIBMTR ( Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research ), HSCT ( hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ), KPS ( Karnofsky performance score ), TRM ( transplantation-related mortality )\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

We identified residents of Olmsted County who sought care for cellulitis from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 1999, reviewed medical records to ascertain agreement with a case definition of lower-extremity cellulitis, and calculated the population-based incidence of lower-extremity cellulitis.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】During 1999, 176 episodes met the case definition of lower-extremity cellulitis; the incidence of lower-extremity cellulitis in Olmsted County was 199 per 100,000 person-years. Sex-specific incidence was 197 per 100,000 person-years for women and 201 per 100,000 person-years for men. In a sex-adjusted model, the incidence increased 3.7% (95% confidence interval, 2.9%-4.5%) per year increment in age or 43.8% (95% confidence interval, 33.6%-54.7%) per 10-year increment. The incidence of cellulitis significantly increased with age ( _P_ <.001 in Poisson regression) but was not statistically significantly different between the sexes.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】The incidence of lower-extremity cellulitis in this population-based study was high and was affected by age. In contrast, sex did not influence infection incidence. The need for hospitalization and the prevalence of recurrence of lower-extremity cellulitis added to the burden of disease in Olmsted County.\n\n【8】CI ( confidence interval ), HICDA ( hospital adaptation of the International Classification of Diseases ), ICD-9 ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ), REP ( Rochester Epidemiology Project ), WBC ( white blood cell )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

The British Postmaster General briefly allowed the logo “Pears’ Soap” to be added to the reverse of sheets of the United Kingdom’s 1881 1d. (Scott 89) and 1887 Jubilee ½ d. (Scott 111) stamps issued in 1889, but the experiment was soon discontinued, in part because the contracted printer found it difficult to produce the text consistently. Despite the failure of the British test, the New Zealand post office tried a similar approach 4 years later. Stamps with advertisements on the reverse are sometimes called “underprints” or “backprints,” in contrast to the much more common “overprints,” on which postal administrations have added words or designs to the visible front side of existing stamps.\n\n【1】When New Zealand backprinted stamps debuted in February 1893, advertised products included: Beecham’s pills (a laxative developed in England in the 1840s); Beecham’s toothpaste; Wertheim sewing machines; Sunlight laundry soap; Cadbury’s cocoa, Fry’s cocoa powder; Lattey, Livermore & Company’s imported Ceylon tea; Kaitangata coal; Poneke beef extract; and Bonnington’s Irish Moss cough syrup. Like the British backprints, the New Zealand philatelic advertising experiment was short-lived, but many more examples of the New Zealand stamps were printed, and a large number survive today. A 1998 _Health and Hygiene_ article related one potential reason for the New Zealand postal advertising failure: “Rival advertising agencies promoted a rumor that the dye of the advertisement when licked was injurious to health.”\n\n【2】The most controversial underprint advertisement in the New Zealand series was for “Macbean Stewart’s New Cure for Asthma, Diphtheria, and Croup” 删除4:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Newspaper advertisements for this alleged respiratory panacea, which was “prepared from the mountain and forest plants of New Zealand,” and manufactured by the Sharland & Company chemists in Auckland, had already been appearing for several years when the stamp debuted. Print advertisements for Dr Macbean Stewart’s “cure” often included testimonials from a police sergeant, a local political leader, and a gardener 删除4:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Some of the newspaper advertisements also began with a Maori language quotation, perhaps to suggest that the product’s plant mixture was influenced by traditional Polynesian medicinal lore, though the specific ingredients were never disclosed.\n\n【3】Figure 1 Advertisement for Dr Macbean Stewart’s herbal medication on the reverse of an 1893 New Zealand 2-pence “second sideface series” definitive stamp (Scott 62). The stamp’s violet obverse bears an image of Queen Victoria in profile.

The advertisement also lists “asthma tobacco” and a brand of gumweed cigarillos for sale. During the 19  century, many physicians thought smoking tobacco was beneficial for pulmonary diseases. A typical daily wage for a laborer in the 1890s in New Zealand was 6 to 8 shillings per day, so the cost of Macbean Stewart’s asthma cure represented about one-half-day’s wages.

An editorial in the _Australasian Medical Gazette_ in July 1889 compared Dr Macbean Stewart’s medicine to the Chamberlain family’s infamous century-long failure to disclose their invention of obstetrical forceps, despite the potential benefit of disclosure to humanity: “We feel that, in quoting the Chamberlains in juxtaposition to Francis MacBean Stewart … we are bestowing unmerited distinction on the latter, who, much to our surprise, we find is on the staff of the Christchurch Hospital.” The Royal College of Surgeons wrote to Dr Macbean Stewart in 1890, demanding an explanation for his overpromising advertisements. Similarly, several physicians sent letters to the _British Medical Journal_ in 1892, complaining about the Macbean Stewart newsprint advertisements.\n\n【8】In response to this criticism, Dr Macbean Stewart promised to stop selling his asthma cure. But the 1893 underprinted postage stamps and newspaper advertisements that continued to appear until the late 1890s demonstrated that he did not keep his promise.\n\n【9】Francis Macbean Stewart 删除4:<u>( Figure 3 )</u> was born in Dundee, Scotland, in 1838, and spent much of his childhood living with an uncle near Loch Ness. He enrolled at Edinburgh University to study medicine in 1855. While still a student, he sailed to the Arctic several times between 1859 and 1863 on the whaling and sealing ship _Narwhal,_ acting as the ship’s surgeon. On his final expedition, his legs were severely damaged by frostbite. During testimony 3 decades later to a board of inquiry concerning the asthma “cure,” Macbean Stewart stated that his previously injured legs were worsening with time, and he worried he would eventually be unable to work, so he allowed his name to be put on the patent medicine to provide his wife and family some financial security.\n\n【10】Figure 3 Images of Dr Francis Macbean Stewart at different stages of his career.

Dr Macbean Stewart began a surgical practice in Inverness, where he was the surgical consultant to a dispensary, served as the local health inspector of shipping, and was appointed as a military surgeon to the Cameron Highlanders regiment. For two years in the early 1870s, he was the ship surgeon on the _S.S. Carpentaria_ , a mail boat running between Glasgow and New York.\n\n【13】Dr Macbean Stewart moved to New Zealand in 1873, initially settling in the South Island gold prospecting town of Milton, where he married Annie Stevens Farr (1852-1926), the daughter of a prominent Christchurch architect who had introduced the bumblebee to New Zealand. In 1876, the young couple moved to the South Island village of Ashburton, where Dr Macbean Stewart became a leader in the local Presbyterian Church and the Caledonian Society for Scottish immigrants. He was also a member of the Ancient Order of Druids. Their first child of an eventual six died in infancy; their second child, Douglas, born in 1877, was later killed in the World War I battle of Gallipoli in 1915.\n\n【14】In 1881, Dr Macbean Stewart and his family moved to Christchurch, where he served as an honorary consulting surgeon at Christchurch Hospital for 12 years. The hospital was quite small at that time and had only 2 consulting surgeons. The other surgeon, Irish immigrant Dr Courtney Nedwell, appears to have been a rival. In 1884, Dr Nedwell criticized Macbean Stewart’s operating practices following an unsuccessful hernia repair during which the patient died of peritonitis. This resulted in a formal inquiry, in which Dr Macbean Stewart was exonerated and ultimately allowed to resume practice.\n\n【15】During his career, Dr Macbean Stewart was known for advocating inspection of slaughterhouses and dairies, and he also favored women’s suffrage. In 1893, New Zealand became the first self-governing country in the world to give women the right to vote in national elections. He died in 1906, following an operation to remove a tumor on his eye, and was given a Highland-style funeral by the local Caledonian Society.\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>### Footnotes</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>_Stamp Vignettes focus on biographical details and accomplishments related to science and medicine, and not individual views and prejudices except when they had a major impact on the subject’s life.

{"seq_id": "530fc73f-f9da-4ddd-b644-91909fc446ed", "title": "Aspergillosis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Aspergillosis is an infection caused by a type of mold (fungus). The illnesses resulting from aspergillosis infection usually affect the respiratory system, but their signs and severity vary greatly.\n\n【2】The mold that triggers the illnesses, aspergillus, is everywhere — indoors and outdoors. Most strains of this mold are harmless, but a few can cause serious illnesses when people with weakened immune systems, underlying lung disease or asthma inhale their fungal spores.\n\n【3】In some people, the spores trigger an allergic reaction. Other people develop mild to serious lung infections. The most serious form of aspergillosis — invasive aspergillosis — occurs when the infection spreads to blood vessels and beyond.\n\n【4】Depending on the type of aspergillosis, treatment may involve observation, antifungal medications or, in rare cases, surgery.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】The signs and symptoms of aspergillosis vary with the type of illness you develop:\n\n【7】### Allergic reaction\n\n【8】Some people with asthma or cystic fibrosis have an allergic reaction to aspergillus mold. Signs and symptoms of this condition, known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, include:\n\n【9】*   Fever\n*   A cough that may bring up blood or plugs of mucus\n*   Worsening asthma\n\n【10】### Aspergilloma\n\n【11】Certain chronic lung (pulmonary) conditions, such as emphysema, tuberculosis or advanced sarcoidosis, can cause air spaces (cavities) to form in the lungs. When people with lung cavities are also infected with aspergillus, fungus fibers may find their way into the cavities and grow into tangled masses (fungus balls) known as aspergillomas.\n\n【12】Aspergillomas may produce no symptoms or cause only a mild cough at first. Over time and without treatment, however, aspergillomas can worsen the underlying chronic lung condition and possibly cause:\n\n【13】*   A cough that often brings up blood (hemoptysis)\n*   Wheezing\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Unintentional weight loss\n*   Fatigue\n\n【14】### Invasive aspergillosis\n\n【15】This is the most severe form of aspergillosis. It occurs when the infection spreads rapidly from the lungs to the brain, heart, kidneys or skin. Invasive aspergillosis occurs only in people whose immune systems are weakened as a result of cancer chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation or a disease of the immune system. Untreated, this form of aspergillosis may be fatal.\n\n【16】Signs and symptoms depend on which organs are affected, but in general, invasive aspergillosis can cause:\n\n【17】*   Fever and chills\n*   A cough that brings up blood (hemoptysis)\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Chest or joint pain\n*   Headaches or eye symptoms\n*   Skin lesions\n\n【18】### Other types of aspergillosis\n\n【19】Aspergillus can invade areas of your body other than your lungs, such as your sinuses. In your sinuses, the fungus can cause a stuffy nose sometimes accompanied by drainage that may contain blood. Fever, facial pain and headache may also occur.\n\n【20】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【21】If you have asthma or cystic fibrosis, see your doctor whenever you notice a change in your breathing. Although aspergillosis may not be the cause, it's important to have breathing problems evaluated.\n\n【22】If you have a weakened immune system and develop an unexplained fever, shortness of breath or a cough that brings up blood, get immediate medical care. In the case of invasive aspergillosis, prompt treatment is crucial. In some cases, treatment with antifungal medication begins as soon as aspergillosis is suspected, even before testing has confirmed the diagnosis.\n\n【23】Causes\n------\n\n【24】Aspergillus mold is unavoidable. Outdoors, it's found in decaying leaves and compost and on plants, trees and grain crops.\n\n【25】Everyday exposure to aspergillus is rarely a problem for people with healthy immune systems. When mold spores are inhaled, immune system cells surround and destroy them. But people who have a weakened immune system from illness or immunosuppressant medications have fewer infection-fighting cells. This allows aspergillus to take hold, invading the lungs and, in the most serious cases, other parts of the body.\n\n【26】Aspergillosis is not contagious from person to person.\n\n【27】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【28】Your risk of developing aspergillosis depends on your overall health and the extent of your exposure to mold. In general, these factors make you more vulnerable to infection:\n\n【29】*   **Weakened immune system.** People taking immune-suppressing drugs after undergoing transplant surgery — especially bone marrow or stem cell transplants — or people who have certain cancers of the blood are at highest risk of invasive aspergillosis. People in the later stages of AIDS also may be at increased risk.\n*   **Low white blood cell level.** People who have had chemotherapy, an organ transplant or leukemia have lower white cell levels, making them more susceptible to invasive aspergillosis. So does having chronic granulomatous disease — an inherited disorder that affects immune system cells.\n*   **Lung cavities.** People who have air spaces (cavities) in their lungs are at higher risk of developing aspergillomas.\n*   **Asthma or cystic fibrosis.** People with asthma and cystic fibrosis, especially those whose lung problems are long-standing or hard to control, are more likely to have an allergic response to aspergillus mold.\n*   **Long-term corticosteroid therapy.** Long-term use of corticosteroids may increase the risk of opportunistic infections, depending on the underlying disease being treated and what other drugs are being used.\n\n【30】Complications\n-------------\n\n【31】Depending on the type of infection, aspergillosis can cause a variety of serious complications:\n\n【32】*   **Bleeding.** Both aspergillomas and invasive aspergillosis can cause severe, and sometimes fatal, bleeding in your lungs.\n*   **Systemic infection.** The most serious complication of invasive aspergillosis is the spread of the infection to other parts of your body, especially your brain, heart and kidneys. Invasive aspergillosis spreads rapidly and may be fatal.\n\n【33】Prevention\n----------\n\n【34】It's nearly impossible to avoid exposure to aspergillus, but if you have had a transplant or are undergoing chemotherapy, try to stay away from places where you're likely to encounter mold, such as construction sites, compost piles and buildings that store grain. If you have a weakened immune system, your doctor may advise you to wear a face mask to avoid being exposed to aspergillus and other airborne infectious agents.\n\n【35】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Cause-specific deaths were identified in the stroke belt and nonstroke belt populations using _International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision_ codes. The relative percentage gap was estimated as the absolute difference computed relative to nonstroke belt mortality. Piecewise linear regression and age-period-cohort modeling were used to assess, respectively, the trends and to forecast mortality across the 2 regions.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The cardiovascular mortality rate (per 100,000 persons) was 288.3 (95% CI, 288.0 to 288.6; 3,684,273 deaths) in the stroke belt region and 251.2 (95% CI, 251.0 to 251.3; 13,296,164 deaths) in the nonstroke belt region. In the stroke belt region, age-adjusted mortality rates due to all cardiovascular causes (average annual percentage change \\[AAPC\\] in mortality rates, −2.4; 95% CI, −2.8 to −2.0), IHD (AAPC, −3.8; 95% CI, −4.2 to −3.5), and stroke (AAPC, −2.8; 95% CI, −3.4 to −2.1) declined from 1999 to 2018. A similar decline in cardiovascular (AAPC, −2.5; 95% CI, −3.0 to −2.0), IHD (AAPC, −4.0; 95% CI, −4.3 to −3.7), and stroke (AAPC, −2.9; 95% CI, −3.2 to −2.2) mortality was seen in the nonstroke belt region. There was no overall change in heart failure mortality in both regions ( _P_ <sub>AAPC </sub> \\>.05). The cardiovascular mortality gap was 11.8% in 1999 and 15.9% in 2018, with a modest reduction in absolute mortality rate difference (~7 deaths per 100,000 persons). These patterns were consistent across subgroups of age, sex, race, and urbanization status. An estimated 101,953 additional cardiovascular deaths need to be prevented from 2020 to 2025 in the stroke belt to ameliorate the gap between the 2 regions.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Despite the overall decline, substantial geographic disparities in cardiovascular mortality persist. Novel approaches are needed to attenuate the long-standing geographic inequalities in cardiovascular mortality in the United States, which are projected to increase.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AAPC ( average annual percentage change ), APC ( annual percentage change ), IHD ( ischemic heart disease )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

This was the first such outbreak, although 3 years previously, 2 nonhealing sores on the back of his neck were found to be seborrheic dermatitis. On further questioning, the patient admitted to dyspnea on exertion, progressively worsening during the past few years, but denied having any chest pain, palpitations, weight loss, fever, night sweats, or orthopnea.\n\n【1】The patient's medical history included paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and mild anemia. He had smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day for many years but had quit 20 years previously, and he denied any alcohol or recreational drug use. His father and mother died of liver carcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma, respectively, and his daughter had a “skin disease.” Medications and supplements that the patient was taking included atenolol, amlodipine, levothyroxine, aspirin, and folic acid, and he applied Vanicream and Neosporin ointment as needed; none of these were new to his medication regimen.\n\n【2】On physical examination, the patient was alert and oriented. His blood pressure was 176/78 mm Hg, his pulse rate was 66/min, and he was afebrile. Examination of his skin revealed blistering, crusting lesions on the back of his neck and small papules on his face. He also had shallow excoriated, ulcerated lesions on the dorsal aspects of his hands and forearms, as well as diffuse erythematous scaly patches on his right leg. The lesions were strictly in a photodistributive pattern. No areas of hypopigmentation or hypertrichosis were appreciated. His conjunctivae were pale but not icteric, and his neck was supple without thyromegaly. No oral lesions were seen. Carotid bruits were auscultated bilaterally, with intensity greater on the left than on the right. No lymphadenopathy was noted, and findings on lung, cardiac, abdominal, and rectal examinations were unremarkable. Initial laboratory results (reference ranges shown parenthetically) were as follows: hemoglobin, 9.6 g/dL (13.5-17.5 g/dL); platelets, 199 × 10  /L (150-450 × 10  /L); leukocytes, 3.6 × 10  /L (3.5-10.5 × 10  / L); mean corpuscular volume, 93.7 fL (81.2-95.1 fL); reticulocytes, 1.92% (0.60%-1.83%); sodium, 140 mEq/L (135-145 mEq/L); potassium, 4.2 mEq/L (3.6-4.8 mEq/L); calcium, 9.2 mg/dL (8.9-10.1 mg/dL); creatinine, 1.3 mg/ dL (0.9-1.4 mg/dL); and albumin, 4.1 g/dL (3.5-5.0 g/dL). Skin biopsy revealed subepidermal bullae and mixed dermal inflammation.\n\n【3】*   1.\n\n【4】    **_Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?_**\n\n【5】    *   a.\n\n【6】        _Pemphigus vulgaris_\n\n【7】    *   b.\n\n【8】        _Dermatitis herpetiformis_\n\n【9】    *   c.\n\n【10】        _Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)_\n\n【11】    *   d.\n\n【12】        _Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT)_\n\n【13】    *   e.\n\n【14】        _Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)_\n\n【15】Pemphigus vulgaris is a possibility because of the blistering lesions. However, flaccid bullae typically occur in the oropharynx and may then spread to the skin, with a predilection for the scalp, face, chest, axillae, and groin. Also, affected skin is often painful but rarely pruritic. Our patient had no mucosal lesions, and his rash was pruritic; thus, pemphigus vulgaris is unlikely.\n\n【16】Dermatitis herpetiformis, another condition characterized by pruritic blistering lesions, usually involves papulovesicles in a herpetiform pattern, distributed symmetrically over the extensor surfaces. Histologically, the demonstration of granular IgA deposits along the subepidermal basement membrane confirms the diagnosis. Although our patient had pruritic blisters, mainly on his forearms and hands, the biopsy specimen showed no IgA deposits; thus, dermatitis herpetiformis is unlikely.\n\n【17】Systemic lupus erythematosus can manifest with bullous skin lesions, which result from toxic necrolysis of the skin. However, the skin manifestations of SLE are not limited to sun-exposed surfaces, and thus SLE would be an unlikely cause in our patient. Porphyria cutanea tarda is usually characterized by the appearance of a blistering, pruritic rash on sun-exposed areas, the differentiating feature from other blistering skin diseases. Hyperpigmented macules, atrophic scarring from previous bullae, and milia can also be seen. In our patient, it was clear that the blistering rash appeared after intense sun exposure and was present only on sun-exposed areas. Thus, we believed a diagnosis of PCT was most likely.\n\n【18】TEN is a possible diagnosis because it usually manifests with dissemination of purpuric macules and blisters on the face and trunk. It is usually drug induced and typically begins 1 to 3 weeks after the initiation of the causative drug or drug metabolite. Our patient did not start any new therapy before the onset of his rash, and thus TEN is unlikely. Because porphyria was suspected based on the history and physical examination findings, further studies were required to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【19】*   2.\n\n【20】    **_Which one of the following is the best initial test to help establish a diagnosis in this patient?_**\n\n【21】    *   a.\n\n【22】        _Measurement of urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) and porphyrins_\n\n【23】    *   b.\n\n【24】        _Measurement of fecal porphyrins_\n\n【25】    *   c.\n\n【26】        _Determination of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) activity_\n\n【27】    *   d.\n\n【28】        _Measurement of plasma porphyrins_\n\n【29】    *   e.\n\n【30】        _Skin biopsy_\n\n【31】The initial test for a suspected diagnosis of porphyria, in both the acute (ie, acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria) and the cutaneous-only (ie, PCT, congenital erythropoietic porphyria, erythropoietic protoporphyria) variants, is a 24-hour urine collection to measure both PBG and porphyrins. In acute porphyria, urinary PBG excretion (>3 times the reference range of 0-0.5 mg/24 h) must be increased substantially before the diagnosis can be considered seriously. In cutaneous-only porphyrias, urinary PBG excretion is normal, whereas uroporphyrin values are increased markedly in both PCT and congenital erythropoietic porphyria.\n\n【32】Measurement of 24-hour fecal porphyrin values is more useful in determining the subtype of porphyria and thus would not be the initial test for diagnostic purposes; however, it would be helpful after porphyria has been diagnosed.\n\n【33】UROD is the enzyme that converts uroporphyrinogen III into coproporphyrinogen III, an important step in the proper formation of heme. This enzyme is defective in PCT, and thus its measurement in erythrocytes is useful in diagnosing PCT; however, it would be inappropriate for the initial diagnosis of porphyria. Furthermore, UROD levels can be normal in certain cases of acquired PCT.\n\n【34】Plasma porphyrins are found in trace amounts in the serum of healthy patients but are increased in patients with cutaneous porphyrias. Although not necessary for diagnosis, measurement of plasma porphyrins is a useful test when porphyria is suspected as a cause of photosensitivity, and it should be used in conjunction with urinalysis because it is both sensitive and specific.\n\n【35】无关删除-2:<u>*   Deacon AC\n*   Elder GH</u>\n\n【36】ACP Best Practice No 165: front line tests for the investigation of suspected porphyria.\n\n【37】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Pathol._ 2001; 54 : 500-507</u></u>\n\n【38】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (106)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【39】In addition, measuring plasma porphyrin levels is a simple strategy for monitoring treatment response. Because skin histopathologic findings in PCT are similar to those in other cutaneous porphyrias and in pseudoporphyria, skin biopsy provides no specific diagnostic confirmation and thus would not be an appropriate initial test.\n\n【40】Therefore, when porphyria is suspected, the initial test is a 24-hour urine collection; however, if the main complaint is related to skin lesions (as in our patient), measurement of plasma porphyrin levels in conjunction with urinary porphyrin levels would be helpful. In our patient, all urinary and plasma porphyrin levels were high; the most notable elevated levels were urinary uroporphyrin at 4168 g/24 h (3-25 g/24 h) and total plasma porphyrin at 16 g/dL (=1 g/dL). Even though PCT was diagnosed, we were concerned that another process might be involved because not all of the patient's clinical signs fit the diagnosis of PCT.\n\n【41】*   3.\n\n【42】    **_Which one of the following clinical signs in our patient is not consistent with his condition?_**\n\n【43】    *   a.\n\n【44】        _Erythematous scaly lesions_\n\n【45】    *   b.\n\n【46】        _Pruritic rash_\n\n【47】    *   c.\n\n【48】        _Abnormal results on liver function tests_\n\n【49】    *   d.\n\n【50】        _Hemorrhagic skin vesicles_\n\n【51】    *   e.\n\n【52】        _Anemia_\n\n【53】Although not a frequent cutaneous manifestation of PCT, diffuse erythema in a photodistributive pattern can be present along with blistering lesions. Minor trauma may cause formation of bullae or denudation of the skin, and previous areas of blisters may appear atrophic, brownish, violaceous, erythematous, and scaly.\n\n【54】A pruritic rash is one of the most common presenting features of PCT, along with blistering lesions. Often, PCT is associated with abnormal results on liver function tests, especially elevated transaminase and ?-glutamyl transpeptidase levels, even in cases not associated with other hepatotoxic conditions. In our patient, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin levels were all mildly elevated at 34 U/L, 1.1 mg/dL, and 0.4 mg/ dL, respectively. The skin vesicles and bullae generally found on patients with PCT bleed occasionally because the skin is friable and fragile; thus, hemorrhagic skin vesicles can be present.\n\n【55】Anemia is not part of the clinical picture of patients with PCT and thus was inconsistent with our patient's presentation. This prompted further investigation.\n\n【56】After confirming that the patient's hemoglobin concentration had decreased from 13.1 to 9.6 g/dL over 2 years, iron studies were performed, which revealed that the anemia, surprisingly, was associated with iron overload; the plasma ferritin level was 390 g/L (20-300 g/L), PCT saturation was greater than 80% (4%-50%), and the plasma iron level was 208 g/dL (50-150 g/dL). This prompted a bone marrow biopsy, which revealed a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), subclassified as refractory anemia and ringed sideroblast. Thus, his underlying MDS was likely contributing to the clinical manifestation of PCT.\n\n【57】*   4.\n\n【58】    **_Which one of the following would not likely be associated with the clinical development of this patient's blistering skin disorder?_**\n\n【59】    *   a.\n\n【60】        _Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection_\n\n【61】    *   b.\n\n【62】        _Eczema_\n\n【63】    *   c.\n\n【64】        _Mutation of the_ HFE _gene_\n\n【65】    *   d.\n\n【66】        _Exposure to hexachlorobenzene_\n\n【67】    *   e.\n\n【68】        _Alcohol abuse_\n\n【69】There is a strong association between PCT and HCV infection.\n\n【70】无关删除-2:<u>*   Fargion S\n*   Piperno A\n*   Cappellini MD\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【71】Hepatitis C virus and porphyria cutanea tarda: evidence of a strong association.\n\n【72】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Hepatology._ 1992; 16 : 1322-1326</u></u>\n\n【73】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (329)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【74】The mechanism by which HCV infection might trigger PCT is unclear, but studies have suggested that the virus may have the ability to release free iron.

At that time, his skin manifestations due to PCT had resolved with strict photoprotection, as well as with topical therapy with Vanicream and triamcinolone. Phlebotomy will be considered in the future when the anemia improves.\n\n【132】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【133】Porphyria cutanea tarda is one of the porphyrias, a hereditary enzyme disorder that affects heme biosynthesis and results in excess accumulation and excretion of porphyrin or porphyrin precursors. The clinical manifestations of porphyrias depend on the type of precursors that accumulate. If the excess is of the early precursor molecules d-aminolevulinic acid or PBG, the manifestations are neuropsychiatric. If the excess is of the distal intermediates (uroporphyrins, coproporphyrins, and protoporphyrins), the manifestations are cutaneous. Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common of the porphyrias and is characterized by chronic blistering lesions that develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin, most commonly the dorsal aspects of the hands, forearms, and legs and the face. The fluid-filled vesicles rupture easily, and the denuded areas become crusted and heal slowly. Small white plaques, termed _milia_ , are also common and may precede or follow vesicle formation. Cutaneous thickening, scarring, and calcification, termed _pseudoscleroderma_ , can sometimes be striking and accompanied by hypertrichosis, hyperpigmentation, and photodamage of the conjunctival sclerae.\n\n【134】The 3 types of PCT that have been defined are types I, II, and III. Type I is the most common, and patients have a “sporadic” form of the disease. Levels of UROD in erythrocytes are normal, whereas those in the liver are decreased during active disease. Type II is the familial type and results from an inherited (autosomal dominant) partial deficiency of UROD. The levels of UROD are decreased in all tissues. Type III is similar to type II except that it occurs in more than 1 family member, and onset of the disease is usually at a younger age. Our patient likely had type III PCT because PCT was later diagnosed in his daughter and one of his uncles. The healthy liver has the ability to promote heme synthesis, even with decreased enzyme activity, and patients can remain asymptomatic until UROD activity diminishes to more than 50% or the liver is injured.\n\n【135】无关删除-2:<u>*   Elder GH</u>\n\n【136】Porphyria cutanea tarda.\n\n【137】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Semin Liver Dis._ 1998; 18 : 67-75</u></u>\n\n【138】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (212)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【139】Various cofactors have been associated with the phenotypic expression of PCT, through either hepatocyte injury or hepatic iron overload. Excess ethanol consumption, HCV infection, human immunodeficiency virus infection, estrogen use, pregnancy, smoking, low vitamin C and E status, chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, hemodialysis, inherited partial deficiency of UROD, and mutations of the _HFE_ gene have all been shown to cause expression of PCT. As would be expected, patients with PCT may have multiple risk factors. In our patient, 3 factors could have contributed to unmasking PCT. First, he was found to be heterozygous for the _HFE_ gene. Second, his lengthy history of smoking could have contributed to a lesser extent to the manifestation of his disease because chemicals in cigarette smoke may contribute to oxidative damage in the liver via induction of cytochrome P-450 enzymes and thus precipitate PCT. Third, our hypothesis is that the underlying MDS could have been the main culprit in the expression of PCT. Ineffective erythropoiesis increases intestinal absorption of iron to the point that patients can have clinical signs of iron overload. For unclear reasons, the degree of iron absorption is much more pronounced with ineffective erythropoiesis than with increased effective erythropoiesis.\n\n【140】无关删除-2:<u>*   Pootrakul P\n*   Kitcharoen K\n*   Yansukon P\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【141】The effect of erythroid hyperplasia on iron balance.\n\n【142】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Blood._ 1988; 71 : 1124-1129</u></u>\n\n【143】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【144】Because the relationship between iron overload and PCT has long been recognized,\n\n【145】无关删除-2:<u>*   Sampietro M\n*   Fiorelli G\n*   Fargion S</u>\n\n【146】Iron overload in porphyria cutanea tarda.\n\n【147】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Haematologica._ 1999; 84 : 248-253</u></u>\n\n【148】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【149】it is reasonable to conclude that MDS in our patient contributed to the manifestation of PCT.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

People who have SCAD often don't have risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes.\n\n【4】SCAD can cause sudden death if it isn't diagnosed and treated promptly. Seek emergency attention if you have heart attack symptoms — even if you think you aren't at risk of a heart attack.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Symptoms of SCAD can include:\n\n【7】*   Chest pain\n*   A rapid heartbeat or fluttery feeling in the chest\n*   Pain in the arms, shoulders, back or jaw\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Sweating\n*   Unusual, extreme tiredness\n*   Nausea\n*   Dizziness\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】If you have chest pain or think you might be having a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only as a last resort.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】The cause of spontaneous coronary artery dissection is unknown.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】Risk factors for SCAD include:\n\n【14】*   **Female sex.** Though SCAD can occur in both men and women, it tends to affect women more than men.\n*   **Childbirth.** Some women who have had SCAD have recently given birth. SCAD has been found to occur most often in the first few weeks after delivery, but it can also occur during pregnancy.\n*   **Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD).** This condition, which causes irregular growth of cells in artery walls, can weaken artery walls, leading to blockages, dissections or aneurysms. It can also cause high blood pressure, stroke and tears in other blood vessels. Women are more likely to have FMD than men.\n*   **Hormone use.** Hormone therapy, such as from oral contraceptives or infertility treatments, has been associated with SCAD.\n*   **Other conditions affecting blood vessels.** Diseases that cause inflammation of the blood vessels, such as lupus and polyarteritis nodosa, also have been associated with SCAD.\n*   **Inherited connective tissue diseases.** Genetic diseases that cause problems with the body's connective tissues, such as vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome, have been found to occur in people who have had SCAD.\n*   **Very high blood pressure.** Severe high blood pressure can be associated with SCAD.\n*   **Illegal drug use.** Using cocaine or other illegal drugs might increase the risk of SCAD.\n\n【15】Some episodes of SCAD have occurred after extreme or intense physical exercise and severe emotional stress.\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】SCAD is a tear inside an artery that carries blood to the heart. When the inner layers of the artery separate from the outer layers, blood can pool in between the layers. The pressure of the pooling blood can make a short tear longer. Blood trapped between the layers can form a blood clot.\n\n【18】SCAD can slow blood flow through the artery, which weakens the heart muscle. Or blood flow through the artery can stop, causing heart muscle to die (heart attack). A heart attack as a result of SCAD is different from a heart attack caused by hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).\n\n【19】SCAD can happen more than once, despite successful treatment, either soon after the first episode or years later. People who have SCAD can also have a higher risk of other heart problems, such as heart failure due to the damage to the heart muscle from heart attacks.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "1187004c-b9e4-4c41-9fe4-c3c35276ddc9", "title": "Tattoo removal", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Tattoo removal is a procedure done to try to remove an unwanted tattoo. Common techniques used for tattoo removal include laser surgery, surgical removal and dermabrasion.\n\n【2】Tattoo ink is placed beneath the top layer of the skin. That makes tattoo removal more complicated — and expensive — than the original tattoo application.\n\n【3】If you're interested in tattoo removal, consult a skin doctor (dermatologist) about the options. Don't attempt tattoo removal on your own. Do-it-yourself tattoo removal creams and other home treatments aren't likely to be effective and can cause skin irritation or other reactions.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】You might consider tattoo removal if you regret a tattoo or you're unhappy with the appearance of your tattoo. Perhaps the tattoo has faded or blurred, or you decide that the tattoo doesn't fit your current image.\n\n【6】Tattoo removal might also be important if you develop an allergic reaction to the tattoo or other complications, such as an infection.\n\n【7】Risks\n-----\n\n【8】Scarring is likely after most types of tattoo removal. Infection or skin discoloration is possible as well.\n\n【9】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【10】If you're considering tattoo removal, consult a dermatologist. He or she can explain the options for tattoo removal and help you choose the method that's most likely to be effective for your tattoo.\n\n【11】For example, some tattoo inks are more responsive to laser treatment than are others. Likewise, small tattoos might be good candidates for surgical removal, while others are simply too large to remove with a scalpel.\n\n【12】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【13】Tattoo removal is often done as an outpatient procedure with local anesthesia. Common techniques for tattoo removal include laser surgery, surgical removal and dermabrasion.\n\n【14】### Laser surgery\n\n【15】Q-switched lasers — which release energy in a single, powerful pulse — are often the treatment of choice for tattoo removal. A special type of laser — called a Q-switched Nd:YAG — might be used on darker skin to avoid changing the skin's pigment permanently.\n\n【16】Before laser treatment, the skin is numbed with an injection of a local anesthetic. Then a powerful pulse of energy is applied to the tattoo to heat and shatter the tattoo ink. Multicolored tattoos might need treatment with various lasers and different wavelengths.\n\n【17】After the procedure, you might notice swelling and possibly blistering or bleeding. Antibacterial ointment can help promote healing. You'll likely need repeated sessions to lighten the tattoo, and it might not be possible to completely erase the tattoo.\n\n【18】### Surgical removal\n\n【19】During surgical removal, the skin is numbed with an injection of a local anesthetic. The tattoo is removed with a scalpel, and the edges of skin are stitched back together. After the procedure, antibacterial ointment helps promote healing.\n\n【20】Surgical tattoo removal is effective — but it leaves a scar and might be practical only for small tattoos.\n\n【21】### Dermabrasion\n\n【22】During dermabrasion, the tattooed area is typically chilled until numb. Then the tattooed skin is sanded down to deeper levels with a high-speed rotary device that has an abrasive wheel or brush. This allows the tattoo ink to leach out of the skin.\n\n【23】The affected area feels sore and raw for several days after the procedure. Recovery can take up to two to three weeks. Due to unpredictable results and less effective outcomes than laser or a combination of laser and excision, dermabrasion isn't a common choice.\n\n【24】Results\n-------\n\n【25】Tattoos are meant to be permanent, and complete tattoo removal is difficult. Some degree of scarring or skin color variation is likely to remain, regardless of the specific method of tattoo removal.\n\n【26】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

We used multivariate and univariate analyses to compare the exercisers with sedentary women on fitness, physical activity, and questionnaire measures of body esteem and mood. Analyses were repeated after the 2 groups were subdivided by age (<50 years vs ≥50 years).\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Regular exercisers (mean ± SD age, 54.57± 9.18 years) reported significantly more positive attitudes toward their physical condition and sexual attractiveness; significantly less confusion, fatigue, depression, and total mood disturbance; and higher vigor than sedentary women (mean ± SD age, 52.33±9.11 years). Both younger and older exercisers had higher physical condition scores than their sedentary peers. Older exercisers reported higher vigor and less confusion, anger, fatigue, depression, and total mood disturbance than sedentary women, regardless of age. Younger exercisers reported higher vigor than their sedentary peers and less confusion than older sedentary women.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】In this largely white sample of well-educated women, breast cancer survivors who exercised (particularly older women) reported higher body esteem and better mood than sedentary breast cancer survivors.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】BMI ( body mass index ), MANOVA ( multivariate analysis of variance ), POMS ( Profile of Mood States )\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Because of its varied clinical symptoms and the absence of lymphadenopathy, diagnosis of IVL is extremely difficult and requires histological confirmation. We report here 6 consecutive patients with IVL, admitted to Kameda General Hospital, Kamogawa-shi, Japan, from June 7, 2006, to February 28, 2007, whose IVL was diagnosed by random skin biopsy of healthy-appearing skin. Three patients presented with progressive neurological deterioration and 2 others with hypoxemia with interstitial infiltration on chest radiography. One patient presented with confusion and severe hypoxia without apparent interstitial infiltration. Two patients showed localized skin involvement. Irrespective of the presence of skin lesions, almost all skin biopsy specimens showed obliteration of small vessels of subcutaneous fat tissues by lymphoma cells, allowing a prompt diagnosis of IVL. Early institution of rituximab-based chemotherapy induced favorable responses in all patients treated. Because diagnosis based on tissue other than skin is usually difficult in patients with suspected IVL, random skin biopsy should be considered even in patients with no evident skin lesions.\n\n【1】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "87e1dbb0-41d7-4c52-a169-8d1d8980431c", "title": "Propranolol (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Propranolol (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Hemangeol\n2.  Inderal\n3.  Inderal LA\n4.  Inderal XL\n5.  InnoPran XL\n6.  Propranolol HCl Intensol\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Propranolol is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure may reduce the risk of stroke and heart attacks.\n\n【6】Propranolol is also used to treat severe chest pain (angina), migraine headaches, or hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (thickened heart muscle).\n\n【7】This medicine may also be used to treat irregular heartbeats, tremors, or pheochromocytoma (adrenal gland tumor). It may also be used to reduce the risk of death in patients who have heart attacks.\n\n【8】Propranolol oral solution is used to treat proliferating infantile hemangioma.\n\n【9】This medicine is a beta-blocker. It works by affecting the response to nerve impulses in certain parts of the body, like the heart. As a result, the heart beats slower and decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen is increased to the heart.\n\n【10】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【11】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【12】*   Capsule, Extended Release\n*   Solution\n*   Tablet\n\n【13】Before Using\n------------\n\n【14】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【15】### Allergies\n\n【16】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【17】### Pediatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of propranolol capsules, extended-release capsules, and tablets in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【19】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of propranolol oral solution in children.\n\n【20】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of propranolol oral solution to treat proliferating infantile hemangioma in children 5 weeks to 5 months of age. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children older than 1 year of age.\n\n【21】### Geriatric\n\n【22】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of propranolol in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving propranolol.\n\n【23】No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of propranolol oral solution in geriatric patients.\n\n【24】### Breastfeeding\n\n【25】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【26】### Drug Interactions\n\n【27】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

{"seq_id": "794ab226-0804-41fb-bc67-d26fa709de54", "title": "Thoracic outlet syndrome", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a group of disorders that occur when blood vessels or nerves in the space between your collarbone and your first rib (thoracic outlet) are compressed. This can cause shoulder and neck pain and numbness in your fingers.\n\n【2】Common causes of thoracic outlet syndrome include physical trauma from a car accident, repetitive injuries from job- or sports-related activities, certain anatomical defects (such as having an extra rib), and pregnancy. Sometimes doctors don't know the cause of thoracic outlet syndrome.\n\n【3】Treatment for thoracic outlet syndrome usually involves physical therapy and pain relief measures. Most people improve with these treatments. In some cases, however, your doctor may recommend surgery.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】There are three general types of thoracic outlet syndrome:\n\n【6】*   **Neurogenic (neurologic) thoracic outlet syndrome.** This most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome is characterized by compression of the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that come from your spinal cord and control muscle movements and sensation in your shoulder, arm and hand.\n*   **Venous thoracic outlet syndrome.** This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one or more of the veins under the collarbone (clavicle) are compressed, resulting in blood clots.\n*   **Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome.** This is the least common type of TOS. It occurs when one of the arteries under the collarbone is compressed, resulting in bulging of the artery, also known as an aneurysm.\n\n【7】It's possible to have a mix of the three different types of thoracic outlet syndrome, with multiple parts of the thoracic outlet being compressed.\n\n【8】Thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary depending on the type. When nerves are compressed, signs and symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include:\n\n【9】*   Numbness or tingling in your arm or fingers\n*   Pain or aches in your neck, shoulder, arm or hand\n*   Weakening grip\n\n【10】Signs and symptoms of venous thoracic outlet syndrome can include:\n\n【11】*   Discoloration of your hand (bluish color)\n*   Arm pain and swelling\n*   Blood clot in veins in the upper area of your body\n*   Arm fatigue with activity\n*   Paleness or abnormal color in one or more fingers or your hand\n*   Throbbing lump near your collarbone\n\n【12】Signs and symptoms of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome can include:\n\n【13】*   Cold fingers, hands or arms\n*   Hand and arm pain\n*   Lack of color (pallor) or bluish discoloration (cyanosis) in one or more of your fingers or your entire hand\n*   Weak or no pulse in the affected arm\n\n【14】### When to see a doctor\n\n【15】See your doctor if you consistently experience any of the signs and symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome.\n\n【16】Causes\n------\n\n【17】Thoracic outlet syndrome is usually caused by compression of the nerves or blood vessels in the thoracic outlet, just under your collarbone (clavicle). The cause of the compression varies and can include:\n\n【18】*   **Anatomical defects.** Inherited defects that are present at birth (congenital) may include an extra rib located above the first rib (cervical rib) or an abnormally tight fibrous band connecting your spine to your rib.\n*   **Poor posture.** Drooping your shoulders or holding your head in a forward position can cause compression in the thoracic outlet area.\n*   **Trauma.** A traumatic event, such as a car accident, can cause internal changes that then compress the nerves in the thoracic outlet. The onset of symptoms related to a traumatic accident often is delayed.\n\n【19】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【20】There are several factors that seem to increase the risk of thoracic outlet syndrome, including:\n\n【21】*   **Sex.** Females are greater than three times more likely to be diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome than are males.\n*   **Age.** Thoracic outlet syndrome may occur at any age but is most commonly diagnosed in adults between the ages of 20 and 50.\n\n【22】Complications\n-------------\n\n【23】Complications from this condition stem from the type of presentation (neurogenic, venous or arterial). For patients with venous or arterial TOS, it is important to seek urgent medical attention to make the correct diagnosis and implement appropriate treatment. For neurogenic TOS, it is important to seek medical attention with appropriate evaluation and testing.\n\n【24】Prevention\n----------\n\n【25】If you're at risk for thoracic outlet compression, avoid repetitive movements and lifting heavy objects. If you're overweight, losing weight may help you prevent or relieve symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome.\n\n【26】Even if you don't have symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome, avoid carrying heavy bags over your shoulder, because this can increase pressure on the thoracic outlet. Stretch daily, and perform exercises that keep your shoulder muscles strong.\n\n【27】Daily stretches focusing on the chest, neck and shoulders can help improve shoulder muscle strength and prevent thoracic outlet syndrome.\n\n【28】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

First, establishments must “\\[r\\]emove and implant the HCT/Ps into the same individual from whom they were removed (autologous use).” Second, establishments must “implant the HCT/Ps within the same surgical procedure.” Third, the HCT/Ps must “remain ‘such HCT/Ps;’ they are in their original form.” The guidance document identifies “rinsing, cleansing, or sizing” and “shaping” as acceptable actions. Other processing steps, “even manufacturing steps considered minimal manipulation” elsewhere within 21 CFR 1271(a), will typically cause the HCT/P to no longer be “such HCT/P.”\n\n【81】The interpretation of 1271.15(b) provided in the draft guidance resembles previous responses provided by the FDA’s Tissue Reference Group when asked whether the production of SVF falls within the scope of the exception.\n\n【82】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lazarus E.</u>\n\n【83】Letter to Mitchell S.

Physicians who market and administer adipose-derived autologous “stem cell” interventions while claiming they are at liberty to engage in the “practice of medicine” without having to comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 1271 appear to be incorrect.\n\n【93】The draft guidance, though it does “not establish legally enforceable responsibilities,” clarifies the FDA’s interpretation of the exception identified in 21 CFR 1271.15(b). The FDA has made it clear that it “considers the same surgical procedure exception to be a narrow exception to regulation under Part 1271.”\n\n【94】In addition to failing to operate within the exception identified in 21 CFR 1271.14(b), clinics advertising adipose-derived stem cell therapies do not appear to meet the standard for what are often referred to as “361 products.” Such cells, tissues, and cellular-and-tissue–based interventions must comply with 21 CFR 1271 and section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to develop regulations intended to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.) However, they do not require premarketing review and approval by the FDA. In contrast, “section 351 products” fall under the scope of section 351 of the Public Health Service Act; are regulated as drugs, biologic products, or medical devices; and require premarketing approval by the FDA. Two additional new draft guidance documents help distinguish stem cell interventions requiring premarketing approval by the FDA from HCT/Ps that do not need to go through the premarketing approval process.\n\n【95】### 21 CFR 1271.10 and 1271.20\n\n【96】According to 21 CFR 1271.10, autologous HCT/Ps are “regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act” and applicable components of 21 CFR 1271 only if they are “minimally manipulated,” “intended for homologous use only, as reflected by the labeling, advertising, or other indications of the manufacturer’s objective intent;” and “\\[t\\]he manufacture of the HCT/P does not involve the combination of the cells or tissues with another article, except for water, crystalloids, or a sterilizing, preserving, or storage agent,” provided that the addition of such agents “does not raise new clinical safety concerns with respect to the HCT/P.”\n\n【97】Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Establishment Registration and Listing, Final Rule.\n\n【98】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Fed Regist._ January 19, 2001; 66 ( Accessed February 2, 2015 ) : 5447-5469</u></u>\n\n【99】删除3:<u>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2001-01-19/pdf/01-1126.pdf</u>\n\n【100】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【101】However, in several warning letters, the FDA has stated that it regards the processing steps used to produce SVF from lipoaspirate as falling outside the minimal manipulation standard as it is defined in 21 CFR 1271.\n\n【102】无关删除-2:<u>*   Malarkey M.A.</u>\n\n【103】Warning letter to Dr. Steven Victor, Chief Executive Officer, IntelliCell Biosciences Inc.\n\n【104】Public Health Service, Food and Drug Administration , Rockville, MD March 13, 2012\n\n【105】删除3:<u>http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2012/ucm297245.htm</u>\n\n【106】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【107】无关删除-2:<u>*   Malarkey M.A.</u>\n\n【108】Warning letter to Thomas E.

Rather, they must submit Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption applications to the FDA and conduct safety and efficacy trials before seeking premarketing approval. Companies conducting clinical studies under FDA-cleared Investigational New Drugs or Investigational Device Exemptions cannot remain compliant with federal regulations while also advertising and profiting from the sale of investigational agents of unknown safety and efficacy.\n\n【119】### “Minimal Manipulation”: A Second New Draft Guidance Document Addressing the Regulation of HCT/Ps\n\n【120】In December 2014, the FDA released a draft guidance document titled “Minimal Manipulation of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products.”\n\n【121】Minimal Manipulation of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.

(21 CFR 1271 states that in the case of structural tissue, minimal manipulation is “processing that does not alter the original relevant characteristics of the tissue related to the tissue’s utility for reconstruction, repair, or replacement.”) According to the draft guidance: “If you isolate cells from structural tissue, you should apply the definition of minimal manipulation for structural tissue.” Providing an example of how the definition is applied, the draft guidance adds: Original relevant characteristics of adipose tissue, a structural tissue, to pad and cushion against shocks generally includes its bulk and lipid storage capacity. A manufacturer recovers adipose tissue by tumescent liposuction and processes the adipose tissue to isolate cellular components, commonly referred to as stromal vascular fraction, which is considered a potential source of adipose-derived stromal/stem cells. The HCT/P is generally considered more than minimally manipulated because the processing breaks down and eliminates the structural components that provide cushioning and support, thereby altering the original relevant characteristics of the HCT/P relating to its utility for reconstruction, repair, or replacement.\n\n【125】This draft guidance document states that SVF produced from processed fat tissue does not meet the definition of minimally manipulated structural tissue because the “original relevant characteristics” of fat tissue are changed when lipoaspirate is processed and its cellular components are isolated in the form of SVF. As a result, autologous SVF is classified as an HCT/P “regulated as a drug, device, and/or biological product” and requiring premarketing approval by the FDA.\n\n【126】### HCT/Ps from Adipose Tissue: A Third New Draft Guidance\n\n【127】After the release of the 2 preceding guidance documents, in late December 2014 the FDA issued a third draft guidance document concerning HCT/Ps. This document titled “Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps) from Adipose Tissue: Regulatory Considerations” also states that when the FDA applies 21 CFR 1271 to processing of fat tissue, “\\[p\\]rocessing to isolate non-adipocyte or nonstructural components from adipose tissue (with or without subsequent cell culture or expansion) is generally considered more than minimal manipulation.”\n\n【128】*   Human Cells\n\n【129】Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps) From Adipose Tissue: Regulatory Considerations; Draft Guidance for Industry.\n\n【130】Food and Drug Administration , Rockville, MD December 2014\n\n【131】删除3:<u>http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Tissue/ucm427795.htm</u>\n\n【132】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【133】删除3:<u>The draft guidance proceeds to offer numerous examples concerning how the FDA proposes to regulate HCT/Ps obtained from adipose tissue.

These clinics do not appear to operate in compliance with federal regulations. By failing to establish the safety and efficacy of their stem cell–based medical products in FDA-cleared and institutional review board–approved clinical trials, they are exposing their patients to unnecessary risks and charging substantial fees for medical products that are not approved by the FDA.\n\n【136】Given the significant revenues that can be generated from direct-to-consumer marketing of putative stem cell treatments, clinics engaging in such commercial activity are unlikely to cease operating simply because the FDA has released 3 new draft guidances or proceeds to issue final guidance documents. Even before the release of these draft guidances, such businesses were advertising cell-based interventions that put them at risk of being inspected and possibly subjected to regulatory action by the FDA. Although useful, the draft guidance documents alone are unlikely to have a meaningful deterrent effect. Instead, the FDA must now proceed to the challenging task of enforcing regulatory compliance in a rapidly expanding marketplace where many businesses appear to operate in noncompliance with federal regulations while profiting from the sale of unproven and unlicensed cell-based interventions. Given the number of US clinics now marketing adipose-derived autologous “stem cell treatments,” it is going to require considerable effort by the FDA to promote improved regulatory compliance.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

In one-third of these cases, a fellow member of the health care team initiated the charges against the physician. In this commentary, I intend to explore the implications of another question from the survey—one about humor and its double-edged qualities in the end-of-life setting. I will then speculate as to why accusations of hastening death are occurring and specifically why medical colleagues are charging physicians on their team with engaging in this practice.\n\n【16】We asked all 633 respondents, “In the last year, how often have any of the following people ‘humorously’ referred to you as promoting death, for example by calling you ‘Dr Death’?” The survey's completion rate was 53%, the median age of the respondents was 50 years, and most (78%) were attending physicians. Nearly three-quarters of the sample (72%) reported having been the object of humorous comments at least once during the prior year. As illustrated in the Figure , most of the respondents reported that these remarks came from fellow physicians (59%), although comments also came from other health care professionals (49%), the participants' own friends or family members (47%), patients' family or friends (31%), and patients (21%).\n\n【17】FIGURE Data about humorous accusations from a survey of 633 palliative care specialists regarding accusations of hastening a patient’s death.\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【19】Such jibes are not usually meant to be offensive, and each specialty in medicine is the target of some form of gallows humor. Like swearing, humor during private discourse can signal confederacy, intimacy, or understanding, while simultaneously purging negative emotions. Freud wrote extensively about jokes, maintaining that they are a means by which forbidden thoughts and feelings that society suppresses are introduced into the conscious mind.\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>*   Freud S.</u>\n\n【21】Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious.\n\n【22】WW Norton , New York, NY 1960\n\n【23】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【24】He proposed a number of interpretations to understand humor, including that wit contains and denatures a tremendous amount of hostility, laughter provides emotional catharsis, and jokes reveal more about societal attitudes at a particular time than about the particular individuals at which they are directed. Like the survey results, what jokes illustrate about medical society is that doctors and nurses are members of a pluralistic culture that clearly contains within it conflicting beliefs about end-of-life care, specifically hastening death.\n\n【25】When it comes to end-of-life care, I find an important insight contained in Woody Allen's quip, “I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to achieve it through not dying.” Fear of death is basic to the human condition, and this same anxiety no doubt underlies many of our colleagues' comments. However, Burt\n\n【26】无关删除-2:<u>*   Burt R.A.</u>\n\n【27】Death Is That Man Taking Names: Intersections of American Medicine, Law, and Culture.\n\n【28】University of California Press , Berkeley, CA 2002\n\n【29】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【30】has suggested a more dire explanation. He hypothesizes that in Western cultural tradition, including medicine, death is not merely a fearful event but one that invariably carries with it an aura of wrongfulness and intrinsic immorality. Burt explains that choosing death through physician-patient decisions to discontinue or withhold life-prolonging treatments is “emotionally” experienced as a “murderous” hastening of death. He believes that it is virtually impossible to disentangle beneficent and aggressive motives in any individual case and that an intrinsic tension or ambivalence always accompanies such practices.\n\n【31】Most clinicians who care for dying patients would take umbrage at the suggestion that they actually kill patients. Palliative medicine philosophically relies on Thomas Aquinas' principle of double effect (it may be permissible to bring about as a foreseeable side effect a harmful event that would be impermissible to cause intentionally, particularly when the potential benefit outweighs the side effect's harm).\n\n【32】无关删除-2:<u>*   Burt R.A.</u>\n\n【33】Death Is That Man Taking Names: Intersections of American Medicine, Law, and Culture.\n\n【34】University of California Press , Berkeley, CA 2002\n\n【35】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【36】It takes the position that shortening the process of dying (eg, through suppressing respiration) to ameliorate terminal suffering is entirely justifiable.

The lower courts have decreed that the physicians must seek approval from Ontario's Consent and Capacity Board, an independent, extramedical tribunal that reviews and makes decisions on behalf of people who cannot act for themselves.\n\n【83】Can the involvement of the legal system be avoided? Treating accusations as risk management phenomena and robustly managing them by paying greater attention to communication and conscientious documentation can ameliorate, but not entirely forestall, dissension among health care professionals. Vigorously investigating and exposing sources of disagreement among stakeholders on the health care team can help these conflicts to be addressed within hospital walls. Hospitals can create multiple avenues—e-mails, voice mails, meetings—for staff to express concerns about patient care (a practice that is always preferable to staff members calling the local district attorney). There should be a low threshold for allowing and requesting ethics consultations, while grand rounds and other academic forums can deliberately present controversial topics to make the “hidden curriculum” point that it is acceptable to have and air differing views.\n\n【84】Although our survey spotlights accusations made against medical staff, concerns about the possibility of criminal or civil litigation should not become an excuse for treatment on demand, overtreatment of catastrophically ill patients, undertreatment of pain, or denial of directives requesting a shift from curative to palliative care.\n\n【85】无关删除-2:<u>*   Berge K.H.\n*   Maiers D.R.\n*   Schreiner D.P.\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【86】Resource utilization and outcome in gravely ill intensive care unit patients with predicted in-hospital mortality rates of 95% or higher by APACHE III scores: the relationship with physician and family expectations.\n\n【87】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2005; 80 : 166-173</u></u>\n\n【88】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (28)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【89】Even in the face of potential accusations of euthanasia or murder, clinicians ought not to be bullied into compromising their management of dying patients and won't be if they know their institution has protocols for dealing with accusations when they arise.\n\n【90】I want to reemphasize that the diverse opinions that medical staff hold about terminal care may reflect doctors' and nurses' international origins, as well as wide-ranging religious beliefs within American society. Furthermore, our pluralistic society maintains and respects these differing views. Even though the palliative medicine ethos is the current, predominant philosophy in American hospitals, it is important to appreciate that health care personnel who misunderstand clinical decisions or take offense with them can produce harmful allegations and generate distressing investigations. Medical staff have different faiths, backgrounds, and countries of origin, and all of these factors may contribute to these clinical disagreements. We live and work together in a pluralistic society that hopefully accepts and respects differing views.\n\n【91】Although caring for dying patients is always a serious matter, it would be a mistake to conclude that physicians ought to cease joking about death with their colleagues. Freud's understanding of humor seems newly trenchant. Levity must remain an acceptable defense mechanism in medicine for coping with the weightiest of medical duties: helping patients to die with grace and dignity.\n\n【92】无关删除-2:<u>*   Olsen M.L.\n*   Swetz K.M.\n*   Mueller P.S.</u>\n\n【93】Ethical decision making with end-of-life care: palliative sedation and withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments.\n\n【94】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2010; 85 : 949-954</u></u>\n\n【95】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (79)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【96】无关删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【97】无关删除-1:<u>I would like to acknowledge the efforts of my research coinvestigators: Stephen Arons, JD; Linda Ganzini, MD, MPH; Elizabeth Goy, PhD; Robert Arnold, MD; and Nathan E.

This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of amcinonide topical in the pediatric population. However, because of this medicine's toxicity, it should be used with caution. Children may absorb large amounts through the skin, which can cause serious side effects. If your child is using this medicine, follow your doctor's instructions very carefully.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of amcinonide topical in geriatric patients.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【23】### Other Interactions\n\n【24】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【25】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【26】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【27】*   Cushing's syndrome (adrenal gland disorder) or\n*   Diabetes or\n*   Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) or\n*   Intracranial hypertension (increased pressure in the head)—Use with caution.

Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【31】*   Diabetic ketoacidosis (too much acid in the blood) or\n*   Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)—Should not be used in patients with these conditions. If you have low blood sugar and take insulin, your blood sugar may reach dangerously low levels.\n\n【32】*   Hypokalemia (low potassium in the blood)—May make this condition worse and increase your chance of having serious side effects.\n\n【33】*   Infection or any illness or\n*   Stress (eg, physical or emotional)—These conditions increase blood sugar and may increase the amount of insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart combination you need.\n\n【34】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Effects of insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart combination may be increased because of the slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【35】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【36】A nurse or other trained health professional may give you this medicine. You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. This medicine is given as a shot under your skin.\n\n【37】Always double-check both the concentration (strength) of your insulin and your dose. Concentration and dose are not the same. The dose is how many units of insulin you will use. The concentration tells how many units of insulin are in each milliliter (mL), such as 100 units/mL (U-100), but this does not mean you will use 100 units at a time.\n\n【38】Each package of insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart combination contains a patient information sheet. Read this sheet carefully before beginning your treatment and each time you refill the medicine for any new information, and make sure you understand:\n\n【39】*   How to prepare the medicine.\n*   How to inject the medicine.\n*   How to use a disposable insulin delivery device.\n*   How to dispose of syringes, needles, and injection devices.\n\n【40】It is best to use a different place on the body for each injection (eg, under the skin of your abdomen or stomach, thigh, buttocks, or upper arm). Do not use the exact same spot for each injection. If you have questions about this, contact a member of your health care team.\n\n【41】When used as a mealtime insulin, this insulin combination should be taken within 15 minutes before a meal. If you have type 2 diabetes, you can use this medicine after meals.\n\n【42】Use a new needle for the FlexPen® each time you give yourself an injection. Always remove and throw the needle after each injection from the pen. Store it without a needle attached.\n\n【43】Carefully follow the special meal plan your doctor gave you. This is the most important part of controlling your condition and is necessary if the medicine is to work properly. Also, exercise regularly and test for sugar in your blood or urine as directed.\n\n【44】You should never mix insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart combination with other insulin injections without checking first with your doctor. These injections are usually done separately. Also, this medicine should not be used in an insulin infusion pump. If you have questions about this, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【45】Do not change the brand, type, or dose of your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. When you receive a new supply of insulin, check the label to be sure if it is the correct type of insulin.\n\n【46】### Dosing\n\n【47】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【48】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【49】*   For injection dosage form:\n    *   For diabetes mellitus:\n        *   Adults—The dose is based on your blood sugar and must be determined by your doctor.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【50】### Missed Dose\n\n【51】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【52】### Storage\n\n【53】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【54】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【55】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【56】Store insulin containers that have not been opened in the refrigerator in the original carton until the expiration date. Do not freeze. Do not use the insulin if it has been frozen. You may also store the unopened cartridge or FlexPen® at room temperature for up to 14 days, or the unopened vials at room temperature for up to 28 days.\n\n【57】Store the opened vial of insulin in the refrigerator. Do not freeze. If you cannot keep your vial of insulin in the refrigerator, you may store it at room temperature in a cool place, away from direct heat and light, for only 28 days.\n\n【58】The cartridge and pen you are currently using should not be refrigerated. You should store the cartridge or pen at room temperature in a cool place away from direct heat and light, for only 14 days.\n\n【59】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【60】Never share insulin pens or cartridges with others under any circumstances. It is not safe for one pen to be used for more than one person. Sharing needles or pens can result in transmission of hepatitis viruses, HIV, or other bloodborne illnesses.\n\n【61】Your doctor will want to check your progress at regular visits, especially during the first few weeks that you take this medicine. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【62】It is very important to follow carefully any instructions from your health care team about:\n\n【63】*   Alcohol—Drinking alcohol (including beer and wine) may cause severe low blood sugar. Discuss this with your health care team.\n*   Other medicines—Do not take other medicines during the time you are using this medicine unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription medicines such as aspirin, and medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems.\n*   Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, patients with diabetes may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur in patients with diabetes during pregnancy.\n*   Travel—Keep a recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.\n\n【64】In case of emergency: There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to:\n\n【65】*   Wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says that you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.\n*   Keep an extra supply of insulin and syringes with needles or injection devices on hand in case high blood sugar occurs.\n*   Keep some kind of quick-acting sugar handy to treat low blood sugar.\n*   Have a glucagon kit and a syringe and needle available in case severe low blood sugar occurs. Check and replace any expired kits regularly.\n\n【66】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after you get the injection.\n\n【67】You may have some skin redness, rash, itching, or swelling at the injection site. If this irritation is severe or does not go away, call your doctor. Do not inject this medicine into a skin area that is red, swollen, or itchy.\n\n【68】Using this medicine together with other diabetes medicine (eg, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, Actos®, Actoplus Met®, Avandia®) may cause serious heart problems or edema (fluid retention). Check with your doctor immediately if you are rapidly gaining weight, having shortness of breath, chest pain or discomfort, extreme tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, uneven heartbeat, or excessive swelling of the hands, wrist, ankles, or feet.\n\n【69】Too much insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart combination can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Low blood sugar also can occur if you use insulin aspart with another antidiabetic medicine, changes in insulin regimen (eg, insulin strength, type of insulin, injection site), delay or miss a meal or snack, exercise more than usual, drink alcohol, or cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting or have diarrhea. Low blood sugar must be treated before it causes you to pass out (unconsciousness). People feel different symptoms of low blood sugar. It is important that you learn which symptoms you usually have so you can treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat low blood sugar.\n\n【70】If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel to relieve the symptoms. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Go to a doctor or a hospital right away if the symptoms do not improve. Someone should call for emergency help immediately if severe symptoms such as convulsions (seizures) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe and needle, and know how to use it. Members of your household also should know how to use it.\n\n【71】Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your medicine, changes in insulin regimen, overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual. High blood sugar can be very serious and must be treated right away. It is important that you learn which symptoms you have in order to treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat high blood sugar.\n\n【72】Symptoms of high blood sugar include blurred vision, drowsiness, dry mouth, flushed, dry skin, fruit-like breath odor, increased urination, ketones in the urine, loss of appetite, stomachache, nausea, or vomiting, tiredness, troubled breathing (rapid and deep), unconsciousness, or unusual thirst. If these symptoms occur, check your blood sugar level and call your doctor for instructions.\n\n【73】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【74】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【75】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【76】#### More common\n\n【77】1.  Anxiety\n2.  blurred vision\n3.  burning, tingling, numbness or pain in the hands, arms, feet, or legs\n4.  chills\n5.  cold sweats\n6.  confusion\n7.  cool, pale skin\n8.  depression\n9.  difficulty with breathing\n10.  dizziness\n11.  fast heartbeat\n12.  headache\n13.  increased hunger\n14.  loss of consciousness\n15.  nausea\n16.  nervousness\n17.  nightmares\n18.  seizures\n19.  sensation of pins and needles\n20.  shakiness\n21.  slurred speech\n22.  stabbing pain\n23.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n\n【78】#### Incidence not known\n\n【79】1.

Genes that don't work properly can cause disease.\n\n【3】Gene therapy replaces a faulty gene or adds a new gene in an attempt to cure disease or improve your body's ability to fight disease. Gene therapy holds promise for treating a wide range of diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, heart disease, diabetes, hemophilia and AIDS.\n\n【4】Researchers are still studying how and when to use gene therapy. Currently, in the United States, gene therapy is available only as part of a clinical trial.\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】Gene therapy is used to correct defective genes in order to cure a disease or help your body better fight disease.\n\n【7】Researchers are investigating several ways to do this, including:\n\n【8】*   **Replacing mutated genes.** Some cells become diseased because certain genes work incorrectly or no longer work at all. Replacing the defective genes may help treat certain diseases. For instance, a gene called p53 normally prevents tumor growth. Several types of cancer have been linked to problems with the p53 gene. If doctors could replace the defective p53 gene, that might trigger the cancer cells to die.\n*   **Fixing mutated genes.** Mutated genes that cause disease could be turned off so that they no longer promote disease, or healthy genes that help prevent disease could be turned on so that they could inhibit the disease.\n*   **Making diseased cells more evident to the immune system.** In some cases, your immune system doesn't attack diseased cells because it doesn't recognize them as intruders. Doctors could use gene therapy to train your immune system to recognize the cells that are a threat.\n\n【9】Risks\n-----\n\n【10】Gene therapy has some potential risks. A gene can't easily be inserted directly into your cells. Rather, it usually has to be delivered using a carrier, called a vector.\n\n【11】The most common gene therapy vectors are viruses because they can recognize certain cells and carry genetic material into the cells' genes. Researchers remove the original disease-causing genes from the viruses, replacing them with the genes needed to stop disease.\n\n【12】This technique presents the following risks:\n\n【13】*   **Unwanted immune system reaction.** Your body's immune system may see the newly introduced viruses as intruders and attack them. This may cause inflammation and, in severe cases, organ failure.\n*   **Targeting the wrong cells.** Because viruses can affect more than one type of cells, it's possible that the altered viruses may infect additional cells — not just the targeted cells containing mutated genes. If this happens, healthy cells may be damaged, causing other illness or diseases, such as cancer.\n*   **Infection caused by the virus.** It's possible that once introduced into the body, the viruses may recover their original ability to cause disease.\n*   **Possibility of causing a tumor.** If the new genes get inserted in the wrong spot in your DNA, there is a chance that the insertion might lead to tumor formation.\n\n【14】The gene therapy clinical trials underway in the U.S. are closely monitored by the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health to ensure that patient safety issues are a top priority during research.\n\n【15】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【16】Currently, the only way for you to receive gene therapy is to participate in a clinical trial. Clinical trials are research studies that help doctors determine whether a gene therapy approach is safe for people. They also help doctors understand the effects of gene therapy on the body.\n\n【17】Your specific procedure will depend on the disease you have and the type of gene therapy being used.\n\n【18】For example, in one type of gene therapy:\n\n【19】*   You may have blood drawn or you may need bone marrow removed from your hipbone with a large needle.\n*   Then, in a lab, cells from the blood or bone marrow are exposed to a virus or another type of vector that contains the desired genetic material.\n*   Once the vector has entered the cells in the lab, those cells are injected back into your body into a vein or into tissue, where your cells take up the vector along with the altered genes.\n\n【20】Viruses aren't the only vectors that can be used to carry altered genes into your body's cells. Other vectors being studied in clinical trials include:\n\n【21】*   **Stem cells.** Stem cells are the cells from which all other cells in your body are created. For gene therapy, stem cells can be trained in a lab to become cells that can help fight disease.\n*   **Liposomes.** These fatty particles have the ability to carry the new, therapeutic genes to the target cells and pass the genes into your cells' DNA.\n\n【22】Results\n-------\n\n【23】The possibilities of gene therapy hold much promise. Clinical trials of gene therapy in people have shown some success in treating certain diseases, such as:\n\n【24】*   Severe combined immune deficiency\n*   Hemophilia\n*   Blindness caused by retinitis pigmentosa\n*   Leukemia\n\n【25】But several significant barriers stand in the way of gene therapy becoming a reliable form of treatment, including:\n\n【26】*   Finding a reliable way to get genetic material into cells\n*   Targeting the correct cells\n*   Reducing the risk of side effects\n\n【27】Gene therapy continues to be a very important and active area of research aimed at developing new, effective treatments for a variety of diseases.\n\n【28】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "a594f1e9-271d-4656-9990-f593ae3e3d50", "title": "Eye floaters", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Eye floaters are spots in your vision. They may look to you like black or gray specks, strings, or cobwebs. They may drift about when you move your eyes. Floaters appear to dart away when you try to look at them directly.\n\n【2】Most eye floaters are caused by age-related changes that occur as the jelly-like substance (vitreous) inside your eyes liquifies and contracts. Scattered clumps of collagen fibers form within the vitreous and can cast tiny shadows on your retina. The shadows you see are called floaters.\n\n【3】If you notice a sudden increase in eye floaters, contact an eye specialist immediately — especially if you also see light flashes or lose your vision. These can be symptoms of an emergency that requires prompt attention.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Symptoms of eye floaters may include:\n\n【6】*   Small shapes in your vision that appear as dark specks or knobby, transparent strings of floating material\n*   Spots that move when you move your eyes, so when you try to look at them, they move quickly out of your line of vision\n*   Spots that are most noticeable when you look at a plain bright background, such as a blue sky or a white wall\n*   Small shapes or strings that eventually settle down and drift out of the line of vision\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Contact an eye specialist immediately if you notice:\n\n【9】*   Many more eye floaters than usual\n*   A sudden onset of new floaters\n*   Flashes of light in the same eye as the floaters\n*   A gray curtain or blurry area that blocks part of your vision\n*   Darkness on a side or sides of your vision (peripheral vision loss)\n\n【10】These painless symptoms could be caused by a retinal tear, with or without a retinal detachment. This is a sight-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】Eye floaters may be caused by vitreous changes related to aging or from other diseases or conditions:\n\n【13】*   **Age-related eye changes.** The vitreous is a jelly-like substance made primarily of water, collagen (a type of protein) and hyaluronan (a type of carbohydrate). The vitreous fills the space in your eye between the lens and retina and helps the eye maintain its round shape.\n\n【14】    As you age, the vitreous changes. Over time, it liquifies and contracts — a process that causes it to pull away from the eyeball's inside surface.\n\n【15】    As the vitreous changes, collagen fibers within the vitreous form clumps and strings. These scattered pieces block some of the light passing through the eye. This casts tiny shadows on your retina that are seen as floaters.\n\n【16】*   **Inflammation in the back of the eye.** Uveitis is inflammation in the middle layer of tissue in the eye wall (uvea). Posterior uveitis affects the back of the eye, which includes the retina and an eye layer called the choroid. The inflammation causes floaters in the vitreous. Causes of posterior uveitis include infection, autoimmune disorders and inflammatory diseases.\n*   **Bleeding in the eye.** Bleeding into the vitreous can have many causes, including retinal tears and detachments, diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), blocked blood vessels, and injury. Blood cells are seen as floaters.\n*   **Torn retina.** Retinal tears can happen when a contracting vitreous tugs on the retina with enough force to tear it. Without treatment, a retinal tear may lead to retinal detachment. If fluid leaks behind the tear, it can cause the retina to separate from the back of your eye. Untreated retinal detachment can cause permanent vision loss.\n*   **Eye surgeries and eye medications.** Certain medications that are injected into the vitreous can cause air bubbles to form. These bubbles are seen as shadows until your eye absorbs them. Silicone oil bubbles added during certain surgeries on the vitreous and retina also can be seen as floaters.\n\n【17】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【18】Factors that can increase your risk of eye floaters include:\n\n【19】*   Age over 50 years\n*   Nearsightedness\n*   Eye injury\n*   Complications from cataract surgery\n*   Diabetes complication that causes damage to the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy)\n*   Eye inflammation\n\n【20】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "eb50a084-ad35-4648-b24f-94a748846548", "title": "Intussusception", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Intussusception (in-tuh-suh-SEP-shun) is a serious condition in which part of the intestine slides into an adjacent part of the intestine. This telescoping action often blocks food or fluid from passing through. Intussusception also cuts off the blood supply to the part of the intestine that's affected. This can lead to infection, death of bowel tissue or a tear in the bowel, called perforation.\n\n【2】Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children younger than 3 years old. The cause of most cases of intussusception in children is unknown. Though intussusception is rare in adults, most cases of adult intussusception are the result of an underlying medical condition, such as a tumor.\n\n【3】In children, the intestines can usually be pushed back into position with a minor procedure. In adults, surgery is often required to correct the problem.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】### Children\n\n【6】The first sign of intussusception in an otherwise healthy infant may be sudden, loud crying caused by belly pain. Infants who have belly pain may pull their knees to their chests when they cry.\n\n【7】The pain of intussusception comes and goes, usually every 15 to 20 minutes at first. These painful episodes last longer and happen more often as time passes.\n\n【8】Other symptoms of intussusception include:\n\n【9】*   Stool mixed with blood and mucus — sometimes referred to as currant jelly stool because of its appearance.\n*   Vomiting.\n*   A lump in the belly.\n*   Weakness or lack of energy.\n*   Diarrhea.\n\n【10】Not everyone has all of the symptoms. Some infants have no obvious pain. Some children don't pass blood or have a lump in the belly. And some older children have pain but no other symptoms.\n\n【11】### Adults\n\n【12】Intussusception is rare in adults. Also, because symptoms of the disorder often overlap with the symptoms of other disorders, it's more challenging to identify. The most common symptom is belly pain that comes and goes. Nausea and vomiting also may occur. People sometimes have symptoms for weeks before seeking medical attention.\n\n【13】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【14】Intussusception requires emergency medical care. If you or your child develops the symptoms listed above, seek medical help right away.\n\n【15】In infants, pulling the knees to the chest and crying are often symptoms of belly pain.\n\n【16】Causes\n------\n\n【17】Your intestine is shaped like a long tube. In intussusception, one part of your intestine — usually the small intestine — slides inside an adjacent part. This is sometimes called telescoping because it's similar to the way a collapsible telescope slides together.\n\n【18】In some cases in adults, the telescoping is caused by a growth in the intestine, such as a polyp or a tumor, called a lead point. The typical wavelike contractions of the intestine grab this lead point and pull it and the lining of the intestine into the bowel ahead of it. In most cases, however, no cause can be found for intussusception.\n\n【19】### Children\n\n【20】In most cases of intussusception in children, the cause is unknown. Intussusception seems to occur more often in the fall and winter. And because many children with the problem also have flu-like symptoms, some suspect a virus may play a role in the condition. Sometimes, a lead point can be identified as the cause of the condition — most frequently the lead point is a pouch in the lining of the small intestine (Meckel's diverticulum).\n\n【21】### Adults\n\n【22】In adults, intussusception is usually the result of a medical condition or procedure, including:\n\n【23】*   A polyp or tumor.\n*   Scar-like tissue in the intestine, known as adhesions.\n*   Weight-loss surgery such as gastric bypass or other surgery on the intestinal tract.\n*   Swelling in the intestines due to diseases such as Crohn's disease.\n\n【24】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【25】Risk factors for intussusception include:\n\n【26】*   **Age.** Children — especially young children — are much more likely to develop intussusception than adults are. It's the most common cause of bowel obstruction in children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years.\n*   **Sex.** Intussusception more often affects boys.\n*   **Irregular intestinal formation at birth.** Intestinal malrotation is a condition in which the intestine doesn't develop or rotate correctly. This increases the risk of intussusception.\n*   **Certain conditions.** Some disorders can increase the risk of intussusception, including:\n    *   Cystic fibrosis.\n    *   Henoch-Schonlein purpura, also known as IgA vasculitis.\n    *   Crohn's disease.\n    *   Celiac disease.\n\n【27】Complications\n-------------\n\n【28】Intussusception can cut off the blood supply to the affected portion of the intestine. If left untreated, lack of blood causes tissue of the intestinal wall to die. Tissue death can lead to a tear in the intestinal wall, called a perforation. This can cause an infection of the lining of the abdominal cavity, known as peritonitis.\n\n【29】Peritonitis is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. Symptoms of peritonitis include:\n\n【30】*   Belly pain.\n*   Swelling in the belly area.\n*   Fever.\n*   Vomiting.\n\n【31】Peritonitis may cause your child to go into shock. Symptoms of shock include:\n\n【32】*   Cool, clammy skin that may be pale or gray.\n*   A weak and rapid pulse.\n*   Breathing that may be either slow and shallow or very rapid.\n*   Anxiety or agitation.\n*   Extreme listlessness.\n\n【33】A child who is in shock may be conscious or unconscious. If you suspect your child is in shock, seek emergency medical care right away.\n\n【34】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Many of these supplements contain compounds such as bitter orange that are similar in structure and action to ephedra. We describe a patient in whom ischemic colitis developed 1 week after initiation of a bitter orange-containing weight-loss supplement.

Both consumers and health care professionals should be aware of the potential harm that bitter orange-containing dietary supplements can cause and report such adverse events to the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\n【1】ED ( emergency department ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration )\n\n【2】**S** ince the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the use of ephedra-containing weight-loss drugs in February 2004, a steady increase of new “ephedra-free” drugs have appeared on the market. However, many of these drugs contain compounds such as bitter orange that are similar in structure and action to ephedra. We present a case in which a woman developed ischemic colitis 1 week after she started taking a bitter orange-containing weight-loss supplement.\n\n【3】REPORT OF A CASE\n----------------\n\n【4】A 52-year-old woman with no remarkable medical or surgical history presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 1-day history of acute-onset, diffuse lower abdominal cramping associated with passage of 30 to 50 mL of bright red blood per rectum. She had experienced a total of 5 such episodes before presenting to the ED. She had no fever, light-headedness, nausea, or vomiting and no history of recent travel.\n\n【5】The patient had no known drug allergies and was taking no prescription medications. However, she admitted that she had started taking NaturalMax Skinny Fast (Nutraceutical Corporation, Park City, Utah), a dietary weight-loss supplement, 1 week before presentation. In the ED, she was hemodynamically stable. Abdominal examination revealed an obese abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds and mild tenderness to deep palpation in the left lower quadrant but no evidence of abdominal masses or organomegaly. Rectal examination showed red blood in the rectal vault. Laboratory studies yielded the following results: serum hemoglobin, 12 g/dL; white blood cell count, 11.2 × 10  /L; and a normal platelet count. Results of serum chemistries and liver function tests were within normal ranges. Computed tomography with oral and intravenous contrast medium showed circumferential thickening involving the sigmoid colon.\n\n【6】A presumptive diagnosis of ischemic colitis was made on the basis of the patient's clinical presentation and computed tomographic findings. The precipitating agent was believed to be the weight-loss supplement NaturalMax Skinny Fast that the patient had started taking 1 week previously. She was hospitalized for 3 days, and the supplement was discontinued. The patient's symptoms resolved over 24 to 48 hours with conservative management.\n\n【7】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【8】In this patient, the temporal relationship between the initiation of the supplement and the onset of symptoms was consistent with a diagnosis of ischemic colitis caused by decreased vascular flow to the gastrointestinal tract and resultant ischemic insult. Ischemic colitis has been associated with the use of vasoconstrictive drugs known to decrease splanchnic blood flow, such as cocaine, ma huang (ephedra), and pseudoephedrine.\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>*   Dowd J\n*   Bailey D\n*   Moussa K\n*   Nair S\n*   Doyle R\n*   Culpepper-Morgan JA</u>\n\n【10】Ischemic colitis associated with pseudoephedrine: four cases.\n\n【11】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Gastroenterol._ 1999; 94 : 2430-2434</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (54)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【13】According to the manufacturer, each capsule of the supplement our patient was taking contained 5 active ingredients—bitter orange (334 mg), Garcinia cambogia (300 mg), <sub>L </sub> \\-carnitine (250 mg), chitosan (250 mg), and chromium arginate (200 μg)—and the recommended dosage was 3 capsules once a day by mouth to achieve optimal weight loss.

Consumers should be aware of the potential harm that these dietary supplements can cause, and health care professionals should report these adverse events to the FDA. MedWatch is an FDA program that allows both health care professionals and consumers to report serious problems that they suspect are associated with the medical products they prescribe, dispense, or use.

Current strategies emphasize the need for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention based on the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. The advent of agents that are more tailored to inhibit the specific disease processes will profoundly affect management. Immunogenetic studies may eventually assist in identifying subgroups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have more aggres sive disease and who require a more aggressive treatment approach.\n\n【1】COX ( cyclooxygenase ), DMARD ( disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ), GI ( gastrointestinal ), IL ( interleukin ), NSAID ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ), RA ( rheumatoid arthritis ), TNF ( tumor necrosis factor )\n\n【2】Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common disease that affects about 1% of the population worldwide. Women are affected almost 3 times as often as men. The prevalence increases with advancing age, and 4% to 6% of the white population older than 65 years may have RA. Although the cause is unknown, evidence suggests an association between severe RA and HLA, particularly to alleles coding for a shared epitope on the HLA-DRB1 molecule.\n\n【3】Major features of active disease include symmetrical polyarthritis with joint swelling and tenderness and morning stiffness lasting for an hour or longer. Subcutaneous nodules, presence of rheumatoid factor (in about 80% of patients with RA), and radiographically evident erosions or juxta-articular osteoporosis in or adjacent to the involved joints are further characteristics of RA.\n\n【4】The onset and clinical course of RA are variable. Gradual onset is most common.

Appropriate and timely therapeutic intervention after accurate diagnosis diminishes not only the symptoms but also the progress of RA. The primary care physician has a crucial role in this process by early recognition of the symptoms of RA, leading to its diagnosis and use of the resources necessary to establish a successful treatment program to achieve these goals, and by participating in the ongoing management of the patient with RA.\n\n【27】Early in the course of RA, education on the disease and vocational, lifestyle, and family counseling must be provided. Patients are best served by a multidisciplinary team that includes a rheumatologist and other specially trained medical personnel, including nurses and occupational and physical therapists skilled and knowledgeable about RA.\n\n【28】Physical modalities such as joint protection, orthotics and other adaptive devices, and exercises improve the symptoms, function, and well-being of the patient. Adequate rest reduces the fatigue associated with active RA, and resting the involved joints lessens the symptoms of inflammation.\n\n【29】THERAPY\n-------\n\n【30】Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce inflammation and help relieve pain but seldom completely eliminate signs and symptoms of active arthritis. They inhibit 1 or both types of cyclooxygenase (COX). Cyclooxygenase-1 is constitutively expressed in the GI mucosa, kidneys, platelets, and vascular endothelium. Cyclooxygenase-2 is functionally expressed and promotes the elaboration of prostaglandins in inflamed tissues.\n\n【31】Selective blockage of COX-2 may lead to an improved safety profile for these agents. Celecoxib and rofecoxib are the first such agents available in the United States that selectively block COX-2. Of importance, the efficacy of these COX-2 inhibitors does not differ substantially from that of conventional NSAIDs. Their putative advantage is principally because of a reduced rate of adverse events, especially upper GI bleeding.\n\n【32】无关删除-2:<u>*   Wolf MM\n*   Lichtenstein DR\n*   Singh G</u>\n\n【33】Gastrointestinal loxicrty of nonstcroidal antiinflammatory drugs.\n\n【34】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1999; 340 : 1888-1899</u></u>\n\n【35】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1961)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【36】Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors should be considered in patients at high risk of GI bleeding, including those older than 65 years and those with a previous history of GI bleeding. Despite advantages, these drugs may be associated with important adverse reactions, including allergy and fluid retention, and like other NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency.\n\n【37】Glucocorticoids are the most potent suppressors of inflammation and may be needed to control severe polyarticular disease until disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been added and become effective. At that point, the glucocorticoids should be tapered and discontinued. Glucocorticoids should not be used alone in the management of RA. Oral prednisone or an equivalent is given in dosages typically ranging between 2 and 15 mg/d, often in divided doses (eg, 2 mg twice a day). A splitdosing regimen is frequently necessary because the antiinflammatory effect is relatively short. It is preferable, but often not possible, to avoid long-term glucocorticoid therapy in patients with RA because of the well-appreciated adverse effects of these drugs. Systemic extra-articular manifestations such as rheumatoid vasculitis may require treatment with initial prednisone dosages of 40 to 60 mg/d, tapering according to response.\n\n【38】无关删除-2:<u>*   Malleson EL\n*   Conn DL</u>\n\n【39】Exiraarticular manifestations of rheumaloid arthritis.\n\n【40】无关删除-2:<u>in: Weisman MH Weinblatl ME Treatment of the Rheumatic Diseases.

For many of the agents, the mechanism of action is defined incompletely, whereas for some, including the new class of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, it is better understood.\n\n【49】Table 1 DMARD Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis\n\n【50】AST = aspartate aminotransferase; CBC = complete blood cell count; DMARD = disease-modifying antirheumatic drug.\n\n| Drugs | Dosage | Toxic effects requiring follow-up | Monitoring studies†Suggested laboratory studies; complete guidelines have been previously published.8 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Azathioprine | 50-150 mg/d in 1-3 doses, based on body weight; take with food | Myelosuppression, hepatotox-icity, lymphoproliferative disorders | CBC and platelet count every 1-2 wk with changes in dosage, every 1-3 mo thereafter‡When chemotherapeutic agents are initiated, obtain a baseline chest radiograph (current within 6-12 mo), hepatitis B and C, CBC, platelet count, creatinine, and AST value. |\n| Chlorambucil§Chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide are not generally very effective for the treatment of synovitis, although they can be useful in treating extra-articular disease, specifically rheumatoid vasculitis. | 0.05-0.10 mg/kg/d; maintenance dosage generally 4-6 mg/d in 1-2 doses | Myelosuppression, myelopro-liferative disorders, malignancy | CBC and platelet count every 1-2 wk with changes in dosage, every 1-3 mo thereafter‡When chemotherapeutic agents are initiated, obtain a baseline chest radiograph (current within 6-12 mo), hepatitis B and C, CBC, platelet count, creatinine, and AST value. |\n| Corticosteroids (oral prednisone, others) | For synovial disease, 2-15 mg/d in 1-4 doses; for extra-articular disease (vasculitis), 20-60 mg/d according to response | Hypertension, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis | Baseline blood pressure, chemistry panel, lipid profile, bone densitometry in high-risk patients; follow-up tests including glucose and lipids as indicated |\n| Cyclophosphamide§Chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide are not generally very effective for the treatment of synovitis, although they can be useful in treating extra-articular disease, specifically rheumatoid vasculitis.‖Fluid intake should be 2-3 L/d, and bladder should be emptied before bedtime. | 50-150 mg/d orally in a single morning dose | Myelosuppression, myelopro-liferative disorders, malignancy, hemorrhagic cystitis | CBC and platelet count every 1-2 wk with changes in dosage, every 1-3 mo thereafter; urinalysis and urine cytology every 6-12 mo after cessation of drug‡When chemotherapeutic agents are initiated, obtain a baseline chest radiograph (current within 6-12 mo), hepatitis B and C, CBC, platelet count, creatinine, and AST value. |\n| Cyclosporine | 2.5-5 mg/kg/d in 1 or 2 doses | Renal insufficiency, anemia, hypertension, hirsutism | Creatinine every 2 wk until dose is stable, then monthly; then periodic CBC, potassium, liver function tests‡When chemotherapeutic agents are initiated, obtain a baseline chest radiograph (current within 6-12 mo), hepatitis B and C, CBC, platelet count, creatinine, and AST value. |\n| Penicillamine¶Although this drug is considered a DMARD, I do not use it in patients with rheumatoid arthritis because of its limited therapeutic benefit and its high incidence of adverse effects. | 125-250 mg/d in a single initial dose, increased to not more than 1500 mg/d in 3 doses; take on an empty stomach | Myelosuppression, proteinuria | CBC and urine dipstick for protein every 2 wk until dosage is stable, then every 1-2 mo |\n| Etanercept | 25 mg subcutaneously 2 times a week | Reactions at injection site, influenza-like symptoms | Not defined |\n| Gold#1 rarely use gold in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; however, I continue to prescribe it to a few patients who have taken it for years and have done well.

Retinopathy due to hydroxychloroquine rarely develops when appropriate dosages are used. The onset of antirheumatic disease activity occurs in about 3 to 4 months in almost 50% of patients, although 6 months may be needed for the full benefit to be realized. For patients with moderately active or severe newly diagnosed disease, methotrexate or sometimes sulfasalazine is a preferred initial choice. In patients with continuing active established disease, methotrexate may be used in combination with other agents including hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or both or cyclosporine, azathioprine, and the more recently available DMARDs.\n\n【66】无关删除-2:<u>*   Borigini MJ\n*   Paulus HE</u>\n\n【67】Rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【68】无关删除-2:<u>in: Weisman MH Weinblatl ME Treatment of the Rheumatic Diseases.

The initial dosage is usually 7.5 to 10.0 mg/wk, titrated upward to an average dosage of 12.5 to 15.0 mg/wk, although dosages of 20 to 30 mg/wk (if tolerated) may be necessary to realize this drug's therapeutic potential before the response is deemed “inadequate.” Methotrexate may be given in tablet or liquid form; the liquid form is substantially less expensive than tablets, and injection may be associated with less stomatitis and GI upset. Appropriately managed, methotrexate can be used effectively for long periods to control RA. Although generally well tolerated, methotrexate can cause GI upset and hepatotoxicity including liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Concomitant alcohol use is an important risk factor for methotrexate-related hepatotoxicity, and thus alcohol should not be used by patients taking this drug. Methotrexate can also cause a syndrome of pulmonary hypersensitivity manifested by dyspnea, cough, and fever and should not be used in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency or severe lung disease. Supplemental folate (usually 1 mg/d) seems to reduce the occurrence of other adverse effects, including stomatitis, hair thinning, and bone marrow suppression. In patients taking methotrexate, physicians should avoid prescribing antifolate drugs such as sulfamethoxazole for sinusitis or cystitis, which may precipitate pancytopenia.\n\n【72】Use of DMARDs has substantially improved disease control and the long-term outlook for patients with RA. Their use may be associated with a lower incidence of extra-articular disease manifestations such as systemic vasculitis. In a series of more than 3000 patients monitored for up to 20 years, patients who had received DMARD therapy had a 30% reduction in long-term disability and improvement in survival compared with patients who had received NSAIDs alone.\n\n【73】无关删除-2:<u>*   Fries JF\n*   Williams CA\n*   Morfeld D\n*   Singh G\n*   Sibley J</u>\n\n【74】Reduction in long-term disability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis by disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-based treatment strategies.\n\n【75】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arthritis Rheum._ 1996; 39 : 616-622</u></u>\n\n【76】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (231)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【77】Despite these successes, major challenges exist.

About 50% of patients with RA treated by rheumatologists are prescribed combination therapies with either 2 or 3 DMARDs. The combination of methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine is among the most popular regimens. Methotrexate is often combined with other DMARDs including cyclosporine, but many other combinations of DMARDs have also been used.\n\n【84】In addition to hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, other traditional DMARDs include penicillamine, gold, and sulfasalazine. Sulfasalazine was among the first drugs to be developed for the treatment of RA and may be chosen as the initial DMARD for patients with no allergy to sulfa, rather than hydroxychloroquine or methotrexate. I seldom recommend gold or penicillamine because of the limited efficacy and the pronounced incidence of adverse effects associated with these drugs.\n\n【85】Three to 6 months may be needed before agents such as gold, hydroxychloroquine, and even sulfasalazine are effective. If the response is inadequate after 6 months of treatment, a second DMARD should be added or the DMARD regimen should be changed.\n\n【86】In the past year, 3 new DMARDs, etanercept, infliximab, and leflunomide, have been approved for the treatment of patients with RA.\n\n【87】无关删除-2:<u>*   Weinblatl ME\n*   Kremer JM\n*   Bankhurst AD\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【88】A trial of etancrcept, a recombinanl tumor necrosis factor receptor: Fc fusion protein, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving metho-trexate.\n\n【89】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1999; 340 : 253-259</u></u>\n\n【90】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1946)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【91】无关删除-2:<u>*   Moreland LW\n*   Baumgartner SW\n*   Schiff MH\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【92】Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with a recombinanl human lumor necrosis factor receptor (p75)-Fc fusion protein.\n\n【93】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N EnglJ Med._ 1997; 337 : 141-147</u></u>\n\n【94】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1515)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【95】Etanercept and infliximab are TNF-α antagonists that have powerful anti-inflammatory effects in patients with RA. Tumor necrosis factor is a potent inflammatory cytokine expressed in increased amounts in the serum and synovial fluid of patients with RA. It promotes the release of other proinflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL) 1, IL-6, and IL-8 and stimulates protease production. Etanercept consists of fusion monoclonal antibody composed of 2 identical chains of recombinant human TNF-α receptor fused with the Fc portion of human IgG1. In vitro it binds to soluble TNF. About 70% of patients receiving subcutaneous etanercept at dosages of 25 mg twice a week have substantial improvement in the extent of joint inflammation; often within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. This improvement can be enhanced by combination with methotrexate. Adverse effects of etanercept are influenza-like symptoms and reactions at the injection site, which usually abate after the first few injections. The efficacy of infliximab, a recombinant TNF receptor fusion protein, seems to be roughly equivalent to that of etanercept. Infliximab is given intravenously once every 8 weeks, a regimen that may be more convenient for some patients. Potential long-term risks of these TNF-α antagonists have not been established. Infliximab may be associated with development of autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibodies. To date, neither drug has an increased risk of malignancy, autoimmune disease, or infection, issues that are the subject of ongoing postmarketing surveillance. The cost of these drugs is about $10,000 to $12,000 a year, generally higher for etanercept than infliximab. The available TNF-α antagonists should be considered in patients with recalcitrant disease not controlled by methotrexate.\n\n【96】Leflunomide is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor with clinical efficacy generally equivalent to methotrexate.\n\n【97】无关删除-2:<u>*   Mladenovic V\n*   Domljan Z\n*   Rozman D\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【98】Safety and effectiveness ofteflunomide in the treatment of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【99】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arthritis Rheum._ 1995; 38 : 1595-1603</u></u>\n\n【100】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (292)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【101】Adverse effects reported include rash, alopecia, allergy, weight loss, thrombocytopenia, and diarrhea. Diarrhea often occurs early in the course of treatment and may abate, but discontinuation of the drug is necessary when the diarrhea cannot be ameliorated with dose reduction or concomitant use of antidiarrheal agents.\n\n【102】Serious extra-articular disease manifestations including vasculitis, scleritis, and recalcitrant serositis generally require systemic glucocorticoids and may necessitate the use of immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide. In my opinion, the only indication for cyclophosphamide in the treatment of RA is severe extra-articular disease, especially vasculitis.\n\n【103】Of importance, the decision about the use and aggressiveness of DMARD therapy should not be based solely on the presence or absence of the rheumatoid factor. Early in the course of RA, the rheumatoid factor may be absent, whereas in patients with established polyarticular arthritis, absence of the rheumatoid factor is not invariably associated with mild disease and good disease outcome. Treatment must be tailored to the disease manifestations and needs of the individual patient. Consultation with a rheumatologist is helpful for patients who are pregnant or considering pregnancy because many antirheumatic drugs have severe fetal toxic effects including teratogenicity. Management suggestions for several clinical scenarios involving patients with RA are listed in Table 2 .\n\n【104】Table 2 Scenarios Illustrating the Practical Application of Therapeutic Strategies for RA\n\n【105】DMARD = disease-modifying antirheumatic drug; NSAID = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; TB = tuberculosis; TNF-α = tumor necrosis factor α.\n\n| Scenario | Therapeutic strategy |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1.Newly diagnosed RA in a young patient with presence of rheumatoid factor and mild disease (few joints involved and sedimentation rate <30 mm/h) | 1.Hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg/d, with or without an NSAID, and prednisone, 3-5 mg/d over a 1-to 3-mo period; sulfasalazine, up to 3 g/d in 2 divided doses, is an acceptable alternative |\n| 2.Patient with new-onset RA with pronounced symptoms including fatigue, low-grade fever, weight loss, and polyarticular disease†The role of the TNF-a antagonists is evolving; some rheumatologists may institute therapy with these agents in several of these scenarios. | 2.Methotrexate, with an NSAID, and prednisone, 5-15 mg/d; taper prednisone over a 3-or 4-mo period if possible. If adequate control cannot be achieved after the initial 6-8 wk of therapy, consider adding hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or both to this regimen; a frequent cause of ”methotrexate failure“ is an inadequate dose of methotrexate (providing that the patient is able to tolerate the higher doses) |\n| 3.Patient with established mild disease | 3.Hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg/d, with or without an NSAID, and prednisone, 3-5 mg/d over a 1-to 3-mo period; sulfasalazine, up to 3 g/d in 2 divided doses is an acceptable alternative |\n| 4.Patient with established RA in whom optimal dose of methotrexate is partially effective!a.Initiate combination therapyb.Combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or both is ineffectivec.Combination therapy with methotrexate and cyclosporine, leflunomide, or azathioprine is poorly tolerated or ineffective (many rheumatologists may not use any of these combinations but would add a tumor necrosis factor _a_ antagonist) | 4.NS AIDs if they add measurably to symptom control; prednisone, 5-15 mg/da.Add hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or bothb.Discontinue hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine; add leflunomide, azathioprine, cyclosporine, or possibly goldc.Continue methotrexate but discontinue the combination drug and add etanercept or infliximab.

As a generalization, DMARD therapy should be continued indefinitely; however, if the patient does well and has no signs of active disease for at least 1 year, DMARD therapy could be carefully tapered. With combination DMARD therapy, one of the DMARDs could be tapered if the patient has been in remission for at least 6 months. I consider methotrexate an “anchor” therapy and generally continue this drug for the longest period. Of note, less than 5% of patients with bona fide seropositive RA remain in long-term disease-free remission.\n\n【111】Rheumatoid arthritis is a serious disease. Follow-up early in the course of disease and in patients with poorly controlled disease should be every 2 to 6 weeks. Patients with well-controlled disease may be seen every 3 to 6 months. The primary care physician has an important role in the management of RA and can effectively guide and monitor routine therapy, with periodic consultation by a rheumatologist as needed. Assessment of disease activity and treatment efficacy is enhanced substantially with serial use of standard outcome measures, including duration of morning stiffness, severity of fatigue, presence and degree of joint pain and stiffness including joint counts, global and disease-specific health assessment instruments such as the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and radiographs of involved joints.\n\n【112】Appropriate medical care for patients with RA includes immunization and prompt treatment of infections. Patients with RA have a high risk of infections even if they are not taking DMARDs but particularly when they are taking immunosuppressive drugs. Several medications used to manage RA, including NSAIDs, cyclosporine, and glucocorticoids, may cause or exacerbate hypertension. Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with an increased incidence of pulmonary disease, and patients who smoke have an especially high rate of lung disease. In patients at high risk of GI bleeding, including elderly women and those with a previous history of GI bleeding, prophylaxis is achieved with agents such as proton pump inhibitors and misoprostol. As a general principle, use of NSAIDs should be avoided when possible and certainly discontinued when symptoms diminish. Virtually all patients with RA have or develop osteoporosis as a complication of the disease or its treatment. Adequate intake of calcium (1200–1500 mg/d) and vitamin D (400 IU/d) is important. In all patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy, including men, an antiresportive agent such as bisphosphonates or calcitonin should be considered. In postmenopausal women, estrogen replacement therapy or agents such as raloxifene may be considered. Finally, mouth and eye moisturization is necessarv for patients with sicca complex symptoms.\n\n【113】Understanding the relationship of disease susceptibility and severity with genetic factors may provide an avenue for individualized treatment of patients with RA in the future. It may be possible to treat patients lacking genetic markers of severe disease with milder agents, while those with markers of severe disease may be treated more aggressively. More than 80 drugs are currently being developed for treatment of RA; thus, further advances in the management of the disease are forthcoming.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Edarbyclor\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Azilsartan and chlorthalidone combination is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.\n\n【6】Azilsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, azilsartan relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.\n\n【7】Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【33】*   Anuria (not able to pass urine) or\n*   Diabetic patients who are also taking aliskiren (Tekturna®)—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【34】*   Congestive heart failure, severe—Use may lead to kidney problems.\n\n【35】*   Electrolyte imbalances (e.g. low potassium or sodium in the body) or\n*   Fluid imbalances (caused by dehydration, vomiting, or diarrhea) or\n*   Gout or\n*   Kidney problems or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【36】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【37】In addition to the use of this medicine, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and a change in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium (salt). Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet.\n\n【38】Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any symptoms of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal. It is very important that you take your medicine exactly as directed and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well.\n\n【39】Remember that this medicine will not cure your high blood pressure, but it does help control it. You must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life. If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, stroke, or kidney disease.\n\n【40】You may take this medicine with or without food.\n\n【41】This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet. It is very important that you read and understand this information. Be sure to ask your doctor about anything you do not understand.\n\n【42】### Dosing\n\n【43】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【44】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【45】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   For high blood pressure:\n        *   Adults—One tablet once a day. Your doctor may increase your dose as needed.

Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【57】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position or after the first dose of this medicine. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or not alert. If you feel dizzy, lie down so you do not faint. Then sit for a few moments before standing to prevent the dizziness from returning. If you faint, call your doctor right away.\n\n【58】Check with your doctor right away if you become sick while taking this medicine, especially with severe or continuing nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. These conditions may cause you to lose too much water and which may lead to low blood pressure. You can also lose water by sweating, so drink plenty of water during exercise or in hot weather.\n\n【59】Hypokalemia (low potassium in the blood) may occur after using this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms: dry mouth, increased thirst, muscle cramps, nausea, or vomiting.\n\n【60】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems, since they may tend to increase your blood pressure.\n\n【61】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【62】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【63】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【64】#### Less common\n\n【65】1.

Patients in the department preregistered for the service, and then were able to use the online portal for consultations with their primary care physician. Use of the online portal was monitored and data were collected from November 1, 2007, through October 31, 2009.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】During the 2-year period, 4282 patients were registered for the service. Patients made 2531 online visits, and billings were made for 1159 patients. E-visits were submitted primarily by women during working hours and involved 294 different conditions. Of the 2531 e-visits, 62 (2%) included uploaded photographs, and 411 (16%) replaced nonbillable telephone protocols with billable encounters. The e-visits made office visits unnecessary in 1012 cases (40%); in 324 cases (13%), the patient was asked to schedule an appointment for a face-to-face encounter.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Although limited in scope, to our knowledge this is the largest study of online visits in primary care using a structured history, allowing the patient to enter any problem, and billing the patient when appropriate. The extent of conditions possible for treatment by online care was far-ranging and was managed with a minimum of message exchanges by using structured histories. Processes previously given as a free service or by nurse triage and subject to malpractice (protocols) were now documented and billed.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "c4ac2e38-7afa-45e4-8be0-a2103b9ed0c4", "title": "Etidronate (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Etidronate (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Didronel\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Etidronate is used to treat Paget's disease of the bone. It may also be used to treat or prevent a certain type of bone problem (heterotopic ossification) after hip replacement surgery or spinal injury.\n\n【6】Etidronate is also used to treat hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood) that may occur with some types of cancer.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Tablet\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of etidronate in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of etidronate in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving etidronate.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【22】### Other Interactions\n\n【23】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【24】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【25】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【26】*   Anemia or\n*   Blood clotting problems or\n*   Cancer or\n*   Dental or tooth problems or\n*   Dental procedures (eg, tooth extraction) or\n*   Infection or\n*   Poor oral hygiene or\n*   Surgery (eg, dental surgery)—May increase risk for severe jaw problems. This risk may also be increased if you use this medicine for a long time.\n\n【27】*   Enterocolitis (severe diarrhea) or\n*   Hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate in the blood) or\n*   Stomach or bowel problems (eg, Barrett's esophagus, difficulty with swallowing, heartburn, inflammation of the esophagus, or ulcers)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【28】*   Esophagus (the tube that runs from your throat to your stomach) problems (eg, achalasia, stricture) or\n*   Osteomalacia (soft bones) or\n*   Trouble with swallowing—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【29】*   Kidney disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【30】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【31】Take this medicine only as directed. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.\n\n【32】Make sure your doctor knows if your diet includes large amounts of calcium, such as milk or other dairy products, or if you are on any special diet, such as a low-sodium or low-sugar diet. Calcium in the diet may prevent the absorption of oral etidronate.\n\n【33】Take etidronate with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces) of water on an empty stomach at least 2 hours before or after food (mid-morning is best) or at bedtime. Food may decrease the amount of etidronate absorbed by your body.\n\n【34】Do not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking this medicine, and do not lie down until after you have eaten some food.\n\n【35】In some patients, etidronate takes up to 3 months to work. If you feel that the medicine is not working, do not stop taking it on your own. Instead, check with your doctor.\n\n【36】It is important that you eat a well-balanced diet with an adequate amount of calcium and vitamin D (found in milk or other dairy products). Too much or too little of either may increase the chance of side effects while you are taking etidronate. Your doctor can help you choose the meal plan that is best for you. However, do not take any food, especially milk, milk formulas, or other dairy products, or antacids, mineral supplements, or other medicines that are high in calcium or iron (high amounts of these minerals may also be in some vitamin preparations), magnesium, or aluminum within 2 hours of taking etidronate. To do so may keep this medicine from working properly.\n\n【37】If this medicine upsets your stomach, ask your doctor if you can take two smaller doses instead of one larger dose. Do not change without talking to your doctor.\n\n【38】For treating Paget's disease, you may need to take this medicine for up to 6 months. Then after 90 days of not taking the medicine, your doctor may want you to start another course of treatment.\n\n【39】If you have Paget's disease, this medicine may work slowly, so you may not feel better until you have been using it for awhile. Do not stop taking it without talking to your doctor first. Your body may continue to respond to this medicine for several months after you stop using it.\n\n【40】### Dosing\n\n【41】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【42】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【43】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   For Paget's disease of bone:\n        *   Adults—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. At first, 5 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) (2.3 mg per pound) of body weight a day, usually as a single dose, for not more than 6 months. Some people may need 6 to 10 mg per kg (2.7 to 4.6 mg per pound) of body weight a day for not more than 6 months. Others may need 11 to 20 mg per kg (5 to 9.1 mg per pound) of body weight a day for not more than 3 months. Your doctor may adjust your dose depending on your response to treatment.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For treating or preventing a certain type of bone problem that may occur after hip replacement:\n        *   Adults—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The dose is usually 20 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) (9.1 mg per pound) of body weight a day for 1 month before surgery, and for 3 months after surgery.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For treating or preventing a certain type of bone problem that may occur after spinal injury:\n        *   Adults—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The dose is usually 20 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) (9.1 mg per pound) of body weight a day for 2 weeks, beginning as soon as possible after your injury. Your doctor may then decrease your dose to 10 mg per kg (4.5 mg per pound) of body weight for an additional 10 weeks.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For treating hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood):\n        *   Adults—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The dose is usually 20 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) (9.1 mg per pound) of body weight a day for 30 days. Treatment usually does not continue beyond 90 days.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【44】### Missed Dose\n\n【45】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【46】### Storage\n\n【47】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【48】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【49】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【50】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【51】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【52】It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits even if you are between treatments and are not taking this medicine. If your condition has improved and your doctor has told you to stop taking etidronate, your progress must still be checked. The results of laboratory tests or the occurrence of certain symptoms will tell your doctor if more medicine must be taken. Your doctor may want you to begin another course of treatment after you have been off the medicine for at least 3 months.\n\n【53】This medicine can irritate your esophagus. If you think this medicine has started to damage your esophagus, stop taking this medicine and call your doctor. Some symptoms of damage to the esophagus are heartburn (either new or worse than usual), pain when swallowing, pain in the center of your chest, trouble swallowing, or feeling that food gets stuck on the way to your stomach.\n\n【54】It is important that you tell all of your health care providers that you are taking etidronate. If you are having dental procedures done while taking etidronate you may have an increased chance of getting a severe problem of your jaw.\n\n【55】Make sure you tell your doctor about any new medical problems, especially with your teeth or jaws. Tell your doctor if you have severe bone, joint, or muscle pain while using this medicine.\n\n【56】If this medicine causes you to have nausea or diarrhea and it continues, check with your doctor. The dose may need to be changed.\n\n【57】This medicine may increase your risk of developing fractures. This may be more common if you use it for a long time.

For most people, palliative care is not provided by hospice and palliative medicine specialists, but rather by their primary care providers. The recognition of hospice and palliative medicine as its own medical subspecialty in 2006 highlighted the importance of palliative care to the practice of medicine, yet many health care professionals harbor misconceptions about palliative care, which may be a barrier to ensuring that the palliative care needs of their patients are identified and met in a timely fashion. When physicians discuss end-of-life concerns proactively, many patients choose more comfort-focused care and receive care more aligned with their values and goals. This article defines palliative care, describes how it differs from hospice, debunks some common myths associated with hospice and palliative care, and offers suggestions on how primary care providers can integrate palliative care into their practice.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CPR ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation ), EOL ( end of life ), HPM ( hospice and palliative medicine ), PCP ( primary care provider )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .

Palliative care addresses symptoms directly to improve how the patient feels, regardless of the cause. As defined by the Center to Advance Palliative Care: Palliative care, also known as palliative medicine, is specialized medical care for people living with serious illness. It focuses on providing relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness—whatever the diagnosis. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the family.\n\n【28】删除3:<u>Center to Advance Palliative Care. About palliative care. https://www.capc.org/about/palliative-care/ .

Nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers, chaplains, and pharmacists work alongside physicians to address psychosocial and spiritual concerns of patients and families in addition to physical symptoms. Symptom management, psychosocial-spiritual support, and facilitation of medical decision making are 3 key domains of palliative care. The Table describes common elements of palliative care in each of these domains. Even with tremendous growth in the past 2 decades, including recognition of hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) as an official subspecialty of the American Board of Medical Subspecialties and the American Osteopathic Association, there remains a shortage of HPM specialists, which is projected to increase as the population ages.\n\n【31】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lupu D.</u>\n\n【32】American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine Workforce Task Force.

This lack of awareness creates an opportunity for clinicians to frame the benefits of palliative care for patients and their families. Yet the survey also found that most health care professionals erroneously equated palliative care with end-of-life (EOL) care. Clinicians who perceive palliative care as EOL care, or lack a clear understanding of its benefits, will miss critical opportunities to identify and address palliative care needs in their patients. Primary palliative care competencies for PCPs include (1) recognition of palliative care needs in patients, (2) prognostication, (3) advance care planning, (4) assessment and management of common symptoms in the seriously ill, (5) referral to specialty palliative, and (6) appropriate and timely referral to hospice.\n\n【54】Recognizing Palliative Care Needs in Primary Care Patients\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】Patients with a serious illness often experience substantial physical burden due to pain and symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and dyspnea. Anxiety and depression are also common after the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness. Any of these symptoms may alter a person's ability to fulfill roles critical to self-identity, such as athlete, caring spouse, or devoted parent. Through their longitudinal relationship, PCPs can help individuals explore these issues and find ways to adapt and prioritize in the face of a serious illness.\n\n【56】Many PCPs already engage in primary palliative care but may not recognize their actions as palliative care. Primary care providers commonly provide careful assessment of symptoms and recognition of how the symptoms affect that individual's quality of life. Many also routinely prescribe and titrate opioids for patients in pain.\n\n【57】无关删除-2:<u>*   Matlock D.D.</u>\n\n【58】The pain pendulum swinging again.\n\n【59】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Palliat Med._ 2015; 18 : 734-735</u></u>\n\n【60】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【61】Primary care providers often focus on maximizing quality of life by helping patients and their families find value and meaning, particularly when a patient's time or function is limited. It is important to help PCPs gain insight into primary palliative care that they already provide, so they may disentangle palliative care and EOL care and integrate palliative care to meet the needs of their patients. Effective symptom management promotes a patient's ability to remain active in important activities and relationships. When appropriate, palliative care counseling by PCPs can extend to family caregivers during active caregiving and into bereavement.\n\n【62】Prognostication and Communication\n---------------------------------\n\n【63】Patients with a serious illness commonly face difficult medical choices.

Thus, heightened awareness of patient factors that predict a shortened survival or elevated risks of decline are key palliative care skills.

Most PCPs believe that advance care planning is within their purview, but struggle to find adequate time during patient visits and address competing health conditions appropriately. In 2016, the Medicare program began reimbursing clinicians for counseling patients about advance care planning. This was an important step toward supporting clinicians for the considerable time it takes to have these crucial conversations. More deliberate prognostication efforts may help PCPs identify their patients for whom advance care planning is a priority.\n\n【85】Advance care planning includes encouraging patients to appoint a health care proxy or surrogate decision maker, facilitating discussions between the patient and their proxy about their wishes in the event of serious illness, and documenting these discussions. Importantly, most patients want information about prognosis in the setting of serious illness.\n\n【86】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hagerty R.G.\n*   Butow P.N.\n*   Ellis P.M.\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【87】Communicating with realism and hope: incurable cancer patients' views on the disclosure of prognosis.\n\n【88】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Oncol._ 2005; 23 ( \\[published correction appears in J Clin Oncol. 2005;23(15):3652.

However, the terms _palliative care_ and _hospice_ should never be used interchangeably. In the United States, hospice is a critical, focused component of palliative care, with specific eligibility requirements driven by the 1983 Medicare hospice benefit. Hospice is usually provided in the patient's home to allow them to die comfortably surrounded by loved ones. Although fewer than 25% of Americans die at home despite an overwhelming desire to do so, more than 75% of patients on hospice die at home.\n\n【163】National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization\n\n【164】删除3:<u>http://www.allhealth.org/briefingmaterials/NHPCO-NHPCOsFactsandFigures-2005Findings-760.pdf</u>\n\n【165】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【166】Thus, hospice is really _the_ service that allows patients to die at home, if they choose to do so.\n\n【167】What Hospice Services Provide\n-----------------------------\n\n【168】Hospice is a team-based approach to care. Typically hospice is provided by an interdisciplinary team comprising a nurse, social worker, home health aides, chaplain, volunteers, and hospice medical director. Hospice has 4 levels of care: routine home care, general inpatient care, continuous care, and respite care. Most hospice care (96%) is routine home care, delivered in the patient's residence to ensure comfort and avoid hospitalization.\n\n【169】删除3:<u>http://www.nhpco.org/sites/default/files/public/Statistics\\_Research/Hospice\\_Levels\\_of\\_Care.pdf</u>\n\n【170】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【171】Members of the team visit the patient's home to assess symptoms, adjust medications to alleviate or mitigate symptoms, and provide support to the patient and family. Hospice covers durable medical equipment, such as a hospital bed, commode, and supplemental oxygen provided in the home as well as the cost of all medications related to the hospice diagnosis, including schedule II opioid analgesics. Finally, patients on hospice may access a hospice provider, usually a nurse, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by phone. When phone guidance is insufficient, the hospice provider will come to the patient's home day or night. Reliable, easy access to an expert provider provides comfort and reassurance to family members, who provide the bulk of care to patients, while helping to avoid emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Occasionally, patients on hospice with complex symptoms, such as refractory pain or agitated delirium, do require hospital care. Such patients can remain on hospice under the general inpatient benefit at either an inpatient hospice facility (if available) or a hospital, in which the hospice team visits them daily and continues to manage their care along with the inpatient hospital team. In contrast, the continuous care hospice benefit provides between 8 and 24 hours of medical care, usually nursing care, in the patient's home. The continuous care benefit is typically used to manage a complicated symptom or to allow a patient to remain at home, during a symptom crisis, with ample medical support. The hospice benefit will also provide up to 5 consecutive days of respite care in a facility, often a skilled nursing facility, to relieve stress of family caregivers. In 2012, continuous care and respite care combined accounted for less than 1% of hospice care delivered in the United States.\n\n【172】删除3:<u>http://www.nhpco.org/sites/default/files/public/Statistics\\_Research/Hospice\\_Levels\\_of\\_Care.pdf</u>\n\n【173】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【174】When starting hospice, patients choose a primary physician, often their PCP, to oversee their medical care while on hospice. This physician receives updates and changes in the patient's status and gives orders for medications as needed. Many patients fear abandonment by their regular providers when hospice is mentioned. By reassuring their patients that they will remain the physician in charge of their care, PCPs can mitigate this concern. Moreover, able patients on hospice can continue to come in for clinic visits with their PCP and other providers if they desire. However, most hospice benefits do not cover hospitalization unless required for a patient's comfort. In general, hospitalization requires that patients disenroll from hospice and resume prior insurance. Approximately 3% to 6% of patients enrolled in hospice get hospitalized, and many of these patients go on to receive high-intensity care, which indeed may conflict with their preference for comfort measures.\n\n【175】无关删除-2:<u>*   Cintron A.\n*   Hamel M.B.\n*   Davis R.B.\n*   Burns R.B.\n*   Phillips R.S.\n*   McCarthy E.P.</u>\n\n【176】Hospitalization of hospice patients with cancer.\n\n【177】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Palliat Med._ 2003; 6 : 757-768</u></u>\n\n【178】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (40)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【179】无关删除-2:<u>*   Wang S.Y.\n*   Aldridge M.D.\n*   Gross C.P.\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【180】Transitions Between Healthcare Settings of Hospice Enrollees at the End of Life.\n\n【181】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Am Geriatr Soc._ 2016; 64 : 314-322</u></u>\n\n【182】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (45)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【183】Limitations of Hospice\n----------------------\n\n【184】To qualify for hospice care, a physician must certify that the patient is expected to die within the next 6 months, if the disease follows its natural course. Once enrolled in hospice, a physician or hospice nurse practitioner must have at least 1 face-to-face visit with the patient in each of the first two 90-day periods, which certifies that the patient continues to meet the prognostic criteria. Patients surviving longer than 6 months require recertification once every 60 days, also accomplished through a face-to-face visit.\n\n【185】*   Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Medicare Hospice Benefit Facts\n\n【186】删除3:<u>https://www.cgsmedicare.com/hhh/education/materials/pdf/Medicare\\_Hospice\\_Benefit\\_Facts.pdf</u>\n\n【187】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【188】Occasionally, patients recover unexpectedly and no longer qualify for hospice. Such patients, often dubbed “hospice graduates,” disenroll from hospice and resume their prior medical care. Patients often qualify for hospice before actually being referred. This is partially because physicians notoriously overestimate prognosis,\n\n【189】无关删除-2:<u>*   Christakis N.A.\n*   Lamont E.B.</u>\n\n【190】Extent and determinants of error in doctors' prognoses in terminally ill patients: prospective cohort study.\n\n【191】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_BMJ._ 2000; 320 : 469-472</u></u>\n\n【192】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【193】but is also related to readiness of patients and their families to accept hospice. Primary care providers engaged in primary palliative care may help prepare patients and their families for an earlier transition to hospice.\n\n【194】The other major distinction in hospice care is that because of the reimbursement structure, hospice is required only to provide comfort-focused care related to the hospice diagnosis. The Medicare hospice benefit requires patients to forgo treatments aimed at curing their terminal diagnosis. Thus, many hospices will not accept patients receiving disease-directed care (eg, chemotherapy for cancer) because they will not be reimbursed for these therapies, even when the intent is palliative. Such treatments can delay referral to hospice while perpetuating the misconception that hospice is only for the final days of life. Some “open access” hospices allow patients to continue on disease-directed therapy, but this is negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Although receipt of hospice care has increased in recent years, the proportion of patients enrolling within 7 days has also increased.\n\n【195】无关删除-2:<u>*   Teno J.M.\n*   Gozalo P.L.\n*   Bynum J.P.\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【196】Change in end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries: site of death, place of care, and health care transitions in 2000, 2005, and 2009.\n\n【197】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 2013; 309 : 470-477</u></u>\n\n【198】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (771)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【199】Such late enrollment in hospice deprives patients and families of the chance to derive optimal benefits from hospice services\n\n【200】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bradley E.H.\n*   Prigerson H.\n*   Carlson M.D.\n*   Cherlin E.\n*   Johnson-Hurzeler R.\n*   Kasl S.V.</u>\n\n【201】Depression among surviving caregivers: does length of hospice enrollment matter?\n\n【202】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Psychiatry._ 2004; 161 : 2257-2262</u></u>\n\n【203】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (118)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【204】删除7:<u>;</u> timely referral to hospice is key to ensuring patients and families can take advantage of hospice benefits.\n\n【205】Overcoming Barriers to Hospice Use\n----------------------------------\n\n【206】Even among patients and health care professionals who understand the value of hospice, many still equate hospice to “giving up” and/or agreeing to shorten one's life. Reframing hospice as a choice to focus on _how_ one lives rather than _how long_ one lives sometimes can help patients and families accept hospice. Interestingly, care focused on comfort and quality may allow patients to live both better and perhaps a little longer.\n\n【207】无关删除-2:<u>*   Connor S.R.\n*   Pyenson B.\n*   Fitch K.\n*   Spence C.\n*   Iwasaki K.</u>\n\n【208】Comparing hospice and nonhospice patient survival among patients who die within a three-year window.\n\n【209】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Pain Symptom Manage._ 2007; 33 : 238-246</u></u>\n\n【210】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (346)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【211】When choosing hospice, most patients will also choose to forgo attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but a do-not-resuscitate order is not required. Patients who wish for comfort-focused care but, for some reason, still want the option for attempted resuscitation can be enrolled in hospice. The hospice team will continue to address the issue of code status with the patient and family.

The medical community is recognizing the importance of prioritizing medical treatments that promote quality of life along with interventions primarily aimed at prolonging survival. The expansion of primary palliative care delivered by PCPs will greatly promote symptom management and quality of life for patients throughout the course of a life-threatening illness, not just at the end. The development of new models of integrated palliative care will allow patients and families to consider their own personal goals and quality of life when making choices about the direction of their medical care. When attuned to patients' personal values, primary care providers can help individuals find meaning and joy when living with limited function and/or shortened life expectancy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Twenty-seven athletes (8.2% of total group), 1 of whom was female, reported creatine use. Of these 27 athletes, 14 (52%) were taking creatine at the time of the survey. The frequency of creatine use among past and current users was equally distributed among rarely (30%), weekly (35%), and daily (35%). Creatine users were older than nonusers (mean 16.5±1.2 vs 15.0±1.3 years; P<.001). Of creatine users, 21 (78%) were male football players. Nineteen of 24 respondents (79%) believed creatine improved their performance. Overall, 78% of users either did not know how much creatine they were taking (12/22 respondents) or were taking greater than the recommended doses (5/22 respondents). Minor gastrointestinal side effects or muscle cramps were reported by 5 (20%) of 25 respondents. Creatine users were more likely than nonusers to know other creatine users (81% vs 22%; _P_ <.001) and to use other supplements (67% vs 9%; P<.001). Creatine users obtained creatine information primarily from friends (74%) and purchased creatine predominantly from health food stores (86%).\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】High school male and female athletes as young as 14 years use creatine. Of high school athletes participating in our study, 8.2% reported creatine use. Relatively minor side effects, diarrhea, cramps, and loss of appetite, were reported. Creatine users seem to believe that creatine improves their performance, but they may lack sufficient information to make informed decisions regarding creatine use. Further larger scale study is warranted.\n\n【8】AAS ( anabolic-androgenic steroid ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), NCAA ( National Collegiate Athletic Association ), PPE ( preparticipation examination )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Polyhydramnios occurs in about 1 to 2 percent of pregnancies.\n\n【2】Most cases of polyhydramnios are mild and result from a gradual buildup of amniotic fluid during the second half of pregnancy. Severe polyhydramnios may cause shortness of breath, preterm labor, or other signs and symptoms.\n\n【3】If you're diagnosed with polyhydramnios, your health care provider will carefully monitor your pregnancy to help prevent complications. Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Mild polyhydramnios may go away on its own. Severe polyhydramnios may require closer monitoring.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Polyhydramnios symptoms result from pressure being exerted within the uterus and on nearby organs.\n\n【6】Mild polyhydramnios may cause few — if any — signs or symptoms. Severe polyhydramnios may cause:\n\n【7】*   Shortness of breath or the inability to breathe\n*   Swelling in the lower extremities and abdominal wall\n*   Uterine discomfort or contractions\n*   Fetal malposition, such as breech presentation\n\n【8】Your health care provider may also suspect polyhydramnios if your uterus is excessively enlarged and he or she has trouble feeling the baby.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Some of the known causes of polyhydramnios include:\n\n【11】*   A birth defect that affects the baby's gastrointestinal tract or central nervous system\n*   Maternal diabetes\n*   Twin-twin transfusion — a possible complication of identical twin pregnancies in which one twin receives too much blood and the other too little\n*   A lack of red blood cells in the baby (fetal anemia)\n*   Blood incompatibilities between mother and baby\n*   Infection during pregnancy\n\n【12】Often, however, the cause of polyhydramnios isn't clear.\n\n【13】Complications\n-------------\n\n【14】Polyhydramnios is associated with:\n\n【15】*   Premature birth\n*   Premature rupture of membranes — when your water breaks early\n*   Placental abruption — when the placenta peels away from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery\n*   Umbilical cord prolapse — when the umbilical cord drops into the vagina ahead of the baby\n*   C-section delivery\n*   Stillbirth\n*   Heavy bleeding due to lack of uterine muscle tone after delivery\n\n【16】The earlier that polyhydramnios occurs in pregnancy and the greater the amount of excess amniotic fluid, the higher the risk of complications.\n\n【17】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

We excluded patients with inflammatory bowel disease, history of colon polyps, or family history of CRC. All patients were followed up until the diagnosis of CRC or carcinoma in situ, death, or December 31, 2005. The risk of CRC after colonoscopy was compared with the risk after sigmoidoscopy or no lower endoscopy. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used in statistical analysis.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In the colonoscopy group (n=12,266), 58 CRCs (0.5%) were diagnosed during follow-up compared with 66 CRCs (1.0%) in the sigmoidoscopy group (n=6402) and 634 (1.5%) in the control group (n=41,410) (all _P_ <.001). In the sigmoidoscopy group, 771 patients (12.0%) underwent colonoscopy within the next 12 months. In multivariate Cox regressions, colonoscopy was associated with a decreased risk of distal CRC (hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 0.266; 95% CI, 0.161-0.437) and proximal CRC (HR, 0.451; 95% CI, 0.305-0.666); sigmoidoscopy was associated with a decreased risk of distal CRC (HR, 0.409; 95% CI, 0.207-0.809) but not proximal CRC.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Among older patients, the risk of distal CRC decreased after both colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy; the risk of proximal CRC decreased after colonoscopy but not sigmoidoscopy.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CRC ( colorectal cancer ), HR ( hazard ratio ), ICD-9 ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ), SEER ( Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "cf10ec7c-eb15-4506-899f-438ebef94c14", "title": "Olodaterol (Inhalation Route)", "text": "【0】Olodaterol (Inhalation Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Striverdi Respimat\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Olodaterol is used for the long-term maintenance treatment of air flow blockage in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is a long-term lung disease that causes bronchospasm (wheezing or difficulty with breathing).\n\n【6】Olodaterol belongs to the family of medicines known as adrenergic bronchodilators. Bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Spray\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Olodaterol is not for use in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of olodaterol in the elderly.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【23】*   Acebutolol\n*   Arotinolol\n*   Atenolol\n*   Befunolol\n*   Betaxolol\n*   Bevantolol\n*   Bisoprolol\n*   Bopindolol\n*   Bucindolol\n*   Bupranolol\n*   Carteolol\n*   Carvedilol\n*   Celiprolol\n*   Dilevalol\n*   Esmolol\n*   Labetalol\n*   Landiolol\n*   Levobunolol\n*   Mepindolol\n*   Methacholine\n*   Metipranolol\n*   Metoprolol\n*   Nadolol\n*   Nebivolol\n*   Oxprenolol\n*   Penbutolol\n*   Pindolol\n*   Practolol\n*   Propranolol\n*   Sotalol\n*   Talinolol\n*   Tertatolol\n*   Timolol\n\n【24】### Other Interactions\n\n【25】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【26】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【27】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【28】*   Asthma—Use is not recommended in patients with this condition without an inhaled steroid medicine.\n\n【29】*   COPD attack, severe—Should not be used if you are having a severe COPD attack or if symptoms of a COPD attack has already started. Your doctor may prescribe another medicine for you to use in case of an acute COPD attack.\n\n【30】*   Diabetes or\n*   Heart or blood vessel disease (eg, coronary insufficiency, obstructive cardiomyopathy) or\n*   Heart rhythm problems (eg, arrhythmia, QT prolongation) or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) or\n*   Hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood) or\n*   Seizures or\n*   Thyroid problems (eg, thyrotoxicosis)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【31】*   Liver disease, severe—Use has not been studied in patients with this condition.\n\n【32】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【33】Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using this medicine or any asthma medicine without telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of breathing problems.\n\n【34】This medicine is used with a special inhaler and usually comes with a patient information leaflet or patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using this medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.\n\n【35】Use this medicine at the same time each day to prevent COPD attacks.\n\n【36】Do not stop using this medicine or other breathing medicines that your doctor has prescribed for you unless you have discussed this with your doctor.\n\n【37】When you use the inhaler for the first time, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. Therefore, before using the inhaler, prime it by pressing the dose-release button until you see a mist, then press the button 3 more times. If you have not used the inhaler for more than 3 days, prime it once before use. If you have not used it for more than 21 days, press the dose-release button until you see a mist, then press it 3 more times.\n\n【38】To use the inhaler:\n\n【39】*   Take the inhaler and cartridge out of the carton before you use it for the first time.\n*   Do not use the inhaler for this medicine with any other medicine.\n*   Push the narrow end of the cartridge into the inhaler. About 1/8 of an inch will remain visible when the cartridge is correctly inserted.\n*   Do not turn the clear base before inserting the cartridge.\n*   Do not remove the cartridge once it has been inserted in the inhaler.\n*   Flip the yellow cap until it snaps fully open. Turn the clear base in the direction of the black arrows on the label until it clicks (half a turn).\n*   Prime the inhaler before use by releasing 4 test sprays.\n*   To inhale this medicine, breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible. Put the mouthpiece fully into your mouth and close your lips around it without closing the air vents. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue. Point the inhaler to the back of your throat.\n*   While pressing down firmly and fully on the dose release button of the inhaler, breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath.\n*   Hold your breath for about 10 seconds or for as long as you can, then breathe out. Repeat these steps for the next puff.\n*   Close the yellow cap after taking your medicine.\n*   Clean the mouthpiece, including the metal part inside the mouthpiece, with a damp cloth or tissue only, at least once a week.\n\n【40】### Dosing\n\n【41】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【42】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【43】*   For inhalation dosage form (spray):\n    *   For maintenance treatment of COPD:\n        *   Adults—Two puffs once a day. Do not use more than 2 puffs every 24 hours.\n        *   Children—Use is not recommended.\n\n【44】### Missed Dose\n\n【45】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【46】### Storage\n\n【47】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【48】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【49】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【50】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【51】Throw away the inhaler 3 months after its first use, or when the inhaler is locked, or when it expires.\n\n【52】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【53】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure the medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.\n\n【54】This medicine should not be used together with similar inhaled medicines, such as albuterol (Proventil®, Ventolin®), isoproterenol (Isuprel®), metaproterenol (Alupent®), pirbuterol (Maxair®), or terbutaline (Bricanyl®).\n\n【55】Tell your doctor if you are also using any other medicine for your COPD. Your doctor may want you to use it only during a severe COPD attack. Follow your doctor's instructions on how you should take your medicine.\n\n【56】This medicine should not be used if you are having a severe asthma or COPD attack, or if symptoms of an asthma or COPD attack has already started. Your doctor may prescribe another medicine for you to use in case of an acute COPD attack. If the other medicine does not work as well, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【57】Talk with your doctor or get medical care right away if:\n\n【58】*   Your symptoms do not improve after using this medicine or if they become worse.\n*   Your short-acting inhaler does not seem to work as well as it used to and you need it more often than normal.\n*   You have a big decrease in your peak flow when measured as directed by your doctor.\n\n【59】This medicine may increase the risk of worsening asthma, which may lead to hospitalization, intubation, and death in patients with asthma who take this medicine without an inhaled steroid medicine. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this.\n\n【60】This medicine may cause paradoxical bronchospasm, which means your breathing or wheezing will get worse. Paradoxical bronchospasm may be life-threatening. Check with your doctor right away if you have coughing, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, or wheezing after using this medicine.\n\n【61】Olodaterol may cause heart or blood vessel problems, including heart rhythm problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain or tightness, decreased urine output, dilated neck veins, extreme fatigue, irregular heartbeat, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, troubled breathing, or weight gain.\n\n【62】Hypokalemia (low potassium in the blood) may occur while you are using this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have more than one of the following symptoms: convulsions (seizures), decreased urine, dry mouth, increased thirst, irregular heartbeat, loss of appetite, mood changes, muscle pain or cramps, nausea or vomiting, numbness or tingling in the hands, feet, or lips, shortness of breath, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【63】This medicine may affect blood sugar levels. If you are diabetic and notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests, check with your doctor.\n\n【64】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, a large, hive-like swelling on the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, throat, hands, legs, feet, or genitals, trouble breathing, or chest tightness while you are using this medicine.\n\n【65】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【66】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【67】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【68】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【69】#### More common\n\n【70】1.

{"seq_id": "d806038f-a606-43b9-a459-23d0b6d79bf9", "title": "Cystic fibrosis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body.\n\n【2】Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery. But in people with CF, a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. Instead of acting as lubricants, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas.\n\n【3】Although cystic fibrosis is progressive and requires daily care, people with CF are usually able to attend school and work. They often have a better quality of life than people with CF had in previous decades. Improvements in screening and treatments mean that people with CF now may live into their mid- to late 30s or 40s, and some are living into their 50s.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】In the U.S. because of newborn screening, cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. But people born before newborn screening became available may not be diagnosed until the signs and symptoms of CF show up.\n\n【6】Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until their teenage years or adulthood. People who are not diagnosed until adulthood usually have milder disease and are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of an inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia.\n\n【7】People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF affect the respiratory system and digestive system.\n\n【8】### Respiratory signs and symptoms\n\n【9】The thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. This can cause signs and symptoms such as:\n\n【10】*   A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum)\n*   Wheezing\n*   Exercise intolerance\n*   Repeated lung infections\n*   Inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose\n*   Recurrent sinusitis\n\n【11】### Digestive signs and symptoms\n\n【12】The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren't able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. The result is often:\n\n【13】*   Foul-smelling, greasy stools\n*   Poor weight gain and growth\n*   Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus)\n*   Chronic or severe constipation, which may include frequent straining while trying to pass stool, eventually causing part of the rectum to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse)\n\n【14】### When to see a doctor\n\n【15】If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis — or if someone in your family has CF — talk with your doctor about testing for the disease. Consult a physician who is knowledgeable about CF.\n\n【16】Cystic fibrosis requires consistent, regular follow-up with your doctor, at least every three months. Contact you doctor if you experience new or worsening symptoms, such as more mucus than usual or a change in the mucus color, lack of energy, weight loss, or severe constipation.\n\n【17】Seek immediate medical care if you're coughing up blood, have chest pain or difficulty breathing, or have severe stomach pain and distention.\n\n【18】Causes\n------\n\n【19】In cystic fibrosis, a defect (mutation) in a gene — the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene — changes a protein that regulates the movement of salt in and out of cells. The result is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as increased salt in sweat.\n\n【20】Many different defects can occur in the gene. The type of gene mutation is associated with the severity of the condition.\n\n【21】Children need to inherit one copy of the gene from each parent in order to have the disease. If children inherit only one copy, they won't develop cystic fibrosis. However, they will be carriers and could pass the gene to their own children.\n\n【22】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【23】Because cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder, it runs in families, so family history is a risk factor. Although CF occurs in all races, it's most common in white people of Northern European ancestry.\n\n【24】Complications\n-------------\n\n【25】Complications of cystic fibrosis can affect the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as other organs.\n\n【26】### Respiratory system complications\n\n【27】*   **Damaged airways (bronchiectasis).** Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of bronchiectasis, a chronic lung condition with abnormal widening and scarring of the airways (bronchial tubes). This makes it harder to move air in and out of the lungs and clear mucus from the bronchial tubes.\n*   **Chronic infections.** Thick mucus in the lungs and sinuses provides an ideal breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. People with cystic fibrosis may often have sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia. Infection with bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics and difficult to treat is common.\n*   **Growths in the nose (nasal polyps).** Because the lining inside the nose is inflamed and swollen, it can develop soft, fleshy growths (polyps).\n*   **Coughing up blood (hemoptysis).** Bronchiectasis can occur next to blood vessels in the lungs. The combination of airway damage and infection can result in coughing up blood. Often this is only a small amount of blood, but it can also be life-threatening.\n*   **Pneumothorax.** In this condition, air leaks into the space that separates the lungs from the chest wall, and part or all of a lung collapses. This is more common in adults with cystic fibrosis. Pneumothorax can cause sudden chest pain and breathlessness. People often feel a bubbling sensation in the chest.\n*   **Respiratory failure.** Over time, cystic fibrosis can damage lung tissue so badly that it no longer works. Lung function usually worsens gradually, and it eventually can become life-threatening. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death.\n*   **Acute exacerbations.** People with cystic fibrosis may experience worsening of their respiratory symptoms, such as coughing with more mucus and shortness of breath. This is called an acute exacerbation and requires treatment with antibiotics. Sometimes treatment can be provided at home, but hospitalization may be needed. Decreased energy and weight loss also are common during exacerbations.\n\n【28】### Digestive system complications\n\n【29】*   **Nutritional deficiencies.** Thick mucus can block the tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your intestines. Without these enzymes, your body can't absorb protein, fats or fat-soluble vitamins, so you can't get enough nutrients. This can result in delayed growth, weight loss or inflammation of the pancreas.\n*   **Diabetes.** The pancreas produces insulin, which your body needs to use sugar. Cystic fibrosis increases the risk of diabetes. About 20% of teenagers and 40% to 50% of adults with CF develop diabetes.\n*   **Liver disease.** The tube that carries bile from your liver and gallbladder to your small intestine may become blocked and inflamed. This can lead to liver problems, such as jaundice, fatty liver disease and cirrhosis — and sometimes gallstones.\n*   **Intestinal obstruction.** Intestinal blockage can happen to people with cystic fibrosis at all ages. Intussusception, a condition in which a segment of the intestine slides inside an adjacent section of the intestine like a collapsible telescope, also can occur.\n*   **Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS).** DIOS is partial or complete obstruction where the small intestine meets the large intestine. DIOS requires urgent treatment.\n\n【30】### Reproductive system complications\n\n【31】*   **Infertility in men.** Almost all men with cystic fibrosis are infertile because the tube that connects the testes and prostate gland (vas deferens) is either blocked with mucus or missing entirely. Certain fertility treatments and surgical procedures sometimes make it possible for men with CF to become biological fathers.\n*   **Reduced fertility in women.** Although women with cystic fibrosis may be less fertile than other women, it's possible for them to conceive and to have successful pregnancies. Still, pregnancy can worsen the signs and symptoms of CF, so be sure to discuss the possible risks with your doctor.\n\n【32】### Other complications\n\n【33】*   **Thinning of the bones (osteoporosis).** People with cystic fibrosis are at higher risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones. They may also experience joint pain, arthritis and muscle pain.\n*   **Electrolyte imbalances and dehydration.** Because people with cystic fibrosis have saltier sweat, the balance of minerals in their blood may be upset. This makes them prone to dehydration, especially with exercise or in hot weather. Signs and symptoms include increased heart rate, fatigue, weakness and low blood pressure.\n*   **Mental health problems.** Dealing with a chronic illness that has no cure may cause fear, depression and anxiety.\n\n【34】Prevention\n----------\n\n【35】If you or your partner has close relatives with cystic fibrosis, you both may choose to have genetic testing before having children. The test, which is performed in a lab on a sample of blood, can help determine your risk of having a child with CF.\n\n【36】If you're already pregnant and the genetic test shows that your baby may be at risk of cystic fibrosis, your doctor can conduct additional tests on your developing child.\n\n【37】Genetic testing isn't for everyone. Before you decide to be tested, you should talk to a genetic counselor about the psychological impact the test results might carry.\n\n【38】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "9371eafa-4d8c-4aea-83e0-ac8d021e6254", "title": "Praziquantel (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Praziquantel (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Biltricide\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Praziquantel is used to treat schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever or bilharzia, an infection of the urinary tract or bowels, caused by schistosoma (blood fluke), a flatworm parasite. It is also used to treat clonorchiasis infection caused by the Chinese or Oriental liver fluke (Clonorchis sinensis) or opisthorchiasis infection caused by the Southeast Asian liver fluke (Opisthorchis viverrini).\n\n【6】Blood flukes live in freshwater snails and are spread into the surrounding waters (eg, pond). You may get infected when you swim or get in these waters. They enter the body through the skin and travel until they reach your bowels where they grow and lay eggs. Sometimes, the eggs get in the liver, which causes chronic inflammation. Infections with a liver fluke usually occur after eating contaminated raw or undercooked freshwater fish, crabs, or crayfish. They travel from your bowels to the bile ducts in the liver where they live and grow. Most patients infected with liver flukes do not show any symptoms, which may cause the infection to last a long time.\n\n【7】Praziquantel belongs to the family of medicines called anthelmintics. Anthelmintics are used in the treatment of worm infections. Praziquantel works by causing severe spasms and paralysis of the worms' muscles. Some kinds of worms are then passed in the stool. However, you may not notice them since they are sometimes completely destroyed in the bowels.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of praziquantel in children 1 year of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 1 year of age.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of praziquantel in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution for patients receiving praziquantel.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

The effects may be increased by slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【35】*   Ocular cysticercosis (tapeworm cysts in the eye)—Should not be used in patients with this condition.\n\n【36】*   Worm cysts in the brain—Your doctor may want you to be in the hospital to treat this infection.\n\n【37】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【38】Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.\n\n【39】Praziquantel has a bitter taste that may cause gagging or vomiting. The bitter taste may be more noticeable if the tablets are held in the mouth or chewed. Therefore, do not chew praziquantel tablets. Swallow the tablets whole with water during meals.\n\n【40】If your child cannot swallow the tablet, you may crush or dissolve and mix it with semi-solid food or liquid. Take the mixture within 1 hour of mixing.\n\n【41】Do not break the tablet unless your doctor tells you to. If you have been told to break your tablet, you can break off a part by pressing the notch with your thumbnails. If one-fourth of a tablet is required, break the tablet from the outer end.\n\n【42】Keep using this medicine for the full treatment time, even if you feel better after the first few doses. Your infection may not clear up if you stop using the medicine too soon.\n\n【43】Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using this medicine.\n\n【44】### Dosing\n\n【45】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【46】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【47】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   For clonorchiasis (Chinese or Oriental liver fluke) and opisthorchiasis (liver flukes):\n        *   Adults and children 1 year of age and older—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The dose is 25 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight taken 3 times a day for 1 day only. Each dose should be at least 4 hours apart and not more than 6 hours apart.\n        *   Children younger than 1 year of age—Use and dose must be determined by the doctor.\n    *   For schistosomiasis:\n        *   Adults and children 1 year of age and older—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor.

{"seq_id": "fdd3fe99-a787-4c06-9e93-fa3bb05ba61f", "title": "Association Between Public Trust and Provider Specialty Among Physicians With Financial Conflicts of Interest", "text": "【0】Association Between Public Trust and Provider Specialty Among Physicians With Financial Conflicts of Interest\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Objectives\n\n【2】To characterize public perception of physicians’ conflicts of interest (COIs) across medical and surgical specialties.\n\n【3】### Patients and Methods\n\n【4】A cross-sectional 6-arm randomized survey of a nonprobability sample from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk occurred on December 11 to 16, 2018. Survey respondents were randomly assigned to vignettes that varied the physician specialty with COI. The primary outcome was mean difference in Mayer Trust, and the secondary outcome included the proportion who desire to discontinue care.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】There were 1729 of 1920 respondents who completed the experiment (90.1% completion rate). Respondents were male (52.5%; n=907), white (71.4%; n=1234), and between the ages of 25 and 44 years (70.9%; n=1227). Mean ± SD Mayer Trust across the 6 specialties was 3.7±.60, with the only between-specialty differences observed for psychiatry compared with the other specialties ( _F_ \\=5.4; _P_ <.001). The median dollar amount that would affect respondents’ trust in a physician was $5000 (interquartile range, $100-$100,000). A total of 75.1% (n=1298) of respondents desired COI information, with 41.6% (n=720) discontinuing care. Age older than 34 years (adjusted odds ratio \\[aOR\\], 0.7; 95%, CI, 0.49-0.99; _P_ \\=.047), nonwhite race (aOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.02-1.6; _P_ \\=.03), educational attainment of 4 or more years of college (aOR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.6; _P_ \\=.016), and physician specialty as a psychiatrist (aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.03-2.2; _P_ \\=.034) were predictors for discontinuing care.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Public COI disclosure is a common method for managing financial conflicts. Although survey respondents were more likely to discontinue care with a physician with COI, they will act on this knowledge of COI differently depending on the specialty of the physician. The finding that psychiatry is an outlier may be a chance finding that warrants further confirmation.

The lesions started initially as macular discoloration of the cheeks but evolved into indurated, erythematous plaques involving the entire face, trunk, and bilateral upper and lower extremities. The patient also experienced flattening of the nasal bridge and loss of bilateral eyebrows. The lesions on the extremities were associated with numbness and swelling of the hands and feet. The patient had palpable, nodular thickening of ulnar and sural nerves and diffuse skin changes. Biopsy of the right earlobe and sural nerve showed granulomatous inflammation. Numerous acid-fast organisms were seen on Fite method and auramine-rhodamine stains, suggestive of multibacillary (lepromatous) leprosy. Electromyographic findings indicated axonal length-dependent sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. A treatment regimen of clofazimine, dapsone, and rifampin was initiated, with a planned duration of 2 years.

Lipmann is credited with formulating the general rules for the biotechnology of energy transmission and was a major participant in deciphering the cellular, catalytic, and energetic mechanisms needed to understand how the body builds and renews itself.\n\n【2】Lipmann, whose father was a lawyer, was born on June 12, 1899, in Königsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Lipmann's uncle was a pediatrician and had a great influence on Lipmann's decision to become a physician. Lipmann entered the University of Königsberg in 1917, but his education was interrupted when he served in the German army medical corps during the last months of World War I (1914–1918). After the war, he enrolled at the University of Munich (Germany) and later at the University of Berlin (Germany), from which he received an MD degree in 1924. After receiving his medical degree, he changed his interest to biochemistry. He worked under the direction of Otto Meyerhof (1884–1951) at the University of Berlin and received a PhD degree in 1927.\n\n【3】In 1927, Lipmann became a research assistant to Meyerhof at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin. When Meyerhof moved to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, Lipmann accompanied him, serving as his assistant from 1927 to 1931. In 1931, Lipmann returned to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin to become an assistant to Albert Fischer, who taught him to grow fibroblasts in an in vitro culture, a technique useful in studies of cellular metabolism. In 1932, Lipmann joined Fischer in a new laboratory at the Biological Institute of the Carlsberg Foundation in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he remained until 1939.\n\n【4】In 1939, Nazi control and aggression in Denmark prompted Lipmann to emigrate to the United States, where he became associated with Cornell Medical School in New York City and worked with American biochemist Vincent Du Vigneaud (1901–1978), winner of a 1955 Nobel Prize for the first synthesis of a polypeptide hormone. Lipmann remained at Cornell University until 1941, when he left to become a physician and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1944. From 1949 to 1957, he served as director of the biochemical research department and professor of biological chemistry at the Harvard Medical School.\n\n【5】In 1941, Lipmann proposed the theory of a metabolic dynamo, with adenosine triphosphate as the general link between energy generation and utilization. In the course of his studies on the chemical nature of the active acetate (the building block of lipids) and an intermediary of carbohydrate oxidation, he discovered a new coenzyme, the acetyl-carrying coenzyme A. In 1947, he isolated and named the coenzyme, and in 1953, he determined its molecular structure. Now, coenzyme A is known to be bound to acetic acid as the end product of sugar and fat breakdown in the absence of oxygen. Coenzyme A is one of the most important substances involved in cellular metabolism. It helps in the conversion of amino acids, steroids, fatty acids, and hemoalobin into energy.\n\n【6】In 1957, Lipmann moved to the Rockefeller Institute (now Rockefeller University) in New York City, where he served as a teacher and researcher until his death on July 24, 1986, in Poughkeepsie, NY, at the age of 87 years.\n\n【7】Although Lipmann's major work was in the classification of energy-producing phosphates, he also did research on the thyroid gland, fibroblasts, the Pasteur effect (in the presence of oxygen, anaerobic glycolysis is suppressed), glycolysis in embryo cell metabolism, and the mechanism of peptide and protein synthesis.\n\n【8】In 1995, Grenada issued a stamp in his honor. The stamp is 1 of a set of 9 honoring Nobel laureates.\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【11】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/75.1.30</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>© 2000 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Each nutrient was associated with a specific disease, the approximate mechanism of its action was elucidated, and programs of supplementation or fortification that led to control or virtual elimination of the disease were implemented, more or less in that order. Most of this occurred more than half a century ago, and with those gains to its credit, nutrition has virtually disappeared from the radar screens of many, perhaps most, medical specialties. Except for alleged negative effects (eg, fat, salt, cholesterol), what more did nutrition have to offer human medicine?\n\n【1】In essentially every instance, the index disease for each of the classic micronutrients had a short latency; otherwise the connection between cause (deficient intake) and effect (deficiency disease) could not have been discerned. Deficiency conditions that have long latencies are not precluded, and expanded understanding of cell biology suggests that they may, perhaps must, exist. Nevertheless, they have proved difficult to recognize, as have deficiency states that develop through mechanisms different from those understood to mediate the index disease.\n\n【2】Today, at the beginning of its second century as a science, clinical nutrition faces 2 major and very different problems: (1) the need to develop investigative approaches to define the role nutritional deficiency plays in a broad array of chronic diseases and (2) the fact that American medicine tends either to ignore\n\n【3】无关删除-2:<u>*   Leaf A</u>\n\n【4】Dietary prevention of coronary heart disease: the Lyon Diet Heart Study \\[editorial\\].\n\n【5】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Circulation._ 1999; 99 : 733-735</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (72)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【7】or to dismiss\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>*   Goodwin JS\n*   Tangum MR</u>\n\n【9】Battling quackery: attitudes about micronutrient supplements in American academic medicine.\n\n【10】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Intern Med._ 1998; 158 : 2187-2191</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (43)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【12】nutritional evidence relating to the diseases it treats.\n\n【13】In the current issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , Holick\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   Holick MF</u>\n\n【15】High prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy and implications for health.\n\n【16】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2006; 81 : 353-373</u></u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1532)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【18】summarizes a massive body of data indicating that vitamin D, in addition to its classic role in the calcium economy, is involved in many other systems and diseases.

We now know that vitamin D is intimately involved in regulating gene expression for such basic cell biologic processes as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, in addition to various aspects of both primary and acquired immunity. The ubiquity of vitamin D involvement suggests that deficiency of the nutrient could be expressed in myriad ways distinct from rickets and osteomalacia. Defining optimal vitamin D status in this context will prove challenging because most chronic diseases typically share 2 characteristics that make investigation difficult: long latency and multifactorial causation.\n\n【24】The challenge is not only to determine whether changing vitamin D status will alter development or severity of any of the conditions concerned but also to figure out how to show efficacy in a context of long latency, a problem not readily attacked by randomized controlled trials. There are also the lesser problems of determining how much vitamin D is needed to optimize a given system and how most effectively to improve vitamin D status for whole populations. At stake are far-reaching consequences for nutritional policy. Current micronutrient intake recommendations are pegged to preventing only the index disease. That will have to change. For vitamin D, current recommendations are sufficient to prevent only rickets. We already know that that is not enough to prevent the portion of the osteoporosis burden caused by low vitamin D status.\n\n【25】Vitamin D is actually a sort of poster child for a broad array of essential nutrients, many of which are now known to function in diverse systems and, for some of their effects, to exhibit latencies varying from days to years (the latter of course not recognizable in the early days of nutritional science). Calcium is a good example because both its multiple system involvement and mechanisms of some of its manifold actions are now reasonably well worked out.\n\n【26】Inadequate calcium intake depletes or limits skeletal mass, which functions as the body's calcium nutrient reserve, thereby causing or aggravating osteoporosis.\n\n【27】无关删除-2:<u>*   Heaney RP</u>\n\n【28】Bone as the calcium nutrient reserve.\n\n【29】无关删除-2:<u>in: Weaver CM Heaney RP Calcium in Human Health.

For example, unabsorbed calcium in the gut lumen (which averages about 90% of intake) complexes and neutralizes certain potentially harmful byproducts of digestion, such as oxalic acid, free fatty acids, and bile acids.

Folate facilitates 1-carbon transfers for an array of biochemical systems ranging from thymine synthesis, needed in all rapidly growing tissues, to DNA methylation, involved in regulation of gene expression.\n\n【57】Additionally, folate shares with calcium and vitamin D the feature that, for some of the manifestations of deficiency, the pathogenesis can be indirect. For example, low folate levels lead to decreases in methylation of homocysteine. Serum homocysteine levels rise, and the compound binds irreversibly to disulfide bonds in extracellular elastic proteins. In this way, folate deficiency is postulated to lead to age-related deterioration in connective tissues,\n\n【58】无关删除-2:<u>*   Krumdieck CL\n*   Prince CW</u>\n\n【59】Mechanisms of homocysteine toxicity on connective tissues: implications for the morbidity of aging.\n\n【60】删除3:<u>_J Nutr._ 2000; 130 : 365S-368S</u>\n\n【61】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【62】an outcome with a long latency.\n\n【63】Similarly, for both calcium and vitamin D, low inputs evoke increases in parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, a physiologically appropriate response to reduced intake or absorption of calcium. However, long-term high PTH levels, in addition to mitigating the effect of reduced intestinal calcium input, have several collateral effects. One is an increase in bone remodeling.

Even with rickets, the classic deficiency disease for vitamin D, the pathology is produced not so much by malabsorption of calcium and phosphorus, which is the direct effect of vitamin D deficiency, but by hypophosphatemia caused by PTH's lowering of the renal reabsorption of filtered phosphorus, an indirect effect of vitamin D deficiency.\n\n【69】For both vitamin D and calcium, such collateral damage extends well beyond the arena of the calcium economy. High calcitriol production in response to elevated PTH levels, in addition to promoting calcium absorption, opens calcium channels in a variety of tissues,\n\n【70】无关删除-2:<u>*   Shi H\n*   Norman AW\n*   Okamura WH\n*   Sen A\n*   Zemel MB</u>\n\n【71】1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <sub>3 </sub> modulates human adipocyte metabolism via nongenomic action.\n\n【72】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_FASEB J._ 2001; 15 : 2751-2753</u></u>\n\n【73】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【74】increasing intracellular \\[Ca  \\] and thereby augmenting cell expression of such tissue-specific effects as arteriolar smooth muscle contraction. This is likely the mechanism behind the small, but important, blood pressure reduction produced by increased calcium intake, and as Holick notes in his review, the corresponding blood pressure lowering effect of increased vitamin D intake as well.\n\n【75】The rich complexity of these interactions makes it clear why a simplistic 1-nutrient-1-disease model of nutrition is woefully inadequate. At the same time, it forces us to confront the difficulty of designing investigative approaches that are sufficient to demonstrate and quantify benefit from altered nutrient input at a population level. Which end point should we choose? How large a nutrient input should we use? How will we separate its effects from those of other simultaneously acting causal factors?\n\n【76】无关删除-2:<u>Even the short latency disorders present challenges, partly because of substantial population heterogeneity and partly because of medicine's seeming preference for pharmacological solutions to medical disease. The former is exemplified by the fact that redundancies in intracellular signaling systems and/or ability to defend intracellular \\[Ca  \\] against unstimulated inputs varies considerably from individual to individual, just as, for example, does salt sensitivity. The preference for pharmacological solutions is illustrated nicely by Holick's description of efforts to develop noncalcemic analogues of calcitriol. Doing this may seem to follow naturally from the fact that calcitriol is the principal biologically active form of vitamin D. However, it also presumes that it is _serum_ calcitriol that is responsible for the effects of the vitamin. That is true for vitamin D's role in intestinal calcium absorption but appears not to be the case for the probably more important autocrine actions of vitamin D.</u>\n\n【77】One of the most exciting of the discoveries described by Holick is the finding that many cell types—perhaps most epithelial and immune response cells—express the vitamin D 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B). They are able to synthesize and degrade calcitriol intracellularly. As a consequence, rather than all tissues responding to, or being dependent on, the same circulating calcitriol level, each tissue can make what it currently needs for itself. All that is required is an adequate availability of the precursor, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25\\[OH\\]D). The 1α-hydroxylase operates well below its k <sub>M </sub> , and hence intracellular calcitriol synthesis is critically dependent on substrate concentration. It follows that, for most vitamin D-related disorders, the best (and most physiological) solution may be simple elevation of serum 25(OH)D by ensuring adequate inputs of cholecalciferol, not expensive drugs.\n\n【78】However, there will be a few situations in which such an approach is not likely to be adequate, principally because of abnormalities of intracellular calcitriol metabolism (eg, loss of the 1α-hydroxylase or overexpression of the 24-hydroxylase). That may be the case for human myelodysplasia\n\n【79】无关删除-2:<u>*   Mellibovsky L\n*   Diez A\n*   Perez-Vila E\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【80】Vitamin D treatment in myelodysplastic syndromes.\n\n【81】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Br J Haematol._ 1998; 100 : 516-520</u></u>\n\n【82】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (42)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【83】and has been demonstrated for at least 1 cancer model—a mouse mammary tumor that has lost the 1α-hydroxylase but reverts to a quasinormal phenotype on exposure to exogenous calcitriol.\n\n【84】无关删除-2:<u>*   Welsh J</u>\n\n【85】Vitamin D and breast cancer: insights from animal models.\n\n【86】删除3:<u>_Am J Clin Nutr._ 2004; 80 : 1721S-1724S</u>\n\n【87】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【88】The concentration of 25(OH)D in serum that is required to optimize all vitamin D-related functions remains uncertain, but there is a growing consensus that it is at least 32 ng/mL (80 nmol/L) and may be as high as 48 ng/mL (120 nmol/L). Both values are lower than those found in outdoor workers in the tropics and hence are still less than the primitive levels to which human physiology adapted over the course of evolution. Fortunately, contemporary evidence confirms that such levels are safe: no credible reports exist of vitamin D toxicity at serum 25(OH)D levels below 500 nmol/L (J. N. Hathcock, PhD, A. Shao, PhD, R. Vieth, PhD, R.P.H. unpublished data, January 2006).\n\n【89】From the standpoint of public health, it would logically be necessary to demonstrate efficacy of increased serum 25(OH)D for only one of the disorders that may be vitamin D dependent. Preventing that one outcome could automatically produce other possible benefits without having to demonstrate each of them, one by one. “Proof” (or lack thereof) would then come from change in public health statistics, as occurred for dental caries after water fluoridation or for pellagra and neural tube defects after fortification of cereal products with niacin and folate, respectively.\n\n【90】Virtually the entire populations of the industrialized nations have substantially lower vitamin D inputs than our ancestors in equatorial East Africa. The extent to which that lower input is “deficient” is what is at issue and remains to be conclusively shown. But, imagine, if you will, a search for the cause of lung cancer in a population of cigarette smokers. Identifying differences between those who do and do not develop cancer tells us nothing about cause, only about individual susceptibility. Is that the situation we face with vitamin D and the multiplicity of chronic diseases in the industrialized nations?\n\n【91】The triumphs of nutrition are not all behind us. If only a small fraction of the disorders for which a plausible vitamin D hypothesis can be framed turn out to be due at least in part to inadequate vitamin D status, and if we act on that knowledge, the medicine of the future could look extremely different from that of today.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

You do not need to keep a schedule for taking it.\n\n【51】### Storage\n\n【52】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【53】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【54】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【55】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【56】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【57】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【58】Using this medicine during the last 3 months of pregnancy can harm your newborn baby. Check with your doctor right away if your baby has pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, difficult or trouble breathing, excessive sleepiness, or limpness. Tell your doctor right away if you are pregnant or if you think you have become pregnant while using this medicine.\n\n【59】If you think you need to take zolpidem for more than 7 to 10 days, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Insomnia that lasts longer than this may be a sign of another medical problem.\n\n【60】Zolpidem may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hives, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat while you are using this medicine.\n\n【61】This medicine may cause you to do things while you are still asleep that you may not remember the next morning. It is possible you could drive a car, sleepwalk, have sex, make phone calls, or prepare and eat food while you are asleep or not fully awake. Tell your doctor right away if you learn that any of these has happened.\n\n【62】This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. CNS depressants are medicines that slow down the nervous system, which may cause drowsiness or make you less alert. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, barbiturates or medicine for seizures, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics. This effect may last for a few days after you stop taking this medicine. Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are using this medicine.\n\n【63】This medicine may cause some people, especially older persons, to become drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, clumsy or unsteady, or less alert than they are normally, which may lead to falls. Even though zolpidem is taken at bedtime, it may cause some people to feel drowsy or less alert on arising. Also, this medicine may cause double vision or other vision problems, or severe injuries (eg, hip fractures, severe bleeding in the head). Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\n【64】If you develop any unusual and strange thoughts or behavior while you are using zolpidem, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Some changes that have occurred in people using this medicine are like those seen in people who drink alcohol and then act in a manner that is not normal. Other changes may be more unusual and extreme, such as confusion, worsening of depression, hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there), suicidal thoughts, and unusual excitement, nervousness, or irritability.\n\n【65】Do not change your dose or stop using it without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping completely. This may help prevent a worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, including confusion as to time, place, or person, hallucinations, holding false beliefs that cannot be changed by fact, seizures, stomach or muscle cramps, tremors, unusual excitement, nervousness, or restlessness, or vomiting.\n\n【66】If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once. Taking an overdose of zolpidem or taking alcohol or other CNS depressants with zolpidem may lead to serious breathing problems (eg, respiratory depression) and unconsciousness. Symptoms of an overdose include: severe drowsiness, severe nausea or vomiting, staggering, and trouble breathing.\n\n【67】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal (eg, St. John's wort) or vitamin supplements.\n\n【68】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【69】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【70】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【71】#### Less common\n\n【72】1.

It remains a frequent cause of unexpected deaths. Traditionally, the diagnostic work-up for suspected PE has centered on the use of ventilation-perfusion (V-P) radionuclide lung scanning. However, V-P scanning does not provide adequate confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis in the majority of patients who undergo this test. Although published guidelines advise further diagnostic testing after nondiagnostic V-P scans, clinicians infrequently perform such testing, and management decisions are commonly based on clinical judgment. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the use of computed tomographic (CT) angiography in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected PE. Although there are unresolved issues regarding its sensitivity in detecting small peripheral emboli, CT angiography is more accurate than V-P scanning in the diagnosis of PE and yields other intrathoracic diagnoses. Herein we summarize the problems with the traditional approach centered on the use of V-P scanning in the diagnosis of PE and propose an alternative diagnostic strategy based primarily on the use of CT angiography.\n\n【1】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【2】CT ( computed tomography ), DVT ( deep venous thrombosis ), ECG ( electrocardiogram ), ELISA ( enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ), IPG ( impedance plethysmography ), MR ( magnetic resonance ), PE ( pulmonary embolism ), PIOPED ( Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis ), US ( ultrasonography ), V-P ( ventilation-perfusion ), VTE ( venous thromboembolism )\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

As part of the study, enrolled patients completed both the ACT™/CACT™ and the Asthma APGAR system between March 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011. Kappa and McNemar statistics were used to compare the results of questionnaires.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of the 468 patients in our sample, 306 (65%) were classified as not controlled by the ACT™/CACT™ or the Asthma APGAR system. The overall agreement was 84.4%, with a kappa value of .68 (substantial agreement) and a McNemar test _P_ value of .35 (suggesting no significant difference in the direction of disagreement). Of those with poor control as defined by the Asthma APGAR system, 23.8% (73) had no controller medications and 76.5% (234) were seldom or sometimes able to avoid identified triggers for their asthma. Of those who stated that they had been prescribed controller medications, 116 of 332 (35%) stated that they did not use the controller medication on a daily basis.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The Asthma APGAR system and the ACT™/CACT™ similarly assess asthma control in a multicenter primary care–based sample. The Asthma APGAR system identified an “actionable item” in more than 75% (234) of the individuals with poor asthma control, thus linking an assessment of poor asthma control with a management strategy.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACT™ ( Asthma Control Test ), ACQ ( Asthma Control Questionnaire ), AQLQ ( Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire ), CACT™ ( Childhood Asthma Control Test ), GINA ( Global Initiative for Asthma ), IRB ( institutional review board ), PAQLQ ( Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Our primary objective was prediction of AKI using extant clinical data following ICU admission. We used random forest classification to provide continuous AKI risk score.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We included 4572 and 1958 patients in the training and validation mutually exclusive cohorts, respectively. Acute kidney injury occurred in 1355 patients (30%) in the training cohort and 580 (30%) in the validation cohort. We incorporated known AKI risk factors and routinely measured vital characteristics and laboratory results. The model was run throughout ICU admission every 15 minutes and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 on validation. It was 92% sensitive and 68% specific and detected 30% of AKI cases at least 6 hours before the criterion standard time (AKI stages 1-3). For discrimination of AKI stages 2 to 3, the model had 91% sensitivity, 71% specificity, and 53% detection of AKI cases at least 6 hours before AKI onset.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】We developed and validated an AKI prediction model using random forest for continuous monitoring of ICU patients. This model could be used to identify high-risk patients for preventive measures or identifying patients of prospective interventional trials.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AKI ( acute kidney injury ), AKIN ( Acute Kidney Injury Network ), AUC ( area under the curve ), GFR ( glomerular filtration rate ), ICU ( intensive care unit ), ROC ( receiver operating characteristic )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

A total of 104,909 participants were assessed for cognitive function at least once (mean follow-up length, 29.5±35.7 months). Baseline moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA were reported by participants as more than once a week, once a week, one to three times a month, or hardly ever or never. With regard to PA frequency, participants were categorized as inactive, low active, intermediate active, or high active. The main outcome measure is a cognitive composite score created by summing the _z_ scores of 4-item temporal orientation, 10-word list for delayed recall, and verbal fluency.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Adjusted, 2-level mixed-effect regressions found that compared with doing no PA, doing PA more than once a week, once a week, or one to three times a month was positively associated with the composite score (β coefficients varied from 0.52 to 0.75 for moderate-intensity PA and from 0.26 to 0.33 for vigorous-intensity PA). Similarly, compared with the inactive category, high-active, intermediate-active, and low-active categories had positive associations with the composite score (β varied from 0.77 to 1.10). Positive associations were also obtained between PA variables and the raw scores of cognitive tests.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Physical activity has dose-response associations with cognitive function, with even low PA frequencies (few times per month) being positively associated with cognitive function during aging.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】PA ( physical activity ), SHARE ( Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

This retrospective cohort study included patients from a medical ICU from April 1, 1995, to November 30, 2009. Data collected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III database included demographic characteristics; severity of illness scores; noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation time; ICU and hospital length of stay; and ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality. Statistically significant univariate variables for 1-year mortality were entered into a multivariate model, and the independent variables were used to generate a scoring system to predict 1-year mortality rate. At 1-year follow-up, 295 of 591 patients died (50%). Age and hospital length of stay were identified as independent determinants of mortality at 1 year by using multivariate analysis, and the predictive model developed had an area under the operating curve of 0.68. Bootstrap analysis with 1000 iterations validated the model, age, and hospital length of stay, entered the model 100% of the time (area under the operating curve=0.687; 95% CI, 0.686-0.688). A simple model using age and hospital length of stay may be informative for providers willing to identify patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with high 1-year mortality rate who may benefit from end-of-life communications and from palliative care.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】APACHE III ( Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III ), AUC ( area under the operating curve ), COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ), ICU ( intensive care unit ), SOFA ( Sequential Organ Failure Assessment )\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "281eb306-1c1b-4ace-bbad-b972abe93123", "title": "Childhood schizophrenia", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Childhood schizophrenia is an uncommon but severe mental disorder in which children and teenagers interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognitive), behavior or emotions. It may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs your child's ability to function.\n\n【2】Childhood schizophrenia is essentially the same as schizophrenia in adults, but it starts early in life — generally in the teenage years — and has a profound impact on a child's behavior and development. With childhood schizophrenia, the early age of onset presents special challenges for diagnosis, treatment, education, and emotional and social development.\n\n【3】Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that requires lifelong treatment. Identifying and starting treatment for childhood schizophrenia as early as possible may significantly improve your child's long-term outcome.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling.\n\n【6】In most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare.\n\n【7】Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases.\n\n【8】### Early signs and symptoms\n\n【9】Schizophrenia signs and symptoms in children and teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize in this age group.\n\n【10】Early signs and symptoms may include problems with thinking, behavior and emotions.\n\n【11】Thinking:\n\n【12】*   Problems with thinking and reasoning\n*   Bizarre ideas or speech\n*   Confusing dreams or television for reality\n\n【13】Behavior:\n\n【14】*   Withdrawal from friends and family\n*   Trouble sleeping\n*   Lack of motivation — for example, showing up as a drop in performance at school\n*   Not meeting daily expectations, such as bathing or dressing\n*   Bizarre behavior\n*   Violent or aggressive behavior or agitation\n*   Recreational drug or nicotine use\n\n【15】Emotions:\n\n【16】*   Irritability or depressed mood\n*   Lack of emotion, or emotions inappropriate for the situation\n*   Strange anxieties and fears\n*   Excessive suspicion of others\n\n【17】### Later signs and symptoms\n\n【18】As children with schizophrenia age, more typical signs and symptoms of the disorder begin to appear. Signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【19】*   **Delusions.** These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; that certain gestures or comments are directed at you; that you have exceptional ability or fame; that another person is in love with you; or that a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.\n*   **Hallucinations.** These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, hallucinations have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.\n*   **Disorganized thinking.** Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad.\n*   **Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior.** This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior is not focused on a goal, which makes it hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement.\n*   **Negative symptoms.** This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion — doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions, speaks in a monotone, or doesn't add hand or head movements that normally occur when speaking. Also, the person may avoid people and activities or lack the ability to experience pleasure.\n\n【20】Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, children and teens may be:\n\n【21】*   Less likely to have delusions\n*   More likely to have visual hallucinations\n\n【22】### Symptoms may be difficult to interpret\n\n【23】When childhood schizophrenia begins early in life, symptoms may build up gradually. Early signs and symptoms may be so vague that you can't recognize what's wrong. Some early signs can be mistaken for typical development during early teen years, or they could be symptoms of other mental or physical conditions.\n\n【24】As time goes on, signs may become more severe and more noticeable. Eventually, your child may develop the symptoms of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions and difficulty organizing thoughts. As thoughts become more disorganized, there's often a \"break from reality\" (psychosis) frequently requiring hospitalization and treatment with medication.\n\n【25】### When to see a doctor\n\n【26】It can be difficult to know how to handle vague behavioral changes in your child. You may be afraid of rushing to conclusions that label your child with a mental illness. Your child's teacher or other school staff may alert you to changes in your child's behavior.\n\n【27】Seek medical care as soon as possible if you have concerns about your child's behavior or development.\n\n【28】### Suicidal thoughts and behavior\n\n【29】Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with schizophrenia. If you have a child or teen who is in danger of attempting suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with him or her. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or if you think you can do so safely, take your child to the nearest hospital emergency room.\n\n【30】Causes\n------\n\n【31】It's not known what causes childhood schizophrenia, but it's thought that it develops in the same way as adult schizophrenia does. Researchers believe that a combination of genetics, brain chemistry and environment contributes to development of the disorder. It's not clear why schizophrenia starts so early in life for some and not for others.\n\n【32】Problems with certain naturally occurring brain chemicals, including neurotransmitters called dopamine and glutamate, may contribute to schizophrenia. Neuroimaging studies show differences in the brain structure and central nervous system of people with schizophrenia. While researchers aren't certain about the significance of these changes, they indicate that schizophrenia is a brain disease.\n\n【33】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【34】Although the precise cause of schizophrenia isn't known, certain factors seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering schizophrenia, including:\n\n【35】*   Having a family history of schizophrenia\n*   Increased immune system activation, such as from inflammation\n*   Older age of the father\n*   Some pregnancy and birth complications, such as malnutrition or exposure to toxins or viruses that may impact brain development\n*   Taking mind-altering (psychoactive) drugs during teen years\n\n【36】Complications\n-------------\n\n【37】Left untreated, childhood schizophrenia can result in severe emotional, behavioral and health problems. Complications associated with schizophrenia may occur in childhood or later, such as:\n\n【38】*   Suicide, suicide attempts and thoughts of suicide\n*   Self-injury\n*   Anxiety disorders, panic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)\n*   Depression\n*   Abuse of alcohol or other drugs, including nicotine\n*   Family conflicts\n*   Inability to live independently, attend school or work\n*   Social isolation\n*   Health and medical problems\n*   Being victimized\n*   Legal and financial problems, and homelessness\n*   Aggressive behavior, although uncommon\n\n【39】Prevention\n----------\n\n【40】Early identification and treatment may help get symptoms of childhood schizophrenia under control before serious complications develop. Early treatment is also crucial in helping limit psychotic episodes, which can be extremely frightening to a child and his or her parents. Ongoing treatment can help improve your child's long-term outlook.\n\n【41】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "da037459-a5c8-4e14-ad89-5f189fe4ff87", "title": "Placental abruption", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Placental abruption (abruptio placentae) is an uncommon yet serious complication of pregnancy. The placenta develops in the uterus during pregnancy. It attaches to the wall of the uterus and supplies the baby with nutrients and oxygen.\n\n【2】Placental abruption occurs when the placenta partly or completely separates from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery. This can decrease or block the baby's supply of oxygen and nutrients and cause heavy bleeding in the mother.\n\n【3】Placental abruption often happens suddenly. Left untreated, it endangers both the mother and the baby.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Placental abruption is most likely to occur in the last trimester of pregnancy, especially in the last few weeks before birth. Signs and symptoms of placental abruption include:\n\n【6】*   Vaginal bleeding, although there might not be any\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Back pain\n*   Uterine tenderness or rigidity\n*   Uterine contractions, often coming one right after another\n\n【7】Abdominal pain and back pain often begin suddenly. The amount of vaginal bleeding can vary greatly, and doesn't necessarily indicate how much of the placenta has separated from the uterus. It's possible for the blood to become trapped inside the uterus, so even with a severe placental abruption, there might be no visible bleeding.\n\n【8】In some cases, placental abruption develops slowly (chronic abruption), which can cause light, intermittent vaginal bleeding. Your baby might not grow as quickly as expected, and you might have low amniotic fluid or other complications.\n\n【9】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【10】Seek emergency care if you have signs or symptoms of placental abruption.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】The cause of placental abruption is often unknown. Possible causes include trauma or injury to the abdomen — from an auto accident or fall, for example — or rapid loss of the fluid that surrounds and cushions the baby in the uterus (amniotic fluid).\n\n【13】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【14】Factors that can increase the risk of placental abruption include:\n\n【15】*   Placental abruption in a previous pregnancy that wasn't caused by abdominal trauma\n*   Chronic high blood pressure (hypertension)\n*   Hypertension-related problems during pregnancy, including preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome or eclampsia\n*   A fall or other type of blow to the abdomen\n*   Smoking\n*   Cocaine use during pregnancy\n*   Early rupture of membranes, which causes leaking amniotic fluid before the end of pregnancy\n*   Infection inside of the uterus during pregnancy (chorioamnionitis)\n*   Being older, especially older than 40\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】Placental abruption can cause life-threatening problems for both mother and baby.\n\n【18】For the mother, placental abruption can lead to:\n\n【19】*   Shock due to blood loss\n*   Blood clotting problems\n*   The need for a blood transfusion\n*   Failure of the kidneys or other organs resulting from blood loss\n*   Rarely, the need for hysterectomy, if uterine bleeding can't be controlled\n\n【20】For the baby, placental abruption can lead to:\n\n【21】*   Restricted growth from not getting enough nutrients\n*   Not getting enough oxygen\n*   Premature birth\n*   Stillbirth\n\n【22】Prevention\n----------\n\n【23】You can't prevent placental abruption, but you can decrease certain risk factors.

The resultant purpura is nonblanching but is not palpable. No pronounced damage occurs to the blood vessel walls, differentiating this condition from vasculitis. As a result of the red blood cell extravasation, hemosiderin is deposited into the dermis, giving the skin a copper or brownish coloration. Occasionally, an element of dermatitis or eczema is evident. Mild stasis changes, contact irritation, or allergic contact dermatitis may be present. Several terms have been used to describe this condition or closely related conditions including eczematoid purpura, purpura simplex, lichen aureus, eczematoid purpura of Kapetanakis and Doucas, and figurate purpura. Most often no reliable systemic associations exist, and the process is troublesome from the appearance standpoint but is rarely a serious health issue. However, distinguishing Schamberg purpura from cutaneous vasculitis, which it resembles clinically, is important. If the correct diagnosis is unclear, a skin biopsy may be necessary.\n\n【1】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【4】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/79.8.1070</u></u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>© 2004 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【30】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【31】*   Arthritis or\n*   Back pain, chronic or\n*   Blood clotting problems or\n*   Headache, before surgery or\n*   Mental illness (eg, psychosis) or\n*   Paresthesia (nerve problem), persistent or\n*   Pernicious anemia, history of or\n*   Poliomyelitis, history of or\n*   Spinal problems or\n*   Syphilis, history of or\n*   Tumor, history of—Use with caution. May prevent the use of bupivacaine in patients with these conditions.\n\n【32】*   Blood vessel disease or\n*   Heart disease or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure)—Use with caution. The chance of side effects may be increased.\n\n【33】*   Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) or\n*   Heart problems or\n*   Lung or breathing problems or\n*   Methemoglobinemia (blood disorder), hereditary or idiopathic (unknown cause)—Use with caution. May increase risk of having methemoglobinemia.\n\n【34】*   Heart rhythm problems (eg, arrhythmia, heart block) or\n*   Hemorrhage (bleeding), severe or\n*   Hypotension (low blood pressure), severe or\n*   Infection at the injection site or\n*   Septicemia (blood infection) or\n*   During uterine contractions—Marcaine™ should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【35】*   Heart rhythm problems (eg, heart block) or\n*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)—Use with caution. Posimir® may make these conditions worse.\n\n【36】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【37】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【38】A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital. Marcaine™ is sometimes given through a catheter placed into your lower back for an epidural or a spinal block. Posimir® is usually given in the shoulder area.\n\n【39】Posimir® should not be used to ease labor pains during childbirth.\n\n【40】This medicine should cause numbness only to the area where it is injected. You may experience temporary loss of sensation or movement in the injected area. This type of numbing procedure is called local anesthesia. It is not meant to cause you to fall asleep or become unconscious.\n\n【41】You may experience temporary loss of sensation and movement, usually in the lower half of your body, if you receive this medicine into your lower back (epidural). It may be easier to hurt yourself while your treated body area is still numb. Be careful to avoid injury until you have regained all the feeling and are no longer numb.\n\n【42】To avoid injury after dental work, do not chew solid foods until normal feeling has returned to the area. Do not test the feeling in your mouth by biting or poking the treated area (up to 7 hours).\n\n【43】If you are receiving this medicine as an epidural to ease labor pains, it may take longer than normal for you to push your baby out. It is also possible that the baby may have unwanted effects after birth (including sleepiness, slow responses). Talk to your doctor if you have questions about how this medicine might affect your baby.\n\n【44】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【45】It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress closely while receiving this medicine to see if it is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.\n\n【46】This medicine may cause a rare, but serious blood problem called methemoglobinemia. The risk may be increased in children younger than 6 months of age, elderly patients, or patients with certain inborn defects. It is more likely to occur in patients receiving too much of the medicine, but can also occur with small amounts. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has the following symptoms after receiving this medicine: pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nails, confusion, headache, lightheadedness, fast heartbeat, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【47】This medicine may cause a bone or joint problem called chondrolysis. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have bone or joint pain or stiffness or an inability to move.\n\n【48】This medicine may cause low blood pressure (hypotension). This is more likely in patients with blood vessel problems, including high blood pressure (hypertension) or a decrease in blood volume. Check with your doctor right away if you have confusion, dizziness, faintness, or lightheadedness when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting position, sweating, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【49】Bupivacaine injection may also cause a dangerous increase in body temperature (hyperthermia). Check with your doctor if you or your child have fast shallow breathing, a fast, weak heartbeat, headache, muscle cramps, pale, clammy skin, or an extremely high fever or body temperature.\n\n【50】This medicine may make you dizzy or drowsy. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\n【51】Check with your doctor before receiving this medicine with other medicines that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The use of other medicines that affect the CNS with bupivacaine injection may worsen the side effects of this medicine, such as dizziness, poor concentration, drowsiness, unusual dreams, and trouble with sleeping. Some examples of medicines that affect the CNS are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicines, medicine for depression, medicine for anxiety, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, or muscle relaxants.\n\n【52】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【53】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【54】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【55】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【56】#### More common\n\n【57】1.  Burning, crawling, itching, numbness, prickling, \"pins and needles\", or tingling feelings\n2.  change or loss of taste\n3.  chest pain or discomfort\n4.  continuing ringing or buzzing or other unexplained noise in the ears\n5.  decrease in the frequency and amount of urine\n6.  diarrhea\n7.  difficult or painful urination\n8.  dizziness\n9.  dry mouth\n10.  fever\n11.  headache\n12.  hearing loss\n13.  increased thirst\n14.  loss of appetite\n15.  mood changes\n16.  muscle pain or cramps\n17.  nausea or vomiting\n18.  seizures\n19.  sleepiness or unusual drowsiness\n20.  slow or irregular heartbeat\n21.  trouble breathing\n22.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n23.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n\n【58】#### Less common\n\n【59】1.

He reported a history of thrombocytopenia at age 14 years that was treated successfully with oral prednisone. Evaluation at an outside hospital revealed recurrence of thrombocytopenia, for which he had been treated with varying doses of prednisone for the past 5 years. At the time, he was also informed that he had an enlarged spleen and generalized lymphadenopathy based on imaging. His history was notable for tobacco use, recently discontinued 2 months before presentation, no exposures or risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and no exotic pets or travel. Of note, review of medical records revealed that 2 years before the current presentation, the patient had received pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine version PPSV23 and subsequently had negative serologic results. The patient had no other notable medical history. His medications included prednisone, 10 mg orally every other day, and over-the-counter loratadine daily.\n\n【1】On physical examination, the patient was afebrile, with a heart rate of 96 beats/min with a regular rhythm, blood pressure of 157/117 mm Hg, and normal respiratory effort at 16 breaths/min with 99% oxygen saturation while breathing room air. He was in no apparent distress. Ear, nose, and throat examination revealed a mildly erythematous left tympanic membrane but no other abnormalities. No swollen cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes were appreciated. Cardiopulmonary examination findings were normal. Abdominal examination was remarkable for a palpable spleen approximately 3 cm below the costal margin in the midclavicular line but no hepatomegaly; the abdomen was nontender and not distended with normoactive bowel sounds.\n\n【2】Laboratory values on initial evaluation included the following (reference ranges provided parenthetically): hemoglobin, 15.1 g/dL (13.2-16.6 g/dL); hematocrit, 46% (38.3%-48.6%); platelet count, 164 × 10  /L (135-317 × 10  /L); white blood cell count, 7.1 × 10  /L (3.4-9.6 × 10  /L); neutrophils, 4.51 × 10  /L (1.56-6.45 × 10  /L); absolute neutrophil count, 4.97 × 10  /L; bands, 70% (42%-75%); lymphocytes, 1.62 × 10  /L (0.95-3.07 × 10  /L); iron and coagulation values, normal; sodium,144 mmol/L (135-145 mmol/L); potassium, 3.9 mmol/L (3.6-5.2 mmol/L); random glucose, 97 mg/dL (70-140 mg/dL); creatinine,1.5 mg/dL (0.74-1.35 mg/dL); aspartate aminotransferase, 23 U/L (8-48 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 47 U/L (7-55 U/L); thyrotropin, 1.7 mIU/L (0.3-4.2 mIU/L); erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 1 mm/1 h (0-22 mm/1 h); C-reactive protein, 6.6 mg/L (≤8.0 mg/L); and antinuclear antibodies, SS-A/Ro antibodies, SS-B/La antibodies, absent. Flow cytometry studies revealed the following: CD19 B-cell count, 49 cells/μL (81-409 cells/μL); CD4 T-cell count, 423 cells/μL (365-1437 cells/μL); CD8 T-cell count, 610 cells/μL (171-846 cells/μL); and NK cell count, 88 cells/μL (59-513 cells/μL). Serum platelet antibodies were absent; IgA level was <1 mg/dL (61-356 mg/dL); IgM value was 20 mg/dL (37-286 mg/dL); and IgG level was 233 mg/dL (767-1590 mg/dL). Testing results for _Legionella_ , _Pneumocystis_ , _Aspergillus_ , adenovirus, influenza A and B, and HIV were all negative. Given the recurrent sinopulmonary infections and unremarkable chest radiographic findings, computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed, revealing mediastinal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly (spleen measuring 17.5 cm in long axis).\n\n【3】*   1.\n\n【4】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ diagnosis in this patient?**\n\n【5】    *   a.\n\n【6】        Bronchiectasis\n\n【7】    *   b.\n\n【8】        Common variable immunodeficiency\n\n【9】    *   c.\n\n【10】        Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\n\n【11】    *   d.\n\n【12】        Chronic granulomatous disease\n\n【13】    *   e.\n\n【14】        Selective IgA deficiency\n\n【15】Bronchiectasis is the abnormal dilation of one or more of the bronchi. This disease is usually secondary to an infectious process and could be a result of this patient's disease, rather than the cause. The most likely diagnosis based on this patient's presentation is common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). This patient presented with recurrent sinus infections as well as thrombocytopenia and an inadequate response to vaccinations, which are also known findings in CVID. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangitis (previously known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) is a necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis associated with severe asthma, constitutional symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy, none of which is evident in this patient.\n\n【16】Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is caused by a mutation of _NADPH_ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 1), which causes an inability of phagocytes to kill intracellular pathogens. This flaw leads to recurrent infections and failure to thrive, usually within the first year of life. The infections seen in CGD are broad and include pneumonias, skin infections and abscess, otitis, septicemia, diarrhea, and suppurative lymphadenitis. This patient presented at an older age and without several of the other common findings of CGD.\n\n【17】Selective IgA deficiency is most often an asymptomatic disease (in 80% to 90% of patients). When patients are symptomatic, they can have recurrent sinus infections, lower respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal tract infections, and severe allergic reactions if transfused with blood products containing IgA. With selective IgA deficiency, other immunoglobulin levels (IgG and IgM) would be within the normal range.\n\n【18】In view of his presentation, the patient most likely has CVID. He was engaged in a discussion and was educated regarding additional testing that should be performed at this time.\n\n【19】*   2.\n\n【20】    **Which _one_ of the following tests is _most likely_ to establish the diagnosis in this patient?**\n\n【21】    *   a.\n\n【22】        Sinus CT\n\n【23】    *   b.\n\n【24】        Serum IgE levels\n\n【25】    *   c.\n\n【26】        Chest CT\n\n【27】    *   d.\n\n【28】        Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM levels\n\n【29】    *   e.\n\n【30】        Flow cytometry for T, B and NK cells\n\n【31】Sinus CT may be considered in a patient with multiple episodes of rhinosinusitis or pneumonia. It can aid in identifying an infection, but it would not determine the cause of the patient’s recurrent infections. Elevated IgE levels can be associated with hyper-IgE syndrome (also known as Job syndrome), which has a classic presentation of pulmonary infections and multiple and eczemalike rashes. IgE levels are usually normal in patients with CVID.\n\n【32】Chest CT is often obtained in patients with CVID to determine the extent of anatomic damage that is caused by recurrent infections; it would not be needed to diagnose CVID.\n\n【33】Diagnosis of CVID requires low IgG and IgA levels, ineffective immune response to previous vaccines, and recurrent infections. The IgM level is routinely checked while diagnosing these patients; however, it is not one of the diagnostic criteria because IgM levels will be normal in 50% of patients with CVID.\n\n【34】无关删除-2:<u>*   Conley M.E.\n*   Notarangelo L.D.\n*   Etzioni A.</u>\n\n【35】representing PAGID (Pan-American Group for Immunodeficiency) and ESID (European Society for Immunodeficiencies).

Prophylactic antibiotics lead to an increased risk of developing resistant infections. The standard of care for CVID is the use of immunoglobulin replacement therapy. This medication is used to prevent recurrent infections and to decrease the severity and/or incidence of autoimmune disease. This medication is administered as an intravenous solution every 2 to 4 weeks, with the goal of therapy being to maintain an appropriate trough level. In patients with poor intravenous access, there is a subcutaneous form that can be used, but it must be dosed more frequently.\n\n【53】Similar to antibiotics, antifungals such as fluconazole should be administered on an as-needed basis to decrease resistance. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant that can be used for treatment of the autoimmune conditions that are associated with CVID. The 2 most common autoimmune conditions associated with CVID are thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic anemia.\n\n【54】无关删除-2:<u>*   Agarwal S.\n*   Cunningham-Rundles C.</u>\n\n【55】Autoimmunity in common variable immunodeficiency.\n\n【56】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Curr Allergy Asthma Rep._ 2009; 9 : 347-352</u></u>\n\n【57】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (137)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【58】These medications are used to treat these conditions after they have been diagnosed rather than as a preventive medication.

It can be hard to differentiate GLILD from some infectious causes of lung disease, but it can be done definitively via lung biopsy. Lung biopsy in patients with GLILD would show lymphoid hyperplasia and granulomatous patterns on histologic examination. Granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease is estimated to occur in 10% to 30% of patients with CVID and can be a challenging complication to treat because currently there are no US Food and Drug Administration–approved treatments.\n\n【78】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hartono S.\n*   Motosue M.S.\n*   Khan S.\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【79】Predictors of granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease in common variable immunodeficiency.\n\n【80】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol._ 2017; 118 : 614-620</u></u>\n\n【81】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (42)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【82】Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown pathology, with a hallmark of noncaseating granulomas. This disease may or may not present with symptoms including dyspnea on exertion, fevers, fatigue, and anorexia. Currently, there is no known connection between sarcoidosis and CVID. Pulmonary tuberculosis can present with radiographic abnormalities during disease reactivation. These abnormalities would be consolidations with cavitation in the apical-posterior segments of the upper lobes. Histoplasmosis can manifest with a wide range of findings, from no signs and symptoms to a life-threatening illness. When symptoms develop, they usually present within 3 to 17 days after exposure and can include fevers and chills, dry cough, chest pain, muscle aches, joint pain, and/or erythema nodosum. When present, some physical examination and imaging findings can include mediastinal granulomas, mediastinitis, and gastrointestinal tract (including oral) lesions. Vasculitides such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis may require a biopsy to rule out entirely; however, they do not have any association with CVID. Additionally, these diseases usually present with fatigue, fevers, weight loss, arthralgias, renal abnormalities, and purpura in addition to the pulmonary symptoms. Radiographic findings in vasculitis vary widely, but if CT is performed in a patient with a vasculitis and a primary pulmonary complaint, vessel wall thickening, nodular or cavitary lesions, ground-glass opacities, or consolidations could be indicative of vasculitis.\n\n【83】Granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease was diagnosed, and treatment with oral azathioprine and rituximab was initiated. The patient maintained good exercise tolerance and experienced about 2 sinus infections a year for the next 3 years while receiving intravenous immunoglobulin. However, he presented at the next visit with symptoms of night sweats and unintentional weight loss of 12 kg over 5 months. His physician was concerned about a possible underlying malignancy.\n\n【84】*   5.\n\n【85】    **Which _one_ of the following malignant diseases is _most likely_ to develop in patients with CVID?**\n\n【86】    *   a.\n\n【87】        Acute myeloid leukemia\n\n【88】    *   b.\n\n【89】        Non-Hodgkin T-cell lymphoma\n\n【90】    *   c.\n\n【91】        Hodgkin lymphoma\n\n【92】    *   d.\n\n【93】        Chronic lymphocytic leukemia\n\n【94】    *   e.\n\n【95】        Non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma\n\n【96】Acute myeloid leukemia is associated with hematologic disorders (eg, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia), familial germline mutations (RUNX1), and environmental exposures (radiation, tobacco smoke, and benzene) and thus is unlikely to develop in this patient. Non-Hodgkin T-cell lymphoma makes up about 15% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. This disease is associated with chromosomal translocations, infections (Epstein-Barr virus \\[EBV\\], human T-lymphotropic virus 1, hepatitis C virus, and _Helicobacter pylori_ ), environmental exposures (radiation, chemotherapy, and pesticides), and immunodeficiency states (severe combined immunodeficiency, and AIDS). Hodgkin lymphoma is strongly associated with EBV, HIV, and family history (increases risk by 3- to 7-fold) and would not be expected to occur in this patient.\n\n【97】Similarly unlikely, chronic lymphocytic leukemia is an acquired disorder associated with abnormal karyotypes (trisomy 12), with familial cases being exceedingly rare. However, a strong association exists between CVID and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, perhaps due to an increase in the EBV infection rate in this patient population. There is a 5-fold increased risk of lymphoid malignancy in patients with a polyclonal lymphocytic infiltration.\n\n【98】无关删除-2:<u>*   Chapel H.\n*   Lucas M.\n*   Lee M.\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【99】Common variable immunodeficiency disorders: division into distinct clinical phenotypes.\n\n【100】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Blood._ 2008; 112 : 277-286</u></u>\n\n【101】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (617)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【102】The patient was correctly diagnosed as having non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and will be beginning treatment soon.\n\n【103】Discussion\n----------\n\n【104】A study performed in 2013 suggested that primary immunodeficiencies may be present in 6 million people worldwide, with only an estimated 27,000 to 60,000 who have been diagnosed.\n\n【105】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bousfiha A.A.\n*   Jeddane L.\n*   Ailal F.\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【106】Primary immunodeficiency diseases worldwide: more common than generally thought.\n\n【107】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Immunol._ 2013; 33 : 1-7</u></u>\n\n【108】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (214)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【109】The most common of the primary immunodeficiencies is CVID.

Toxic hepatitis can be caused by alcohol, chemicals, drugs or nutritional supplements.\n\n【2】In some cases, toxic hepatitis develops within hours or days of exposure to a toxin. In other cases, it may take months of regular use before signs and symptoms appear.\n\n【3】The symptoms of toxic hepatitis often go away when exposure to the toxin stops. But toxic hepatitis can permanently damage your liver, leading to irreversible scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis) and in some cases to liver failure, which can be life-threatening.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Mild forms of toxic hepatitis may not cause any symptoms and may be detected only by blood tests. When signs and symptoms of toxic hepatitis occur, they may include:\n\n【6】*   Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n*   Itching\n*   Abdominal pain in the upper right portion of the abdomen\n*   Fatigue\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Rash\n*   Fever\n*   Weight loss\n*   Dark or tea-colored urine\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】See your doctor right away if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you.\n\n【9】Overdoses of some medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), can lead to liver failure. Get immediate medical care if you think an adult or a child has taken an overdose of acetaminophen. Signs and symptoms of a possible acetaminophen overdose include:\n\n【10】*   Loss of appetite\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Upper abdominal pain\n*   Coma\n\n【11】删除3:<u>If you suspect an acetaminophen overdose, immediately call 911, your local emergency services, or the poison help line. There are two ways to get help from Poison Control in the U.S: online at www.poison.org or by calling 800-222-1222. Both options are free, confidential, and available 24 hours a day. Do not wait for symptoms to develop. An acetaminophen overdose can be fatal but can be successfully treated if addressed early after ingestion.</u>\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】Toxic hepatitis occurs when your liver develops inflammation because of exposure to a toxic substance. Toxic hepatitis may also develop when you take too much of a prescription or over-the-counter medication.\n\n【14】The liver normally removes and breaks down most drugs and chemicals from your bloodstream. Breaking down toxins creates byproducts that can damage the liver. Although the liver has a great capacity for regeneration, constant exposure to toxic substances can cause serious, sometimes irreversible harm.\n\n【15】Toxic hepatitis can be caused by:\n\n【16】*   **Alcohol.** Heavy drinking over many years can lead to alcoholic hepatitis — inflammation in the liver due to alcohol, which can lead to liver failure.\n*   **Over-the-counter pain relievers.** Nonprescription pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen (Aleve, others) can damage your liver, especially if taken frequently or combined with alcohol.\n*   **Prescription medications.** Some medications linked to serious liver injury include the statin drugs used to treat high cholesterol, the combination drug amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin), phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek), azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), niacin (Niaspan), ketoconazole, certain antivirals and anabolic steroids. There are many others.\n*   **Herbs and supplements.** Some herbs considered dangerous to the liver include aloe vera, black cohosh, cascara, chaparral, comfrey, kava and ephedra. There are many others. Children can develop liver damage if they mistake vitamin supplements for candy and take large doses.\n*   **Industrial chemicals.** Chemicals you may be exposed to on the job can cause liver injury. Common chemicals that can cause liver damage include the dry cleaning solvent carbon tetrachloride, a substance called vinyl chloride (used to make plastics), the herbicide paraquat and a group of industrial chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls.\n\n【17】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【18】Factors that may increase your risk of toxic hepatitis include:\n\n【19】*   **Taking over-the-counter pain relievers or certain prescription drugs.** Taking a medication or over-the-counter pain reliever that carries a risk of liver damage increases your risk of toxic hepatitis. This is especially true if you take multiple medications or take more than the recommended dose of medication.\n*   **Having a liver disease.** Having a serious liver disorder such as cirrhosis or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease makes you much more susceptible to the effects of toxins.\n*   **Having hepatitis.** Chronic infection with a hepatitis virus (hepatitis B, hepatitis C or one of the other — extremely rare — hepatitis viruses that may persist in the body) makes your liver more vulnerable.\n*   **Aging.** As you age, your liver breaks down harmful substances more slowly. This means that toxins and their byproducts stay in your body longer.\n*   **Drinking alcohol.** Drinking alcohol while taking medications or certain herbal supplements increases the risk of toxicity.\n*   **Being female.** Because women seem to metabolize certain toxins more slowly than men do, their livers are exposed to higher blood concentrations of harmful substances for a longer time. This increases the risk of toxic hepatitis.\n*   **Having certain genetic mutations.** Inheriting certain genetic mutations that affect the production and action of the liver enzymes that break down toxins may make you more susceptible to toxic hepatitis.\n*   **Working with industrial toxins.** Working with certain industrial chemicals puts you at risk of toxic hepatitis.\n\n【20】Complications\n-------------\n\n【21】The inflammation associated with toxic hepatitis can lead to liver damage and scarring. Over time, this scarring, called cirrhosis, makes it difficult for your liver to do its job. Eventually cirrhosis leads to liver failure. The only treatment for chronic liver failure is to replace your liver with a healthy one from a donor (liver transplant).\n\n【22】Prevention\n----------\n\n【23】Because it's not possible to know how you'll react to a particular medication, toxic hepatitis can't always be prevented. But you may reduce your risk of liver problems if you:\n\n【24】*   **Limit medications.** Take prescription and nonprescription drugs only when absolutely necessary. Investigate nondrug options for common problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and arthritis pain.\n*   **Take medications only as directed.** Follow the directions exactly for any drug you take. Don't exceed the recommended amount, even if your symptoms don't seem to improve. Because the effects of over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes wear off quickly, it's easy to take too much.\n*   **Be cautious with herbs and supplements.** Don't assume that a natural product won't cause harm. Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor before taking herbs and supplements. The National Institutes of Health maintains the LiverTox website, where you can look up medications and supplements to see if they're linked to liver damage.\n*   **Don't mix alcohol and drugs.** Alcohol and medications are a bad combination. If you're taking acetaminophen, don't drink alcohol. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the interaction between alcohol and other prescription and nonprescription drugs you use.\n*   **Take precautions with chemicals.** If you work with or use hazardous chemicals, take all necessary precautions to protect yourself from exposure. If you do come in contact with a harmful substance, follow the guidelines in your workplace, or call your local emergency services or your local poison control center for help.\n*   **Keep medications and chemicals away from children.** Keep all medications and vitamin supplements away from children and in childproof containers so that children can't accidentally swallow them.\n\n【25】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Visual loss can be related to trauma to the globe, which can produce vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, retinal edema, or choroidal rupture. Ischemic optic neuropathy is usually due to a disease of small optic nerve vessels. We report a case of bilateral traumatic internal carotid artery dissection with delayed visual loss due to ischemic optic neuropathy.\n\n【18】Report Of A Case\n----------------\n\n【19】A 43-year-old woman, who was wearing a seat belt, had a single-car high-speed motor vehicle accident in which the air bag was deployed. The patient was unconscious for an unknown period and was subsequently brought to the emergency department. Right periorbital ecchymosis and enophthalmos were noted on admission. As part of the initial evaluation, computed tomography (CT) of the head and abdomen was performed, along with the usual trauma films (radiography of the chest, cervical spine, and pelvis). The patient's injuries consisted of a mild closed head injury, an open nasal fracture, a right zygomaticoorbital fracture, a grade 1 spleen laceration, and a right clavicular fracture. Reduced visual acuity of the right eye (20/200) was thought to be due to posttraumatic optic neuropathy, and therapy with corticosteroids was initiated.\n\n【20】The patient was admitted to the hospital, and additional work-up was performed. The facial fractures were evaluated with coronal and axial CT scans with 3-dimensional reconstruction. She had a nasal bone fracture as well as right medial and inferior orbital wall fractures with a zygomatic fracture involving the maxillary buttress and zygo-matic arch. A subcondylar fracture of the mandible on the right side was also noted.\n\n【21】Five days after the injury, the patient's visual acuity was improving (right eye, 20/120; left eye, 20/40). Her cervical spine was clinically reexamined, and the ligamentous system was found to be uninjured. The patient was taken to the operating room 8 days after the injury for open reduction and internal fixation of her facial fractures.\n\n【22】The facial fractures were anatomically reduced by using standard coronal, subciliary, and Caldwell-Luc incisions. Rigid fixation was obtained by using 1.5-mm titanium plates. The orbital floor and medial wall fractures were reconstructed with use of a 0.85-mm Medpore plate, which was secured with titanium screws. The lacrimal system was reconstructed by immediate dacryocystorhinostomy. The mandibular fracture was reduced, and the patient was placed in intermaxillary fixation.\n\n【23】The patient's early postoperative course was uneventful. Regular postoperative visual examinations by the craniofacial team revealed no subjective visual changes. On the fifth postoperative day, the patient reported decreased visual acuity in her right eye in the early morning; 4 hours later, this had progressed to no light perception. Urgent CT of the orbits revealed no bony fragments compressing the optic nerve 删除4:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Evaluation of the right fundus revealed mild nasal swelling of the optic disc. A high-dose corticosteroid drip (5.4 mg/kg in the first 15 minutes and then 0.9 mg/kg per hour for 72 hours) was initiated. No improvement in her vision was noted after 12 hours of corticosteroid treatment (right eye, no light perception; left eye, 20/30). At that time, the craniofacial and ear, nose, and throat teams decided to proceed with endoscopic transethmoidal optic canal decompression. The high-dose corticosteroids were continued after the decompression for 48 hours, but vision in the right eye did not improve.\n\n【24】Figure 1 Computed tomographic scan showing that optic nerves are not compressed by bone fragments or fixation devices.\n\n【25】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【26】Computed tomography demonstrated a low attenuated 2-cm lesion in the anterior limb of the left internal capsule and left caudate nucleus. The patient had no neurologic symptoms. A CT scan of the head repeated 48 hours later showed a new area of infarction, 1.5 cm in diameter, in the left frontal lobe. Additional work-up to determine the source of embolization consisted of a transthoracic echocardiogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck with magnetic resonance angiography. Findings on the echocardiogram were unremarkable, but MRI revealed dissection of the carotid arteries bilaterally. Dissection involved the intracranial portion of both internal carotid arteries, with 50% stenosis on the right side 删除4:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Thrombus formation was visualized in the cxtracranial part of both carotid arteries.\n\n【27】Figure 2 Magnetic resonance angiogram after traumatic carotid artery dissection causing 50% vessel narrowing of the cervical vessels (arrow), with arterial dissection distal to the narrowing.\n\n【28】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【29】Anticoagulant therapy was initiated immediately. Assessment by a vascular surgeon revealed that the patient was not an operative candidate for carotid artery reconstruction. The anticoagulant therapy is being continued, and MRI and duplex ultrasonography will be performed in 3 months to monitor for pseudoaneurysm formation.\n\n【30】The patient was dismissed after the 12th day of hospitalization. She was receiving oral anticoagulation, and the international normalized ratio was 2 to 3. Optic disc atrophy was noted on a fundus examination at that time. She continued to have no light perception in her right eye.\n\n【31】Discussion\n----------\n\n【32】The exact incidence of extracranial carotid artery dissection after blunt trauma is unknown. It was once thought to be rare, but increased awareness and noninvasive duplex ultrasonography and MRI have demonstrated more frequent occurrence. Nonetheless, it probably remains undiagnosed in a number of patients with and without precerebral neurologic events because it can clear spontaneously.\n\n【33】无关删除-2:<u>*   Javid H\n*   Chawla SK\n*   Dye WS\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【34】Carotid body rumor: resection or reflection.\n\n【35】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Surg._ 1976; 111 : 344-347</u></u>\n\n【36】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (27)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【37】删除7:<u>In 1982, Zelenock et al</u>\n\n【38】无关删除-2:<u>*   Zelenock GB\n*   Kazmers A\n*   Whilehouse Jr, WM\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【39】Extracranial internal carotid artery dissections: noniatrogenic traumatic lesions.\n\n【40】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Surg._ 1982; 117 : 425-432</u></u>\n\n【41】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (98)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【42】described 2 main mechanisms of injury leading to dissection caused by blunt trauma.

Tarka\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Trandolapril and verapamil combination is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.\n\n【6】Trandolapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, trandolapril relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.\n\n【7】Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker (CCB). It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This relaxes the blood vessels, lowers blood pressure, and increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet, Extended Release\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

{"seq_id": "fad72f6f-5556-4532-b544-e4e3d8f3679b", "title": "Food allergy", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Food allergy is an immune system reaction that occurs soon after eating a certain food. Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger signs and symptoms such as digestive problems, hives or swollen airways. In some people, a food allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis.\n\n【2】Food allergy affects an estimated 8% of children under age 5 and up to 4% of adults. While there's no cure, some children outgrow their food allergies as they get older.\n\n【3】It's easy to confuse a food allergy with a much more common reaction known as food intolerance. While bothersome, food intolerance is a less serious condition that does not involve the immune system.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】For some people, an allergic reaction to a particular food may be uncomfortable but not severe. For other people, an allergic food reaction can be frightening and even life-threatening. Food allergy symptoms usually develop within a few minutes to 2 hours after eating the offending food. Rarely, symptoms may be delayed for several hours.\n\n【6】The most common food allergy signs and symptoms include:\n\n【7】*   Tingling or itching in the mouth\n*   Hives, itching or eczema\n*   Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat or other parts of the body\n*   Wheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathing\n*   Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting\n*   Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting\n\n【8】### Anaphylaxis\n\n【9】In some people, a food allergy can trigger a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. This can cause life-threatening signs and symptoms, including:\n\n【10】*   Constriction and tightening of the airways\n*   A swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in your throat that makes it difficult to breathe\n*   Shock with a severe drop in blood pressure\n*   Rapid pulse\n*   Dizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness\n\n【11】Emergency treatment is critical for anaphylaxis. Untreated, anaphylaxis can cause a coma or even death.\n\n【12】### When to see a doctor\n\n【13】See your health care provider or allergist if you have food allergy symptoms shortly after eating. If possible, see your provider when the allergic reaction is occurring. This will help your provider make a diagnosis.\n\n【14】Seek emergency treatment if you develop any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as:\n\n【15】*   Constriction of airways that makes it difficult to breathe\n*   Shock with a severe drop in blood pressure\n*   Rapid pulse\n*   Dizziness or lightheadedness\n\n【16】Causes\n------\n\n【17】When you have a food allergy, your immune system mistakenly identifies a specific food or a substance in food as something harmful. In response, your immune system triggers cells to release an antibody known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) to neutralize the allergy-causing food or food substance (the allergen).\n\n【18】The next time you eat even the smallest amount of that food, IgE antibodies sense it and signal your immune system to release a chemical called histamine, as well as other chemicals, into your bloodstream. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.\n\n【19】The majority of food allergies are triggered by certain proteins in:\n\n【20】*   Crustacean shellfish, such as shrimp, lobster and crab\n*   Peanuts\n*   Tree nuts, such as walnuts and pecans\n*   Fish\n*   Chicken eggs\n*   Cow's milk\n*   Wheat\n*   Soy\n\n【21】### Pollen-food allergy syndrome\n\n【22】Also known as oral allergy syndrome, pollen-food allergy syndrome affects many people who have hay fever. In this condition, certain fresh fruits and vegetables or nuts and spices can trigger an allergic reaction that causes the mouth to tingle or itch. In serious cases, the reaction results in swelling of the throat or even anaphylaxis.\n\n【23】Proteins in certain fruits, vegetables, nuts and spices cause the reaction because they're similar to allergy-causing proteins found in certain pollens. This is an example of cross reactivity.\n\n【24】Symptoms are typically triggered by eating these foods when they're fresh and uncooked. However, when these foods are cooked, symptoms may be less severe.\n\n【25】The following table shows the specific fruits, vegetables, nuts and spices that can cause pollen-food allergy syndrome in people who are allergic to different pollens.\n\n| If you are allergic to: | Birch pollen | Ragweed pollen | Grasses | Mugwort pollen |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **You may also have a reaction to:** | AlmondAppleApricotCarrotCeleryCherryHazelnutPeachPeanutPearPlumRaw potatoesSoybeanSome herbs and spices (anise, caraway seed, coriander, fennel, parsley) | BananasCucumberMelons (cantaloupe, honeydew and watermelon)Zucchini | KiwiMelons (cantaloupe, honeydew and watermelon)OrangePeanutTomatoesWhite potatoZucchini | ApplesBell pepperBroccoliCabbageCarrotsCauliflowerCeleryGarlicOnionPeachSome herbs and spices (anise, black pepper, caraway seed, coriander, fennel, mustard, parsley) |\n\n【27】### Exercise-induced food allergy\n\n【28】Eating certain foods may cause some people to feel itchy and lightheaded soon after starting to exercise. Serious cases may even involve hives or anaphylaxis. Not eating for a couple of hours before exercising and avoiding certain foods may help prevent this problem.\n\n【29】### Food intolerance and other reactions\n\n【30】A food intolerance or a reaction to another substance you ate may cause the same signs and symptoms as a food allergy does — such as nausea, vomiting, cramping and diarrhea.\n\n【31】Depending on the type of food intolerance you have, you may be able to eat small amounts of problem foods without a reaction. By contrast, if you have a true food allergy, even a tiny amount of the food may trigger an allergic reaction.\n\n【32】One of the tricky aspects of diagnosing food intolerance is that some people are sensitive not to the food itself but to a substance or ingredient used in the preparation of the food.\n\n【33】Common conditions that can cause symptoms mistaken for a food allergy include:\n\n【34】*   **Absence of an enzyme needed to fully digest a food.** You may not have adequate amounts of some enzymes needed to digest certain foods. Insufficient quantities of the enzyme lactase, for example, reduce your ability to digest lactose, the main sugar in milk products. Lactose intolerance can cause bloating, cramping, diarrhea and excess gas.\n*   **Food poisoning.** Sometimes food poisoning can mimic an allergic reaction. Bacteria in spoiled tuna and other fish also can make a toxin that triggers harmful reactions.\n*   **Sensitivity to food additives.** Some people have digestive reactions and other symptoms after eating certain food additives. For example, sulfites used to preserve dried fruit, canned goods and wine can trigger asthma attacks in people with sensitivity to food additives.\n*   **Histamine toxicity.** Certain fish, such as tuna or mackerel, that are not refrigerated properly and that contain high amounts of bacteria may also contain high levels of histamine that trigger symptoms similar to those of food allergy. Rather than an allergic reaction, this is known as histamine toxicity or scombroid poisoning.\n*   **Celiac disease.** While celiac disease is sometimes referred to as a gluten allergy, it does not result in anaphylaxis. Like a food allergy, celiac disease does involve an immune system response, but it's a unique reaction that's more complex than a simple food allergy.\n\n【35】    This chronic digestive condition is triggered by eating gluten, a protein found in bread, pasta, cookies, and many other foods containing wheat, barley or rye.\n\n【36】    If you have celiac disease and eat foods containing gluten, an immune reaction occurs that causes damage to the surface of your small intestine, leading to an inability to absorb certain nutrients.\n\n【37】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【38】Food allergy risk factors include:\n\n【39】*   **Family history.** You're at increased risk of food allergies if asthma, eczema, hives or allergies such as hay fever are common in your family.\n*   **Other allergies.** If you're already allergic to one food, you may be at increased risk of becoming allergic to another. Similarly, if you have other types of allergic reactions, such as hay fever or eczema, your risk of having a food allergy is greater.\n*   **Age.** Food allergies are more common in children, especially toddlers and infants. As children grow older, their digestive systems mature and their bodies are less likely to absorb food or food components that trigger allergies.\n\n【40】    Fortunately, children typically outgrow allergies to milk, soy, wheat and eggs. Severe allergies and allergies to nuts and shellfish are more likely to be lifelong.\n\n【41】*   **Asthma.** Asthma and food allergy commonly occur together. When they do, both food allergy and asthma symptoms are more likely to be severe.\n\n【42】Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anaphylactic reaction include:\n\n【43】*   Having a history of asthma\n*   Being a teenager or younger\n*   Delaying use of epinephrine to treat your food allergy symptoms\n*   Not having hives or other skin symptoms\n\n【44】Complications\n-------------\n\n【45】Complications of food allergy can include:\n\n【46】*   **Anaphylaxis.** This is a life-threatening allergic reaction.\n*   **Atopic dermatitis (eczema).** Food allergy may cause a skin reaction, such as eczema.\n\n【47】Prevention\n----------\n\n【48】### Early exposure\n\n【49】Early introduction of peanut products has been associated with a lower risk of peanut allergy. In a recent study, high-risk infants — such as those with atopic dermatitis or egg allergy or both — were selected to either ingest or avoid peanut products from 4 to 6 months of age until 5 years of age.\n\n【50】Researchers found that high-risk children who regularly consumed peanut protein, such as peanut butter or peanut-flavored snacks, were around 80% less likely to develop a peanut allergy.\n\n【51】Before introducing allergenic foods, talk with your child's doctor about the best time to offer them.\n\n【52】### Taking precautions\n\n【53】Once a food allergy has already developed, the best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to know and avoid foods that cause signs and symptoms. For some people, this is a mere inconvenience, but others find it a greater hardship. Also, some foods — when used as ingredients in certain dishes — may be well hidden. This is especially true in restaurants and in other social settings.\n\n【54】If you know you have a food allergy, follow these steps:\n\n【55】*   **Know what you're eating and drinking.** Be sure to read food labels carefully.\n*   **If you have already had a severe reaction,** wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that lets others know that you have a food allergy in case you have a reaction and you're unable to communicate.\n*   **Talk with your doctor about prescribing emergency epinephrine.** You may need to carry an epinephrine autoinjector (Adrenaclick, EpiPen) if you're at risk of a severe allergic reaction.\n*   **Be careful at restaurants.** Be certain your server or chef is aware that you absolutely can't eat the food you're allergic to, and you need to be completely certain that the meal you order doesn't contain it. Also, make sure food isn't prepared on surfaces or in pans that contained any of the food you're allergic to.\n\n【56】    Don't be reluctant to make your needs known. Restaurant staff members are usually more than happy to help when they clearly understand your request.\n\n【57】*   **Plan meals and snacks before leaving home.** If necessary, take a cooler packed with allergen-free foods when you travel or go to an event. If you or your child can't have the cake or dessert at a party, bring an approved special treat so no one feels left out of the celebration.\n\n【58】If your child has a food allergy, take these precautions to ensure his or her safety:\n\n【59】*   **Notify key people that your child has a food allergy.** Talk with child care providers, school personnel, parents of your child's friends and other adults who regularly interact with your child. Emphasize that an allergic reaction can be life-threatening and requires immediate action. Make sure that your child also knows to ask for help right away if he or she reacts to food.\n*   **Explain food allergy symptoms.** Teach the adults who spend time with your child how to recognize signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction.\n*   **Write an action plan.** Your plan should describe how to care for your child when he or she has an allergic reaction to food. Provide a copy of the plan to your child's school nurse and others who care for and supervise your child.\n*   **Have your child wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace.** This alert lists your child's allergy symptoms and explains how others can provide first aid in an emergency.\n\n【60】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

A serious issue that emerged was the vulnerability of our medication supply chain, and potential ways to boost or preserve the supply of important medications have been reported.\n\n【3】无关删除-2:<u>*   Choo E.K.\n*   Rajkumar S.V.</u>\n\n【4】Medication shortages during the COVID-19 crisis: what we must do.\n\n【5】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2020; 95 ( \\[Epub ahead of print.\\] ) : 1112-1115</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (54)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【7】The existing health system infrastructure is critical to these efforts and can be used to help steward these vital resources and manage increasing demands. In this commentary, we highlight how antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) and formulary/pharmacy and therapeutics (F/P&T) committees can help manage the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【8】Use of ASPS to Optimize Medication Use\n--------------------------------------\n\n【9】Antimicrobial stewardship programs are charged with improving medical outcomes by providing patients with optimal antimicrobial therapy, emphasizing the five rights of medication administration: right patient, right drug, right time, right dose, and right duration. Successful ASP strategies include antimicrobial use policies and procedures, enforceable medication-use restrictions developed by key clinical experts, prospective antimicrobial audit with feedback to prescribers, engagement and partnership with microbiology laboratories, antimicrobial tracking and reporting, electronic ordering tools, and staff education. Furthermore, engagement of multidisciplinary stakeholders across the institution is a critical component of any successful ASP.\n\n【10】Because antimicrobial stewardship structure and strategies are already in place at most hospitals, they are well suited to be rapidly deployed to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic, and antimicrobial stewardship personnel have been heavily involved in the response. However, the pandemic has required a rapid readjustment of the role and tools of antimicrobial stewardship. In many circumstances, this has translated to a temporary diversion of effort and resources from some of the existing ASP activities to focus on pressing and time-sensitive COVID-19 activities. At the same time, the pandemic has led to increased support for activities related to COVID-19 and to infrastructure, some of which can be used to improve overall medication stewardship.\n\n【11】Antimicrobial stewardship program tools such as rule-based flags in the electronic health records, which are used to identify inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing, can also be used to identify medication overuse that may be directly related to COVID-19 medical care. An example is the rapid development and implementation of a flag to identify patients with negative COVID-19 testing and an active order for a medication, such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, or tocilizumab.\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>*   Stevens R.W.\n*   Estes L.\n*   Rivera C.</u>\n\n【13】Practical implementation of COVID-19 patient flags into an antimicrobial stewardship program's prospective review.\n\n【14】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol._ 2020; : 1-2</u></u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【16】This new flag in the electronic health record serves multiple different functions. First, it can directly preserve medications being inappropriately prescribed. Second, it can allow for engagement between the antimicrobial stewardship, infectious diseases, and prescribing teams to provide real-time education through academic detailing. This approach has been shown to be effective both for patients, who will not be prescribed drugs they do not need, and for physicians, who will learn to avoid inappropriate prescribing.\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>*   Solomon D.H.\n*   Van Houten L.\n*   Glynn R.J.\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【18】Academic detailing to improve use of broad-spectrum antibiotics at an academic medical center.\n\n【19】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Intern Med._ 2001; 161 : 1897-1902</u></u>\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (217)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【21】In addition, a rule-based flag system to identify patients who are COVID-19–positive and receiving prescribed medications off-label may help identify patients who may be candidates for clinical trials, which could be the most appropriate and scientifically sound approach to determining the utility of these drugs for COVID-19. This approach may help further the science needed to end the global pandemic.\n\n【22】Role OF F/P&T Committees in the Use of COVID-19 Medications\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Although an ASP framework can be adapted to address medication use issues, adaptation must be coordinated with F/P&T committees. These committees are critical for identifying impending medication shortages to maintain adequate medication supplies, guide safe medication use practices, and develop appropriate medication-related policies and mitigation strategies. The F/P&T committees can also work with pharmacies that are part of their health system to encourage appropriate prescribing behaviors, such as limiting dispensing of essential medications to recognized appropriate indications or for shorter durations and introducing limits on refill quantities to counteract drug-hoarding behavior.\n\n【24】The rapid pace of the pandemic has also led to substantial challenges in developing evidence-based criteria for medication use. At this time, a sufficient evidence base is lacking to make critical decisions regarding off-label use of approved medications for COVID-19 and to ensure medications remain available for approved indications where there is clear benefit. For example, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who depend on hydroxychloroquine will likely be harmed if the medication is not available.\n\n【25】Canadian Hydroxychloroquine Study Group  \nA randomized study of the effect of withdrawing hydroxychloroquine sulfate in systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【26】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1991; 324 : 150-154</u></u>\n\n【27】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (590)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【28】Across all Mayo Clinic sites, there was an 85% increase in outpatient prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine in March 2020 compared with March 2019, which was more pronounced among non-rheumatology services where the prescription rate increased more than 130%. Anticipating this issue, the F/P&T committees developed prescribing and pharmacy dispensing restrictions for hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 use and also implemented prescription refill limits for pharmacies that are part of Mayo Clinic. By April 2020, the number of prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine had returned to near before COVID-19 levels. Despite this improvement, loopholes in prescribing guidelines and dispensing restrictions make additional mechanisms to optimize medication use necessary.\n\n【29】Integrating the F/P&T Committees and ASP Framework to Sustain Health Care Through the COVID-19 Crisis\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】As we enter the plateau phase of this pandemic, we should anticipate a prolonged period of potential disruption of normal medical practice. Accordingly, long-term strategies are necessary to identify and address shortages of medications needed for the care of patients with and without COVID-19. A combined approach is a possibility, using the strength of both the F/P&T committees and the ASP 删除4:<u>( Figure )</u> to protect and preserve medications that are already in short supply or have impending supply issues. For example, if an impending hospital shortage of fentanyl were identified by the F/P&T committees, guidelines and potential prescribing restrictions for fentanyl or for alternative medications for critically ill patients could be developed in conjunction with critical care and anesthesia specialists. By using the existing ASP structure and information technology resources, rules could be developed to identify patients for whom fentanyl use is outside of evidence-based guidelines. The care plans for such patients could be reviewed by a medication stewardship pharmacy team, which would ideally include individuals with critical care expertise who could intervene with the primary provider teams to provide recommendations for therapeutic alternatives and education regarding the restriction. Simultaneously, existing programs could be used to monitor drug usage and to identify providers considered prescribing outliers, who could then receive targeted education about the medication identified. Finally, when the F/P&T committees have determined that supply chain interruption has been resolved for a medication, prospective audits and feedback could be discontinued while best practice guidance is updated or maintained as appropriate. Using the existing ASP and F/P&T framework, further rules could be developed to guide appropriate prescribing of other medications in shortage or at risk of shortage, such as dexmedetomidine, propofol, and others currently on the US Food and Drug Administration shortage list.\n\n【31】US Food & Drug Administration  \nFDA Drug Shortages.\n\n【32】删除3:<u>https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/</u>\n\n【33】删除6:<u>Date accessed: May 14, 2020</u>\n\n【34】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【35】Figure Flow diagram showing the approach for combining the F/P&T committees and the ASP to protect and preserve medication usage.

Whereas national and international strategies to improve drug supply are necessary, local management strategies to identify and steward medications will have a vital role moving forward. Optimal use of existing medication stewardship infrastructure will facilitate timely adaptations in a rapidly evolving health care environment.\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>Acknowledgment\n--------------</u>\n\n【40】无关删除-1:<u>Editing, proofreading, and reference verification were provided by Scientific Publications, Mayo Clinic.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Like other types of diabetes, gestational diabetes affects how your cells use sugar (glucose). Gestational diabetes causes high blood sugar that can affect your pregnancy and your baby's health.\n\n【2】While any pregnancy complication is concerning, there's good news. During pregnancy you can help control gestational diabetes by eating healthy foods, exercising and, if necessary, taking medication. Controlling blood sugar can keep you and your baby healthy and prevent a difficult delivery.\n\n【3】If you have gestational diabetes during pregnancy, generally your blood sugar returns to its usual level soon after delivery. But if you've had gestational diabetes, you have a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes. You'll need to be tested for changes in blood sugar more often.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Most of the time, gestational diabetes doesn't cause noticeable signs or symptoms. Increased thirst and more-frequent urination are possible symptoms.\n\n【6】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【7】If possible, seek health care early — when you first think about trying to get pregnant — so your health care provider can check your risk of gestational diabetes along with your overall wellness. Once you're pregnant, your health care provider will check you for gestational diabetes as part of your prenatal care.\n\n【8】If you develop gestational diabetes, you may need checkups more often. These are most likely to occur during the last three months of pregnancy, when your health care provider will monitor your blood sugar level and your baby's health.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Researchers don't yet know why some women get gestational diabetes and others don't. Excess weight before pregnancy often plays a role.\n\n【11】Usually, various hormones work to keep blood sugar levels in check. But during pregnancy, hormone levels change, making it harder for the body to process blood sugar efficiently. This makes blood sugar rise.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】Risk factors for gestational diabetes include:\n\n【14】*   Being overweight or obese\n*   Not being physically active\n*   Having prediabetes\n*   Having had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy\n*   Having polycystic ovary syndrome\n*   Having an immediate family member with diabetes\n*   Having previously delivered a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4.1 kilograms)\n*   Being of a certain race or ethnicity, such as Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American\n\n【15】Complications\n-------------\n\n【16】Gestational diabetes that's not carefully managed can lead to high blood sugar levels. High blood sugar can cause problems for you and your baby, including an increased likelihood of needing a surgery to deliver (C-section).\n\n【17】### Complications that may affect your baby\n\n【18】If you have gestational diabetes, your baby may be at increased risk of:\n\n【19】*   **Excessive birth weight.** If your blood sugar level is higher than the standard range, it can cause your baby to grow too large. Very large babies — those who weigh 9 pounds or more — are more likely to become wedged in the birth canal, have birth injuries or need a C-section birth.\n*   **Early (preterm) birth.** High blood sugar may increase the risk of early labor and delivery before the due date. Or early delivery may be recommended because the baby is large.\n*   **Serious breathing difficulties.** Babies born early may experience respiratory distress syndrome — a condition that makes breathing difficult.\n*   **Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).** Sometimes babies have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth. Severe episodes of hypoglycemia may cause seizures in the baby. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal.\n*   **Obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.** Babies have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.\n*   **Stillbirth.** Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth.\n\n【20】### Complications that may affect you\n\n【21】Gestational diabetes may also increase your risk of:\n\n【22】*   **High blood pressure and preeclampsia.** Gestational diabetes raises your risk of high blood pressure, as well as preeclampsia — a serious complication of pregnancy that causes high blood pressure and other symptoms that can threaten both your life and your baby's life.\n*   **Having a surgical delivery (C-section).** You're more likely to have a C-section if you have gestational diabetes.\n*   **Future diabetes.** If you have gestational diabetes, you're more likely to get it again during a future pregnancy. You also have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes as you get older.\n\n【23】Prevention\n----------\n\n【24】There are no guarantees when it comes to preventing gestational diabetes — but the more healthy habits you can adopt before pregnancy, the better. If you've had gestational diabetes, these healthy choices may also reduce your risk of having it again in future pregnancies or developing type 2 diabetes in the future.\n\n【25】*   **Eat healthy foods.** Choose foods high in fiber and low in fat and calories. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to help you achieve your goals without compromising taste or nutrition. Watch portion sizes.\n*   **Keep active.** Exercising before and during pregnancy can help protect you from developing gestational diabetes. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days of the week. Take a brisk daily walk. Ride your bike. Swim laps. Short bursts of activity — such as parking further away from the store when you run errands or taking a short walk break — all add up.\n*   **Start pregnancy at a healthy weight.** If you're planning to get pregnant, losing extra weight beforehand may help you have a healthier pregnancy. Focus on making lasting changes to your eating habits that can help you through pregnancy, such as eating more vegetables and fruits.\n*   **Don't gain more weight than recommended.** Gaining some weight during pregnancy is typical and healthy. But gaining too much weight too quickly can increase your risk of gestational diabetes. Ask your health care provider what a reasonable amount of weight gain is for you.\n\n【26】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "e43296b6-38eb-4b1a-9385-145ef29cb93e", "title": "IgA nephropathy (Berger disease)", "text": "【0】IgA nephropathy (Berger disease)\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】IgA nephropathy (nuh-FROP-uh-thee), also known as Berger disease, is a kidney disease. It happens when a germ-fighting protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in the kidneys. This causes a type of swelling called inflammation that, over time, can make it harder for the kidneys to filter waste from the blood.\n\n【2】IgA nephropathy often becomes worse slowly over years. But the course of the disease varies from person to person. Some people leak blood into their urine without having other problems. Others might have complications such as losing kidney function and spilling protein into the urine. Still others develop kidney failure, which means the kidneys stop working well enough to filter the body's waste on their own.\n\n【3】There's no cure for IgA nephropathy, but medicines can slow how quickly it becomes worse. Some people need treatment to lower inflammation, reduce the spilling of protein into the urine and prevent the kidneys from failing. Such treatments may help the disease become not active, a state called remission. Keeping blood pressure under control and lowering cholesterol also slow the disease.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】IgA nephropathy often doesn't cause symptoms early on. You might not notice any health effects for 10 years or more. Sometimes, routine medical tests find signs of the disease, such as protein and red blood cells in the urine that are seen under a microscope.\n\n【6】When IgA nephropathy causes symptoms, they might include:\n\n【7】*   Cola- or tea-colored urine caused by blood. You might notice these color changes after a cold, sore throat or respiratory infection.\n*   Blood that can be seen in the urine.\n*   Foamy urine from protein leaking into the urine. This is called proteinuria.\n*   Pain on one or both sides of the back below the ribs.\n*   Swelling in the hands and feet called edema.\n*   High blood pressure.\n*   Weakness and tiredness.\n\n【8】If the disease leads to kidney failure, symptoms may include:\n\n【9】*   Rashes and itchy skin.\n*   Muscle cramps.\n*   Upset stomach and vomiting.\n*   Less appetite.\n*   Metallic taste in the mouth.\n*   Confusion.\n\n【10】Kidney failure is life-threatening without treatment. But dialysis or a kidney transplant can help people live for many more years.\n\n【11】### When to see a doctor\n\n【12】See your doctor if you think you have symptoms of IgA nephropathy. It's key to get a checkup if you notice blood in your urine. Various conditions can cause this symptom. But if it keeps happening or it doesn't go away, it might be a sign of a serious health problem. Also see your doctor if you notice sudden swelling in your hands or feet.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】The kidneys are two bean-shaped, fist-sized organs located at the small of the back, one on each side of the spine. Each kidney contains tiny blood vessels called glomeruli. These vessels filter waste, extra water and other substances from the blood. Then the filtered blood goes back into the bloodstream. The waste products pass into the bladder and out of the body in urine.\n\n【15】Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is a type of protein called an antibody. The immune system makes IgA to help attack germs and fight infections. But with IgA nephropathy, this protein collects in the glomeruli. This causes inflammation and affects their filtering ability over time.\n\n【16】Researchers don't know exactly what causes IgA to build up in the kidneys. But the following things might be linked with it:\n\n【17】*   **Genes.** IgA nephropathy is more common in some families and in certain ethnic groups, such as people of Asian and European descent.\n*   **Liver diseases.** These include scarring of the liver called cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B and C infections.\n*   **Celiac disease.** Eating gluten, a protein found in most grains, triggers this digestive condition.\n*   **Infections.** These include HIV and some bacterial infections.\n\n【18】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【19】The exact cause of IgA nephropathy is unknown. But these factors might raise the risk of getting it:\n\n【20】*   **Sex.** In North America and Western Europe, IgA nephropathy affects at least twice as many men as it does women.\n*   **Ethnicity.** IgA nephropathy is more common in white people and people of Asian descent than it is in Black people.\n*   **Age.** IgA nephropathy most often develops between the mid-teens and mid-30s.\n*   **Family history.** IgA nephropathy appears to run in some families.\n\n【21】Complications\n-------------\n\n【22】The course of IgA nephropathy varies from person to person. Some people have the disease for years with few or no problems. Many don't get diagnosed. Other people develop one or more of the following complications:\n\n【23】*   **High blood pressure.** Damage to the kidneys from IgA buildup can raise blood pressure. And high blood pressure can do more damage to the kidneys.\n*   **High cholesterol.** High levels of cholesterol can raise the risk of a heart attack.\n*   **Acute kidney failure.** If the kidneys can't filter blood well enough due to buildup of IgA, levels of waste products rise quickly in the blood. And if kidney function gets worse very quickly, health care professionals may use the term rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.\n*   **Chronic kidney disease.** IgA nephropathy can cause the kidneys to stop working over time. Then a treatment called dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed to live.\n*   **Nephrotic syndrome.** This is a group of problems that can be caused by damage to the glomeruli. The problems can include high urine protein levels, low blood protein levels, high cholesterol and lipids, and swelling of the eyelids, feet and stomach area.\n\n【24】Prevention\n----------\n\n【25】You can't prevent IgA nephropathy. Talk with your doctor if you have a family history of the disease. Ask what you can do to keep your kidneys healthy. For example, it helps to lower high blood pressure and keep cholesterol at healthy levels.\n\n【26】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Rivastigmine will not cure or stop Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease from getting worse, however, rivastigmine can improve the thinking ability in some patients.\n\n【6】In Alzheimer's disease, many chemical changes take place in the brain. One of the earliest and biggest changes is that there is less of a chemical called acetylcholine (ACh). ACh helps the brain to work properly. Rivastigmine slows the breakdown of ACh, so it can build up and have a greater effect. However, as Alzheimer's disease gets worse, there will be less and less ACh, so rivastigmine may not work as well.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Capsule\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Commonly encountered lesion types include arteriovenous malformations, cavernous malformations, venous malformations, dural arteriovenous fistulas, and capillary telangiectasias. Patients can experience various symptoms and signs at presentation. The natural history of vascular malformations depends on lesion type, location, size, and overall hemodynamics. The natural history for each lesion subtype is reviewed, with special consideration of the risk of hemorrhage or other adverse outcomes after the lesion is detected and any known predictors of hemorrhage or other outcomes. In practice, these data are compared with the risk of available treatment options as the optimal management is clarified. A multidisciplinary approach including neurosurgery, radiosurgery, interventional neuroradiology, and vascular neurology is most useful in determining the best management strategy.\n\n【1】AVM ( arteriovenous malformation ), CM ( cavernous malformation ), CT ( computed tomography ), DAVF ( dural arteriovenous fistula ), MRA ( magnetic resonance angiography ), MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ), NBCA ( N-butyl cyanoacrylate ), VM ( venous malformation )\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Thrombocytosis (throm-boe-sie-TOE-sis) is a disorder in which your body produces too many platelets.\n\n【2】It's called reactive thrombocytosis or secondary thrombocytosis when the cause is an underlying condition, such as an infection.\n\n【3】Less commonly, when the high platelet count has no apparent underlying condition as a cause, the disorder is called primary thrombocythemia or essential thrombocythemia. This is a blood and bone marrow disease.\n\n【4】A high platelet level may be detected in a routine blood test known as a complete blood count. It's important to determine whether it's reactive thrombocytosis or essential thrombocythemia to choose the best treatment options.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】People with high platelet levels often don't have signs or symptoms. When symptoms occur, they're often related to blood clots. Examples include:\n\n【7】*   Headache.\n*   Confusion or changes in speech.\n*   Chest pain.\n*   Shortness of breath and nausea.\n*   Weakness.\n*   Burning pain in the hands or feet.\n\n【8】Less commonly, very high platelet levels may cause bleeding. This can cause:\n\n【9】*   Nosebleeds.\n*   Bruising.\n*   Bleeding from your mouth or gums.\n*   Bloody stool.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Bone marrow is a spongy tissue inside your bones. It contains stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets. Platelets stick together, helping blood to form a clot that stops bleeding when you damage a blood vessel, such as when you cut yourself. Thrombocytosis occurs when your body produces too many platelets.\n\n【12】### Reactive thrombocytosis\n\n【13】This is the more common type of thrombocytosis. It's caused by an underlying medical problem, such as:\n\n【14】*   Blood loss.\n*   Cancer.\n*   Infections.\n*   Iron deficiency.\n*   Removal of your spleen.\n*   Hemolytic anemia — a type of anemia in which your body destroys red blood cells faster than it produces them, often due to certain blood diseases or autoimmune disorders.\n*   Inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis or inflammatory bowel disease.\n*   Surgery and other types of traumas.\n\n【15】### Essential thrombocythemia\n\n【16】The cause of this disorder is unclear. It often appears to be connected to changes in certain genes. The bone marrow produces too many of the cells that form platelets, and these platelets often don't work properly. This poses a much higher risk of clotting or bleeding complications than does reactive thrombocytosis.\n\n【17】Complications\n-------------\n\n【18】Essential thrombocythemia can lead to a variety of potentially life-threatening complications, such as:\n\n【19】*   **Strokes.** If a blood clot occurs in the arteries that supply the brain, it may cause a stroke. A mini stroke, also called a transient ischemic attack, is a temporary interruption of blood flow to part of the brain.\n*   **Heart attacks.** Less commonly, essential thrombocythemia can cause clots in the arteries that supply blood to your heart.\n*   **Cancer.** Rarely, essential thrombocythemia may lead to a type of leukemia that progresses quickly.\n\n【20】### Pregnancy complications\n\n【21】Most women who have essential thrombocythemia have normal, healthy pregnancies. But uncontrolled thrombocythemia can lead to miscarriage and other complications. Your risk of pregnancy complications may be reduced with regular checkups and medication, so be sure to have your doctor regularly monitor your condition.\n\n【22】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Serum samples from all participants were analyzed by electrophoresis performed on agarose gel; any serum sample with a discrete or localized band was subjected to immunofixation. Age-adjusted and standardized (to the 2000 world population) prevalence estimates of MGUS and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed in the Ghanaian men and compared with MGUS prevalence in 7996 white men from Minnesota. Associations between selected characteristics and MGUS prevalence were assessed by the Fisher exact test and logistic regression models.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of the 917 study participants, 54 were found to have MGUS, yielding an age-adjusted prevalence of 5.84 (95% CI, 4.27-7.40) per 100 persons. No significant variation was found by age group, ethnicity, education status, or prior infectious diseases. The concentration of monoclonal immunoglobulin was undetectable in 41 (76%) of the 54 MGUS cases, less than 1 g/dL in 10 patients (19%), and 1 g/dL or more in only 3 patients (6%). Compared with white men, the age-adjusted prevalence of MGUS was 1.97-fold (95% CI, 1.94-2.00) higher in Ghanaian men.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】The prevalence of MGUS in Ghanaian men was twice that in white men, supporting the hypothesis that race-related genetic susceptibility could explain the higher rates of MGUS in black populations. An improved understanding of MGUS and MM pathophysiology would facilitate the development of strategies to prevent progression of MGUS to MM.\n\n【8】CI ( confidence interval ), MGUS ( monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance ), MM ( multiple myeloma )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "91cbc207-3756-4ad5-8ab4-9c54c6155cc7", "title": "Spermatocele", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】A spermatocele (SPUR-muh-toe-seel) is an abnormal sac (cyst) that develops in the epididymis — the small, coiled tube located on the upper testicle that collects and transports sperm. Noncancerous and generally painless, a spermatocele usually is filled with milky or clear fluid that might contain sperm.\n\n【2】The exact cause of spermatoceles isn't clear, but they might be due to a blockage in one of the tubes that transport sperm.\n\n【3】Spermatoceles, sometimes called spermatic cysts, are common. They typically don't reduce fertility or require treatment. If a spermatocele grows large enough to cause discomfort, your doctor might suggest surgery.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】A spermatocele usually causes no signs or symptoms and might remain stable in size. If it becomes large enough, however, you might feel:\n\n【6】*   Pain or discomfort in the affected testicle\n*   Heaviness in the testicle with the spermatocele\n*   Fullness behind and above the testicle\n\n【7】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【8】Because a spermatocele usually doesn't cause symptoms, you might discover it only during a testicular self-exam, or your doctor might find it during a routine physical exam.\n\n【9】It's a good idea to have your doctor evaluate any scrotal mass to rule out a serious condition, such as testicular cancer. Also, call your doctor if you experience pain or swelling in your scrotum. A number of conditions can cause testicular pain, and some require immediate treatment.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】The cause of spermatoceles is unknown. Spermatoceles might result from a blockage in one of the multiple tubes within the epididymis that transport and store sperm from the testicle.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】There aren't many known risk factors for developing a spermatocele. Men whose mothers were given the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy to prevent miscarriage and other pregnancy complications appear to have a higher risk of spermatoceles. Use of this drug was stopped in 1971 due to concerns about an increased risk of rare vaginal cancer in women.\n\n【14】Complications\n-------------\n\n【15】A spermatocele is unlikely to cause complications.\n\n【16】However, if your spermatocele is painful or has grown so large that it's causing you discomfort, you might need to have surgery to remove the spermatocele. Surgical removal might damage the epididymis or the vas deferens, a tube that transports sperm from the epididymis to the penis. Damage to either can reduce fertility. Another possible complication that can occur after surgery is that the spermatocele might come back, though this is uncommon.\n\n【17】Prevention\n----------\n\n【18】Although there's no way to prevent a spermatocele, it's important for you to conduct scrotal self-exams at least monthly to detect changes, such as masses, in your scrotum. Any new mass in your scrotum should be evaluated promptly.\n\n【19】Your doctor can instruct you in how to conduct a testicular self-examination, which can improve your chances of finding a mass.\n\n【20】### How to examine your testicles\n\n【21】A good time to examine your testicles is during or after a warm bath or shower. The heat from the water relaxes your scrotum, making it easier for you to detect anything unusual. Then follow these steps:\n\n【22】*   **Stand in front of a mirror.** Look for any swelling on the skin of the scrotum.\n*   **Examine each testicle with both hands.** Place the index and middle fingers under the testicle while placing your thumbs on the top.\n*   **Gently roll the testicle between the thumbs and the fingers.** Remember that the testicles are usually smooth, oval shaped and somewhat firm. It's normal for one testicle to be slightly larger than the other. Also, the cord leading upward from the top of the testicle (epididymis) is a normal part of the scrotum.\n\n【23】By regularly performing this exam, you'll become more familiar with your testicles and aware of any changes that might be of concern. If you find a lump, call your doctor as soon as possible.\n\n【24】Regular self-examination is an important health habit. But it can't substitute for a doctor's examination. Your doctor normally checks your testicles whenever you have a physical exam.\n\n【25】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

We then mailed a structured questionnaire to the survey respondents and achieved a response rate of 732 individuals. Percentages of individuals and predictors of those who meet recommendations for intake of fruits and vegetables and for dietary fats were determined by using χ  tests of general association and multivariate logistic regression.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Only 16% of the population of Olmsted County reported meeting standard dietary recommendations for consuming both 5 or more servings of fruits and/or vegetables per day and no more than 30% of calories from fat. Fifty-one percent of the population was meeting neither recommendation. Women were more likely than men to report meeting both goals (22% vs 8%, _P_ <.001), but still more women were meeting neither goal than were meeting both goals (40% vs 22%, _P_ <.001). Multivariate logistic regression revealed the following factors to predict adherence to both goals: female sex, lower body mass index, nonsmoker, history of high cholesterol, and daily physical activity.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】Few individuals in Olmsted County are meeting national recommendations for intake of fruits, vegetables, and dietary fat.

All patients were staged using the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM system.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】The median age of the 77 patients (44 men and 33 women) was 65 years (range, 35-85 years). Operations performed included thoracotomy with biopsy of hilar mass in 10 patients, wedge excision in 30 (6 with talc pleurodesis), segmentectomy in 4, lobectomy in 28, bilobectomy in 3, and pneumonectomy in 2. Mediastinal lymphadenectomy was performed in 50 patients and lymph node sampling in 19. Postoperative therapy included chemotherapy alone in 20 patients, radiation therapy in 3, and combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy in 40. Median tumor diameter was 4 cm (range, 1.0-10.0 cm). Postsurgical tumor stage was IA in 7 patients, IB in 11, IIA in 8, IIB in 7, IIIA in 30, IIIB in 10, and IV in 4. A total of 19 patients (25%) had complications: atrial arrhythmia in 7 patients, pneumonia in 6, prolonged air leak in 3, and myocardial infarction, postoperative bleeding, and cerebrovascular accident in 1 each. Operative mortality was 3% (2/77). Follow-up ranged from 4 days to 170 months (median, 19 months). At last follow-up, 20 patients were alive. The estimated overall 5-year survival was 27% when excluding the 10 patients who underwent a biopsy without additional surgery. Five-year survival for stage I and II combined (n=33) was 38% compared with only 16% for stage III and IV combined (n=34) ( _P_ \\=.02). Overall median survival was 24 months; median survival for patients who underwent curative surgery was 25 months compared with 16 months for those who had a palliative procedure ( _P_ \\=.34).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Pulmonary resection in patients with stage I or stage II SCLC is safe with low mortality and morbidity. Curative resection is associated with long-term survival in early stage SCLC in some patients and should be considered in selected patients.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【57】If your symptoms do not improve within a few days, or if they become worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【58】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hives, hoarseness, trouble with breathing, trouble with swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after you receive this medicine.\n\n【59】Serious skin reactions can occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, red skin lesions, severe acne or skin rash, sores or ulcers on the skin, or fever or chills while you are using this medicine.\n\n【60】Check with your doctor right away if you have dark urine, clay-colored stools, abdominal or stomach pain, or yellow eyes or skin. These maybe symptoms of a serious liver problem.\n\n【61】Norfloxacin may cause some people to become dizzy, lightheaded, drowsy, or less alert than they are normally. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or are not alert. If these reactions are especially bothersome, check with your doctor.\n\n【62】Norfloxacin may cause diarrhea, and in some cases it can be severe. It may occur 2 months or more after you stop using this medicine. Do not take any medicine to treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor. Diarrhea medicines may make the diarrhea worse or make it last longer. If you have any questions about this or if mild diarrhea continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【63】Tell your doctor right away if you start having numbness, tingling, or burning pain in your hands, arms, legs, or feet. These may be symptoms of a condition called peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【64】Norfloxacin may rarely cause inflammation or even tearing of a tendon (the cord that attaches muscles to bones). The risk of having tendon problems may be increased if you are over 60 years of age, using steroid medicines (eg, dexamethasone, prednisolone, prednisone, or Medrol®), if you have severe kidney problems, a history of tendon problems (eg, rheumatoid arthritis), or if you have received an organ (eg, heart, kidney, or lung) transplant. If you get sudden pain or swelling in a tendon after exercise (eg, in the ankle, back of the knee or leg, shoulder, elbow, or wrist), check with your doctor right away. Refrain from exercise until your doctor says otherwise.\n\n【65】Tell your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms while using this medicine: convulsions, feeling anxious, confused, or depressed, seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there, severe headache, trouble sleeping, or unusual thoughts or behaviors.\n\n【66】Some people who take norfloxacin may become more sensitive to sunlight than they are normally. Exposure to sunlight, even for brief periods of time, may cause severe sunburn, or skin rash, redness, itching, or discoloration. When you begin using this medicine:\n\n【67】*   Stay out of direct sunlight, especially between the hours of 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM, if possible.\n*   Wear protective clothing, including a hat and sunglasses.\n*   Apply a sun block product that has a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. Some people may require a product with a higher SPF number, especially if they have a fair complexion. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.\n*   Do not use a sunlamp or tanning bed or booth.\n\n【68】If you have a severe reaction from the sun, check with your doctor.\n\n【69】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【70】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【71】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【72】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【73】#### Rare\n\n【74】1.

The most common symptoms were light-headedness and weakness. Comorbid conditions included neurologic diseases (38%), preexisting hypertension (36%), hyperlipidemia (31%), cardiac arrhythmias and coronary artery disease (45%), and neoplasm (28%). During ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, postprandial decreases in blood pressure were noted in 83% of the OH group, supine or sleep hypertension in 84%, and noncompensatory heart rate variability in 75%. Findings on autonomic testing were abnormal in 99% of patients, serum creatinine value was increased in 30%, proteinuria was present in 27%, and left ventricular hypertrophy was present in 20%.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】Orthostatic hypotension is present in a heterogeneous group of disease states, is usually symptomatic, and is often associated with an abnormal blood pressure profile of reversal of circadian pattern, postprandial hypotension, and noncompensatory heart rate variability. Consequent target organ (kidney) damage can be as frequent as in patients who undergo 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for evaluation of hypertension.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

You may be extremely sad, empty or irritable (depressed), or you may have periods of depression alternating with being excessively happy (mania).\n\n【2】Anxiety disorders can also affect your mood and often occur along with depression. Mood disorders may increase your risk of suicide.\n\n【3】Some examples of mood disorders include:\n\n【4】*   **Major depressive disorder** — prolonged and persistent periods of extreme sadness\n*   **Bipolar disorder** — also called manic depression or bipolar affective disorder, depression that includes alternating times of depression and mania\n*   **Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)** — a form of depression most often associated with fewer hours of daylight in the far northern and southern latitudes from late fall to early spring\n*   **Cyclothymic disorder** — a disorder that causes emotional ups and downs that are less extreme than bipolar disorder\n*   **Premenstrual dysphoric disorder** — mood changes and irritability that occur during the premenstrual phase of a woman's cycle and go away with the onset of menses\n*   **Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)** — a long-term (chronic) form of depression\n*   **Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder** — a disorder of chronic, severe and persistent irritability in children that often includes frequent temper outbursts that are inconsistent with the child's developmental age\n*   **Depression related to medical illness** — a persistent depressed mood and a significant loss of pleasure in most or all activities that's directly related to the physical effects of another medical condition\n*   **Depression induced by substance use or medication** — depression symptoms that develop during or soon after substance use or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication\n\n【5】For most people, mood disorders can be successfully treated with medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy).\n\n【6】### When to see a doctor\n\n【7】If you're concerned that you may have a mood disorder, make an appointment to see your doctor or a mental health professional as soon as you can. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, talk to a friend or loved one, a faith leader, or someone else you trust.\n\n【8】Talk to a health care professional if you:\n\n【9】*   Feel like your emotions are interfering with your work, relationships, social activities or other parts of your life\n*   Have trouble with drinking or drugs\n*   Have suicidal thoughts or behaviors — seek emergency treatment immediately\n\n【10】Your mood disorder is unlikely to simply go away on its own, and it may get worse over time.

Among these is the possibility that a person with dementia will become lost in the community and face the risk of injury or death. Caregivers often cite anxiety about this possibility as a reason for placing their loved ones in a professional-care setting. Our case study and review of research show that all persons with dementia are at risk, regardless of age, past behavior, and sex. Thus, health care providers have an important role to play in educating caregivers about this risk and assisting them in preventing or responding to such situations. In addition, health care providers should ensure that their respective professionalcare facilities have appropriate measures in place to prevent and respond to these eventualities. Finally, health care providers can educate local law enforcement personnel about dementia in general and more specifically about research-based strategies for searching for persons with dementia who have become lost in the community.\n\n【1】Individuals with a dementing illness, such as Alzheimer disease, present many challenges for their caregivers.

Perhaps as a consequence, health care providers are often ill equipped to assist caregivers in dealing with the potential or the reality of a loved one being lost. We describe a person with dementia who became lost while performing an activity that he had performed numerous times before without incident. We present this case study, along with a summary of current research on the topic and recommendations to the health care practitioner, to help practitioners become more aware of the potential for such incidents with all persons with dementia and to encourage practitioners to work with caregivers and law enforcement personnel to reduce the risk of occurrence and to increase the likelihood of a safe outcome when persons with dementia become lost.\n\n【24】CASE STUDY\n----------\n\n【25】In November 2003, Mr X, a 79-year-old man with moderate to severe dementia, was discharged home from the hospital to the care of his spouse and a paid attendant. Shortly after his return, Mr X became angry when his wife left their independent-living home in the afternoon, and he attempted to follow her on his bicycle. Because Mr X had never become lost or gone far from view in the past, the attendant had been instructed that Mr X could ride alone within the complex (contained assisted and independentliving units in a community that had open egress during the day but was gated at night). Thus, the attendant did not accompany Mr X but remained at the home. Sixty minutes later, the attendant told Mr X's spouse that Mr X had not returned home. Family members conducted the initial search, driving around the neighborhood, but were unable to find Mr X. The local law enforcement agency was contacted, and personnel arrived 2 hours after Mr X disappeared. Their initial search focused on increasing street patrols by automobile, a helicopter flyby of surrounding neighborhoods, and reverse 911 regional telephone dispatch (911 generates an automatic call to homes in the vicinity) to request that citizens be on the lookout for Mr X. These measures continued for about 5 hours, until sunset. Over the next several days, volunteers and authorities thoroughly searched Mr X's community and adjacent neighborhoods and golf course on foot and with vehicle patrols. The situation was highlighted on local media for several days, heightening the community's exposure and interest. On the basis of a remote lead on day 5, authorities attempted to track Mr X using scent-sniffing dogs but were unsuccessful. Many leads were received when the Amber Alert Plan (an emergency system broadcast across numerous media outlets) was used, but none of these leads were useful. On day 6, a helicopter with special infrared technology searched the area within a 3-mile radius of Mr X's home, including remote locations, without definite leads. Also on day 6, one of the authors (M.A.R.) contacted the law enforcement agency and summarized the research presented subsequently and recommendations for searching. On the basis of the research findings, authorities mapped a grid for the area surrounding Mr X's residence and conducted a massive foot search. Ten volunteer searchers and a law enforcement officer were assigned to each specific search area within the grid. Volunteers were instructed to walk and visually search every space in that area, under brush, in bushes, etc. Sixty-three minutes from the start of this ground search, Mr X was located alive about 300 yards into dense woods, covered in leaves under a tree near his bike. He was about 0.25 miles from his home. Mr X had experienced exposure to the elements and severe dehydration but recovered fully.\n\n【26】RESEARCH ON PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA BECOMING LOST IN THE COMMUNITY\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Few studies have addressed the serious issue of persons with dementia becoming lost in the community. In addition, there is no national database of such incidents or of cases in which lost individuals die before being found. However, the findings of a small number of recent studies have begun to paint a more complete picture of who is at risk, what distinguishes cases in which the individuals are found alive from those in which they are found dead, and what search strategies are most likely to lead to the safe return of these individuals to their homes.\n\n【28】In the earliest of these studies, Koester\n\n【29】无关删除-2:<u>*   Koester RJ</u>\n\n【30】The lost Alzheimer's and related disorders search subject: new research and perspectives.\n\n【31】无关删除-2:<u>in: Response 98 NASAR Proceedings.

The researchers examined 3 types of data collected from January 1997 through January 1998: demographic data on the registered individuals and their primary caregivers from the registration files, data on the circumstances surrounding the disappearance based on the missing person reports, and data on the circumstances surrounding the discovery of these individuals based on the discovery reports. Not all cases had all 3 types of data available; thus, in the findings discussed subsequently, the total number varies.\n\n【40】In study 2, Rowe and Bennett\n\n【41】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rowe MA\n*   Bennett V</u>\n\n【42】A look at deaths occurring in persons with dementia lost in the community.\n\n【43】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen._ 2003; 18 : 343-348</u></u>\n\n【44】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (73)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【45】reviewed retrospectively 93 US newspaper articles published from 1998 to 2002 that described cases in which persons with dementia were found dead after becoming lost in the community. To our knowledge, this was the first study conducted to determine characteristics and/or circumstances that might distinguish the relatively few but tragic cases in which individuals die before being found from most cases in which individuals are returned safely to their homes.\n\n【46】Study 3 extends the findings of study 2 to include 45 additional newspaper reports from January through December 2003 in the analysis. This study has not been described in a previous publication. The study was conducted in spring 2004 by one of the authors of the current article (M.A.R.) using the same methodology as that used for study 2. Because of the nature of the data sources, no clinical data were available for any of the 3 studies.\n\n【47】### WHO IS AT RISK?\n\n【48】The combined findings from the studies indicate that all persons with dementia are at risk of becoming lost in the community. As shown in Table 1 , the ages of the persons with dementia ranged from 48 to 102 years, indicating that even extremely old adults with dementia are at risk. In study 1, individuals were lost from 1 month to more than 5 years after registration with Safe Return.\n\n【49】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rowe MA\n*   Glover JC</u>\n\n【50】Antecedents, descriptions and consequences of wandering in cognitively-impaired adults and the Safe Return (SR) program.\n\n【51】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen._ 2001; 16 : 344-352</u></u>\n\n【52】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (78)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【53】These findings imply that individuals are at risk at all stages of dementia.\n\n【54】TABLE 1 Demographic Characteristics of Persons With Dementia Who Became Lost in the Community\n\n|  | Study |\n| --- | --- |\n删除3:<u>|  | 17Rowe MAGlover JCAntecedents, descriptions and consequences of wandering in cognitively-impaired adults and the Safe Return (SR) program._Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen._ 2001; 16 : 344-352CrossrefPubMedScopus (78)Google Scholar(N=481) | 28Rowe MABennett VA look at deaths occurring in persons with dementia lost in the community._Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen._ 2003; 18 : 343-348CrossrefPubMedScopus (73)Google Scholar(N=93) | 3 (N=45) |</u>\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mean ± SD age (y) (range) | 77.8±8.3 (48–102) | 78±6.6 (60–91) | 79±8.6 (51–92) |\n| Men (%) | 51 | 67 | 60 |\n\n【56】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【57】Both men and women were at risk, but men seemed to be at higher risk both for becoming lost and for dying.

This finding could be explained neither by difference in age-there was no significant difference in age between men and women in any of the 3 studies (study 1: _t_ \\=1.9, _P_ \\=.06; study 2/3: _t_ \\=0.72, _P_ \\=.47)- nor by difference in type of residence (institution vs home) (study 1: χ  \\=2.84, _P_ \\=.24; study 2/3: χ  \\=7.26, _P_ \\=.19). Men were not more likely to be found farther from the place in which they were last seen than women (study 1: χ  \\=7.40, _P_ \\=.28; study 2/3: χ  \\=5.98, _P_ \\=.31), and the cause of death did not differ between men and women (study 2/3: χ  \\=2.90, _P_ \\=.72).\n\n【68】Although one might assume that individuals residing in professional-care settings would not be at risk, the studies indicated that persons with dementia in all types of living arrangements became lost in the community. A particularly disturbing finding from studies 2 and 3 is that 22% of the persons found dead lived in facilities such as assistedliving facilities and homes providing meals and personal care. This percentage far exceeds the percentage of the population of persons with dementia that resides in this type of facility, estimated to be less than 5%. Furthermore, by 2003 most nursing homes were using alarm technology in dementia units to alert the staff to potentially dangerous situations, like a resident exiting unaccompanied. However, in study 3, conducted using newspaper reports exclusively from 2003, 16% of persons with dementia found dead had resided in nursing homes.\n\n【69】Caregivers and health care professionals may often assume that persons with dementia who have exhibited the behavior of wandering are at risk of becoming lost, whereas those who have not wandered have little to no risk. In this context, _wandering_ is defined as inefficient travel that involves random movement and frequent changes in direction, pacing, or lapping.\n\n【70】无关删除-2:<u>*   Algase DL\n*   Beattie ER\n*   Therrien B</u>\n\n【71】Impact of cognitive impairment on wandering behavior.\n\n【72】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_West J Nurs Res._ 2001; 23 : 283-295</u></u>\n\n【73】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (40)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【74】However, we found that wandering was only 1 risk factor and that individuals who had never wandered became lost. It is particularly important that informal caregivers understand this distinction. Often, a caregiver will refuse any counseling regarding the problem of persons with dementia becoming lost because her or his relative has never wandered.\n\n【75】### WHAT CONSTITUTES A RISKY SITUATION?\n\n【76】Study 1 examined the context in which persons with dementia had become lost.\n\n【77】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rowe MA\n*   Glover JC</u>\n\n【78】Antecedents, descriptions and consequences of wandering in cognitively-impaired adults and the Safe Return (SR) program.\n\n【79】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen._ 2001; 16 : 344-352</u></u>\n\n【80】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (78)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【81】Not surprisingly, persons with dementia are at higher risk of becoming lost when they are left unattended, even in their own residences-whether private homes or professional settings-and even for only a moment. As shown in Table 2 , 13% of the persons with dementia who became lost had been on an outing that they regularly took alone, such as going for a walk or driving to a specific place. Approximately 65% of the persons with dementia who became lost were actually in the presence of a caregiver at the time: 18% were in a caregiving facility, 34% were with an individual caregiver who was either momentarily distracted or asleep, and 13% had had an argument with their caregiver at home or were otherwise agitated and left the home alone. The 4.8% who became lost in the context of being transported by a professionalcare service were usually dropped off at the entrance to a facility rather than accompanied inside. These findings highlight the unpredictability of this type of event: not only are all persons with dementia at risk but they also are at risk even in their own homes or during the course of activities that they may have performed without incident hundreds of times before.\n\n【82】TABLE 2 Context in Which Persons With Dementia Became Lost in Study 1\n\n【83】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rowe MA\n*   Glover JC</u>\n\n【84】Antecedents, descriptions and consequences of wandering in cognitively-impaired adults and the Safe Return (SR) program.\n\n【85】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen._ 2001; 16 : 344-352</u></u>\n\n【86】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (78)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n| Context | % (n=146) |\n| --- | --- |\n| At day care, nursing home, or other caregiving facility | 17.9 |\n| Outside of home with caregiver | 14.3 |\n| Agitated/difficult behavior of person with dementia in the home | 13.1 |\n| Caregiver distracted | 13.1 |\n| On a normal outing alone and did not return | 13.1 |\n| Home alone | 10.7 |\n| Caregiver asleep | 7.1 |\n| Out driving alone | 6.0 |\n| Being transported by professional-care services | 4.8 |\n\n【88】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【89】### WHAT FACTORS INCREASE THE RISK OF DEATH FOR A PERSON WITH DEMENTIA WHO HAS BECOME LOST?\n\n【90】The most striking distinction between the cases in which the person with dementia was found alive and those in which he or she was found dead is that most of those found alive remained out in the open in populated areas of the community,\n\n【91】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rowe MA\n*   Glover JC</u>\n\n【92】Antecedents, descriptions and consequences of wandering in cognitively-impaired adults and the Safe Return (SR) program.\n\n【93】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen._ 2001; 16 : 344-352</u></u>\n\n【94】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (78)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【95】whereas those who were found dead had generally secluded themselves in natural or sparsely populated areas.\n\n【96】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rowe MA\n*   Bennett V</u>\n\n【97】A look at deaths occurring in persons with dementia lost in the community.\n\n【98】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen._ 2003; 18 : 343-348</u></u>\n\n【99】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (73)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【100】Table 3 lists the places in which persons with dementia were found alive, and Table 4 combines data from studies 2 and 3 to list the places in which they were found dead.

For those found dead, only 29% were found within 24 hours. It is likely that this difference in time in finding persons with dementia is due, at least in part, to the fact that those who died had chosen to leave populated areas and, in many cases, to seclude themselves further by hiding in brush, ditches, or abandoned structures. Of course, the longer they are lost, the more likely persons with dementia will die because of exposure to the elements, particularly during the hottest and coldest times of the year. In studies 2 and 3, the highest number of deaths occurred in July (20 cases), followed in descending order by January (19), December (16), February (14), May (13), and August (12). Fewer than 10 deaths occurred in each of the remaining months.\n\n【119】TABLE 5 Time Required to Find Person With Dementia\n\n删除3:<u>| Time | Study 17Rowe MAGlover JCAntecedents, descriptions and consequences of wandering in cognitively-impaired adults and the Safe Return (SR) program._Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen._ 2001; 16 : 344-352CrossrefPubMedScopus (78)Google Scholar(%) | Studies 28Rowe MABennett VA look at deaths occurring in persons with dementia lost in the community._Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen._ 2003; 18 : 343-348CrossrefPubMedScopus (73)Google Scholarand 3 (%) |</u>\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| <12 h | 78.1 | 18.3 |\n| 12.1–24 h | 8.8 | 10.6 |\n| 1–7 d | 13.1 | 32.0 |\n| \\>7 d | 0.0 | 39.1 |\n\n【121】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【122】### WHAT ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE SEARCH STRATEGIES?\n\n【123】Several features of these cases stand out as critical for determining effective search strategies. Generally, persons with dementia did not travel far. Of those found alive in study 1, 87% were found within a 5-mile radius of the location in which they had last been seen.\n\n【124】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rowe MA\n*   Glover JC</u>\n\n【125】Antecedents, descriptions and consequences of wandering in cognitively-impaired adults and the Safe Return (SR) program.\n\n【126】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen._ 2001; 16 : 344-352</u></u>\n\n【127】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (78)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【128】Those who were found dead traveled even shorter distances, with 73% of individuals in study 2 being found within 1 mile of the place last seen and only 7% being found more than 5 miles away. In study 3, 40% were found within 0.5 miles of the place last seen and 74% within 1 mile. Only 2 individuals who traveled on foot were found more than 5 miles away.\n\n【129】Persons with dementia do not often behave in a predictable manner when they become lost. Information from study 1 showed that it was rare that any of the lost individuals asked for help. Rather, they were found when a good samaritan noticed that the person with dementia was behaving strangely or as the result of a search by law enforcement personnel. Furthermore, in the cases in which missing persons with dementia were found dead, it was frequently discovered that searchers had passed very near the places in which the persons with dementia were eventually found, but the lost individuals had not responded to the searchers' calls. In all 3 studies, predictions of where the individual might have gone, generally made by family members, sent searchers in the wrong direction. Thus, the accuracy of the search was not enhanced when searchers relied on families' predictions to determine the location or direction of the search.\n\n【130】These principles were applicable even when the individual had become lost while driving a vehicle. It is unlikely that a person with dementia can successfully negotiate all the steps required to refuel an automobile. In all 3 studies, only 1 individual drove farther than could be managed on a typical tank of gas (~200 miles). Once the automobile would no longer go (ran out of gas, got stuck off the road, etc), the person with dementia continued on foot. In studies 2 and 3, those found dead after driving were all found within 1 mile of the automobile, and most were found within 0.1 mile.\n\n【131】These findings suggest several strategies for a successful search. First, because family members' predictions of a lost person's actions do not appear to aid in the search efforts, searches should be designed around the general findings of research, rather than around individual characteristics of the missing person with dementia.\n\n【132】Second, caregivers should report that a person with dementia is missing immediately to both Safe Return, in the case of a registered individual, and the local law enforcement agency. An intensive search should begin promptly so that the individual has less time to find a secluded hiding place and has minimal exposure to the elements. Law enforcement personnel typically delay initiating a search for missing persons because the hope is that individuals will return on their own. The search then follows an escalating strategy. However, in cases involving persons with dementia, it is crucial to begin the search as quickly and as thoroughly as possible. It is particularly important to respond immediately in instances involving institutional settings because it can take hours for personnel to discover and/or report that an individual is missing. Searches should continue throughout the night because persons with dementia often continue to wander and are at greater risk of injury.\n\n【133】Third, the initial 6 to 12 hours of the search should cover a 5-mile radius around the location in which the person with dementia was last seen. These early efforts should focus on the types of locations listed in Table 3 , both outside and inside easily accessible buildings. If the individual is not found through these initial efforts, the subsequent search should be devoted to an intensive foot search of natural and sparsely populated areas, beginning within a 1-mile radius around the location in which the individual was last seen and extending from there. Because persons with dementia are often extremely difficult to find and most do not travel more than a mile, it may also be useful to search the area within a 1-mile radius more than once. Of importance, persons with dementia typically neither call for help nor respond to searchers' calls. Thus, it may be advisable to organize a number of searchers closely spaced in a horizontal line to move through an area together. If the individual traveled by automobile, initial search efforts should focus on locating the vehicle. Once the automobile is found, the search should continue as aforementioned, using the automobile as the focal point.\n\n【134】Although persons with dementia were found most commonly by either searchers or passersby traveling on foot, some searches involved more sophisticated techniques, such as scent-sniffing dogs and aircraft. Even though these techniques may occasionally prove useful, it is important to note that the locations in which most of the dead persons with dementia were found were not conducive to either aerial or scent searches because the individuals often took extra measures to seclude themselves.\n\n【135】IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PRACTITIONER\n---------------------------------\n\n【136】### EDUCATING INFORMAL CAREGIVERS\n\n【137】The best way to avoid a tragic outcome is to prevent persons with dementia from becoming lost. Practitioners can play an important role in this endeavor by educating informal and formal caregivers. It is crucial to emphasize to caregivers that all persons with dementia are at risk, regardless of whether they have exhibited any “risky” behavior in the past. Many caregivers assume that persons with dementia who have not wandered or become lost in the past are not at risk of becoming lost in the future. Practitioners can ensure that their patients' caregivers are aware of the problem and help them to identify both high-risk situations and appropriate resources to assist them in preparing for an incident before it occurs.\n\n【138】The risk to persons with dementia of becoming lost is highest when they are left home alone, are able to leave the house unattended during the night or on regular outings during the day, or leave the home when angry. Practitioners can assist informal caregivers in identifying areas of potential risk and ensure that they are aware of appropriate community resources, such as day care and respite-care facilities, and experts who may be able to provide advice on particular topics. Caregiver support groups, often sponsored by local chapters of the Alzheimer's Association, can also be helpful.\n\n【139】Registration with Safe Return or similar programs is critical. Persons with dementia lost in the community often will not be able to remember their addresses, telephone numbers, or even their full names. Programs like Safe Return 删除4:<u>(see Appendix)</u> keep this information on file; thus, timely return of these individuals to their homes can be posible.\n\n【140】### WORKING WITH PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS\n\n【141】Physicians and other health care practitioners have an important role in assisting personnel in formal-care settings prepare adequate safety plans to prevent their clients or residents from becoming lost. On the basis of the aforementioned findings of the research, persons with dementia living in residential-care settings seem to be at particular risk. Thus, it is critical that medical directors of such facilities review mechanisms for preventing residents from leaving. The facility must have a well-functioning system in place and evaluate the actual use of the system. In several cases from the research, employees had actually inactivated the system for some reason before a person disappeared. In addition, each facility should have a formal plan for reporting missing individuals. In our studies, we found that it was not uncommon for residential-care facilities to either delay the beginning of the search substantially or to use only their own resources in the search rather than contacting law enforcement. As mentioned previously, an appropriately designed search begun promptly can make a major-often life-and-death-difference in the outcome.\n\n【142】Of importance, particularly in states or localities where there are few regulations governing safe housing for persons with dementia, the level of security in residential-care facilities varies greatly. When caregivers are considering institutional placement, the practitioner can assist them in identifying facilities that have the strongest safety policies in place or suggest criteria for evaluating those policies.\n\n【143】### WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\n【144】Once an individual has become lost, his or her health care provider can play a useful role as advocate for the caregiver in interactions with law enforcement agencies. As such, they may identify important search techniques or defuse any concerns expressed about the adequacy of care provided by the caregiver. It might be helpful to provide law enforcement personnel with information about or references to this research so that they can better target their search strategies to find lost persons with dementia quickly.\n\n【145】Health care practitioners might also consider providing training on dementia to local law enforcement personnel. These professionals potentially interact with persons with dementia and their caregivers in a variety of situations, including episodes in which the person with dementia has become lost and instances in which the caregiver requires assistance with an angry or agitated person with dementia. Education on the basics of dementia and Alzheimer disease can help to ensure that law enforcement personnel respond appropriately.\n\n【146】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【147】The health care practitioner is in a unique situation not only to prevent persons with dementia from becoming lost but also to facilitate an effective search.\n\n【148】无关删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【149】无关删除-1:<u>_We acknowledge Chad Phipps, nursing student, for his assistance in collecting data for study 3._</u>\n\n【150】无关删除-1:<u>APPENDIX\n--------</u>\n\n【151】无关删除-1:<u>### SAFE RETURN</u>\n\n【152】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>Safe Return is administered by the Alzheimer's Association.

The automated digital algorithm was derived from secondary analysis of an observational cohort study of 1447 patients admitted to the intensive care unit from January 1 through December 31, 2006, and validated in an independent cohort of 240 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the automated digital algorithm and _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)_ codes were compared with comprehensive medical record review (reference standard) for the Charlson comorbidities.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In the derivation cohort, the automated digital algorithm achieved a median sensitivity of 100% (range, 99%-100%) and a median specificity of 99.7% (range, 99%-100%). In the validation cohort, the sensitivity of the automated digital algorithm ranged from 91% to 100%, and the specificity ranged from 98% to 100%. The sensitivity of the _ICD-9_ codes ranged from 8% for dementia to 100% for leukemia, whereas specificity ranged from 86% for congestive heart failure to 100% for leukemia, dementia, and AIDS.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Our results suggest that search strategies that use automated electronic search strategies to extract Charlson comorbidities from the clinical notes contained within the electronic medical record are feasible and reliable. Automated digital algorithm outperformed _ICD-9_ codes in all the Charlson variables except leukemia, with greater sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CCI ( Charlson Comorbidity Index ), CI ( confidence interval ), DDQB ( Data Discovery and Query Builder ), EMR ( electronic medical record ), ICD-9 ( International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision ), ICU ( intensive care unit ), IQR ( interquartile range ), MCLSS ( Mayo Clinic Life Sciences System ), NPV ( negative predictive value ), PPV ( positive predictive value ), SNOMED-CT ( Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine–Clinical Terms )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "f49454b8-83ad-435d-8d0c-9a6b33759705", "title": "Telaprevir (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Telaprevir (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Incivek\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Telaprevir is used in combination with injectable peginterferon alfa (Pegasys®, Pegintron®) and ribavirin (Copegus®, Rebetol®) to treat chronic hepatitis C infection. These medicines are used in patients with liver disease (including cirrhosis) who have not been treated before or who have received other medicines that did not work well. Telaprevir is an antiviral agent.\n\n【6】This medicine was available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【7】Telaprevir was withdrawn from the United States market on October 16, 2014.\n\n【8】Before Using\n------------\n\n【9】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【10】### Allergies\n\n【11】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【12】### Pediatric\n\n【13】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of telaprevir in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【14】### Geriatric\n\n【15】Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of telaprevir have not been performed in the geriatric population, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver problems, which may require caution in patients receiving telaprevir.\n\n【16】### Breastfeeding\n\n【17】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【18】### Drug Interactions\n\n【19】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【20】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【25】*   Atazanavir\n*   Efavirenz\n\n【26】### Other Interactions\n\n【27】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【28】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【29】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【30】*   Anemia or\n*   Blood or bone marrow problems or\n*   Gout, history of or\n*   Weakened immune system (eg, HIV or AIDS)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【31】*   Liver disease, moderate to severe—Should not be used in patients with this condition.\n\n【32】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【33】To help clear up your infection completely, telaprevir must be taken together with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for the full time of treatment, even if you begin to feel better after a few days. Also, it is important to keep the amount of medicine in your body at a steady level. To help keep the amount constant, telaprevir must be used on a regular schedule.\n\n【34】Telaprevir should be taken within 30 minutes after eating a high-fat meal or snack (containing about 20 grams of fat). Ask your doctor about examples of food that you can eat that contain 20 grams of fat.\n\n【35】This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow the information carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions. Ask your pharmacist for the Medication Guide if you do not have one.\n\n【36】### Dosing\n\n【37】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【38】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【39】*   For oral dosage form (tablet):\n    *   For hepatitis C virus infection, in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin:\n        *   Adults—750 milligrams (mg) (two 375-mg tablets) 3 times a day with food. Each dose should be taken 7 to 9 hours apart.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【40】### Missed Dose\n\n【41】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【42】If you miss a dose or forget to take your medicine and it is less than 4 hours from the time your regular dose was scheduled, take the tablet as soon as you can. If you miss a dose and it is more than 4 hours from the time your regular dose was scheduled, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the regular time. Call your doctor if you have questions about this.\n\n【43】### Storage\n\n【44】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【45】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【46】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【47】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【48】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【49】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【50】Using this medicine together with ribavirin while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. These medicines may also cause birth defects if the father is using it when his sexual partner becomes pregnant. If a pregnancy occurs while you are using these medicines, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【51】To make sure you are not pregnant, your doctor may ask you to have a pregnancy test before you start using this medicine. You must have a negative pregnancy test before you will be allowed to use this medicine with ribavirin. Two forms of birth control must be used during treatment and for 6 months after treatment ends. You should test for pregnancy every month while you are using this medicine, and for 6 months after your treatment ends.\n\n【52】Do not use the following medicines while you are using this medicine: alfuzosin (Uroxatral®), cisapride (Propulsid®), oral midazolam (Versed®), pimozide (Orap®), rifampin (Rifadin®, Rimactane®), sildenafil (Revatio®), St. John's wort, tadalafil (Adcirca®), triazolam (Halcion®), certain medicines to lower cholesterol (such as lovastatin, simvastatin, Mevacor®, Zocor®), or ergot medicines (such as dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine, Cafergot®, Ergomar®, Wigraine®). Using telaprevir with any of these medicines can cause very serious medical problems.\n\n【53】Serious skin reactions can occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have a severe skin rash, blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, fever or chills, hives or welts, red skin lesions, acne, sores or ulcers on the skin, or yellowing of the skin or the whites of your eyes.\n\n【54】Check with your doctor right away if you have back, leg, or stomach pains, bleeding gums, chills, dark urine, difficulty with breathing, fever, general body swelling, headache, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, nosebleeds, pale skin, sore throat, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellowing of the eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a blood disorder called anemia.\n\n【55】Birth control pills may not work while you are using this medicine. To keep from getting pregnant, use two other forms of birth control. Other forms of birth control include condoms, diaphragms, or contraceptive foams or jellies.\n\n【56】Using this medicine with peginterferon alfa can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets in the blood, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【57】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【58】Do not change or suddenly stop using this medicine without checking first with your doctor.\n\n【59】This medicine will not keep you from giving hepatitis C to other people. Follow your doctor's instructions about how to prevent the spread of this infection.\n\n【60】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【61】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【62】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【63】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【64】#### More common\n\n【65】1.  Black, tarry stools\n2.  bleeding gums\n3.  blood in the urine or stools\n4.  chills\n5.  cough\n6.  fever\n7.  joint pain, stiffness, or swelling\n8.  lower back, side, or stomach pain\n9.  painful or difficult urination\n10.  pale skin\n11.  pinpoint red spots on the skin\n12.  rash\n13.  shortness of breath\n14.  sore throat\n15.  swelling of the feet or lower legs\n16.  troubled breathing with exertion\n17.  ulcers, sores, or white spots in the mouth\n18.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n19.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n\n【66】#### Rare\n\n【67】1.  Blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin\n2.  cloudy urine\n3.  dark urine\n4.  diarrhea\n5.  difficulty with breathing\n6.  drowsiness\n7.  general tiredness and weakness\n8.  headache\n9.  itching\n10.  joint or muscle pain\n11.  light-colored stools\n12.  nausea or vomiting\n13.  red skin lesions, often with a purple center\n14.  red, irritated eyes\n15.  swelling or puffiness of the face\n16.  unusual weight gain\n17.  upper right abdominal or stomach pain\n18.  yellow eyes and skin\n\n【68】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【69】#### More common\n\n【70】1.

Particularly with the advent of newer data regarding the utility of prostate-specific antigen in a screening population, it is apparent that any decision to screen or not to screen should be made after a discussion with the patient about the merits and risks of screening.

Tethered cord syndrome is a disorder that occurs when tissue attached to the spinal cord limits its movements. Signs and symptoms may include weakness or numbness in the legs and bladder or bowel incontinence.\n\n【10】The risks of these spinal problems increase if the sacral dimple is accompanied by a nearby tuft of hair, skin tag or lump, and certain types of skin discoloration\n\n【11】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "d776da51-7ba6-4d60-8f86-d9edde8f5213", "title": "Dwarfism", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Dwarfism is short stature that results from a genetic or medical condition. Dwarfism is generally defined as an adult height of 4 feet 10 inches (147 centimeters) or less. The average adult height among people with dwarfism is 4 feet (122 cm).\n\n【2】Many different medical conditions cause dwarfism. In general, the disorders are divided into two broad categories:\n\n【3】*   **Disproportionate dwarfism.** If body size is disproportionate, some parts of the body are small, and others are of average size or above-average size. Disorders causing disproportionate dwarfism inhibit the development of bones.\n*   **Proportionate dwarfism.** A body is proportionately small if all parts of the body are small to the same degree and appear to be proportioned like a body of average stature. Medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood limit overall growth and development.\n\n【4】Some people prefer the term \"short stature\" or \"little people\" rather than \"dwarf\" or \"dwarfism.\" So it's important to be sensitive to the preference of someone who has this disorder. Short stature disorders do not include familial short stature — short height that's considered a normal variation with normal bone development.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms — other than short stature — vary considerably across the spectrum of disorders.\n\n【7】### Disproportionate dwarfism\n\n【8】Most people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature. Usually, this means that a person has an average-size trunk and very short limbs, but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened (but disproportionately large) limbs. In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body.\n\n【9】Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities. Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus).\n\n【10】The most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature. This disorder usually results in the following:\n\n【11】*   An average-size trunk\n*   Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs\n*   Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers\n*   Limited mobility at the elbows\n*   A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose\n*   Progressive development of bowed legs\n*   Progressive development of swayed lower back\n*   An adult height around 4 feet (122 cm)\n\n【12】Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include:\n\n【13】*   A very short trunk\n*   A short neck\n*   Shortened arms and legs\n*   Average-size hands and feet\n*   Broad, rounded chest\n*   Slightly flattened cheekbones\n*   Opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate)\n*   Hip deformities that result in thighbones turning inward\n*   A foot that's twisted or out of shape\n*   Instability of the neck bones\n*   Progressive hunching curvature of the upper spine\n*   Progressive development of swayed lower back\n*   Vision and hearing problems\n*   Arthritis and problems with joint movement\n*   Adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm)\n\n【14】### Proportionate dwarfism\n\n【15】Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're proportionate to each other. Because these disorders affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems.\n\n【16】Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone, which is essential for normal childhood growth. Signs include:\n\n【17】*   Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts\n*   Growth rate slower than expected for age\n*   Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years\n\n【18】### When to see a doctor\n\n【19】Signs and symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism are often present at birth or in early infancy. Proportionate dwarfism may not be immediately apparent. See your child's doctor if you have any concerns about your child's growth or overall development.\n\n【20】Causes\n------\n\n【21】Most dwarfism-related conditions are genetic disorders, but the causes of some disorders are unknown. Most occurrences of dwarfism result from a random genetic mutation in either the father's sperm or the mother's egg rather than from either parent's complete genetic makeup.\n\n【22】### Achondroplasia\n\n【23】About 80 percent of people with achondroplasia are born to parents of average height. A person with achondroplasia and with two average-size parents received one mutated copy of the gene associated with the disorder and one normal copy of the gene. A person with the disorder may pass along either a mutated or normal copy to his or her own children.\n\n【24】### Turner syndrome\n\n【25】Turner syndrome, a condition that affects only girls and women, results when a sex chromosome (the X chromosome) is missing or partially missing. A female inherits an X chromosome from each parent. A girl with Turner syndrome has only one fully functioning copy of the female sex chromosome rather than two.\n\n【26】### Growth hormone deficiency\n\n【27】The cause of growth hormone deficiency can sometimes be traced to a genetic mutation or injury, but for most people with the disorder, no cause can be identified.\n\n【28】### Other causes\n\n【29】Other causes of dwarfism include other genetic disorders, deficiencies in other hormones or poor nutrition. Sometimes the cause is unknown.\n\n【30】Complications\n-------------\n\n【31】Complications of dwarfism-related disorders can vary greatly, but some complications are common to a number of conditions.\n\n【32】### Disproportionate dwarfism\n\n【33】The characteristic features of the skull, spine and limbs shared by most forms of disproportionate dwarfism result in some common problems:\n\n【34】*   Delays in motor skills development, such as sitting up, crawling and walking\n*   Frequent ear infections and risk of hearing loss\n*   Bowing of the legs\n*   Difficulty breathing during sleep (sleep apnea)\n*   Pressure on the spinal cord at the base of the skull\n*   Excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus)\n*   Crowded teeth\n*   Progressive severe hunching or swaying of the back with back pain or problems breathing\n*   Narrowing of the channel in the lower spine (spinal stenosis), resulting in pressure on the spinal cord and subsequent pain or numbness in the legs\n*   Arthritis\n*   Weight gain that can further complicate problems with joints and the spine and place pressure on nerves\n\n【35】### Proportionate dwarfism\n\n【36】With proportionate dwarfism, problems in growth and development often result in complications with poorly developed organs. For example, heart problems that often occur with Turner syndrome can have a significant effect on health. An absence of sexual maturation associated with growth hormone deficiency or Turner syndrome affects both physical development and social functioning.\n\n【37】### Pregnancy\n\n【38】Women with disproportionate dwarfism may develop respiratory problems during pregnancy. A C-section (cesarean delivery) is almost always necessary because the size and shape of the pelvis doesn't allow for successful vaginal delivery.\n\n【39】### Public perceptions\n\n【40】Most people with dwarfism prefer not to be labeled by a condition. However, some people may refer to themselves as dwarfs, little people or people of short stature. The word \"midget\" is generally considered an offensive term.\n\n【41】People of average height may have misconceptions about people with dwarfism. And the portrayal of people with dwarfism in modern movies often includes stereotypes. Misconceptions can impact a person's self-esteem and limit opportunities for success in school or employment.\n\n【42】Children with dwarfism are particularly vulnerable to teasing and ridicule from classmates. Because dwarfism is relatively uncommon, children may feel isolated from their peers.\n\n【43】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Genetic testing can help determine which family members have the disorder and require sur-veillance endoscopy. Astute physicians may detect unsuspected FAP in patients with extraintestinal manifestations such as hard or soft cutaneous tumors. Colectomy will prevent cancer but is often necessary before the patient is 20 years old. Postoperative lifelong surveillance is indicated to screen for associated duodenal, thyroid, and rectal or ileal neoplasms. Attenuated FAP variants are less typical and may be confused with other types of familial colorectal neoplasia. Chemoprevention, regression, and other treatment strategies are being developed to improve the management of extracolonic neoplasms and desmoid tumors. A better understanding of the natural history of these FAP-associated AP-associated phenomena will facilitate the rational selection of interventions. Management guidelines that were recently developed at Mayo Clinic Rochester to provide for uniform care and surveillance are discussed.\n\n【1】APC ( adenomatous polyposis coli ), CHRPE ( congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium ), FAP ( familial adenomatous polyposis ), HNPCC ( hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ), PTT ( protein truncation testing )\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

He had not had a gastrointestinal work-up previously and had received only symptomatic treatments. His right upper quadrant discomfort was associated with eating. He presented after a recurrent acute episode of severe right upper quadrant pain that lasted “several hours,” which had improved but not completely resolved. On presentation, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination revealed an obese man in no acute distress with minimal epigastric tenderness on palpation. His medications included aspirin, calcium-vitamin D, cyanocobalamin, furosemide, levothyroxine, lisinopril, metoprolol succinate, naproxen, niacin, fish oil, omeprazole, vitamin C, and vitamin E.

Abdominal radiography may reveal air in the biliary tract (pneumobilia) but is a poor test for cholelithiasis. Right upper quadrant ultrasonography is the test of choice because it is inexpensive, noninvasive, and highly specific.\n\n【19】Given concern about cholelithiasis, right upper quadrant ultrasonography was performed and revealed the presence of gallstones and sludge but no pericholecystic fluid, gallbladder wall thickening, or ductal dilation. The patient was asymptomatic and did not have another flare of his abdominal pain after ultrasonography.\n\n【20】*   2.\n\n【21】    **Given the findings thus far, which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ next step in management?**\n\n【22】    *   a.\n\n【23】        Close observation\n\n【24】    *   b.\n\n【25】        Follow-up ultrasonography at 6 months\n\n【26】    *   c.\n\n【27】        Symptomatic treatment with analgesics\n\n【28】    *   d.\n\n【29】        Elective cholecystectomy\n\n【30】    *   e.\n\n【31】        Trial of medical therapy with oral bile acids\n\n【32】Patients with cholelithiasis can be separated into 2 broad categories: symptomatic and asymptomatic.

At a follow-up appointment 2 weeks after cholecystectomy, the patient reported doing well with as-needed postoperative opioid analgesics and had no postoperative complications or recurrent abdominal pain. Two months later, he requested an appointment because of loose stools that had been persistent since his cholecystectomy. He noted that more than half of his stools were “watery,” and the diarrhea was worse with consumption of greasy foods. He specifically denied any association with the intake of dairy products and found that loperamide was moderately helpful.\n\n【49】*   3.\n\n【50】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ cause of the patient's diarrhea?**\n\n【51】    *   a.\n\n【52】        Biliary leakage\n\n【53】    *   b.\n\n【54】        Bile acid malabsorption\n\n【55】    *   c.\n\n【56】        Medication adverse effects\n\n【57】    *   d.\n\n【58】        Gastrointestinal infection\n\n【59】    *   e.\n\n【60】        Malabsorption\n\n【61】Biliary leakage is a rare, but known, complication of cholecystectomy, but it does not present with diarrhea.

It can be objectively evaluated with relatively new testing techniques that measure total bile acids in the stool. Medications could certainly induce diarrhea, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient's only new medications were opioid analgesics for postoperative pain. Many types of gastrointestinal infection can present with diarrhea, but this patient has no history to suggest infection, and a consequence of surgical treatment is more likely given the postoperative change in anatomy and physiology. Finally, malabsorption is a well-known cause of diarrhea, but a new-onset malabsorptive syndrome is a less likely pathologic mechanism in this patient given his recent surgical procedure.\n\n【67】After an initial unsuccessful trial of avoidance of greasy foods, cholestyramine was prescribed for bile acid malabsorption, and the diarrhea resolved. Two months later, the patient was seen in the clinic for his yearly general medical examination. Routine screening laboratory tests revealed a normal complete blood cell count and electrolyte panel results; however, his thyrotropin level had increased from 1.13 mIU/L a year and a half previously to 51.7 mIU/L.\n\n【68】*   4.\n\n【69】    **In view of the clinical circumstances, which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ cause of the patient's hypothyroidism?**\n\n【70】    *   a.\n\n【71】        Natural course of thyroid disease\n\n【72】    *   b.\n\n【73】        Nonadherence to medication\n\n【74】    *   c.\n\n【75】        Medication interaction\n\n【76】    *   d.\n\n【77】        Laboratory error\n\n【78】    *   e.\n\n【79】        Nonthyroidal illness (euthyroid sick syndrome)\n\n【80】Patients' thyroid replacement needs can change over time because of changes in the underlying disease process, aging, or a change in their health status. However, we would not expect the drastic changes in thyrotropin level seen in this patient. Nonadherence is always a potential concern but is not the most likely scenario for the current patient. The most likely cause of the hypothyroidism is an interaction between levothyroxine and cholestyramine that has altered the bioavailability of the levothyroxine.\n\n【81】无关删除-2:<u>*   Harmon S.M.\n*   Seifert C.F.</u>\n\n【82】Levothyroxine-cholestyramine interaction reemphasized.\n\n【83】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 1991; 115 : 658-659</u></u>\n\n【84】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (50)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【85】Laboratory error is a possibility but is less likely in view of his medications.

The patient did not report worsening fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, or skin concerns.\n\n【87】*   5.\n\n【88】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ treatment for the patient's hypothyroidism?**\n\n【89】    *   a.\n\n【90】        Separate medication administration temporally\n\n【91】    *   b.\n\n【92】        Discontinue bile acid binder\n\n【93】    *   c.\n\n【94】        Increase levothyroxine dose\n\n【95】    *   d.\n\n【96】        Observation because the patient is asymptomatic\n\n【97】    *   e.\n\n【98】        An alternative form of thyroid replacement therapy\n\n【99】Patients are often counseled to take levothyroxine before breakfast and independent of other medications to reduce the risk of medication interactions. The first step in management is to counsel the patient on separating his or her medications temporally to avoid compromising levothyroxine bioavailability. Discontinuing the bile acid binder may cause a recurrence of his diarrhea and is unnecessary. This patient may ultimately need an increased dose of levothyroxine, but this is not the first step in management. Even though the patient is asymptomatic, treatment is indicated because his thyrotropin level is greater than 10 mIU/L, the point at which there is increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure.\n\n【100】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rodondi N.\n*   Newman A.B.\n*   Vittinghoff E.\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【101】Subclinical hypothyroidism and the risk of heart failure, other cardiovascular events, and death.\n\n【102】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Intern Med._ 2005; 165 : 2460-2466</u></u>\n\n【103】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (407)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【104】无关删除-2:<u>*   Garber J.R.\n*   Cobin R.H.\n*   Gharib H.\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【105】Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association.\n\n【106】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Endocr Pract._ 2012; 18 ( \\[published correction appears in Endocr Pract. 2013;19(1):175\\] ) : 988-1028</u></u>\n\n【107】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【108】There are other options for thyroid replacement therapy, but this patient has tolerated oral levothyroxine long-term and can continue with this regimen if the aforementioned precautions are taken.\n\n【109】The patient was counseled on the correct administration and timing of his medications.

Synthetic levothyroxine is often the initial drug of choice given its track record of efficacy. However, management of hypothyroidism can prove difficult if patients are not counseled regarding medication administration. Furthermore, physicians must also be aware of both potential complicating comorbidities and medication interactions that can affect the absorption of levothyroxine and therefore the drug's efficacy.\n\n【121】The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism are often vague and nonspecific. Therefore, laboratory testing primarily drives long-term management of thyroid replacement therapy. Thyrotropin is uniquely sensitive to the plasma levels of free thyroid hormone, making it an excellent test for evaluating the efficacy of thyroid replacement therapy.\n\n【122】无关删除-2:<u>*   Garber J.R.\n*   Cobin R.H.\n*   Gharib H.\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【123】Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association.\n\n【124】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Endocr Pract._ 2012; 18 ( \\[published correction appears in Endocr Pract. 2013;19(1):175\\] ) : 988-1028</u></u>\n\n【125】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【126】Routine periodic measurement of thyrotropin levels allows for medication titration with the goal of euthyroidism. However, an elevated thyrotropin level in the setting of levothyroxine therapy may belie inadequate replacement for reasons other than suboptimal dosing.\n\n【127】As with all medications, levothyroxine bioavailability will determine efficacy. The medication must be not only bioavailable but consistently so. Medication adherence, as with all drug therapy, is essential, but simply taking the medication daily is not enough. For patients, timing and potential coadministration are particularly important with levothyroxine therapy, making physician counseling critical. For physicians, understanding the physiology is important for adequate counseling. The current case illustrates this point particularly well because cholestyramine is one of the most potent inhibitors of levothyroxine absorption and may necessitate dosage increase regardless of temporally spaced dosing.\n\n【128】Levothyroxine absorption occurs mostly in the small intestine at the jejunum and ileum.\n\n【129】无关删除-2:<u>*   Liwanpo L.\n*   Hershman J.M.</u>\n\n【130】Conditions and drugs interfering with thyroxine absorption.\n\n【131】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab._ 2009; 23 : 781-792</u></u>\n\n【132】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (164)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【133】Optimal absorption occurs when the stomach is empty because gastric acidity supports the process; therefore, patients should take levothyroxine on an empty stomach 60 minutes before food intake.\n\n【134】无关删除-2:<u>*   Liwanpo L.\n*   Hershman J.M.</u>\n\n【135】Conditions and drugs interfering with thyroxine absorption.\n\n【136】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab._ 2009; 23 : 781-792</u></u>\n\n【137】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (164)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【138】Often, the simplest regimen is to have patients take the medication immediately on waking in the morning. Furthermore, drug coadministration is of particular concern. The list of potential interactions is extensive, so a recommendation that patients take levothyroxine separately from other medications is reasonable. However, this plan can be logistically difficult for patients who take numerous drugs. In this situation, if there is a known reaction, levothyroxine and offending medications should be separated by at least 4 to 6 hours. Common offending medications include ferrous sulfate, sucralfate, calcium carbonate, proton pump inhibitors, and cholestyramine. Medication timing can be especially difficult with concomitant proton pump inhibitor therapy because it is often recommended to be taken 30 minutes before breakfast. In this setting, evening levothyroxine or proton pump inhibitor dosing could be considered. It is also important to be aware of stable chronic or newly acquired comorbidities that affect absorption. These conditions include bowel resection, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, lactose intolerance, _Helicobacter pylori_ infection, small-intestine bacterial overgrowth, and chronic gastritis.\n\n【139】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hollowell J.G.\n*   Staehling N.W.\n*   Flanders W.D.\n删除7:<u>*   et al.</u></u>\n\n【140】Serum TSH, T(4), and thyroid antibodies in the United States population (1988 to 1994): National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).\n\n【141】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Endocrinol Metab._ 2002; 87 : 489-499</u></u>\n\n【142】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2049)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【143】These lists are by no means comprehensive, and physicians should include medication interaction in the differential diagnosis in the setting of a change in patient replacement requirements even if the patient is not taking the most common offending agents.\n\n【144】Physicians should also be aware of other factors that can alter levothyroxine dosing and efficacy.

He was the creator of a spectacularly popular series of crime-solving adventures involving the exploits of Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson. In the span of about 40 years, 4 novels and 56 related short stories featuring Holmes and Watson were published. They have sold in the many millions of copies, including various editions and translations. The central figures of these adventures have been metamorphosed from characters in stories into real persons. They were so well drawn by Doyle that they transcended the printed page and became living, breathing human beings to thousands of enthusiastic devotees. Enough books and articles have been published about these characters and their adventures to fill a sizable library. Bibliographic tools note at least 30,000 items such as biographies, postage stamps issued in their honor, directories, encyclopedias, periodicals, cards, cartoons, advertisements, memorabilia, more than 300 movies, more than 75 television productions, more than 70 plays, several musicals, 35 different series broadcast on the radio, and at least 1 ballet. Sherlock Holmes has even been awarded an Honorary Diploma in the Art and Science of Sleuthing from Colorado State University (Fort Collins).\n\n【2】Holmes and Watson are 2 of the most immediately recognizable figures in popular culture. Their images have been adapted countless times for innumerable purposes. Biographical data concerning them can be drawn from the research efforts of Holmesian authorities.\n\n【3】Sherlock Holmes, probably William Sherlock Holmes, was born on January 6, 1854, in the North Riding of Yorkshire (England). His father, a country squire, was probably named Sigerson, and his maternal grandmother was a sister of French painter Horace Vernet (1789-1863). Sherlock had 2 brothers, Mycroft and Sherrinford. Mycroft worked for the English government, and Sherrinford emigrated to the Territory of New Mexico, where he died of smallpox in 1885. Sherlock attended either the University of Cambridge or the University of Oxford. He went to London after about 2 years without obtaining his degree. Holmes never married because he believed it would bias his judgment. In many respects, he was a complicated character. Nothing could exceed his puissance when he was working, but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for hours on end he would lie on the sofa hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle. He sometimes turned to drugs for stimulation, and then an even blacker depression would overtake him, from which he could be rescued only by a case.\n\n【4】John Henry or Hamish Watson was born on July 7 or September 18, 1852, in Hampshire (England). He had 1 brother, Henry, who was “a drunkard.” After his mother's death when he was still quite young, Watson moved with his father to Australia. He returned to England, obtained his medical degree in 1878 at the University of London, practiced medicine (first at the St Bartholomew Hospital in London and then at the army surgical school at Netley near Southampton), and was subsequently sent to India, where he was attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as assistant surgeon. Watson was wounded on July 27, 1880, at the “fatal battle of Maiwand” (Afghanistan). After a long convalescence in a base hospital, he returned to England, where he was introduced to Holmes and began their “great partnership.” From 1903, he served as medical officer at a London asylum, took a teaching post in Birmingham, set up a general practice, did some surgery, retired, and finally settled in the Northwest. Watson was kind, sensible, genial, and composed. He enjoyed sports, tales of the sea, Turkish baths, and dogs. He was possessed of a kind of wild courage and tended to be romantic, easily deceived, occasionally rash, and sometimes headstrong.\n\n【5】Regarding the deaths of Holmes and Watson, we can borrow from a sonnet written by Vincent Starrett (1886-1974):\n\n【6】“Here dwell together still two men of note\n\n【7】Who never lived and so can never die….\n\n【8】Here, though the world explode, these two survive.\n\n【9】And it is always eighteen ninety-five.”\n\n【10】Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes, and Dr John Watson were honored on a set of 4 stamps showing scenes from the adventures of Sherlock Holmes. One of the stamps (Scott No. 632), issued by Turks and Caicos Islands in 1984, depicts Holmes introducing Dr Watson to Mycroft Holmes in _The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter_ .\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【13】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/80.6.722</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>© 2005 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

There is a paucity of data on the long-term effect of coronary revascularization at the time of myectomy. Between January 1, 1961, and October 31, 2017, 2913 adult patients underwent transaortic septal myectomy at Mayo Clinic. Concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed in 246 (8.4%). We compared baseline characteristics of patients who underwent septal myectomy with and without CABG and assessed the effect of surgical revascularization on the risk of all-cause mortality. Patients who underwent concomitant CABG were older (median \\[interquartile range\\], 66.3 \\[59.8-72.1\\] years vs 54.4 \\[43.5-64.8\\] years; _P_ <.0001) and more likely to be male (63.0% vs 54.2%; _P_ \\=.008) than those who did not undergo coronary revascularization at operation. There was no significant difference in preoperative left ventricular outflow tract gradients (55 \\[25-81\\] mm Hg vs 58 \\[25-88\\] mm Hg; _P_ \\=.116). Overall operative mortality (≤30 days after surgery) was 1.0% and higher in patients who underwent concomitant CABG (2.2% vs 0.8%; _P_ \\=.048). In multivariable analysis (n=2641), factors independently associated with mortality included concomitant CABG (hazard ratio \\[95% CI\\], 1.89 \\[1.39-2.58\\]; _P_ <.0001), older age at operation (per interquartile range increase, 2.79 \\[1.95-3.98\\]; _P_ <.0001), atrial fibrillation (1.46 \\[1.11-1.92\\]; _P_ \\=.006), diabetes (1.45 \\[1.04-2.04\\]; _P_ \\=.031), higher body mass index (change from 0.95 to 0.5 quantile, 1.95 \\[1.46-2.59\\]; _P_ <.0001), and surgery performed earlier in the study period (2.02 \\[1.31-3.11\\]; _P_ \\=.001). In conclusion, obstructive coronary artery disease severe enough to prompt concomitant CABG at the time of septal myectomy is an important risk factor for late mortality.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CABG ( concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting ), HCM ( hypertrophic cardiomyopathy )\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

The superior durability of LIMA in terms of long-term patency and coronary flow supply compared with other conduits routinely used in CABG, such as the radial artery or the saphenous vein (SV), has historically been attributed to its specific structural attributes and mechanical properties. Differences in endothelial cell function, extracellular matrix composition (eg, a relatively higher elastin content), or cellular arrangement in the tunica media appear to equip the LIMA to be better adapted in enduring the mechanical forces triggered by flow shear stress and wall strain of the coronary flow dynamics and pulsatility.

They are to be congratulated for providing a visionary and balanced revision of the current knowledge, providing physiologic and biologic insights on graft function as well as novel insights on genomic and proteomic profiles of graft conduits; such “omic” profiling enables the development of novel therapeutic strategies. These authors postulate that in addition to superior passive mechanical characteristics, the LIMA displays active biologic function. They describe this as an “autocrine” function that is related to secretion of bioactive molecules such as nitric oxide and the production of endothelial cell–derived microparticles. In particular, they highlight the potential role of specialized exosomes carrying a crucial cargo of combined vasodilatory, antioxidant, and other biologically active molecules, including microRNAs with antiproliferative and antiatherosclerotic properties. These biologic functions are the foundation for high long-term LIMA patency rates and may further have an impact on downstream vessel properties, instigating the regression of coronary atherosclerosis. As an example, in case of composite SV-LIMA grafts, such autocrine activity may possibly prevent postgrafting degeneration of the vein conduit because of improved flow dynamics.\n\n【14】删除3:<u>Tran-Nguyen N, Condemi F, Yan A, Fremes S, Triverio P, Jimenez-Juan L.

Alendronate may make these conditions worse.\n\n【33】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【34】This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and a patient information insert. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【35】Take the medicine on an empty stomach. It should be taken as soon as you get out of bed in the morning and at least 30 minutes before any food, beverage, or other medicines. Food and beverages (eg, mineral water, coffee, tea, or juice) will decrease the amount of alendronate absorbed by the body. Waiting longer than 30 minutes will allow more of the drug to be absorbed. Medicines such as antacids, calcium, or vitamin supplements will also decrease the absorption of alendronate.\n\n【36】If you are using alendronate oral liquid, drink at least 2 ounces (a quarter of a cup) of water immediately after taking the medicine. This will allow the medicine to reach your intestines and be absorbed by the body more quickly.\n\n【37】Swallow the tablet whole with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces) of plain water. Do not suck or chew on the tablet because it may cause throat irritation.\n\n【38】The effervescent tablet should not be chewed, swallowed whole, or dissolved in the mouth to prevent the risk of mouth or throat irritation.\n\n【39】If you are taking alendronate effervescent tablet, dissolve it in 4 ounces of room temperature plain water only (not mineral water or flavored water). Wait at least 5 minutes after the effervescence stops and then stir the solution for 10 seconds and drink it.\n\n【40】Do not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate and before having your first food for the day. This will help alendronate reach your stomach faster. It will also help prevent irritation to your esophagus.\n\n【41】It is important that you eat a well-balanced diet with adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D (found in milk or other dairy products). However, do not take any foods, beverages, or calcium supplements within 30 minutes or longer after taking the alendronate. To do so may keep this medicine from working properly.\n\n【42】Follow your dosing instructions given to you by your doctor closely. It may affect the way this medicine works if you do not. Do not stop using this medicine suddenly without asking your doctor.\n\n【43】Tell your doctor if you do weight-bearing exercises, smoke or drink excessively. Your doctor will need to take these into consideration in deciding your dose.\n\n【44】### Dosing\n\n【45】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine.

But do all plant-derived dietary constituents uniformly and unerringly confer such health benefits? In the present issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings,_ Delgado-Velandia et al addressed this question in a study involving almost 12,000 individuals broadly representative of the adult Spanish population, and who were followed for approximately 10 years after their recruitment between 2008 to 2010. These individuals were participants in the prospective cohort “Study on Nutrition and Cardiovascular Risk in Spain (ENRICA).” To assess the effects of the composition of plant-based diets, the authors used the previously introduced distinction between healthy plant-based diets (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, olive oil) and unhealthy plant-based diets (refined grains, potatoes, fruit juices, sugar-enriched beverages, and desserts). Dietary intake was assessed by a validated diet history and, based on 18 major food groups, scores were obtained for a healthy plant-based diet (hPDI) or an unhealthy plant-based diet (uPDI). The data demonstrate that all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV)-related mortality were decreased by 14% and 37%, respectively, for each 10-point increase in hPDI. Notably, no significant associations were discerned for uPDI either with all-cause mortality or CV-related mortality. Other relevant findings in this study are that consumption of animal-derived foods and fruit juices were associated with higher risk of CV-related mortality, consumption of vegetable oils was attended by lower risk of all-cause mortality, and the Mediterranean diet score, like hPDI, was generally associated with lower all-cause and CV-related mortality. To explain the health benefits of healthy plant-based diets, the authors suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of many components of these diets underlie the accompanying reduced risk of all-cause mortality and CV-related mortality. This important study of Delgado-Velandia et al indicates that the health benefits of plant-based diets are not invariantly derived from such food groupings, but rather from specific plant-based dietary components. The well-accepted adage “we are what we eat,” would thus underscore the wisdom and importance of diets rich in vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetable oil.</u>\n\n【3】Delgado-Velandia M, Maroto J, Ortolá R, García-Esquinas E, Rodríguez-Artalejo F, Sotos-Prieto.

As regards the latter, there is compelling evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) effectively delay the progression of CKD by actions that lower BP, proteinuria, and renal inflammation and fibrosis. However, as emphasized by the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of BP in CKD ( https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(20)31270-9/fulltext ), the efficacy of these agents in retarding the progression of proteinuric CKD requires that their doses be escalated to ones maximally approved and to the extent that such doses are tolerated; the rationale for this guideline is that such doses of these agents were generally employed in clinical trials that established their efficacy. The current study by Chu et al shows that in proteinuric CKD, ACEi/ARBs are often submaximally dosed. These authors used the database of the OptumLabs Data Warehouse to examine how ACEi/ARBs were dosed in over 100,000 adult patients in whom these medications were prescribed between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018. In these patients, overall, less than one third (29.8%) were administered maximal doses of ACEi/ARBs. The authors also defined criteria that may proscribe increasing the dose of ACEi/ARBs; these criteria included systolic BP less than 120 mmHg, serum potassium (K  ) greater than 5.0 mEq/L, an eGFR lower than 15 ml/min per 1.73 m  , and the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) within the preceding year. In patients without these criteria (approximately 75,000), the percentage of patients who received maximal doses of ACEi/ARBs marginally increased to 32.3%. Submaximal ACEi/ARB dosing was more likely to occur in patients who were less than 40 years old, female, Hispanic, or those patients exhibiting a lower BP, a higher serum K  , a prior episode of AKI, less albuminuria, concomitant heart failure, or absence of diabetes. It should be noted that while some of these proscriptions against dose escalation may be absolute (for example, low BP), others are relative and can be safely managed (for example, marginally elevated serum K  which can be controlled by increased doses of loop diuretics and/or by newer K  \\-binding agents). The progression of CKD to ESKD markedly increases morbidity and mortality, necessitates new therapies, and significantly alters the life of a patient with CKD. Delaying this outcome can be achieved by ACEi/ARBs, but the full efficacy of these agents is dose-dependent.</u></u>\n\n【6】删除7:<u>Chu CD, Powe NR, Estrella MM, et al.

For example, in normotensive individuals, the blood pressure profile is characterized by a 10-20% drop during nighttime and a rise in BP in the early hours of the morning, with BP peaking in the afternoon ( _Free Rad Biol Med_ . 2018;119:108-114). Abnormalities in this physiologic profile in BP may associate with and/or predispose to hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. The intrinsic functioning of circadian clocks is influenced by cues derived from such sources as the light-dark cycle, mealtime, and social interaction. Such clues may be attenuated or lost in certain circumstances, a salient one being night shift work. Indeed, night shift work has been linked to a variety of diseases, in part because of attendant stress imposed on the circadian rhythmicity of biologic processes. Xiao et al provide new insights regarding night shift work and the occurrence of hypertension. These investigators employed the large prospective observational study of the UK Biobank and classified some 230,000 of the participants in this study as day workers, shift workers but never or rarely night shift, irregular shift workers including night shift, and permanent night shift workers. The data demonstrate that night shift work associated with hypertension, and in the three types of night shift work, a higher risk of hypertension was observed compared with the day shift work, with the risk increasing as the frequency of night shift work increased. In modeling that adjusted for other factors relevant to hypertension, the risk for hypertension with night shift work was still significant. Furthermore, these investigators capitalized on the availability in the UK Biobank of genotyping data, from which they derived a polygenic risk score (PRS) for hypertension; notably, the risk of hypertension was increased in permanent night shift workers with a high PRS compared with day workers with a low PRS. This important study demonstrates that there is an increased risk for hypertension in night shift workers, a risk that itself may be conditioned by genetic factors.</u>\n\n【9】删除7:<u>Xiao Z, Xu C, Liu Q, et al.

Patients underwent compression ultrasonography (CUS) of proximal lower limb veins at admission and discharge. The occurrence of DVT was the primary end point of the study.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Among 1340 patients, 26 (1.9%; 95% CI, 1.3%-2.8%) had asymptomatic DVT at admission and were excluded. During the follow-up, 144 patients were excluded because of hospitalization less than 5 days. The remaining 1170 patients underwent a CUS at discharge. Two hundred fifty (21%) underwent prophylaxis with parenteral anticoagulants; the remaining 920 (79%) were not treated with anticoagulants. The mean length of hospitalization was 13±8 days. Compared with patients without prophylaxis, those treated with parenteral anticoagulants had a higher incidence of active cancer, heart and respiratory failure, pneumonia, renal failure, previous venous thromboembolism, reduced mobility, and elderly age. During the hospital stay, 3 patients with a negative CUS at admission experienced DVT in the proximal tract (0.025%, rate of 1 per 5017 patient-days); 2 of them were in prophylaxis with parenteral anticoagulants.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】We provide evidence that in the real world acutely ill medical patients display more than 90% (1.9%) asymptomatic DVT at admission, whereas the intrahospital DVT occurrence is very low.

Minoxidil has not been studied in patients older than 65 years of age .\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【24】### Other Interactions\n\n【25】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【26】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【27】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【28】*   Any other skin problems, an irritation, or a sunburn on the scalp—These conditions may cause too much topical minoxidil to be absorbed into the body and may increase the chance of side effects.\n\n【29】*   Heart disease or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure)—Topical minoxidil has not been studied in patients who have these conditions, but more serious problems may develop for these patients if they use more medicine than is recommended over a large area and too much minoxidil is absorbed into the body.\n\n【30】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【31】This medicine usually comes with patient instructions. It is important that you read the instructions carefully.\n\n【32】It is very important that you use this medicine only as directed. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of it being absorbed through the skin. For the same reason, do not apply minoxidil to other parts of your body. Absorption into the body may affect the heart and blood vessels and cause unwanted effects.\n\n【33】Do not use any other skin products on the same skin area on which you use minoxidil. Hair coloring, hair permanents, and hair relaxers may be used during minoxidil therapy as long as the scalp is washed just before applying the hair coloring, permanent, or relaxer. Minoxidil should not be used 24 hours before and after the hair treatment procedure. Be sure to not double your doses of minoxidil to make up for any missed doses.\n\n【34】To apply minoxidil topical solution:\n\n【35】*   Make sure your hair and scalp are completely dry before applying this medicine.\n*   Apply the amount prescribed to the area of the scalp being treated, beginning in the center of the area. Follow your doctor's instructions on how to apply the solution, using the applicator provided.\n*   Do not shampoo your hair for 4 hours after applying minoxidil.\n*   Immediately after using this medicine, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.\n*   Do not use a hairdryer to dry the scalp after you apply minoxidil solution. Blowing with a hairdryer on the scalp may make the treatment less effective.\n*   Allow the minoxidil to completely dry for 2 to 4 hours after applying it, including before going to bed. Minoxidil can stain clothing, hats, or bed linen if your hair or scalp is not fully dry after using the medicine.\n*   Avoid transferring the medicine while wet to other parts of the body. This can occur if the medicine gets on your pillowcase or bed linens or if your hands are not washed after applying minoxidil.\n\n【36】To apply minoxidil topical foam:\n\n【37】*   Open the container by matching the arrow on can ring with the arrow on cap. Pull off the cap.\n*   Part the hair into one or more rows to expose the hair thinning area on the scalp.\n*   Hold the can upside down and press the nozzle to put foam on your fingers.\n*   Use your fingers to spread the foam over the hair loss area and gently massage into your scalp.\n*   Immediately after using this medicine, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them .\n\n【38】If your scalp becomes abraded, irritated, or sunburned, check with your doctor before applying minoxidil.\n\n【39】Minoxidil topical foam or solution is for use on the scalp only. Keep this medicine away from the eyes, nose, and mouth. If you should accidentally get some in your eyes, nose, or mouth, flush the area thoroughly with cool tap water. If you are using the pump spray, be careful not to breathe in the spray .\n\n【40】Do not use the foam near heat or open flame, or while smoking. Do not puncture, break, or burn the aerosol can .\n\n【41】### Dosing\n\n【42】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【43】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【44】*   For hair growth:\n    *   For topical solution dosage form:\n        *   Adults—Apply 1 milliliter (mL) to the scalp two times a day.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by the doctor.\n    *   For topical foam dosage form:\n        *   Adults—Apply half a capful to the scalp two times a day.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor .\n\n【45】### Missed Dose\n\n【46】If you miss a dose of this medicine, apply it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule.\n\n【47】### Storage\n\n【48】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【49】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【50】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【51】Flammable: Keep away from fire or flame.\n\n【52】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【53】It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【54】Tell your doctor if you notice continued itching, redness, or burning of your scalp after you apply minoxidil. If the itching, redness, or burning is severe, wash the medicine off and check with your doctor before using it again.\n\n【55】Hair loss may continue for 2 weeks after you start using minoxidil. Tell your doctor if your hair loss continues after 2 weeks. Also, tell your doctor if your hair growth does not increase after using minoxidil for 4 months.\n\n【56】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【57】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【58】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【59】#### Less common\n\n【60】1.  Itching or skin rash (continued)\n\n【61】#### Rare\n\n【62】1.

In 2012, the RBP technique was introduced as adjunct to HCA during open distal arch repair via thoracotomy. We reviewed the results of the HCA + RBP technique compared with those of the DHCA-only approach. From February 2000 to November 2019, 189 patients (median age, 59 \\[IQR, 46 to 71\\] years; 30.7% female) underwent open distal arch repair via lateral thoracotomy to treat aortic aneurysms. The DHCA technique was used in 117 patients (62%, median age 53 \\[IQR, 41 to 60\\] years), whereas HCA + RBP was used in 72 patients (38%, median age 65 \\[IQR, 51 to 74\\] years). In HCA + RBP patients, cardiopulmonary bypass was interrupted when systemic cooling achieved isoelectric electroencephalogram; once the distal arch had been opened, RBP was then initiated via the venous cannula (flow of 700 to 1000 mL/min, central venous pressure <15 to 20 mm Hg).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The stroke rate was significantly lower in the HCA + RBP group (3%, n=2) compared with the DHCA-only (12%, n=14) ( _P_ \\=.031), despite longer circulatory arrest times in HCA + RBP compared with the DHCA-only (31 \\[IQR, 25 to 40\\] minutes vs 22 \\[IQR, 17 to 30\\] minutes, respectively; _P_ <.001). Operative mortality for patients undergoing HCA + RBP was 6.7% (n=4), whereas for those undergoing DHCA-only it was 10.4% (n=12) ( _P_ \\=.410). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year age-adjusted survival rates for the DHCA group are 86%, 81%, and 75%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year age-adjusted survival rates for the HCA + RBP group are 88%, 88%, and 76%, respectively.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The addition of RBP to HCA in the treatment of distal open arch repair via a lateral thoracotomy is safe and provides excellent neurological protection.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】DHCA ( deep hypothermic circulatory arrest ), HCA ( hypothermic circulatory arrest ), RBP ( retrograde whole-body perfusion ), TAAA ( thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "801f5b35-fef9-4294-8cf4-79703532de50", "title": "Coronary angiogram", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】A coronary angiogram is a procedure that uses X-ray imaging to see your heart's blood vessels. The test is generally done to see if there's a restriction in blood flow going to the heart.\n\n【2】Coronary angiograms are part of a general group of procedures known as heart (cardiac) catheterizations. Cardiac catheterization procedures can both diagnose and treat heart and blood vessel conditions. A coronary angiogram, which can help diagnose heart conditions, is the most common type of cardiac catheterization procedure.\n\n【3】During a coronary angiogram, a type of dye that's visible by an X-ray machine is injected into the blood vessels of your heart. The X-ray machine rapidly takes a series of images (angiograms), offering a look at your blood vessels. If necessary, your doctor can open clogged heart arteries (angioplasty) during your coronary angiogram.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Your doctor may recommend that you have a coronary angiogram if you have:\n\n【6】*   Symptoms of coronary artery disease, such as chest pain (angina)\n*   Pain in your chest, jaw, neck or arm that can't be explained by other tests\n*   New or increasing chest pain (unstable angina)\n*   A heart defect you were born with (congenital heart disease)\n*   Abnormal results on a noninvasive heart stress test\n*   Other blood vessel problems or a chest injury\n*   A heart valve problem that requires surgery\n\n【7】Because there's a small risk of complications, angiograms aren't usually done until after noninvasive heart tests have been performed, such as an electrocardiogram, an echocardiogram or a stress test.\n\n【8】Risks\n-----\n\n【9】As with most procedures done on your heart and blood vessels, a coronary angiogram has some risks, such as radiation exposure from the X-rays used. Major complications are rare, though. Potential risks and complications include:\n\n【10】*   Heart attack\n*   Stroke\n*   Injury to the catheterized artery\n*   Irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\n*   Allergic reactions to the dye or medications used during the procedure\n*   Kidney damage\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Infection\n\n【11】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【12】In some cases, coronary angiograms are performed on an emergency basis. More commonly, though, they're scheduled in advance, giving you time to prepare.\n\n【13】Angiograms are performed in the catheterization (cath) lab of a hospital. Your health care team will give you specific instructions and talk to you about any medications you take. General guidelines include:\n\n【14】*   Don't eat or drink anything after midnight before your angiogram.\n*   Take all your medications to the hospital with you in their original bottles. Ask your doctor about whether to take your usual morning medications.\n*   If you have diabetes, ask your doctor if you should take insulin or other oral medications before your angiogram.\n\n【15】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【16】### Before the procedure\n\n【17】Before your angiogram procedure starts, your health care team will review your medical history, including allergies and medications you take. The team may perform a physical exam and check your vital signs — blood pressure and pulse.\n\n【18】You'll also empty your bladder and change into a hospital gown. You may have to remove contact lenses, eyeglasses, jewelry and hairpins.\n\n【19】### During the procedure\n\n【20】For the procedure, you lie on your back on an X-ray table. Because the table may be tilted during the procedure, safety straps may be fastened across your chest and legs. X-ray cameras will move over and around your head and chest to take pictures from many angles.\n\n【21】An IV line is inserted into a vein in your arm. You may be given a sedative through the IV to help you relax, as well as other medications and fluids. You'll be very sleepy and may drift off to sleep during the procedure, but you'll still be able to be easily awakened to follow any instructions.\n\n【22】Electrodes on your chest monitor your heart throughout the procedure. A blood pressure cuff tracks your blood pressure and another device, a pulse oximeter, measures the amount of oxygen in your blood.\n\n【23】A small amount of hair may be shaved from your groin or arm where a flexible tube (catheter) will be inserted. The area is washed and disinfected and then numbed with an injection of local anesthetic.\n\n【24】A small incision is made at the entry site, and a short plastic tube (sheath) is inserted into your artery. The catheter is inserted through the sheath into your blood vessel and carefully threaded to your heart or coronary arteries.\n\n【25】Threading the catheter shouldn't cause pain, and you shouldn't feel it moving through your body. Tell your health care team if you have any discomfort.\n\n【26】Dye (contrast material) is injected through the catheter. When this happens, you may have a brief sensation of flushing or warmth. But again, tell your health care team if you feel pain or discomfort.\n\n【27】The dye is easy to see on X-ray images. As it moves through your blood vessels, your doctor can observe its flow and identify any blockages or constricted areas. Depending on what your doctor discovers during your angiogram, you may have additional catheter procedures at the same time, such as a balloon angioplasty or a stent placement to open up a narrowed artery. Other noninvasive tests, such as ultrasound, may help your doctor evaluate identified blockages.\n\n【28】Having an angiogram takes about one hour, although it may be longer, especially if combined with other cardiac catheterization procedures. Preparation and post-procedure care can add more time.\n\n【29】### After the procedure\n\n【30】When the angiogram is over, the catheter is removed from your arm or groin and the incision is closed with manual pressure, a clamp or a small plug.\n\n【31】You'll be taken to a recovery area for observation and monitoring. When your condition is stable, you return to your own room, where you're monitored regularly.\n\n【32】You'll need to lie flat for several hours to avoid bleeding if the catheter was inserted in the groin. During this time, pressure may be applied to the incision to prevent bleeding and promote healing.\n\n【33】You may be able to go home the same day, or you may have to remain in the hospital overnight. Drink plenty of fluids to help flush the dye from your body. If you're feeling up to it, have something to eat.\n\n【34】Ask your health care team when to resume taking medications, bathing or showering, working, and doing other normal activities. Avoid strenuous activities and heavy lifting for several days.\n\n【35】Your puncture site is likely to remain tender for a while. It may be slightly bruised and have a small bump.\n\n【36】### Call your doctor's office if:\n\n【37】*   You notice bleeding, new bruising or swelling at the catheter site\n*   You develop increasing pain or discomfort at the catheter site\n*   You have signs of infection, such as redness, drainage or a fever\n*   There's a change in temperature or color of the leg or arm that was used for the procedure\n*   Weakness or numbness in the leg or arm where the catheter was inserted\n*   You develop chest pain or shortness of breath\n\n【38】If the catheter site is actively bleeding and doesn't stop after you've applied pressure to the site, contact 911 or emergency medical services. If the catheter site suddenly begins to swell, contact 911 or emergency medical services.\n\n【39】Results\n-------\n\n【40】An angiogram can show doctors what's wrong with your blood vessels. It can:\n\n【41】*   Show how many of your coronary arteries are blocked or narrowed by fatty plaques (atherosclerosis)\n*   Pinpoint where blockages are located in your blood vessels\n*   Show how much blood flow is blocked through your blood vessels\n*   Check the results of previous coronary bypass surgery\n*   Check the blood flow through your heart and blood vessels\n\n【42】Knowing this information can help your doctor determine what treatment is best for you and how much danger your heart condition poses to your health. Based on your results, your doctor may decide, for instance, that you would benefit from having coronary angioplasty or stenting to help clear clogged arteries. It's also possible that angioplasty or stenting could be done during your angiogram to avoid needing another procedure.\n\n【43】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Aranesp\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Darbepoetin alfa injection causes the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. If the body does not produce enough red blood cells, severe anemia can occur. This often occurs in people with chronic kidney failure whose kidneys are not working properly. Darbepoetin may be used for patients on kidney dialysis or for those not on dialysis. Anemia can also occur in people who are receiving chemotherapy to treat cancer. Darbepoetin alfa is used to treat severe anemia in these patients.\n\n【6】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Solution\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【11】### Allergies\n\n【12】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【13】### Pediatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of darbepoetin alfa injection in children with chronic kidney failure.\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of darbepoetin alfa injection in children with cancer. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of darbepoetin alfa injection in the elderly.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【22】### Other Interactions\n\n【23】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【24】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【25】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【26】*   Aluminum poisoning, severe or\n*   Bleeding, severe or\n*   Bone marrow fibrosis (osteofibrosis cystica) or\n*   Folic acid deficiency or\n*   Infections, inflammation, or cancer or\n*   Iron deficiency or\n*   Vitamin B12 deficiency—May cause a delay in response to treatment.\n\n【27】*   Blood clots (history of) or other problems with the blood or\n*   Congestive heart failure or\n*   Heart attack, history of or\n*   Heart bypass surgery or\n*   Heart or blood vessel disease or\n*   Stroke, history of or\n*   Thrombosis, at risk for—The chance of side effects may be increased.\n\n【28】*   Bone marrow problems (eg, hemolytic anemia, sickle cell anemia, porphyria, thalassemia)—Use of darbepoetin alfa injection has not been established in patients with these conditions.\n\n【29】*   Hypertension (high blood pressure), uncontrolled or\n*   Pure red cell aplasia (rare bone marrow disease)—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【30】*   Seizures, history of—Use with caution. May make this condition worse.\n\n【31】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【32】Darbepoetin alfa injection is usually given by a doctor in a hospital or clinic. However, medicines given by injection are sometimes used at home. If you will be using darbepoetin alfa at home, your doctor will teach you how the injections are to be given. Be sure you understand exactly how the medicine is to be injected.\n\n【33】It may be given as a shot under your skin or into a vein. If your doctor tells you to inject it in a certain way, follow your doctor's instructions.\n\n【34】This medicine comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【35】This medicine is available in 2 forms. You may use a vial or a prefilled syringe with an UltraSafe® Needle Guard.\n\n【36】If you are giving this medicine at home:\n\n【37】*   Use a new needle and syringe each time you inject your medicine.\n*   Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.\n*   You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given.\n\n【38】Do not shake the container of medicine before you use it, and do not use this medicine if it has been frozen.\n\n【39】You might not use all of the medicine in each vial (glass container) or prefilled syringe. Use each vial or syringe only one time. Do not save an open vial or syringe. If the medicine in the vial or syringe has changed color or if you see particles in it, do not use it.\n\n【40】Carefully follow your doctor's instructions about any special diet. You may need to eat foods that contain iron, folic acid, or vitamin B12 such as eggs, certain cereals, meats, and vegetables, or you may take an iron, folic acid, or vitamin B12 supplement while you are using this medicine.\n\n【41】### Dosing\n\n【42】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【43】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【44】*   For injection dosage form (solution):\n    *   For anemia from chronic kidney failure:\n        *   Adults and children—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The starting dose is 0.45 to 0.75 microgram (mcg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight injected into a vein or under the skin once a week or once every 2 weeks. Your doctor may adjust the dose as needed.\n    *   For anemia from cancer chemotherapy:\n        *   Adults—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The starting dose is 2.25 micrograms (mcg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight once a week or 500 mcg once every 3 weeks injected under the skin. Your doctor may adjust the dose as needed.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【45】### Missed Dose\n\n【46】Call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions.\n\n【47】### Storage\n\n【48】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【49】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【50】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【51】Store in the refrigerator. Do not freeze.\n\n【52】Protect the medicine from bright light. Keep your medicine in the original package until you are ready to use it.\n\n【53】Throw away used needles in a hard, closed container that the needles cannot poke through (puncture-resistant). Keep this container away from children and pets.\n\n【54】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【55】People with severe anemia usually feel very tired and sick. When darbepoetin alfa begins to work, usually in about 6 weeks, most people start to feel better. Some people are able to be more active. But darbepoetin alfa only corrects anemia. It has no effect on kidney disease, cancer, or any other medical problem that needs regular medical attention. Even if you are feeling much better, it is very important that you do not miss any appointments with your doctor or any dialysis treatments.\n\n【56】It is very important that your doctor check your blood regularly while you are using this medicine. You may also need to monitor your blood pressure at home. If you notice any changes to your normal blood pressure, call your doctor right away.\n\n【57】Darbepoetin alfa may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, swelling of the face, tongue, and throat, trouble with breathing, or chest pain after you receive the medicine.\n\n【58】This medicine may increase your risk of having blood clots. This is more likely in patients who use high doses of this medicine, or who use this medicine before major surgery. If you have chest pain, trouble breathing, or pain, redness, or swelling in your arms or legs while using this medicine, call your doctor right away. If you are getting kidney dialysis treatments, tell your doctor right away if you notice blood clots at your injection site. Your doctor may give you a blood thinner before surgery to help prevent blood clots.\n\n【59】This medicine may also increase your risk of having serious heart and blood vessel problems such as a heart attack, congestive heart failure, or stroke. Check with your doctor right away if you start having dizziness, fainting spells, severe tiredness, chest pain, trouble with breathing, sudden or severe headache, or problems with vision, speech, or walking.\n\n【60】When used in patients with certain types of cancer (eg, breast, cervix, lymphoid, lung, head, or neck cancer), this medicine has shortened survival time and worsened the tumor or cancer in some patients. If you are concerned about this, talk with your doctor.\n\n【61】Darbepoetin alfa sometimes causes convulsions (seizures), especially during the first few months of treatment. During this time, it is best to avoid driving, operating heavy machinery, or other activities that could cause a serious injury if a seizure occurs while you are performing them.\n\n【62】One form of darbepoetin alfa injection has an ingredient that comes from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them, although the risk is low. Human donors and donated blood are both tested for viruses to keep the transmission risk low. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.\n\n【63】Serious skin reactions can occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, red skin lesions, severe acne or a skin rash, sores or ulcers on the skin, or fever or chills with this medicine.\n\n【64】The needle cover of the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before you start using this medicine.\n\n【65】Many people with kidney problems need to be on a special diet. Also, people with high blood pressure (which may be caused by kidney disease or by darbepoetin alfa treatment) may need to be on a special diet or to take medicine to keep their blood pressure under control. After their anemia has been corrected, some people feel so much better that they want to eat more than before. To keep your kidney disease or your high blood pressure from getting worse, it is very important that you follow your special diet and take your medicines regularly, even if you are feeling better.\n\n【66】In addition to darbepoetin alfa, your body needs iron and vitamins to make red blood cells. Your doctor may direct you to take iron or vitamin supplements. Be sure to follow your doctor's orders carefully. Darbepoetin alfa will not work well if you do not have enough iron or vitamins in your body.\n\n【67】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【68】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【69】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【70】#### More common\n\n【71】1.  Accumulation of pus\n2.  arm, back, or jaw pain\n3.  blurred vision\n4.  breathing problems (irregular, noisy, or trouble when resting)\n5.  chest pain, discomfort, tightness, or heaviness\n6.  chills\n7.  confusion\n8.  cough producing mucus\n9.  decrease in the amount of urine\n10.  diarrhea\n11.  dilated neck veins\n12.  dizziness, fainting, or lightheadedness\n13.  dry mouth\n14.  fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat\n15.  fatigue or tiredness (extreme or unusual)\n16.  fever\n17.  headache\n18.  nausea\n19.  pain, tenderness, swelling, or warmth over the injection site\n20.  pounding in the ears\n21.  rapid breathing\n22.  rapid or pounding pulse\n23.  skin discoloration at the injection site\n24.  stomach pain\n25.  sunken eyes\n26.  sweating\n27.  swelling of the ankles, face, fingers, feet, hands, or lower legs\n28.  thirst\n29.  trouble with breathing\n30.  unconsciousness\n31.  vomiting\n32.  weight gain\n33.  wrinkled skin\n\n【72】#### Less common\n\n【73】1.

Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【79】#### More common\n\n【80】1.

Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\n【40】To lessen stomach upset and to reduce dizziness and lightheadedness, take the regular tablet with or shortly after a meal or light snack.\n\n【41】Take the extended-release tablet at the same time each day, preferably at bedtime, without food.\n\n【42】The tablet can be swallowed whole or given as a half tablet by breaking the tablet along the score line. Do not break the tablet unless your doctor tells you to. Do not crush or chew the tablet.\n\n【43】### Dosing\n\n【44】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【45】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【46】*   For depression:\n    *   For oral dosage form (extended-release tablets):\n        *   Adults—At first, 150 milligrams (mg) per day as a single dose.

Keep from freezing.\n\n【51】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【52】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【53】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【54】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【55】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits, to allow for changes in your dose and to help manage any unwanted effects.\n\n【56】Do not take trazodone with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (eg, isocarboxazid \\[Marplan®\\], linezolid (Zyvox®), methylene blue, phenelzine \\[Nardil®\\], selegiline \\[Eldepryl®\\], tranylcypromine \\[Parnate®\\]). Do not start taking trazodone during the 2 weeks after you stop a MAO inhibitor and wait 2 weeks after stopping trazodone before you start taking a MAO inhibitor. If you take them together or do not wait 2 weeks, you may develop confusion, agitation, restlessness, stomach or intestinal symptoms, a sudden high body temperature, an extremely high blood pressure, or severe convulsions.\n\n【57】Trazodone may cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome if taken together with some medicines. Do not use trazodone with buspirone (Buspar®), fentanyl (Abstral®, Duragesic®), lithium (Eskalith®, Lithobid®), tryptophan, St. John's wort, or some pain or migraine medicines (eg, sumatriptan, tramadol, Frova®, Maxalt®, Relpax®, Zomig®).\n\n【58】For some teenagers and young adults, this medicine can increase thoughts of suicide. Tell your doctor right away if you start to feel more depressed or have thoughts about hurting yourself or others. Report any unusual thoughts or behaviors that trouble you, especially if they are new or get worse quickly. Make sure the doctor knows if you have trouble sleeping, get upset easily, have a big increase in energy, or start to act reckless. Also tell the doctor if you have sudden or strong feelings, such as feeling nervous, angry, restless, violent, or scared. Let the doctor know if you or anyone in your family have bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disorder) or have tried to commit suicide.\n\n【59】Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of serious conditions called serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like reactions. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.\n\n【60】Contact your doctor right away if you have any changes in your heart rhythm such as feeling dizzy or faint, or having a fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat. These could be symptoms of a heart problem called QT prolongation.\n\n【61】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. If this problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【62】Do not stop taking this medicine without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent a worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, irritability, restlessness, or trouble sleeping.\n\n【63】This medicine may cause some people to become drowsy or less alert than they are normally. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert.\n\n【64】This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers or sleeping medicine, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are using this medicine.\n\n【65】Before having any kind of surgery, dental treatment, or emergency treatment, tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are using this medicine. Taking trazodone together with anesthetic medicines (numbing medicines) that are used during surgery, dental treatments, or emergency treatments may cause an increase in CNS depressant effects.\n\n【66】Trazodone may cause dry mouth. For temporary relief, use sugarless gum or candy, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your medical doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.\n\n【67】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【68】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【69】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【70】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【71】#### More common\n\n【72】1.
