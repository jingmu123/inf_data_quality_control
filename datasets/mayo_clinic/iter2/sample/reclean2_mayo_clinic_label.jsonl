{"seq_id": "cabba199-dae2-4f0d-9a66-b46292785f6a", "title": "Nail fungus", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Nail fungus is a common infection of the nail. It begins as a white or yellow-brown spot under the tip of your fingernail or toenail. As the fungal infection goes deeper, the nail may discolor, thicken and crumble at the edge. Nail fungus can affect several nails.\n\n【2】If your condition is mild and not bothering you, you may not need treatment. If your nail fungus is painful and has caused thickened nails, self-care steps and medications may help. But even if treatment is successful, nail fungus often comes back.\n\n【3】Nail fungus is also called onychomycosis (on-ih-koh-my-KOH-sis). When fungus infects the areas between your toes and the skin of your feet, it's called athlete's foot (tinea pedis).\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Symptoms of nail fungus include a nail or nails that are:\n\n【6】*   Thickened\n*   Discolored\n*   Brittle, crumbly or ragged\n*   Misshapen\n*   Separated from the nail bed\n*   Smelly\n\n【7】Nail fungus can affect fingernails, but it's more common in toenails.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】You may want to see a health care provider if self-care steps haven't helped and the nail becomes increasingly discolored, thickened or misshapen. Also talk with your health care provider if you have:\n\n【10】*   Diabetes and think you're developing nail fungus\n*   Bleeding around the nails\n*   Swelling or pain around the nails\n*   Difficulty walking\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】Nail fungus is caused by various fungal organisms (fungi). The most common is a type called dermatophyte. Yeast, bacteria and molds also can cause nail infections. The discoloration from a bacterial infection tends to be green or black.\n\n【13】Fungal infection of the foot (athlete's foot) can spread to the nail, and a fungal infection of the nail can spread to the foot. You can also get the infection from contact with spaces where fungi can thrive, such as the floor tile in a gym shower or inside dark, sweaty, moist shoes.\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】Factors that can increase your risk of developing nail fungus include:\n\n【16】*   Older age\n*   Wearing shoes that make your feet sweat heavily\n*   Having had athlete's foot in the past\n*   Walking barefoot in damp public areas, such as swimming pools, gyms and shower rooms\n*   Having a minor skin or nail injury\n*   Having a skin condition that affects the nails, such as psoriasis\n*   Having diabetes, blood flow problems or a weakened immune system\n\n【17】Complications\n-------------\n\n【18】A severe case of nail fungus can be painful and may cause permanent damage to your nails. And it may lead to other serious infections that spread beyond your feet if you have a suppressed immune system due to medication, diabetes or other conditions.\n\n【19】Prevention\n----------\n\n【20】The following habits can help prevent nail fungus or reinfections and athlete's foot, which can lead to nail fungus:\n\n【21】*   Keep your nails clean and dry. Wash your hands and feet regularly. Wash your hands after touching an infected nail. Dry well, apply an antifungal foot powder and moisturize your nails. Consider applying a nail hardener, which might help strengthen nails and cuticles.\n*   Keep your nails trimmed. Cut nails straight across, smooth the edges with a file and file down thickened areas. Disinfect your nail clippers after each use. Letting your nails grow long creates more places for the fungus to grow.\n*   Wear absorbent socks or change your socks throughout the day.\n*   Choose shoes made of materials that breathe.\n*   Discard old shoes or treat them with disinfectants or antifungal powders.\n*   Wear footwear in pool areas and locker rooms.\n*   Choose a nail salon that uses sterilized manicure tools for each customer. Or disinfect tools you use for home pedicures.\n*   Give up nail polish and artificial nails.\n*   If you have athlete's foot, treat it with an antifungal product.\n\n【22】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "7ad2c899-f363-4a7c-bb97-25c4a048dc77", "title": "Amniocentesis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Amniocentesis is done to remove amniotic fluid and cells from the uterus for testing or treatment. Amniotic fluid surrounds and protects a baby during pregnancy.\n\n【2】Amniocentesis can provide useful information about a baby's health. But it's important to know the risks of amniocentesis — and be prepared for the results.\n\n【3】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【4】Amniocentesis can be done for a number of reasons:\n\n【5】*   **Genetic testing.** Genetic amniocentesis involves taking a sample of amniotic fluid and testing the DNA from the cells for diagnosis of certain conditions, such as Down syndrome. This might follow another screening test that showed a high risk of the condition.\n*   **Diagnosis of fetal infection.** Occasionally, amniocentesis is used to look for infection or other illness in the baby.\n*   **Treatment.** Amniocentesis might be done to drain amniotic fluid from the uterus if too much has built up — a condition called polyhydramnios.\n*   **Fetal lung testing.** If delivery is planned sooner than 39 weeks, amniotic fluid might be tested to help find out whether a baby's lungs are mature enough for birth. This is rarely done.\n\n【6】### Genetic amniocentesis\n\n【7】Genetic amniocentesis can provide information about the baby's genes. Generally, genetic amniocentesis is offered when the test results might affect how to manage the pregnancy.\n\n【8】Genetic amniocentesis is usually done between weeks 14 and 20 of pregnancy. Amniocentesis done before week 14 of pregnancy might lead to more complications.\n\n【9】Reasons to consider genetic amniocentesis include:\n\n【10】*   **Having positive results from a prenatal screening test.** If the results of a screening test — such as the first-trimester screen or prenatal cell-free DNA screening — show high risk or are worrisome, amniocentesis might confirm or rule out a diagnosis.\n*   **Having an earlier pregnancy affected by a genetic condition.** A health care provider might suggest amniocentesis to look for that condition.\n*   **Being 35 or older.** Babies born to people 35 and older have a higher risk of chromosomal conditions, such as Down syndrome. A health care provider might suggest amniocentesis to rule out these conditions if prenatal cell-free DNA screening is positive.\n*   **Having a family history of a genetic condition, or if the parents are carriers of a genetic condition.** Besides identifying Down syndrome, amniocentesis can be used to diagnose other genetic conditions, such as cystic fibrosis.\n*   **Having unusual ultrasound findings.** A health care provider might recommend amniocentesis to diagnose or rule out genetic conditions associated with unusual ultrasound findings.\n\n【11】Risks\n-----\n\n【12】Amniocentesis carries risks, which occur in approximately 1 in 900 tests. They include:\n\n【13】*   **Leaking amniotic fluid.** Rarely, amniotic fluid leaks through the vagina after amniocentesis. In most cases, the amount of fluid lost is small and stops within one week with no effect on the pregnancy.\n*   **Miscarriage.** Second-trimester amniocentesis carries a slight risk of miscarriage — about 0.1% to 0.3% when done by a skilled person using ultrasound. Research suggests that the risk of pregnancy loss is higher for amniocentesis done before 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n*   **Needle injury.** During amniocentesis, the baby might move an arm or leg into the path of the needle. Serious needle injuries are rare.\n*   **Rh sensitization.** Rarely, amniocentesis might cause the baby's blood cells to enter the pregnant person's bloodstream. Those with Rh negative blood who haven't developed antibodies to Rh positive blood are given an injection of a blood product, Rh immune globulin, after amniocentesis. This prevents the body from making Rh antibodies that can cross the placenta and damage the baby's red blood cells.\n*   **Infection.** Very rarely, amniocentesis might trigger a uterine infection.\n*   **Infection transmission.** Someone who has an infection — such as hepatitis C, toxoplasmosis or HIV/AIDS — might transfer it to the baby during amniocentesis.\n\n【14】Remember, genetic amniocentesis is usually offered to pregnant people for whom the test results might greatly affect how they manage the pregnancy. The decision to have genetic amniocentesis is yours. Your health care provider or genetic counselor can give you information to help you decide.\n\n【15】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【16】Your health care provider will explain the procedure and ask you to sign a consent form. Consider asking someone to accompany you to the appointment for emotional support or to drive you home afterward.\n\n【17】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【18】Amniocentesis is usually done in an outpatient obstetric center or a health care provider's office.\n\n【19】### During the procedure\n\n【20】First, a health care provider will use ultrasound to pinpoint where the baby is in the uterus. You'll lie on your back on an exam table with your belly showing. Your health care provider will apply a gel to your belly and then use a small device known as an ultrasound transducer to show your baby's position on a monitor.\n\n【21】Next, your health care provider will clean your abdomen. A numbing medication generally isn't used. Most people report only mild soreness during the procedure.\n\n【22】Guided by ultrasound, your health care provider will insert a thin, hollow needle through your stomach wall and into the uterus. A small amount of amniotic fluid is drawn into a syringe. The needle is then removed.\n\n【23】You need to lie still while the needle is put in and the amniotic fluid is taken out. You might feel a sting when the needle enters your skin. You might feel cramping when the needle enters your uterus.\n\n【24】### After the procedure\n\n【25】After amniocentesis, your health care provider will continue using the ultrasound to monitor your baby's heart rate. You might have cramping or mild pelvic pain after an amniocentesis.\n\n【26】You can return to your regular activities after the test.\n\n【27】The sample of amniotic fluid will be looked at in a lab. Some results might be available within a few days. Other results might take several weeks.\n\n【28】Contact your health care provider if you have:\n\n【29】*   Bleeding or loss of amniotic fluid through the vagina\n*   Severe uterine cramping that lasts more than a few hours\n*   Fever\n*   Redness where the needle was inserted\n*   Fetal activity that is different than usual or no fetal movement\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】Your health care provider or a genetic counselor will help you understand your amniocentesis results.\n\n【32】For genetic amniocentesis, test results can rule out or diagnose some genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome. Amniocentesis can't identify all genetic conditions and birth defects.\n\n【33】If amniocentesis suggests that your baby has a genetic or chromosomal condition that can't be treated, you might face hard decisions. Seek support from your health care team and your loved ones.\n\n【34】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Quinidine has not been widely studied in children; however, it is used in children to treat abnormal heart rhythms and to treat malaria. Children may be able to take higher doses than adults and may have fewer side effects (such as vomiting, loss of appetite, and diarrhea) than adults.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of quinidine in the elderly with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults. However, quinidine may remain in the bodies of older adults longer than it does in younger adults, which may increase the risk of side effects and which may require lower doses.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Several randomized controlled trials and a Cochrane Review compared more restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds with a more liberal threshold (eg, withholding transfusion until a hemoglobin level of ≤7 g/dL vs ≤9 g/dL) and concluded that the 30-day mortality was no worse.\n\n【22】无关删除-2:<u>*   Carson J.L.\n*   Stanworth S.J.\n*   Roubinian N.</u>\n\n【23】Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding allogeneic red blood cell transfusion.\n\n【24】删除3:<u>_Cochrane Database Syst Rev._ 2016; 10 : CD002042</u>\n\n【25】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【26】In addition, evidence-based guidelines for use of other blood components became available to assist providers in making appropriate transfusion decisions.\n\n【27】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kaufman R.M.\n*   Djulbegovic B.\n*   Gernsheimer\n\n【28】Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB.\n\n【29】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 2015; 162 : 205-213</u></u>\n\n【30】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (610)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【31】Implementing a PBM program is complex. Evidence-based hemotherapy practices are only one component to successful PBM programs. Other key principles are limiting blood loss through phlebotomy, optimizing patient hemoglobin levels and coagulopathy before invasive procedures, using intraoperative blood salvage techniques, minimizing perioperative blood loss, using single-unit transfusions, providing real-time education at the time of ordering, and developing quality improvement systems to audit the effectiveness of such programs. Specialty organizations have embraced these concepts and joined forces through the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation’s _Choosing Wisely_ campaign to advocate for decreasing unnecessary transfusion.\n\n【32】ABIM Foundation  \nChoosing Wisely.

Computerized provider order entry, requiring the provider to enter the appropriate indication for transfusion at the time of ordering, reinforces accepted transfusion guidelines. Clinical decision support tools, such as interruptive alerts (pop-ups), which appear when transfusions fall outside of established guidelines, deliver instant education to ordering physicians and allow the provider an opportunity to reflect and to determine whether the patient truly has unique circumstances that require a deviation from established guidelines or a chance to change or cancel the order.\n\n【43】In this issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , Warner and colleagues describe the implementation of a PBM program in a large US academic hospital and the impact of the program on patient outcomes and blood utilization.\n\n【44】无关删除-2:<u>*   Warner M.\n*   Schulte P.\n*   Hansen A.\n\n【45】Implementation of a comprehensive patient blood management program for hospitalized patients at a large United States medical center.\n\n【46】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2021; 96 : 2980-2990</u></u>\n\n【47】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (9)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【48】The program was staged over time, with new interventions being added periodically to existing interventions. Blood utilization and patient outcomes were assessed at 4 distinct time periods. These included pre PBM (2010-2011), early PBM (2012-2013), enhanced PBM (2014), and sustained PBM (2015-2017). In addition to analyzing the effect over time, the observed transfusion use and clinical outcomes were also compared with the expected use and outcome if a PBM program had not been implemented. The authors showed a progressive decrease in the proportion of hospital admissions that used RBC transfusion over time and an overall decrease in the total number of blood components (except cryoprecipitate) transfused over time. These findings are consistent with a recent US population-based study that used the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s National Inpatient Sample database.\n\n【49】无关删除-2:<u>*   Goel R.\n*   Zhu X.\n*   Patel E.U.\n\n【50】无关删除-2:<u>Blood transfusion trends in the United States, National Inpatient Sample, 2015-2018.</u>\n\n【51】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Blood Adv._ 2021; 5 : 4179-4184</u></u>\n\n【52】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (8)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【53】Other important findings of Warner and colleagues included a shorter hospital length of stay and fewer adverse events when evaluated as a composite variable than projected as if no PBM program existed.

This report adds to the small body of evidence suggesting that PBM programs have been successful in curbing the use of blood without causing harm to patients. This is an important accomplishment in times when hospitals are struggling to contain cost and blood-collecting facilities are struggling to meet hospital demand for blood.\n\n【60】Future research should continue to focus on the overall effectiveness of PBM programs. Physicians should examine alternative therapies to transfusion, such as pharmacologic intervention, to add to existing PBM programs. Methods for optimal implementation need to be developed to decrease the complexity involved in executing such programs. Last, more studies focusing on cost-effectiveness of PBM programs would be helpful in convincing hospital administrators of the value in investing in such programs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Patients may need additional tuberculosis treatment.\n\n【36】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【37】A doctor or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a medical facility. It is given through a needle that is placed into one of your veins. It must be given slowly, so the needle will have to remain in place for at least 2 hours.\n\n【38】This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have questions.\n\n【39】You may also receive other medicines (eg, allergy medicine, fever medicine, steroids) to help prevent possible unwanted effects during the injection.\n\n【40】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【41】It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress closely and at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【42】Infliximab may cause an infusion reaction, including a heart attack, stroke, changes in blood pressure, or heart rhythm problems (eg, arrhythmia), while you or your child are receiving it or right after the infusion ends. Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you have chest pain, fever, chills, itching, hives, rash, dizziness, fainting, lightheadedness, headache, joint pain, difficulty with swallowing, trouble breathing, or swelling of the face, tongue, and throat.\n\n【43】Your body's ability to fight an infection may be reduced while you or your child are using infliximab. It is very important that you call your doctor at the first sign of any infection. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have a fever, chills, cough, flu-like symptoms, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【44】Serious skin reactions can occur while you or your child are receiving this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, chills, cough, diarrhea, fever, itching, joint or muscle pain, red skin lesions, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in your mouth, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【45】This medicine may increase your or your child's risk of having a lupus-like syndrome or a liver disease called autoimmune hepatitis. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have dark brown-colored urine, fever or chills, a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or weakness, joint pain, light-colored stools, nausea, vomiting, a rash on the cheeks or arms that gets worse under the sun, severe tiredness, upper right-sided stomach pain, or yellow eyes and skin.\n\n【46】A small number of people (including children and teenagers) who have used this medicine have developed certain types of cancer. This is more common in patients who have lung diseases (eg, emphysema, COPD) or are heavy smokers, and in psoriasis patients who have had phototherapy treatment for a long time. Phototherapy treatment is ultraviolet light or sunlight combined with oral medicine to make your skin sensitive to light. Some teenagers and young adults with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis also developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Talk with your doctor if you have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, unexplained weight loss, or red, scaly patches, or raised bumps with pus on the skin.\n\n【47】Receiving this medicine may increase your risk of getting skin cancer (eg, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma) or cervical cancer. If you have any changes or growths on your skin, abnormal vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【48】While you are being treated with infliximab, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Live virus vaccines should not be given with infliximab. Your child's vaccinations must be current before receiving infliximab. Talk to your child's doctor if you have any questions about this.\n\n【49】Women: If you have a baby while receiving infliximab, make sure the baby's doctor knows that you are receiving this medicine. You will need to wait a few months before giving certain vaccines to your baby. Talk to the baby's doctor if you have questions.\n\n【50】You will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start receiving this medicine. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.\n\n【51】It is important to have your heart checked closely if you receive infliximab. Call your doctor right away if you have trouble breathing, swelling in the ankles and feet, or a sudden weight gain.\n\n【52】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes abatacept (Orencia®), anakinra (Kineret®), tocilizumab (Actemra®), or other medicines called biologics that are used to treat the same conditions as infliximab. Using these medicines together with infliximab may increase your chance of having serious unwanted effects.\n\n【53】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【54】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【55】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【56】#### More common\n\n【57】1.  Black, tarry stools\n2.  bladder pain\n3.  bloody or cloudy urine\n4.  blurred vision\n5.  body aches or pain\n6.  chest pain\n7.  chills\n8.  cough\n9.  cough producing mucus\n10.  difficult, burning, or painful urination\n11.  difficulty breathing\n12.  dizziness\n13.  dryness or soreness of the throat\n14.  ear congestion\n15.  fever\n16.  frequent urge to urinate\n17.  headache\n18.  hoarseness\n19.  hives, itching, or rash\n20.  loss of voice\n21.  lower back or side pain\n22.  muscle pain\n23.  nervousness\n24.  pain or swelling in the arms or legs\n25.  pain or tenderness around the eyes and cheekbones\n26.  painful or difficult urination\n27.  pale skin\n28.  pounding in the ears\n29.  runny or stuffy nose\n30.  slow or fast heartbeat\n31.  sneezing\n32.  sore throat\n33.  sores, ulcers, or white spots on the lips or in the mouth\n34.  stomach pain\n35.  tender, swollen glands in the neck\n36.  tightness in the chest\n37.  trouble breathing\n38.  trouble swallowing\n39.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n40.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n41.  voice changes\n\n【58】#### Rare\n\n【59】1.

Females normally have two X chromosomes in all cells — one X chromosome from each parent. In triple X syndrome, a female has three X chromosomes.\n\n【2】Many girls and women with triple X syndrome don't experience symptoms or have only mild symptoms. In others, symptoms may be more apparent — possibly including developmental delays and learning disabilities. Seizures and kidney problems occur in a small number of girls and women with triple X syndrome.\n\n【3】Treatment for triple X syndrome depends on which symptoms, if any, are present and their severity.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms can vary greatly among girls and women with triple X syndrome. Many experience no noticeable effects or have only mild symptoms.\n\n【6】Being taller than average height is the most typical physical feature. Most females with triple X syndrome experience normal sexual development and have the ability to become pregnant. Some girls and women with triple X syndrome have intelligence in the normal range, but possibly slightly lower when compared with siblings. Others may have intellectual disabilities and sometimes may have behavioral problems.\n\n【7】Occasionally, significant symptoms may occur, which vary among individuals. These signs and symptoms may show up as:\n\n【8】*   Delayed development of speech and language skills, as well as motor skills, such as sitting up and walking\n*   Learning disabilities, such as difficulty with reading, understanding or math\n*   Behavioral problems, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or symptoms of autism spectrum disorder\n*   Psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression\n*   Problems with fine and gross motor skills, memory, judgment and information processing\n\n【9】Sometimes females with triple X syndrome have these signs and symptoms:\n\n【10】*   Vertical folds of skin that cover the inner corners of the eyes (epicanthal folds)\n*   Widely spaced eyes\n*   Curved pinky fingers\n*   Flat feet\n*   Breastbone with an inward bowed shape\n*   Weak muscle tone (hypotonia)\n*   Seizures\n*   Problems with the kidneys\n*   Ovaries that don't work properly at a young age (premature ovarian failure)\n\n【11】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【12】If you're concerned about any signs or symptoms, make an appointment to talk with your family health care provider or pediatrician, who can help determine the cause and suggest appropriate action.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】Although triple X syndrome is genetic, it's usually not inherited — it's due to a random genetic error.\n\n【15】Normally, people have 46 chromosomes in each cell, organized into 23 pairs, including two sex chromosomes. One set of chromosomes is from the mother and the other set is from the father. These chromosomes contain genes, which carry instructions that determine everything from height to eye color.\n\n【16】The pair of sex chromosomes — either XX or XY — determines a child's sex. A mother can give the child only an X chromosome, but a father can pass on an X or a Y chromosome:\n\n【17】*   If the child receives an X chromosome from the father, the XX pair makes the child genetically female.\n*   If the child receives a Y chromosome from the father, the XY pair means the child is genetically male.\n\n【18】Females with triple X syndrome have a third X chromosome from a random error in cell division. This error can happen before conception or early in the embryo's development, resulting in one of these forms of triple X syndrome:\n\n【19】*   **Nondisjunction.** In most cases, either the mother's egg cell or the father's sperm cell divides incorrectly, resulting in an extra X chromosome in the child. This random error is called nondisjunction, and all the cells in the child's body will have the extra X chromosome.\n*   **Mosaic.** Occasionally, the extra chromosome results from an incorrect cell division caused by a random event early in the embryo's development.

The patients were divided by using a modified Stanford classification, termed 301, into 3 groups: types B1 (n=62) and B3 (n=24), with a true and false lumen, respectively, descending closely along the thoracic vertebral bodies, and type B2 (n=115), a semi-spiral or spiral configuration. The value of the 301 classification in assessing the risk for post-TEVAR thoracic aortic expansion, as main outcome, and other complications was assessed by using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Median follow-up duration was 26.37 months, and the 24-month cumulative rate of freedom from thoracic aortic enlargement was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.81) for type B3, 0.75 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.83) for type B2, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.99) for type B1. In the multivariable Cox regression models, types B2 and B3 with type B1 as reference were independently associated with the risk for thoracic aortic expansion (type B2: hazard ratio, 7.81; 95% CI, 1.84 to 33.13; type B3: hazard ratio, 13.91; 95% CI, 2.86 to 67.69).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The 301 classification, a modified Stanford classification system in the era of endovascular repair, appears to improve the risk stratification of patients with TBAD undergoing TEVAR.\n\n【9】### Trial Registration\n\n【10】Chinese Clinical Trial Registry number: ChiCTR-POC-17011726.\n\n【11】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【12】AAE ( abdominal aortic expansion ), CTA ( computed tomography angiography ), FL ( false lumen ), HR ( hazard ratio ), SINE ( stent-graft–induced new entry ), TAE ( thoracic aortic expansion ), TBAD ( type B aortic dissection ), TEVAR ( thoracic endovascular aortic repair ), TL ( true lumen )\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【20】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "c3430e27-954c-4739-a5ec-b335d998ebff", "title": "Carbon monoxide poisoning", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs when carbon monoxide builds up in the blood. When too much carbon monoxide is in the air, the body replaces the oxygen in the red blood cells with carbon monoxide. This can lead to serious tissue damage, or even death.\n\n【2】Carbon monoxide is gas that has no odor, taste or color. Burning fuels, including gas, wood, propane or charcoal, make carbon monoxide. Appliances and engines that aren't well vented can cause the gas to build up to dangerous levels. A tightly enclosed space makes the buildup worse.\n\n【3】Anyone exposed to carbon monoxide needs to get into fresh air and seek medical care right away. Call emergency medical services (EMS) or dial 911 right away for someone who's in a coma or can't respond.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Carbon monoxide poisoning affects the brain and heart the most. Exposure over time might lead to symptoms that can be mistaken for the flu without the fever. Clearer symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can include:\n\n【6】*   Headache.\n*   Weakness.\n*   Dizziness.\n*   Nausea or vomiting.\n*   Shortness of breath.\n*   Confusion.\n*   Blurred vision.\n*   Drowsiness.\n*   Loss of muscle control.\n*   Loss of consciousness.\n\n【7】Symptoms related to the nervous system and brain can come on after recovery from carbon monoxide poisoning. The risk of these is higher in people who lost consciousness from the carbon monoxide and older people. Symptoms might include:\n\n【8】*   Memory loss.\n*   Personality changes.\n*   Movement problems.\n\n【9】Carbon monoxide poisoning can be especially dangerous for people who are asleep, drugged or drunk. Carbon monoxide can cause brain damage or death before anyone realizes there's a problem.\n\n【10】### When to see a doctor\n\n【11】For possible carbon monoxide poisoning, get into fresh air and seek medical care right away.\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】Many fuel-burning products and engines make carbon monoxide. Most often the amount of carbon monoxide from these sources isn't cause for worry in areas with good air flow. But if they're used in a partly closed or closed space, the carbon monoxide level can be a danger. Examples are using a charcoal grill indoors or a running car inside a garage.\n\n【14】Breathing the fumes causes carbon monoxide to replace oxygen in the blood. This prevents oxygen from getting to tissues and organs.\n\n【15】Breathing in smoke during a fire also can cause carbon monoxide poisoning. And smoking through a water pipe, called a hookah, has been linked to increasing numbers of younger people getting carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】Breathing in carbon monoxide can be especially dangerous for:\n\n【18】*   **Unborn babies.** Fetal blood cells take up carbon monoxide more easily than adult blood cells do.\n*   **Infants and children.** Young children take breaths more often than adults do.\n*   **Older adults.** Older people who have carbon monoxide poisoning may be more likely to get brain damage.\n\n【19】Complications\n-------------\n\n【20】Damage from carbon monoxide depends on how much is breathed in and for how long. Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause:\n\n【21】*   Brain damage that doesn't heal.\n*   Damage to the heart, possibly leading to life-threatening heart problems.\n*   Death.\n\n【22】Prevention\n----------\n\n【23】To help prevent carbon monoxide poisoning:\n\n【24】*   **Have carbon monoxide detectors in the home.** Put them near each sleeping area on every level of the house. Check the batteries at least twice a year at the same time as checking the smoke detector batteries.\n\n【25】    If the alarm sounds, believe it! Leave the house and call 911 or the fire department. Carbon monoxide detectors are also made for motor homes and boats.\n\n【26】*   **Open the garage door before starting the car.** Never leave a car running in the garage, especially if the garage is attached to the house. That's true even if the garage door is open.\n*   **Use gas appliances only as intended.** Never use a gas stove or oven for heat. Use gas camp stoves outdoors only. Use fuel-burning space heaters only when someone is awake to keep an eye on them and doors or windows are open. Don't run a generator in an enclosed space, such as the basement or garage.\n*   **Make sure there's space around fuel-burning appliances and engines.** These include all gas appliances, space heaters and wood-burning stoves. Make sure they're vented properly.\n\n【27】    Have professionals set up all gas, oil or coal-burning appliances. Have a qualified service-provider service them yearly.\n\n【28】*   **Keep fireplaces in good condition.** Clean the fireplace chimney and flue every year.\n*   **Keep vents and chimneys unblocked during remodeling.** Check that they aren't covered by tarps or debris.\n*   **Do repairs before returning to where the poisoning occurred.** If carbon monoxide poisoning has occurred in the home, find and repair the source of the carbon monoxide before staying there again. Have a qualified service person check and repair any appliances that might have caused the leak.\n\n【29】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

She was fatigued and confused and had poor oral intake. In the past 2 months, she had lost 10 kg. Two weeks before admission, she started to exhibit atypical behaviors, such as walking about her house undressed. The patient denied fever, headaches, seizures, nuchal rigidity, visual changes, weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, and bowel or bladder incontinence. She was evaluated at another institution for her symptoms about 2 weeks before. Work-up at that time included electroencephalography, which showed generalized slowing consistent with metabolic encephalopathy. The patient received a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin for delirium that was presumed to be secondary to a urinary tract infection. Her symptoms did not improve with antibiotic therapy, so she presented to our institution for further evaluation.\n\n【1】The patient had a long-standing history of bipolar disorder and anxiety treated by a psychiatrist. Her medications included divalproex, lithium, quetiapine, fluphenazine, and clonazepam. Her psychiatric medications had not changed recently, and her mood disorder had been stable for many years. Her other medication was tolterodine, which she had been using for urinary incontinence. The patient and her husband owned a small business, and she had been in charge of the accounting up until 2 months before hospital admission. She smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for many years and denied alcohol consumption or drug abuse.\n\n【2】Physical examination revealed an elderly woman in no acute distress. She was somnolent but arousable and followed instructions. Her affect was flat, and language was remarkable for simple 1-word answers. Her vital signs and general physical examination findings were normal. Neurologic examination revealed an altered mental status with deficits in attention, learning, and recall. She scored 24 out of 38 points on the Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status, with deficits in attention, learning, and recall. Cranial nerves and motor and sensory functions were normal. Reflexes were symmetric, and plantar response was flexor. The patient's gait was normal, and she had no ataxia.\n\n【3】Chest radiography and electrocardiography performed on admission were unremarkable. Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed several small hypodense areas in periventricular white matter consistent with small vessel disease. Laboratory studies (reference ranges provided parenthetically) were remarkable for a hemoglobin of 9 g/dL (12.0-15.5 g/dL) and a mean corpuscular volume of 81 fL (81.6-98.3 fL). Levels of electrolytes, blood glucose, and serum creatinine, transaminases, ammonia, lithium, and valproic acid were within normal or therapeutic range, as were findings on arterial blood gas analysis, urinalysis, and urine drug screening.\n\n【4】*   1.\n\n【5】    **_Which one of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's delirium?_**\n\n【6】    *   a.\n\n【7】        _Bacterial meningitis_\n\n【8】    *   b.\n\n【9】        _Viral encephalitis_\n\n【10】    *   c.\n\n【11】        _Metabolic encephalopathy_\n\n【12】    *   d.\n\n【13】        _Medication-induced delirium_\n\n【14】    *   e.\n\n【15】        _Subdural hematoma_\n\n【16】In reviews of the presentation of bacterial meningitis, approximately 99% to 100% of affected patients present with at least 1 of the following: fever, neck stiffness, or change in mental status.\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>*   Durand ML\n*   Calderwood SB\n*   Weber DJ\n\n【18】Acute bacterial meningitis in adults: a review of 493 episodes.\n\n【19】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1993; 328 : 21-28</u></u>\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1181)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【21】Our patient's 1-month history of delirium without fever or meningeal signs argues against the typical presentation of bacterial meningitis. Numerous viral agents can cause an encephalitis or meningoencephalitis with varying clinical presentation, including herpes simplex virus, enteroviruses, echoviruses, coxsackieviruses, mumps, human immunodeficiency virus, and arboviruses. Affected patients may exhibit a maculopapular exanthem, grouped dermal vesicles, flaccid paralysis, fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, or mental status changes. Our patient's prolonged duration of delirium in the absence of fever and headaches and without focal neurologic findings on examination was not consistent with viral encephalitis. A variety of conditions can cause a metabolic encephalopathy, including hepatic or renal impairment and endocrinopathies. Physical examination findings and laboratory evaluation in our patient were not consistent with a hepatic or uremic encephalopathy.

Thus, a careful review of medications is essential in evaluating delirium for all patients. Subdural hematoma was unlikely in this patient given the findings on CT of the head.\n\n【32】Careful review of the patient's records showed no recent changes in her psychiatric medications and a mood disorder that had been stable for many years. Additional history indicated exposure to mosquitoes and tick bites several months earlier. The patient had always lived in the Midwest in a farmhouse adjacent to a large forest. Drinking water was obtained from a home well. She had no remarkable travel history. The patient owned a cat but denied recent cat scratches.\n\n【33】A lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed an opening pressure of 14 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O, 1 nucleated cell/mL, a glucose level of 51 mg/dL (serum glucose, 91 mg/dL), and a protein level of 54 mg/dL (14-45 mg/dL). Cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain, bacterial cultures, and polymerase chain reaction were negative for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella zoster virus. Urine and blood cultures showed no growth. Morning cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, serum folate, and vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> levels were within normal limits. Over the next several days, the patient's quetiapine, clonazepam, fluphenazine, and tolterodine were tapered and discontinued. Her mental status, however, showed little improvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed mild to moderate cortical atrophy along with periventricular and subcortical white matter changes consistent with small vessel disease. No evidence of recent infarction was seen.\n\n【34】*   2.\n\n【35】    **_Which one of the following diagnostic tests would be least appropriate in this patient?_**\n\n【36】    *   a.\n\n【37】        _Cerebrospinal fluid arbovirus antibody analysis_\n\n【38】    *   b.\n\n【39】        Borrelia burgdorferi _serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with CSF antibody analysis_\n\n【40】    *   c.\n\n【41】        Bartonella henselae _antibody analysis_\n\n【42】    *   d.\n\n【43】        _Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test_\n\n【44】    *   e.\n\n【45】        _Urine arsenic assay_\n\n【46】Findings on CSF analysis are not suggestive of viral meningitis.

Lyme meningitis is usually associated with a CSF pleocytosis and often occurs in late summer to fall. The onset of neuroborreliosis, however, is variable and occasionally includes the triad of meningitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculitis. Lyme and Bartonella encephalitis should be considered given the history of exposure to tick bite and cat. Neurosyphilis, which can manifest as personality changes in addition to hyperreflexia, paresthesias, and tabes dorsalis, should be evaluated in this patient. Heavy metal toxicity can occur from contaminated well water. However, the neurologic symptoms of long-term arsenic poisoning are primarily limited to polyneuropathy with only very rare cases of encephalitis among individuals with an occupational exposure to arsenic,\n\n【52】无关删除-2:<u>*   Morton WE\n*   Caron GA</u>\n\n【53】Encephalopathy: an uncommon manifestation of arsenic poisoning?\n\n【54】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Ind Med._ 1989; 15 : 1-5</u></u>\n\n【55】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (70)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【56】making this the least likely answer.\n\n【57】During her hospital stay, the patient's mental status continued to wax and wane. Later, she developed diffuse muscle weakness that was not present on admission. Physical examination confirmed the presence of proximal muscle weakness. Because of the patient's variable mental condition, it could not be determined whether the muscle weakness was secondary to pain.\n\n【58】*   3.\n\n【59】    **_Which one of the following diagnostic approaches would be the most appropriate next step in evaluating the patient's delirium?_**\n\n【60】    *   a.\n\n【61】        _Electromyography_\n\n【62】    *   b.\n\n【63】        _Vastus lateralis muscle biopsy_\n\n【64】    *   c.\n\n【65】        _Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis_\n\n【66】    *   d.\n\n【67】        _Initiation of antidelirium reorientation techniques_\n\n【68】    *   e.\n\n【69】        _Measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatinine kinase levels_\n\n【70】Electromyography may be useful for evaluating proximal muscle weakness or the presence of peripheral neuropathy. However, determining the presence of a neuropathy may not elucidate the etiology behind the patient's presenting symptom of confusion. Moreover, the patient's symptoms had been present only a few days, making it too early in the patient's course to see typical changes of most neuromuscular diseases on electromyography. Clinical suspicion of myopathy is an indication for muscle biopsy. Both polymyositis and dermatomyositis could present with proximal muscle weakness in patients of this age. However, preliminary studies such as serum creatinine kinase measurement and electromyography should be performed before initiating this relatively invasive procedure. Moreover, the patient's mental status changes are inconsistent with the presentation of most leading causes of myopathy. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis could be useful in locating occult malignancy or infection. However, the lack of evidence of a mass on MRI of the head argues against metastatic spread to the brain. Moreover, the patient had no fever, leukocytosis, or localizing history and physical examination findings to suggest hidden infection.\n\n【71】Reorientation techniques are important in the treatment of delirium, particularly in patients with prolonged hospitalizations and disrupted sleep/wake cycles. Although such techniques should certainly be considered for this patient, it is unlikely that delirium secondary to unfamiliar environment explains the patient's presentation. Her symptoms began before her hospitalization, and her proximal muscle weakness suggests an underlying etiology that merits investigation. The course of the patient's delirium in combination with progressive systemic symptoms such as muscle weakness should prompt an evaluation for vasculitis. Thus, checking serum markers of inflammation would be most appropriate. Measurement of creatinine kinase is appropriate in the evaluation of proximal muscle weakness.\n\n【72】During the hospital stay, the patient became increasingly obtunded. Although she had run a home business in the past, she could no longer perform simple arithmetic calculations nor was she aware of her name or current location. Her upper and lower extremity weakness persisted, and she required moderate assistance in sitting from a supine position. She had symptoms of jaw claudication. Serum anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and creatine kinase levels were normal. The patient had an elevated serum ESR (106 mm/1 h \\[0-29 mm/1 h\\]) and CRP level (147 mg/L \\[<8.0 mg/L\\]). Electroencephalography was performed to reevaluate the generalized slowing seen on her outside study. Diffuse slowing of 6 to 7 Hz with intermittent diffuse delta waves was seen with maximal distribution over the bitemporal head regions.\n\n【73】*   4.\n\n【74】    **_Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step?_**\n\n【75】    *   a.\n\n【76】        _Empiric corticosteroids and temporal artery biopsy_\n\n【77】    *   b.\n\n【78】        _Cerebral angiography_\n\n【79】    *   c.\n\n【80】        _Paraneoplastic CSF analysis_\n\n【81】    *   d.\n\n【82】        _Positron emission tomography/single-photon emission computed tomography of the brain_\n\n【83】    *   e.\n\n【84】        _Psychiatric evaluation for pseudodementia_\n\n【85】Although a rare manifestation, giant cell arteritis (GCA) can present with mental status changes.

If paraneoplastic causes of altered mental status were in the differential diagnosis, a work-up for neoplasm should be performed before a paraneoplastic analysis of CSF. Little in the patient's history and findings on imaging studies suggested an active neoplasm. Positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography of the brain show promise for earlier detection of Alzheimer disease. However, the course of the patient's presentation and her elevated inflammatory markers should prompt evaluation of other etiologies before investigating the generally more slowly developing neurodegenerative diseases. Likewise, the elevated ESR suggests an organic cause for her symptoms that should be evaluated before pursuing a diagnosis of pseudodementia.\n\n【96】The patient denied any headaches or visual changes.

It is commonly seen in individuals older than 50 years and of Scandinavian descent. An epidemiological study in Olmsted County revealed an annual incidence of 1 in 4200 people older than 60 years.\n\n【132】无关删除-2:<u>*   Salvarani C\n*   Gabriel SE\n*   O'Fallon WM\n*   Hunder GG</u>\n\n【133】The incidence of giant cell arteritis in Olmsted County, Minnesota: apparent fluctuations in a cyclic pattern.\n\n【134】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 1995; 123 : 192-194</u></u>\n\n【135】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (315)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【136】The classic presentation of GCA is fever and headache with localization to the temporal region in a patient older than 50 years. Physicians are taught to quickly recognize this typical pattern and intervene to prevent the dreaded complication of vision loss. However, the clinician should also be aware of atypical presentations. In an evaluation of 463 patients with GCA presenting to Mayo Clinic, 2 had confirmed intracranial arterial involvement.\n\n【137】无关删除-2:<u>*   Salvarani C\n*   Giannini C\n*   Miller DV\n*   Hunder G</u>\n\n【138】Giant cell arteritis: involvement of intracranial arteries.\n\n【139】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arthritis Rheum._ 2006; 55 : 985-989</u></u>\n\n【140】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (123)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【141】The symptoms of these 2 patients included progressive deterioration of memory, stupor, confusion, and extremity weakness.\n\n【142】Laboratory evaluation for GCA usually reveals a substantially elevated ESR; normochromic, normocytic anemia; and a mild leukocytosis. The criterion standard for diagnosing GCA remains temporal artery biopsy, which typically reveals vasculitic changes with multinucleated giant cells in the arterial wall, predominantly in the media near the internal elastic lamina. However, treatment should not be delayed in the setting of high clinical suspicion. The diagnosis can still be made on the basis of pathologic findings after several days of treatment with corticosteroids. In patients with high clinical suspicion of GCA and negative findings on unilateral temporal artery biopsy, a biopsy of the contralateral side should be performed. Pathologic changes can be focal, with areas of normal vessel anatomy within wider areas of vasculitic changes, necessitating resections at least 2.5 cm in length for adequate evaluation.\n\n【143】Corticosteroid therapy remains the standard treatment for GCA. In a widely used regimen, prednisone therapy is initiated at 40 to 60 mg/d, and the dose is gradually tapered on the basis of the clinical condition and the level of inflammatory markers. Treatment generally needs to be continued for 2 years on the basis of improvement in constitutional symptoms, vascular symptoms, and ESR. Adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid treatment, such as hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of infections, need to be taken into consideration. To decrease unwarranted adverse effects, corticosteroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and anti—tumor necrosis factor α monoclonal antibody therapy are occasionally used. Daily low-dose aspirin has been suggested to decrease the incidence of cranial ischemic events.\n\n【144】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lee MS\n*   Smith SD\n*   Galor A\n*   Hoffman GS</u>\n\n【145】Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients with giant cell arteritis.\n\n【146】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arthritis Rheum._ 2006; 54 : 3306-3309</u></u>\n\n【147】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (231)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【148】Yearly chest radiography is also recommended to monitor for the development of a thoracic aortic aneurysm.\n\n【149】Giant cell arteritis is the most common systemic vasculitis affecting elderly patients in Western countries.

Pupil examination results were normal, but slight abdominal distention was found on her physical examination.\n\n【23】Axial CT scans (window level of +40 and window width of 300) obtained without bowel preparation or oral or intravenous administration of contrast agent including sagittal and coronal reconstructions and 3-dimensional surface rendered images revealing a distended stomach and bowel loops loaded with numerous drug-filled packets measuring approximately 3.5 to 4 cm. Ingested drug packets appeared almost uniform in shape and were cylindrical. The number of packages was reported to be as high as 200, but it was difficult to determine the exact number. Although the stomach and bowel loops were distended, no abrupt termination of distention (cutoff sign) suggestive of mechanical obstruction was observed. No obvious leaking from the packages was seen.Plain abdominal radiographs of the abdomen (anteroposterior and lateral views) taken at the time of admission showed the stomach and bowel were entirely loaded with numerous drug packets that had density similar to soft tissue. The most useful finding in these radiographs was a thin, lucent rim of air in a cylindrical pattern caused by air trapped between the wrapping and the drug substance in each package or by a rim of air between layers of wrapping (so-called double condom sign).\n\n【24】We administered a polyethylene glycol–electrolyte lavage solution to the patient at a rate of 2 L/h for 12 hours. The plain abdominal radiograph of the abdomen 24 hours later showed a decreased number of packets in the stomach, but numerous packets were still visible in all parts of the colon. Because of the high number of retained pellets, we continued the polyethylene glycol–electrolyte lavage solution for an additional 8 hours. On CT scanning and radiography 48 hours later, the abdomen appeared to be clear of drug packets. Customs agents collected 207 intact pellets of opium. Repeated imaging confirmed complete decontamination.\n\n【25】This case demonstrates the appearance of multiple drug packets using different imaging modalities and the importance of serial imaging in diagnosing and treating patients who are body packing. Although abdominal radiography and ultrasonography are useful screening tools, CT appears to be more effective in the evaluation and management of patients.\n\n【26】无关删除-1:<u>Acknowledgment\n--------------</u>\n\n【27】无关删除-1:<u>The authors wish to convey their appreciation to Professor Robert S.

Bariatric surgery is done when diet and exercise haven't worked or when you have serious health problems because of your weight. Some procedures limit how much you can eat. Other procedures work by reducing the body's ability to absorb nutrients. Some procedures do both.\n\n【2】While bariatric surgery can offer many benefits, all forms of weight-loss surgery are major procedures that can pose serious risks and side effects. Also, you must make permanent healthy changes to your diet and get regular exercise to help ensure the long-term success of bariatric surgery.\n\n【3】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【4】Bariatric surgery is done to help you lose excess weight and reduce your risk of potentially life-threatening weight-related health problems, including:\n\n【5】*   Heart disease and stroke\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)\n*   Sleep apnea\n*   Type 2 diabetes\n\n【6】Bariatric surgery is typically done only after you've tried to lose weight by improving your diet and exercise habits.\n\n【7】### Who it's for\n\n【8】In general, bariatric surgery could be an option for you if:\n\n【9】*   Your body mass index (BMI) is 40 or higher, called extreme obesity.\n*   Your BMI is 35 to 39.9, called obesity, and you have a serious weight-related health problem, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or severe sleep apnea. In some cases, you may qualify for certain types of weight-loss surgery if your BMI is 30 to 34 and you have serious weight-related health problems.\n\n【10】Bariatric surgery isn't for everyone who is severely overweight. You may need to meet certain medical guidelines to qualify for weight-loss surgery. You likely will have an extensive screening process to see if you qualify. You must also be willing to make permanent changes to lead a healthier lifestyle.\n\n【11】You may be required to participate in long-term follow-up plans that include monitoring your nutrition, your lifestyle and behavior, and your medical conditions.\n\n【12】And keep in mind that bariatric surgery is expensive. Check with your health insurance plan or your regional Medicare or Medicaid office to find out if your policy covers such surgery.\n\n【13】Risks\n-----\n\n【14】As with any major procedure, bariatric surgery poses potential health risks, both in the short term and the long term.\n\n【15】Risks associated with the surgical procedure can include:\n\n【16】*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Infection\n*   Adverse reactions to anesthesia\n*   Blood clots\n*   Lung or breathing problems\n*   Leaks in your gastrointestinal system\n*   Rarely, death\n\n【17】Longer term risks and complications of weight-loss surgery vary depending on the type of surgery. They can include:\n\n【18】*   Bowel obstruction\n*   Dumping syndrome, which leads to diarrhea, flushing, lightheadedness, nausea or vomiting\n*   Gallstones\n*   Hernias\n*   Low blood sugar, called hypoglycemia\n*   Malnutrition\n*   Ulcers\n*   Vomiting\n*   Acid reflux\n*   The need for a second, or revision, surgery or procedure\n*   Rarely, death\n\n【19】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【20】If you qualify for bariatric surgery, your health care team gives you instructions on how to prepare for your specific type of surgery. You may need to have various lab tests and exams before surgery. You may have restrictions on eating and drinking and which medications you can take. You may be required to start a physical activity program and to stop any tobacco use.\n\n【21】You may also need to prepare by planning ahead for your recovery after surgery. For instance, arrange for help at home if you think you'll need it.\n\n【22】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【23】Bariatric surgery is done in the hospital using general anesthesia. This means you're unconscious during the procedure.\n\n【24】The specifics of your surgery depend on your individual situation, the type of weight-loss surgery you have, and the hospital's or doctor's practices. Some weight-loss surgeries are done with traditional large incisions in your abdomen. This is known as open surgery.\n\n【25】Today, most types of bariatric surgery are performed laparoscopically. A laparoscope is a small, tubular instrument with a camera attached. The laparoscope is inserted through small incisions in the abdomen. The tiny camera on the tip of the laparoscope allows the surgeon to see and operate inside the abdomen without making the traditional large incisions. Laparoscopic surgery can make recovery faster and shorter, but it's not suitable for everyone.\n\n【26】Surgery usually takes several hours. After surgery, you awaken in a recovery room, where medical staff monitors you for any complications. Depending on your procedure, you may need to stay a few days in the hospital.\n\n【27】### Types of bariatric surgery\n\n【28】Each type of bariatric surgery has pros and cons. Be sure to talk to your doctor about them. Here's a look at common types of bariatric surgery:\n\n【29】*   **Roux-en-Y (roo-en-wy) gastric bypass.** This procedure is the most common method of gastric bypass. This surgery is typically not reversible. It works by decreasing the amount of food you can eat at one sitting and reducing absorption of nutrients.\n\n【30】    The surgeon cuts across the top of the stomach, sealing it off from the rest of the stomach. The resulting pouch is about the size of a walnut and can hold only about an ounce of food. Typically, the stomach can hold about 3 pints of food.\n\n【31】    Then, the surgeon cuts the small intestine and sews part of it directly onto the pouch. Food then goes into this small pouch of stomach and then directly into the small intestine sewn to it. Food bypasses most of the stomach and the first section of the small intestine, and instead enters directly into the middle part of the small intestine.\n\n【32】*   **Sleeve gastrectomy.** With sleeve gastrectomy, about 80% of the stomach is removed, leaving a long, tube-like pouch. This smaller stomach can't hold as much food. It also produces less of the appetite-regulating hormone ghrelin, which may lessen the desire to eat.\n\n【33】    Advantages to this procedure include significant weight loss and no rerouting of the intestines. Sleeve gastrectomy also requires a shorter hospital stay than do most other procedures.\n\n【34】*   **Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch.** This is a two-part surgery in which the first step involves performing a procedure similar to a sleeve gastrectomy. The second surgery involves connecting the end portion of the intestine to the duodenum near the stomach (duodenal switch and biliopancreatic diversion), bypassing the majority of the intestine.\n\n【35】    This surgery both limits how much you can eat and reduces the absorption of nutrients. While it is extremely effective, it has greater risk, including malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies.\n\n【36】Which type of weight-loss surgery is best for you depends on your specific situation. Your surgeon will take many factors into account, including body mass index, eating habits, other health issues, previous surgeries and the risks involved with each procedure.\n\n【37】### After bariatric surgery\n\n【38】After weight-loss surgery, you generally won't be allowed to eat for 1 to 2 days so that your stomach and digestive system can heal. Then, you'll follow a specific diet for a few weeks. The diet begins with liquids only, then progresses to pureed and very soft foods and eventually to regular foods. You may have many restrictions or limits on how much and what you can eat and drink.\n\n【39】You'll also have frequent medical checkups to monitor your health in the first several months after weight-loss surgery. You may need laboratory testing, blood work and various exams.\n\n【40】Results\n-------\n\n【41】Gastric bypass and other bariatric surgeries can provide long-term weight loss. The amount of weight you lose depends on your type of surgery and your change in lifestyle habits. It may be possible to lose half, or even more, of your excess weight within two years.\n\n【42】In addition to weight loss, gastric bypass surgery may improve or resolve conditions often related to being overweight, including:\n\n【43】*   Heart disease\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Obstructive sleep apnea\n*   Type 2 diabetes\n*   Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)\n*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n*   Joint pain, also called osteoarthritis\n\n【44】Gastric bypass surgery can also improve your ability to perform routine daily activities, which could help improve your quality of life.\n\n【45】### When weight-loss surgery doesn't work\n\n【46】Gastric bypass and other weight-loss surgeries don't always work as well as you might have hoped. If a weight-loss procedure doesn't work well or stops working, you may not lose weight and you may develop serious health problems.\n\n【47】Keep all of your scheduled follow-up appointments after weight-loss surgery. If you notice that you are not losing weight or you develop complications, see your doctor immediately. Your weight loss can be monitored and factors potentially contributing to your lack of weight loss evaluated.\n\n【48】It's also possible to not lose enough weight or to regain weight after any type of weight-loss surgery, even if the procedure itself works correctly. This weight gain can happen if you do not follow the recommended lifestyle changes, such as getting regular physical activity and eating healthy foods.\n\n【49】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Her medications on presentation were cholecalciferol, cyanocobalamin, enoxaparin, fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone, midodrine, pantoprazole, and dapsone. She was immunosuppressed from long-term corticosteroid therapy and was taking dapsone for _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ prophylaxis.\n\n【1】Over a 2-year period, she had multiple infections including _Enterococcus faecalis_ and _Candida tropicalis_ bacteremia, methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ skin and soft tissue infections, postinfluenza pneumococcal pneumonia with subsequent bacteremia, and recurrent _Clostridium difficile_ infections requiring fecal transplant. She was previously treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for _P jirovecii_ prophylaxis, but because of recurrent _C difficile_ infections she was switched to dapsone. Two months before the current admission, she was successfully treated with daptomycin for central line–associated bloodstream infection with _E faecalis_ . She did well for 3 weeks after treatment but then began having fevers, chills, and body aches, which prompted her to present to the ED for further evaluation of her symptoms.\n\n【2】In the ED, her temperature was 38.5°C, blood pressure was 101/71 mm Hg, heart rate was 120 beats/min, respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 99% while she breathed room air. On physical examination, she appeared comfortable and in no acute distress. She had a cushingoid appearance with rounded face and central adiposity. Her right upper extremity PICC and surrounding skin appeared normal with no findings suggestive of infection. Neurologic examination findings were normal, with no neck stiffness or other signs of meningismus. The remainder of the physical examination findings were unremarkable.\n\n【3】Laboratory studies (reference ranges provided parenthetically) revealed the following: hemoglobin, 7.7 g/dL (11.6 to 15.0 g/dL) (baseline, 8.5 to 9.0 g/dL); hematocrit, 25.5% (35.5% to 44.9%); erythrocytes, 2.96 × 10  /L (3.92 to 5.13 × 10  /L); mean corpuscular volume, 86.1 fL (78.2 to 97.9 fL); red cell distribution width, 15.8% (12.2% to 16.1%); platelet count, 305 × 10  /L (157 to 371 × 10  /L); reticulocyte count, 3.77% (0.60% to 2.71%); leukocytes, 11.9 × 10  /L (3.4 to 9.6 × 10  /L); neutrophils, 7.91 × 10  /L (1.56 to 6.45 × 10  /L); lymphocytes, 0.64 × 10  /L (0.95 to 3.07 × 10  /L); monocytes, 0.33 × 10  /L (0.26 to 0.81 × 10  /L); eosinophils, less than 0.03 × 10  /L (0.03 to 0.48 × 10  /L); basophils, less than 0.03 × 10  /L (0.01 to 0.08 × 10  /L); peripheral blood smear, unremarkable; sodium, 140 mmol/L (135 to 145 mmol/L); potassium, 4.2 mmol/L (3.6 to 5.2 mmol/L); chloride, 104 mmol/L (98 to 107 mmol/L); bicarbonate, 27 mmol/L (22 to 29 mmol/L); serum urea nitrogen, 17 mg/dL (6 to 21 mg/dL); and creatinine, 0.61 mg/dL (0.59 to 1.04 mg/dL).\n\n【4】Blood and urine specimens were obtained for cultures with results pending. Chest radiography revealed no abnormalities. The patient remained febrile even though there was no clear source of infection. She was admitted for further work-up for fever of unknown origin. During her hospitalization, the patient continued to report an ongoing headache, and with her history of long-term immunosuppression, a diagnostic lumbar puncture was performed to investigate a potential central nervous system source of infection, which was successfully performed without any immediate complications.\n\n【5】Seven hours after lumbar puncture, a rapid response team was called to the patient’s bedside because she had hypoxia with increasing requirement of supplemental oxygen. On the team’s arrival, the patient’s respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min and she was requiring 5 L of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of 88% on pulse oximetry. Her heart rate was 91 beats/min, and blood pressure was 118/68 mm Hg. She reported chest pressure but no dyspnea. Lung examination revealed normal breath sounds bilaterally, and cardiac examination revealed regular rate and rhythm without murmur. Neurologic and mental status examination findings were normal. Skin examination was notable for the presence of perioral cyanosis.\n\n【6】*   1.\n\n【7】    **At this point in the work-up, which _one_ of the following is the _best_ test to perform next?**\n\n【8】    *   a.\n\n【9】        Complete blood cell count with differential\n\n【10】    *   b.\n\n【11】        Arterial blood gas measurement with co-oximetry\n\n【12】    *   c.\n\n【13】        Chest radiography\n\n【14】    *   d.\n\n【15】        Chest computed tomographic angiography\n\n【16】    *   e.\n\n【17】        Cardiac troponin measurements\n\n【18】A complete blood cell count with differential can aid in the evaluation of a patient with acute decompensation when there is suspicion for symptomatic anemia or underlying infection, but it is not the best next test in this patient with acute hypoxia, cyanosis, and increasing oxygen requirement. Arterial blood gas measurement with co-oximetry is the best test to investigate the cause of the patient’s hypoxia and increasing oxygen requirement as it may reveal the underlying cause of her cyanosis. Chest radiography is useful for evaluation of hypoxic respiratory failure, but this patient’s lung sounds were clear bilaterally so it is not the best test in this situation. Because the patient had been receiving therapeutic anticoagulation until just before her lumbar puncture, recurrent pulmonary embolism is unlikely, and computed tomographic angiography would not be the best next step. Cardiac troponin measurements could help to rule out myocardial ischemia, which although possible, would be unlikely in a young woman with no previous cardiac disease.\n\n【19】Arterial blood gas testing revealed the following: pH, 7.43 (7.35 to 7.45); P CO <sub>2 </sub> , 37 mm Hg (32 to 45 mm Hg); P O <sub>2 </sub> , 167 mm Hg (83 to 108 mm Hg); bicarbonate, 25 mmol/L (22 to 26 mmol/L); oxyhemoglobin saturation, 81% (94% to 98%); and oxygen saturation gap, 7% (<5%).\n\n【20】*   2.\n\n【21】    **Which _one_ of the following conditions would account for the oxygen saturation gap?**\n\n【22】    *   a.\n\n【23】        Carboxyhemoglobinemia\n\n【24】    *   b.\n\n【25】        Myocardial ischemia\n\n【26】    *   c.\n\n【27】        Sulfhemoglobinemia\n\n【28】    *   d.\n\n【29】        Pulmonary embolism\n\n【30】    *   e.\n\n【31】        Methemoglobinemia (MetHb)\n\n【32】The oxygen saturation gap refers to the difference between oxygen saturation measurements by pulse oximetry and the actual arterial oxygen hemoglobin saturation measured from an arterial blood sample.

This alters the shape of the heme protein within hemoglobin and greatly decreases the ability of the 3 other oxygen-binding sites to release oxygen to peripheral tissues—creating a leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Carboxyhemoglobinemia can create an oxygen saturation gap of greater than 5%, but in this patient, it is unlikely because she did not have major risk factors for carbon monoxide poisoning. Myocardial ischemia does not affect the ability of hemoglobin to bind oxygen molecules, and a saturation gap is not usually seen in this condition. Sulfhemoglobinemia can lead to an oxygen saturation gap of greater than 5%, but sulfhemoglobin decreases the ability of oxygen molecules to bind to heme proteins, shifting the oxyhemoglobin disassociation curve to the right and leading to increased release of oxygen in the peripheral tissues. Typically, fewer clinical symptoms are seen in sulfhemoglobinemia since oxygen is released in the peripheral tissues. Sulfhemoglobinemia is possible in this patient but not the most likely diagnosis. Pulmonary embolism does not create an oxygen saturation gap nor does it affect the affinity of oxygen for heme proteins within hemoglobin. Methemoglobinemia is the most likely diagnosis in this patient. It leads to a left shift of the oxyhemoglobin disassociation curve in which iron in heme proteins is converted from a ferrous (Fe  ) to a ferric (Fe  ) state. The ferric state is unable to reversibly bind oxygen. In addition, the oxygen affinity of any remaining ferrous molecules within heme proteins in the hemoglobin tetramer are increased. The circulating methemoglobin-containing hemoglobin molecules are unable to deliver oxygen appropriately, and the remaining oxyhemoglobin has increased oxygen affinity. Overall, this results in impaired oxygen delivery to the tissues and clinical signs and symptoms of hypoxia, tachycardia, and cyanosis.\n\n【38】Additional results from the patient’s arterial blood gas measurements with co-oximetry revealed the following: carboxyhemoglobin, less than 1.0% (<3.0%); sulfhemoglobin, 0.4% (0.0% to 0.4%); and methemoglobin, 18.1% (<1.5%). Nevertheless, she was hemodynamically stable, her mentation was normal, and her hypoxia was improving.\n\n【39】*   3.\n\n【40】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ treatment of the patient's condition?**\n\n【41】    *   a.\n\n【42】        Methylene blue\n\n【43】    *   b.\n\n【44】        _N_ \\-acetylcysteine\n\n【45】    *   c.\n\n【46】        Hydroxyurea\n\n【47】    *   d.\n\n【48】        Ascorbic acid\n\n【49】    *   e.\n\n【50】        Supportive care\n\n【51】Methylene blue is an appropriate treatment of MetHb because it activates the nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate reductase pathway to convert iron from the ferric (Fe  ) to ferrous (Fe  ) state—the natural state of iron within hemoglobin that allows oxygen to bind and release to tissues. It is the preferred treatment because a single dose can reduce methemoglobin levels to less than 10% within 10 to 60 minutes. However, it is generally reserved for use in patients with methemoglobin levels greater than 20% or those who are profoundly symptomatic. _N_ \\-acetylcysteine is an appropriate treatment for acetaminophen toxicity but is not used in the treatment of MetHb. Hydroxyurea is a treatment used for sickle cell disease and cytoreduction in some forms of leukemia. Ascorbic acid is indicated in the treatment of MetHb, but it is not preferred to methylene blue because it requires multiple doses and may take 24 or more hours to reduce methemoglobin levels to less than 10%. It is therefore a poor alternative in emergency situations. Supportive care is reasonable if the patient has low levels of methemoglobin (<20%) and/or is asymptomatic. However, if the patient has methemoglobin levels greater than 20%, methylene blue should be initiated for brisk reduction of these levels.\n\n【52】The patient was mildly symptomatic with a methemoglobin level of 18.1%. She was managed with supportive care, and arterial blood gas measurement with co-oximetry was repeated the following morning to assess for decrease in the methemoglobin concentration.\n\n【53】*   4.\n\n【54】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ risk factor that contributed to the development of this condition in our patient?**\n\n【55】    *   a.\n\n【56】        Pantoprazole\n\n【57】    *   b.\n\n【58】        Recent blood transfusion\n\n【59】    *   c.\n\n【60】        Dapsone therapy\n\n【61】    *   d.\n\n【62】        _C difficile_ infection\n\n【63】    *   e.\n\n【64】        Long-term corticosteroid therapy\n\n【65】Methemoglobinemia is not a known adverse effect associated with the use of pantoprazole, and blood transfusions are not a known risk factor for development of MetHb. Dapsone therapy was the largest risk factor that contributed to the development of MetHb in our patient. It is well established in the literature that dapsone increases the risk for MetHb. Local anesthetics (lidocaine, benzocaine, prilocaine) are also well known to be precipitants of the condition. It is likely that when this patient received a lumbar puncture, the lidocaine used for local anesthetic compounded by dapsone therapy precipitated the development of MetHb. Neither _C difficile_ nor long-term corticosteroid therapy has been found to be associated with development of MetHb.\n\n【66】The patient continued to improve with supportive care throughout the night. By morning, her oxygen saturation was 91% while she breathed room air, and her methemoglobin level was 9.5%. The elimination half-life of lidocaine and dapsone are 2 hours and 30 hours, respectively. With discontinuation of dapsone, there was a steady improvement in her clinical condition.\n\n【67】*   5.\n\n【68】    **Which _one_ of the following clinical findings is characteristic of MetHb?**\n\n【69】    *   a.\n\n【70】        Cherry-red skin\n\n【71】    *   b.\n\n【72】        Auer rods\n\n【73】    *   c.\n\n【74】        Heinz bodies\n\n【75】    *   d.\n\n【76】        Chocolate-colored blood\n\n【77】    *   e.\n\n【78】        Target cells\n\n【79】Cherry-red skin is a classic clinical finding associated with carboxyhemoglobinemia. Auer rods are cytoplasmic inclusion bodies visible on peripheral blood smear within myeloblasts seen in acute myelogenous leukemia. Heinz bodies can be visualized on peripheral blood smear in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Chocolate-colored blood is a classic clinical finding associated with MetHb. The ferric state of iron is unable to bind oxygen appropriately, leading to deoxygenated hemoglobin that results in a bluish–dark brown color. Interestingly, the larger the methemoglobin percentage, the darker the brown color of the blood becomes. Target cells can be seen in α- and β-thalassemia.\n\n【80】The patient was transitioned to atovaquone for _P jirovecii_ prophylaxis after the discontinuation of dapsone. Repeated methemoglobin measurement 2 days after the rapid response revealed complete resolution in the blood (0.7%), and she remained clinically stable with oxygen saturations ranging from 95% to 98% while she breathed room air.\n\n【81】Cultures from blood obtained on admission yielded negative results after 5 days of incubation. Following the patient’s episode of MetHb, fever and tachycardia recurred. Repeated blood cultures grew multiple species of enteric bacteria and yeast from her PICC line, while cultures from the periphery were negative. It was suspected that the patient had underlying factitious disorder and was intentionally contaminating her central venous catheter. She was placed on one-to-one patient monitoring. Her PICC line was removed, parenteral nutrition was discontinued, and she was transitioned to oral administration of nutrition and medications without complication. She received a course of parenteral antibiotics for polymicrobial central line–associated bloodstream infection via peripheral intravenous access. The patient was discharged from the hospital with planned follow-up with her local outpatient physicians.\n\n【82】Discussion\n----------\n\n【83】In cyanotic patients with hypoxia that does not improve with supplemental oxygen, MetHb, sulfhemoglobinemia, and right-to-left pulmonary shunting should be considered.\n\n【84】无关删除-2:<u>*   Wendel W.B.</u>\n\n【85】The control of methemoglobinemia with methylene blue.\n\n【86】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Invest._ 1939; 18 : 179-185</u></u>\n\n【87】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【88】无关删除-2:<u>*   Dawson A.H.\n*   Whyte I.M.</u>\n\n【89】Management of dapsone poisoning complicated by methaemoglobinaemia.\n\n【90】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Med Toxicol Adverse Drug Exp._ 1989; 4 : 387-392</u></u>\n\n【91】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (27)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【92】Methemoglobinemia can be congenital due to enzymatic deficiencies or can be acquired due to oxidant stress precipitated by illness, drugs, concomitant G6PD deficiency, and occupational agents. Ferrous iron (Fe  ) is oxidized to ferric iron (Fe  ), which has decreased oxygen-carrying capacity causing a leftward shift in the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve. This shift results in limited oxygen release from hemoglobin and decreased delivery leading to a resultant functional anemic tissue hypoxia.\n\n【93】无关删除-2:<u>*   Agarwal N.\n*   Nagel R.L.\n*   Prchal J.T.</u>\n\n【94】Dyshemoglobinemias.\n\n【95】无关删除-2:<u>in: Steinberg M.H.

The diagnosis of MetHb is made using the Malloy-Evelyn method or using a Rad-57 pulse oximeter (Masimo) to detect 8 wavelengths of light. Although elevated methemoglobin concentrations of greater than 3% are required for definitive diagnosis, symptoms are more pronounced when concentrations exceed 10%. Levels up to 10% may only present with clinically detectable cyanosis in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Greater than 35% concentrations may result in mild symptoms of headache, fatigue, dizziness, and dyspnea in patients without preexisting conditions.

Dapsone along with local anesthetics, antimalarial drugs, metoclopramide, and nitrite-containing compounds are the most common causes of acquired MetHb. It is likely that the lidocaine used as local anesthetic for her lumbar puncture acted as a precipitant for development of MetHb in the setting of long-term dapsone use.\n\n【103】In severely symptomatic patients and/or those with substantially elevated methemoglobin levels, methylene blue is the treatment of choice. Methylene blue converts methemoglobin to hemoglobin by an enzymatically catalyzed reaction requiring nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Methylene blue is given as a solution at 1 to 2 mg/kg intravenously over 5 minutes. Pulse oximetry readings can worsen during administration. The dose can be repeated if cyanosis and hypoxia have not resolved within 1 hour. There should be a lower threshold to treat patients with methemoglobin levels greater than 15% if they have severe comorbidities, such as anemia or cardiovascular compromise.\n\n【104】Methylene blue should be avoided in patients with G6PD deficiency because of the potential for precipitation of acute hemolytic anemia.\n\n【105】无关删除-2:<u>*   Youngster I.\n*   Arcavi L.\n*   Schechmaster R.\n\n【106】Medications and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: an evidence-based review.\n\n【107】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Drug Saf._ 2010; 33 : 713-726</u></u>\n\n【108】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (179)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【109】In patients with G6PD deficiency or other conditions in which methylene blue is contraindicated, such as pregnancy, ascorbic acid is the treatment of choice.\n\n【110】*   Park S.-Y.\n*   Lee K.-W.\n*   Kang T.-S.\n\n【111】High-dose vitamin C management in dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia.\n\n【112】删除3:<u>_Am J Emerg Med._ 2014; 32 : 684.e1-684.e3</u>\n\n【113】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   Scopus (28)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【114】Methylene blue is considered a category X teratogen during pregnancy.\n\n【115】无关删除-2:<u>*   Cragan J.D.</u>\n\n【116】Teratogen update: methylene blue.\n\n【117】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Teratology._ 1999; 60 : 42-48</u></u>\n\n【118】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (69)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【119】There is a paucity of literature exploring the effects of acute and chronic maternal MetHb on their offspring.

If you have diabetes, dangerously high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) or dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can lead to a diabetic coma.\n\n【2】If you go into a diabetic coma, you're alive — but you can't wake up or respond purposefully to sights, sounds or other types of stimulation. If it's not treated, a diabetic coma can result in death.\n\n【3】The idea of a diabetic coma can be scary, but you can take steps to help prevent it. One of the most important is to follow your diabetes treatment plan.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Symptoms of high blood sugar or low blood sugar usually develop before a diabetic coma.\n\n【6】### High blood sugar (hyperglycemia)\n\n【7】If your blood sugar level is too high, you may have:\n\n【8】*   Increased thirst\n*   Frequent urination\n*   Blurred vision\n*   Tiredness or weakness\n*   Headache\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Stomach pain\n*   Fruity breath odor\n*   A very dry mouth\n\n【9】### Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)\n\n【10】If your blood sugar is too low, you may have:\n\n【11】*   Shakiness\n*   Anxiety\n*   Tiredness or drowsiness\n*   Weakness\n*   Sweating\n*   Hunger\n*   A feeling of tingling on your skin\n*   Dizziness or lightheadedness\n*   Headache\n*   Difficulty speaking\n*   Blurry vision\n*   Confusion\n*   Loss of consciousness\n\n【12】Some people, especially those who've had diabetes for a long time, develop a condition known as hypoglycemia unawareness. That means they don't have warning symptoms that signal a drop in blood sugar.\n\n【13】If you have any symptoms of high or low blood sugar, test your blood sugar right away. Based on the test results, follow your diabetes treatment. If you don't start to feel better quickly, or you start to feel worse, get medical care right away.\n\n【14】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【15】A diabetic coma is a medical emergency. If you have symptoms of high or low blood sugar and you think you might pass out, call 911 or your local emergency number.\n\n【16】If you're with someone with diabetes who has passed out, call for emergency help. Tell the emergency personnel that the unconscious person has diabetes.\n\n【17】Causes\n------\n\n【18】Blood sugar that's either too high or too low for too long may cause the following serious health problems, all of which can lead to a diabetic coma.\n\n【19】*   **Diabetic ketoacidosis.** If your muscle cells become starved for energy, your body may start breaking down fat for energy. This process forms toxic acids known as ketones. If you have ketones (measured in blood or urine) and high blood sugar, the condition is called diabetic ketoacidosis. If it's not treated, it can lead to a diabetic coma.\n\n【20】    Diabetic ketoacidosis is most common in people who have type 1 diabetes. But it can also occur in people who have type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes.\n\n【21】*   **Diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome.** If your blood sugar level goes above 600 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 33.3 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), the condition is called diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome.\n\n【22】    When blood sugar is very high, the extra sugar passes from the blood into the urine. That triggers a process that draws a large amount of fluid from the body. If it isn't treated, this can lead to life-threatening dehydration and a diabetic coma.\n\n【23】*   **Hypoglycemia.** Your brain needs sugar (glucose) to function. In severe cases, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) may cause you to pass out. Low blood sugar can be caused by too much insulin or not enough food. Exercising too vigorously or drinking too much alcohol can have the same effect.\n\n【24】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【25】Anyone who has diabetes is at risk of a diabetic coma, but the following factors can increase the risk:\n\n【26】*   **Insulin delivery problems.** If you're using an insulin pump, you have to check your blood sugar frequently. Insulin delivery can stop if the pump fails or if the tubing (catheter) becomes twisted or falls out of place. A lack of insulin can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis.\n*   **An illness, trauma or surgery.** When you're sick or injured, blood sugar levels can change, sometimes significantly, increasing your risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome.\n*   **Poorly managed diabetes.** If you don't monitor your blood sugar properly or take your medications as directed by your health care provider, you have a higher risk of developing long-term health problems and a higher risk of diabetic coma.\n*   **Deliberately skipping meals or insulin.** Sometimes, people with diabetes who also have an eating disorder choose not to use their insulin as they should, in the hope of losing weight. This is a dangerous, life-threatening thing to do, and it raises the risk of a diabetic coma.\n*   **Drinking alcohol.** Alcohol can have unpredictable effects on your blood sugar. Alcohol's effects may make it harder for you to know when you're having low blood sugar symptoms. This can increase your risk of a diabetic coma caused by hypoglycemia.\n*   **Illegal drug use.** Illegal drugs, such as cocaine, can increase your risk of severe high blood sugar and conditions linked to diabetic coma.\n\n【27】Complications\n-------------\n\n【28】If it is not treated, a diabetic coma can lead to permanent brain damage and death.\n\n【29】Prevention\n----------\n\n【30】Good day-to-day control of your diabetes can help you prevent a diabetic coma. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n【31】*   **Follow your meal plan.** Consistent snacks and meals can help you control your blood sugar level.\n*   **Keep an eye on your blood sugar level.** Frequent blood sugar tests can tell you whether you're keeping your blood sugar level in your target range. It also can alert you to dangerous highs or lows. Check more frequently if you've exercised. Exercise can cause blood sugar levels to drop, even hours later, especially if you don't exercise regularly.\n*   **Take your medication as directed.** If you have frequent episodes of high or low blood sugar, tell your health care provider. You may need to have the dose or the timing of your medication adjusted.\n*   **Have a sick-day plan.** Illness can cause an unexpected change in blood sugar. If you are sick and unable to eat, your blood sugar may drop. While you are healthy, talk with your doctor about how to best manage your blood sugar levels if you get sick. Consider storing at least a week's worth of diabetes supplies and an extra glucagon kit in case of emergencies.\n*   **Check for ketones when your blood sugar is high.** Check your urine for ketones when your blood sugar level is over 250 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (14 millimoles per liter (mmol/L)) on more than two consecutive tests, especially if you are sick. If you have a large amount of ketones, call your health care provider for advice. Call your health care provider immediately if you have any level of ketones and are vomiting. High levels of ketones can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can lead to coma.\n*   **Have glucagon and fast-acting sources of sugar available.** If you take insulin for your diabetes, have an up-to-date glucagon kit and fast-acting sources of sugar, such as glucose tablets or orange juice, readily available to treat low blood sugar levels.\n*   **Consider a continuous glucose monitor,** especially if you have trouble maintaining stable blood sugar levels or you don't feel symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia unawareness).\n\n【32】    Continuous glucose monitors are devices that use a small sensor inserted underneath the skin to track trends in blood sugar levels and send the information to a wireless device, such as a smart phone.\n\n【33】    These monitors can alert you when your blood sugar is dangerously low or if it is dropping too fast. But you still need to test your blood sugar levels using a blood glucose meter even if you're using one of these monitors. Continuous glucose monitors are more expensive than other glucose monitoring methods, but they may help you control your glucose better.\n\n【34】*   **Drink alcohol with caution.** Because alcohol can have an unpredictable effect on your blood sugar, have a snack or a meal when you drink alcohol, if you choose to drink at all.\n*   **Educate your loved ones, friends and co-workers.** Teach loved ones and other close contacts how to recognize the early symptoms of blood sugar extremes and how to give emergency injections. If you pass out, someone should be able to call for emergency help.\n*   **Wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace.** If you're unconscious, the bracelet or necklace can provide valuable information to your friends, co-workers and emergency personnel.\n\n【35】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Potential interventions were an ethics consultation and subsequent withdrawal of pacemaker or ICD support. The study's main outcome measures were death and the context in which it occurred.\n\n【4】### Results:\n\n【5】The mean age of the 6 patients (3 men, 3 women) was 75.5 years. Five had pacemakers, and 1 had an ICD. Five patients had advance directives that indicated a desire to withdraw medical interventions if death was inevitable. Two patients and 4 surrogates requested withdrawal of pacemaker or ICD support. One patient died without withdrawal of support despite an ethics consultation that endorsed its permissibility. Another died while an ethics consultation was in progress. The request to withdraw support was granted in 4 patients, all of whom died within 5 days of withdrawal of support.\n\n【6】### Conclusions:\n\n【7】Granting terminally ill patients’ requests to withdraw unwanted medical support is legal and ethical. Death after withdrawal of support is attributable to the patient's underlying pathology and is not the same as physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia. Clinician familiarity with these concepts may lead to more expeditious withdrawal of unwanted medical support from terminally ill patients.\n\n【8】CABG ( coronary artery bypass graft ), CHF ( congestive heart failure ), CPR ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation ), ICD ( implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ), PAS ( physician-assisted suicide )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【40】### Storage\n\n【41】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【42】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【43】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【44】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【45】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【46】It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【47】It is important to tell your doctor if you become pregnant. Your doctor may want you to join a pregnancy registry for patients taking this medicine.\n\n【48】If you have or get HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection, be sure to discuss your treatment with your doctor. If you are taking this medicine to treat chronic hepatitis B and are not taking medicines for your HIV at the same time, some HIV treatments that you take in the future may be less likely to work. Your doctor may need you to get an HIV test before you start taking this medicine and anytime after that when there is a chance you were exposed to HIV. This medicine will not help your HIV infection.\n\n【49】Two rare but serious reactions to this medicine are lactic acidosis (too much acid in the blood) and liver toxicity, which includes an enlarged liver. These are more common if you are female, very overweight (obese), or have been taking anti-HIV medicines for a long time. Call your doctor right away if you or your child feel tired, weak, dizzy, or nauseated, if you vomit or have stomach pain, dark urine, light-colored stools, unusual muscle pains, trouble with breathing, or if your skin or eyes turn yellow.\n\n【50】Liver disease may become worse if treatment with entecavir is stopped. Do not stop taking entecavir unless your doctor tells you to stop.\n\n【51】Treatment with entecavir has not been shown to decrease the chance of giving hepatitis B virus infection to other people through sexual contact or blood contamination.\n\n【52】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【53】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【54】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【55】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【56】#### Incidence not known\n\n【57】1.  Abdominal or stomach discomfort\n2.  cough\n3.  decreased appetite\n4.  diarrhea\n5.  difficulty with swallowing\n6.  dizziness\n7.  fast heartbeat\n8.  fast, shallow breathing\n9.  general feeling of discomfort\n10.  hives, itching, or rash\n11.  muscle pain or cramping\n12.  nausea\n13.  puffiness or swelling of the eyelids or around the eyes, face, lips, or tongue\n14.  right upper abdominal or stomach pain and fullness\n15.  sleepiness\n16.  tightness in the chest\n17.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n\n【58】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【59】#### Less common\n\n【60】1.  Acid or sour stomach\n2.  belching\n3.  headache\n4.  heartburn\n5.  indigestion\n6.  stomach discomfort, upset, or pain\n\n【61】#### Rare\n\n【62】1.  Trouble sleeping\n2.  Unusual drowsiness\n\n【63】#### Incidence not known\n\n【64】1.  Hair loss\n2.  thinning of the hair\n\n【65】无关删除-1:<u>Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients.

Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain and spinal cord process painful and nonpainful signals.\n\n【2】Symptoms often begin after an event, such as physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress. In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event.\n\n【3】Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression.\n\n【4】While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms. Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】The primary symptoms of fibromyalgia include:\n\n【7】*   **Widespread pain.** The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months. To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist.\n*   **Fatigue.** People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea.\n*   **Cognitive difficulties.** A symptom commonly referred to as \"fibro fog\" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks.\n\n【8】Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other conditions, such as:\n\n【9】*   Irritable bowel syndrome\n*   Chronic fatigue syndrome\n*   Migraine and other types of headaches\n*   Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome\n*   Temporomandibular joint disorders\n*   Anxiety\n*   Depression\n*   Postural tachycardia syndrome\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Many researchers believe that repeated nerve stimulation causes the brain and spinal cord of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain.\n\n【12】In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become sensitized, meaning they can overreact to painful and nonpainful signals.\n\n【13】There are likely many factors that lead to these changes, including:\n\n【14】*   **Genetics.** Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder.\n*   **Infections.** Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia.\n*   **Physical or emotional events.** Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical event, such as a car accident. Prolonged psychological stress may also trigger the condition.\n\n【15】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【16】Risk factors for fibromyalgia include:\n\n【17】*   **Your sex.** Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men.\n*   **Family history.** You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a parent or sibling also has the condition.\n*   **Other disorders.** If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia.\n\n【18】Complications\n-------------\n\n【19】The pain, fatigue, and poor sleep quality associated with fibromyalgia can interfere with your ability to function at home or on the job. The frustration of dealing with an often-misunderstood condition also can result in depression and health-related anxiety.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Young children may be at increased risk of unwanted effects because of increased absorption of salicylic acid through the skin. Products containing salicylic acid should not be applied to large areas of the body or used for long periods of time in infants and children.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of salicylic acid and sulfur combination in the elderly with use in other age groups.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Three weeks before presentation, she had started taking oral contraceptives (OCPs), which were prescribed to control dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The bleeding was thought to be secondary to a newly discovered uterine fibroid. The patient's daily bleeding had stopped completely 4 days before admission. Her symptoms had begun 1 day before admission, when she woke up feeling nauseated and could not stop vomiting. She thought she had the flu and postponed coming to the hospital. The patient described lower quadrant abdominal pain and several bloody, soft stools the day before admission. She denied any fevers or diarrhea. Her medical history was unremarkable, and she reported only osteoarthritis and a prior tubal ligation. She denied taking any daily medications except for the OCPs, which she had also taken at the age of 19 years with no problems. The patient had a clinically relevant smoking history, having smoked 1 to 2 packs per day since the age of 14 years. She drank wine socially.\n\n【1】In the 3 months preceding her recent uterine bleeding, the patient had had no vaginal bleeding or menstrual cycles. Up until that time, she had been having regular cycles with normal flow. She had also been having hot flashes for about a year before admission. The patient had regularly undergone Papanicolaou smears and mammography, with no abnormalities identified. She had never undergone an endometrial biopsy and had not yet undergone a screening colonoscopy.\n\n【2】On presentation, the patient was writhing in severe pain, seemingly unable to find a comfortable position. Her abdominal examination was notable for hypoactive bowel sounds and tenderness, most prominent in the left lower quadrant. Peritoneal signs were absent. Her presentation was markedly out of proportion with the findings on physical examination. Findings on the remainder of the examination, including the neurologic and peripheral arterial examinations, were unremarkable.\n\n【3】*   1.\n\n【4】    **_Which one of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's presentation?_**\n\n【5】    *   a.\n\n【6】        _Diverticulitis_\n\n【7】    *   b.\n\n【8】        _Cerebellar infarction_\n\n【9】    *   c.\n\n【10】        _Acute mesenteric ischemia_\n\n【11】    *   d.\n\n【12】        _Nephrolithiasis_\n\n【13】    *   e.\n\n【14】        _Ischemic colitis_\n\n【15】Diverticulitis is high in the differential diagnosis of a patient with abdominal pain localizing to the left lower quadrant. However, the presence of bloody stools and the absence of fever argue against this diagnosis. Diverticulitis becomes more prevalent with increasing age; however, with the current obesity epidemic, this demographic may include much younger people. A cerebellar infarction should always be considered in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors, particularly one presenting with nausea and vomiting. However, the lack of associated neurologic signs and symptoms, as well as the presence of bloody stools and abdominal tenderness, argues strongly against the diagnosis in this case. In a case series of 15 patients with missed cerebellar infarctions, gastritis and gastroenteritis were common alternative diagnoses in those with symptoms of nausea and vomiting.\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>*   Savitz SI\n*   Caplan LR\n*   Edlow JA</u>\n\n【17】Pitfalls in the diagnosis of cerebellar infarction.\n\n【18】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Acad Emerg Med._ 2007; 14 : 63-68</u></u>\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【20】Many of these patients had normal findings on computed tomography (CT) of the head, which is a highly insensitive study for the detection of early posterior fossa ischemia. Acute mesenteric ischemia is the most likely diagnosis, given the clinical context in this case. The patient had several immediate risk factors for clot formation, including her age, smoking status, and recent initiation of OCPs. Further, her symptoms were disproportionate to her examination findings. Nephrolithiasis, which is a reasonable differential diagnosis given lower quadrant writhing abdominal pain, is often associated with nausea and vomiting. However, the presence of abdominal tenderness on examination and history of bloody stooling make this diagnosis unlikely. This presentation has many features consistent with ischemic colitis, which is a consequence of small-vessel atherosclerosis and a transient decrease in blood flow to the colon. Ischemic colitis typically occurs in adults older than 60 years and presents with left-sided abdominal pain and bloody stools. The history is typically more protracted, and the pain less intense, than would be seen with acute mesenteric ischemia. It is critical to exclude acute mesenteric ischemia first because it carries considerable mortality, which can be affected by an early invasive approach.\n\n【21】The patient was given intravenous hydration, began receiving fentanyl patient-controlled analgesia, and was given intravenous antiemetic agents. Her laboratory examination revealed the following (reference ranges provided parenthetically): leukocyte count, 27.6 × 10  /L (3.5-10.5 × 10  /L), with a predominant neutrophilia; hemoglobin, 12.5 g/dL (12.0-15.5 g/dL); and platelet count, 311 × 10  /L (150-450 × 10  /L). The electrolyte panel returned the following results: sodium, 134 mEq/L (135-145 mEq/L); potassium, 3.4 mmol/L (3.6-4.8 mmol/L); chloride, 102 mmol/L (100-108 mmol/L); bicarbonate, 18 mEq/L (22-29 mEq/L); creatinine, 0.5 mg/dL (0.7-1.2 mg/dL); and blood urea nitrogen, 6 mg/dL (6-21 mg/dL). Also noted was 1.4 mmol/L of lactate (0.6-2.3 mmol/L). A panel of abdominal markers revealed the following: alkaline phosphatase, 71 U/L (41-108 U/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 31 U/L (8-43 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 12 U/L (7-45 U/L); lipase, 69 U/L (10-73 U/L); and total bilirubin, 0.4 mg/dL (0.1-1.0 mg/dL).\n\n【22】*   2.\n\n【23】    **_Which one of the following is the most appropriate next diagnostic test?_**\n\n【24】    *   a.\n\n【25】        _Abdominal flat-plate and upright radiography_\n\n【26】    *   b.\n\n【27】        _D-dimer assay_\n\n【28】    *   c.\n\n【29】        _CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis_\n\n【30】    *   d.\n\n【31】        _Abdominal ultrasonography with Doppler imaging_\n\n【32】    *   e.\n\n【33】        _Repeated urgent lactate assays_\n\n【34】In the setting of an abdominal emergency, plain abdominal radiography is most useful for diagnosing bowel obstruction, pneumoperitoneum, and occasionally ureteral calculi. However, with a high clinical suspicion for bowel ischemia and laboratory identification of low bicarbonate levels, plain radiography would not be the best next test. The preclinical probability for thrombosis in our patient was high, meaning that findings on D-dimer assay would not affect management. The best next test would be CT angiography, which could identify an occluded vessel, would be better at characterizing potentially ischemic or necrotic intestinal tissue, and might identify a source for embolization. Abdominal ultrasonography with Doppler imaging is a potentially useful study in this setting; however, it is not as sensitive as CT angiography would be. Lactic acid levels can be very useful in the diagnosis of intestinal ischemia but are not a perfect screening tool. Lactate has been reported to have a sensitivity of 96% to 100%, with a specificity of only 38% to 42%. Normal lactate levels may be seen, especially early in establishing or ruling out the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia.\n\n【35】无关删除-2:<u>*   Brandt LJ\n*   Boley SJ</u>\n\n【36】AGA Technical Review on Intestinal Ischemia.\n\n【37】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Gastroenterology._ 2000; 118 : 954-968</u></u>\n\n【38】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (471)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【39】Given the patient's age, smoking history, recent initiation of OCPs, and examination findings, urgent CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed. An occlusive thrombus of the celiac trunk was identified with distal splenic arterial occlusions, massive splenic infarcts, and a wedge-shaped hepatic infarct. A nonocclusive thrombus in the superior mesenteric artery was also present. No bowel wall thickening, fat stranding, or pneumatosis was noted. On CT angiography, a small (subcentimeter), mobile thrombus in the ascending aorta was identified in an area of an atherosclerotic plaque. Scattered, mild plaques were noted throughout the aorta. An emergent consultation was sought with vascular and general surgery.\n\n【40】*   3.\n\n【41】    **_Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?_**\n\n【42】    *   a.\n\n【43】        _Thrombolytic therapy_\n\n【44】    *   b.\n\n【45】        _Surgical embolectomy_\n\n【46】    *   c.\n\n【47】        _Emergent bowel resection_\n\n【48】    *   d.\n\n【49】        _Invasive mesenteric angiography_\n\n【50】    *   e.\n\n【51】        _Continuous heparin infusion and serial abdominal examinations_\n\n【52】Thrombolytic therapy could be an appropriate intervention for an acute arterial thrombosis or embolism. However, in our patient both the recent history of menorrhagia and the risk of dislodging the ascending aortic thrombus preclude the use of thrombolytic agents. Surgical embolectomy and emergent bowel resection would be appropriate if peritoneal signs or a major embolus in the absence of peritoneal signs was present. The presence of peritoneal signs is thought to be a surrogate of underlying bowel infarction. Mesenteric revascularization, possibly by embolectomy, should typically precede bowel resection in an effort to preserve potentially viable intestinal segments and spare resection of more bowel than is necessary. Invasive mesenteric angiography is the criterion standard imaging test for suspected acute mesenteric ischemia. Had this technique been used in our patient, a catheter could have been left in place for continuous infusion of papaverine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Papaverine acts as a vasodilator and can potentially help rescue salvageable bowel. Because our patient did not have clinical evidence of infarcted bowel, major embolism, multiorgan failure, or hemodynamic instability, she was initially managed conservatively with a continuous heparin infusion and careful clinical monitoring.\n\n【53】Transesophageal echocardiography was performed, revealing no evidence of atrial septal defects or intracardiac thrombi. Early in the morning after admission, the patient had an episode of dark, red hematemesis and was found to have voluntary guarding on examination. She was taken emergently to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. During the course of back-to-back operations, the patient underwent resection of 129 cm of jejunum and subsequently an additional 62 cm of ileum. The patient was left with approximately 210 cm of viable small bowel.\n\n【54】*   4.\n\n【55】    **_Given the case information up to this point, which one of the following is the least likely precipitant of the patient's condition?_**\n\n【56】    *   a.\n\n【57】        _Smoking, OCPs, and perimenopausal state alone_\n\n【58】    *   b.\n\n【59】        _Thrombophilia_\n\n【60】    *   c.\n\n【61】        _Occult malignancy_\n\n【62】    *   d.\n\n【63】        _Mesenteric vasculitis_\n\n【64】    *   e.\n\n【65】        _Median arcuate ligament variant_\n\n【66】Evaluation of a patient with an arterial clot should include consideration of both vascular and thrombotic etiologies.

Screening for thrombophilia, especially measurement of antiphospholipid antibodies, should be performed because the diagnosis establishes a need for indefinite anticoagulation. Occult malignancy is always a consideration in an older person with a substantial clot burden; however, arterial events are much less frequent than venous ones. Mesenteric vasculitis is typically a manifestation of a systemic vasculitis, and the mechanism of ischemia may include luminal narrowing, thrombosis, or spontaneous dissection. Median arcuate ligament variant occurs as a result of a normal anatomic variant, in which the celiac axis becomes indented. A small number of persons with this variant will be clinically affected. This diagnosis would not explain the presence of thrombosis and typically evolves more gradually.\n\n【72】The patient tested negative for thrombophilia; however, this testing was performed during the acute phase and may be misleading. The patient underwent uterine ultrasonography, which revealed an endometrial thickness less than 5 mm, and an endometrial biopsy was not pursued. Follow-up laboratory studies revealed a resolved leukocytosis (leukocyte count, 7.4 × 10  /L \\[3.5-10.5 × 10  /L\\]), a stable hemoglobin (13.3 g/dL \\[12.0-15.5 g/dL\\]), and marked thrombocytosis (platelet count, 962 × 10  /L \\[150-450 × 10  /L\\]).\n\n【73】*   5.\n\n【74】    **_Which one of the following is necessary to complete the medical management of our patient?_**\n\n【75】    *   a.\n\n【76】        _Prophylactic splenectomy_\n\n【77】    *   b.\n\n【78】        _Vaccinations for_ Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hae mophilus influenzae B, _and_ Neisseria meningitidis\n\n【79】    *   c.\n\n【80】        _Initiation of long-term total parenteral nutrition_\n\n【81】    *   d.\n\n【82】        _Recommendation for indefinite anticoagulation_\n\n【83】    *   e.\n\n【84】        _Initiation of progesterone-only tablets_\n\n【85】Most of the patient's spleen was infarcted, accounting for her marked thrombocytosis. A small percentage of patients with infarcted spleens develop an abscess, which may require splenectomy, especially if multifocal in nature. However, there is no role for routine, prophylactic splenectomy. In the setting of a functional splenectomy, prophylactic vaccinations for _S pneumoniae, H influenzae B_ , and _N meningitidis_ are indicated. The risk of postsplenectomy sepsis is approximately 1% to 2% in adults, but the mortality may exceed 50% if it does occur. Acute mesenteric ischemia, along with Crohn disease, is a leading risk factor for short-bowel syndrome. Patients with more than a 50% reduction or less than 200 cm of functional small bowel are at risk of developing this syndrome of malabsorption and malnutrition. Many patients require long-term total parenteral nutrition; however, on the basis of the amount of bowel removed, our patient was not at high risk. If our patient had met criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome, indefinite anticoagulation would have been indicated. However, treatment for 3 to 6 months with follow-up imaging would be an appropriate recommendation at this time. In terms of the patient's fibroid, progesterone-only tablets could be considered but are not necessary. Given that she had a stable hemoglobin level, expectant management would be a reasonable approach. Endometrial ablation or even hysterectomy could be considered depending on her subsequent clinical course, in the setting of required anticoagulation.\n\n【86】The patient was able to tolerate oral intake and was bridged to a therapeutic international normalized ratio with coumadin and heparin; uterine bleeding did not recur. Anticoagulation for 3 months was recommended, with follow-up CT angiography before discontinuation of therapy to evaluate both the aortic arch and mesenteric thrombi.\n\n【87】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【88】Arterial emboli are the most frequent etiology of acute mesenteric ischemia, followed by arterial thrombosis, nonocclusive disease, and rarely, venous thrombosis.\n\n【89】无关删除-2:<u>*   Oldenburg WA\n*   Lau LL\n*   Rodenberg TJ\n\n【90】Acute mesenteric ischemia: a clinical review.\n\n【91】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Intern Med._ 2004; 164 : 1054-1062</u></u>\n\n【92】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (500)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【93】The former 2 conditions classically present abruptly, whereas the latter 2 have a more gradual onset and protracted course; all are associated with a nonspecific set of symptoms. A history of postprandial abdominal pain, nausea, and weight loss can help in differentiating a decomposition of a long-standing problem from a new embolic or thrombotic event. Clinical history and imaging findings may help in differentiating between acute thrombosis and embolism. However, as in our case, this distinction can be difficult. Regardless, all 4 etiologies of acute mesenteric ischemia can progress to bowel infarction, which may manifest clinically as an acute abdomen, with a sepsis-type picture. Establishing the diagnosis early, before the development of bowel infarction, has been a major factor in reducing mortality. In a recent series of 77 patients with acute intestinal ischemia managed surgically, the 30-day mortality rate was 30.0% for patients with arterial occlusive disease, 67.9% for those with nonocclusive disease, and 10.5% for those with mesenteric venous thrombosis.\n\n【94】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hsu HP\n*   Shan YS\n*   Hsieh YH\n*   Sy ED\n*   Lin PW</u>\n\n【95】Impact of etiologic factors and APACHE II and POSSUM scores in management and clinical outcome of acute intestinal ischemic disorders after surgical treatment.\n\n【96】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_World J Surg._ 2006; 30 : 2152-2162</u></u>\n\n【97】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (20)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【98】Thus, establishing the etiology is useful in assessing prognosis.\n\n【99】Arterial embolism may be suspected clinically in the setting of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, ventricular aneurysm, aortic mural thrombi, and certain valvular diseases. Paradoxical emboli should be considered if a patent foramen ovale is identified. The major risk factors for arterial thrombosis include atherosclerosis, estrogen replacement therapy, and hypercoagulability. The distinction is also important in that a diagnosis of acute mesenteric thrombosis should prompt an early invasive approach because of the high in-hospital mortality associated with this etiology.\n\n【100】无关删除-2:<u>*   Brandt LJ\n*   Boley SJ</u>\n\n【101】AGA Technical Review on Intestinal Ischemia.\n\n【102】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Gastroenterology._ 2000; 118 : 954-968</u></u>\n\n【103】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (471)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【104】Regardless of etiology, an early invasive approach should be adopted in the presence of hemodynamic instability or peritoneal signs or if the clot completely occludes the superior mesenteric artery or resides in the superior mesenteric artery above the origin of the ileocolic artery.\n\n【105】无关删除-2:<u>*   Brandt LJ\n*   Boley SJ</u>\n\n【106】AGA Technical Review on Intestinal Ischemia.\n\n【107】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Gastroenterology._ 2000; 118 : 954-968</u></u>\n\n【108】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (471)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【109】The pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis is complex and often involves an interaction among atherosclerotic disease, rheology, and thrombophilia, a concept embodied in the Virchow triad.\n\n【110】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rauch U\n*   Osende JI\n*   Fuster V\n\n【111】Thrombus formation on atherosclerotic plaques: pathogenesis and clinical consequences.\n\n【112】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 2001; 134 : 224-238</u></u>\n\n【113】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (266)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【114】The high lipid content of advanced atheromatous lesions is very thrombogenic, largely because of a high content of tissue factor.

{"seq_id": "c5c3e16a-9411-4236-a328-0ead1c9a3422", "title": "Spina bifida", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't form properly. It's a type of neural tube defect. The neural tube is the structure in a developing embryo that eventually becomes the baby's brain, spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them.\n\n【2】Typically, the neural tube forms early in pregnancy and it closes by the 28th day after conception. In babies with spina bifida, a portion of the neural tube doesn't close or develop properly, causing problems in the spinal cord and in the bones of the spine.\n\n【3】Spina bifida can range from mild to severe, depending on the type of defect, size, location and complications. When necessary, early treatment for spina bifida involves surgery — although such treatment doesn't always completely resolve the problem.\n\n【4】### Types\n\n【5】Spina bifida can occur in different types: spina bifida occulta, myelomeningocele (my-uh-lo-muh-NING-go-seel) or the very rare type meningocele (muh-NING-go-seel).\n\n【6】#### Spina bifida occulta\n\n【7】Occulta means hidden. It's the mildest and most common type. Spina bifida occulta results in a small separation or gap in one or more of the bones of the spine (vertebrae). Many people who have spina bifida occulta don't even know it, unless the condition is discovered during an imaging test done for unrelated reasons.\n\n【8】#### Myelomeningocele\n\n【9】Also known as open spina bifida, myelomeningocele is the most severe type. The spinal canal is open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. The membranes and spinal nerves push through this opening at birth, forming a sac on the baby's back, typically exposing tissues and nerves. This makes the baby prone to life-threatening infections and may also cause paralysis and bladder and bowel dysfunction.\n\n【10】#### Meningocele\n\n【11】This rare type of spina bifida is characterized by a sac of spinal fluid bulging through an opening in the spine. No nerves are affected in this type, and the spinal cord isn't in the fluid sac. Babies with meningocele may have some minor problems with functioning, including those affecting the bladder and bowels.\n\n【12】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【13】Signs and symptoms of spina bifida vary by type and severity, and also between individuals.\n\n【14】*   **Spina bifida occulta.** Typically, there aren't any signs or symptoms because the spinal nerves aren't involved. But you can sometimes see signs on the newborn's skin above the spinal problem, including a tuft of hair, a small dimple or a birthmark. Sometimes, these skin marks can be signs of an underlying spinal cord issue that can be discovered with MRI or spinal ultrasound in a newborn.\n*   **Meningocele.** This type may cause problems with bladder and bowel function.\n*   **Myelomeningocele.** In this severe type of spina bifida:\n\n【15】*   The spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back\n*   Both the membranes and the spinal cord or nerves protrude at birth, forming a sac\n*   Tissues and nerves usually are exposed, though sometimes skin covers the sac\n\n【16】### When to see a doctor\n\n【17】Typically, myelomeningocele is diagnosed before or right after birth, when medical care is available. Children diagnosed with this condition should be followed by a specialized team of health care providers throughout their lives. Families should be educated on the different complications to watch for.\n\n【18】Children with spina bifida occulta typically don't have any symptoms or complications, so usually only routine pediatric care is needed.\n\n【19】Causes\n------\n\n【20】Doctors aren't certain what causes spina bifida. It's thought to result from a combination of genetic, nutritional and environmental risk factors, such as a family history of neural tube defects and folate (vitamin B-9) deficiency.\n\n【21】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【22】Spina bifida is more common among white people and Hispanics, and females are affected more often than males. Although doctors and researchers don't know for sure why spina bifida occurs, they have identified some risk factors:\n\n【23】*   **Folate deficiency.** Folate, the natural form of vitamin B-9, is important to the development of a healthy baby. The synthetic form, found in supplements and fortified foods, is called folic acid. A folate deficiency increases the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects.\n*   **Family history of neural tube defects.** Couples who've had one child with a neural tube defect have a slightly higher chance of having another baby with the same defect. That risk increases if two previous children have been affected by the condition. In addition, women who were born with a neural tube defect have a greater chance of giving birth to a child with spina bifida than someone who doesn't have a neural tube defect. However, most babies with spina bifida are born to parents with no known family history of the condition.\n*   **Some medications.** For example, anti-seizure medications, such as valproic acid seem to cause neural tube defects when taken during pregnancy. This might happen because they interfere with the body's ability to use folate and folic acid.\n*   **Diabetes.** Women with diabetes who don't have well-controlled blood sugar have a higher risk of having a baby with spina bifida.\n*   **Obesity.** Pre-pregnancy obesity is associated with an increased risk of neural tube birth defects, including spina bifida.\n*   **Increased body temperature.** Some evidence suggests that increased body temperature (hyperthermia) in the early weeks of pregnancy may increase the risk of spina bifida. Increases in core body temperature, due to fever or use of a sauna or hot tub, have been associated with a slightly increased risk of spina bifida.\n\n【24】If you have known risk factors for spina bifida, talk with your doctor to determine if you need a larger dose or prescription dose of folic acid, even before a pregnancy begins.\n\n【25】If you take medications, tell your doctor. If you plan ahead, some medications can be adjusted to diminish the potential risk of spina bifida.\n\n【26】Complications\n-------------\n\n【27】Spina bifida may cause minimal symptoms or minor physical problems. But severe spina bifida can lead to more significant physical conditions. Severity is affected by:\n\n【28】*   The size and location of the neural tube defect\n*   Whether skin covers the affected area\n*   Which spinal nerves come out of the affected area of the spinal cord\n\n【29】This list of possible complications may seem overwhelming, but not all children with spina bifida get all of these complications. Many of these complications can be treated.\n\n【30】*   **Walking and mobility problems.** The nerves that control the leg muscles don't work properly below the area of the spina bifida defect. This can cause muscle weakness of the legs and sometimes paralysis. Whether a child can walk typically depends on where the defect is, its size, and the care received before and after birth.\n*   **Orthopedic complications.** Children with myelomeningocele can have a variety of problems in the legs and spine because of weak muscles in the legs and back. The types of problems depend on the location of the defect. Possible problems include orthopedic issues such as:\n\n【31】*   Curved spine (scoliosis)\n*   Abnormal growth\n*   Dislocation of the hip\n*   Bone and joint deformities\n*   Muscle contractures\n\n【32】*   **Bowel and bladder problems.** Nerves that supply the bladder and bowels usually don't work properly when children have myelomeningocele. This is because the nerves that supply the bowel and bladder come from the lowest level of the spinal cord.\n*   **Accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus).** Babies born with myelomeningocele commonly experience accumulation of fluid in the brain, a condition known as hydrocephalus.\n*   **Shunt malfunction.** Shunts placed in the brain to treat hydrocephalus can stop working or become infected. Warning signs may vary. Some of the warning signs of a shunt that isn't working include:\n\n【33】*   Headaches\n*   Vomiting\n*   Sleepiness\n*   Irritability\n*   Swelling or redness along the shunt\n*   Confusion\n*   Changes in the eyes (fixed downward gaze)\n*   Trouble feeding\n*   Seizures\n\n【34】*   **Chiari malformation type II.** Chiari malformation (kee-AH-ree mal-for-MAY-shun) type 2 is a common problem with the brain in children who have the myelomeningocele type of spina bifida. The brainstem is the lowest part of the brain above the spinal cord. In Chiari malformation type 2, the brainstem is elongated and positioned lower than usual. This can cause problems with breathing and swallowing. Rarely, compression on this area of the brain occurs and surgery is needed to relieve the pressure.\n*   **Infection in the tissues surrounding the brain (meningitis).** Some babies with myelomeningocele may develop meningitis, an infection in the tissues surrounding the brain. This potentially life-threatening infection may cause brain injury.\n*   **Tethered spinal cord.** Tethered spinal cord results when the spinal nerves bind to the scar where the defect was closed surgically. The spinal cord is less able to grow as the child grows. This progressive tethering can cause loss of muscle function to the legs, bowel or bladder. Surgery can limit the degree of disability.\n*   **Sleep-disordered breathing.** Both children and adults with spina bifida, particularly myelomeningocele, may have sleep apnea or other sleep disorders. Assessment for a sleep disorder in those with myelomeningocele helps detect sleep-disordered breathing, such as sleep apnea, which warrants treatment to improve health and quality of life.\n*   **Skin problems.** Children with spina bifida may get wounds on their feet, legs, buttocks or back. They can't feel when they get a blister or sore. Sores or blisters can turn into deep wounds or foot infections that are hard to treat. Children with myelomeningocele have a higher risk of wound problems in casts.\n*   **Latex allergy.** Children with spina bifida have a higher risk of latex allergy, an allergic reaction to natural rubber or latex products. Latex allergy may cause rash, sneezing, itching, watery eyes and a runny nose. It can also cause anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition in which swelling of the face and airways can make breathing difficult. So it's best to use latex-free gloves and equipment at delivery time and when caring for a child with spina bifida.\n*   **Other complications.** More problems may arise as children with spina bifida get older, such as urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and depression. Children with myelomeningocele may develop learning disorders, such as problems paying attention, and difficulty learning reading and math.\n\n【35】Prevention\n----------\n\n【36】Folic acid, taken in supplement form starting at least one month before conception and continuing through the first trimester of pregnancy, greatly reduces the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects.\n\n【37】### Get folic acid first\n\n【38】Having enough folic acid in your system by the early weeks of pregnancy is critical to prevent spina bifida. Because many women don't discover that they're pregnant until this time, experts recommend that all women of childbearing age take a daily supplement of 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid.\n\n【39】Several foods are fortified with 400 mcg of folic acid per serving, including:\n\n【40】*   Enriched bread\n*   Pasta\n*   Rice\n*   Some breakfast cereals\n\n【41】Folic acid may be listed on food packages as folate, which is the natural form of folic acid found in foods.\n\n【42】### Planning pregnancy\n\n【43】Adult women who are planning pregnancy or who could become pregnant should be advised to get 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid a day.\n\n【44】Your body doesn't absorb folate as easily as it absorbs synthetic folic acid, and most people don't get the recommended amount of folate through diet alone, so vitamin supplements are necessary to prevent spina bifida. And it's possible that folic acid will also help reduce the risk of other birth defects, including cleft lip, cleft palate and some congenital heart defects.\n\n【45】It's also a good idea to eat a healthy diet, including foods rich in folate or enriched with folic acid. This vitamin is present naturally in many foods, including:\n\n【46】*   Beans and peas\n*   Citrus fruits and juices\n*   Egg yolks\n*   Milk\n*   Avocados\n*   Dark green vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach\n\n【47】### When higher doses are needed\n\n【48】If you have spina bifida or if you've previously given birth to a child with spina bifida, you'll need extra folic acid before you become pregnant. If you're taking anti-seizure medications or you have diabetes, you may also benefit from a higher dose of this B vitamin. Check with your doctor before taking additional folic acid supplements.\n\n【49】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

This overview focuses on the treatment of the major protozoan and helminth infections in humans. Recent developments in antiparasitic therapy include the expansion of artemisinin-based therapies for malaria, new drugs for soil-transmitted helminths and intestinal protozoa, expansion of the indications for antiparasitic drug treatment in patients with Chagas disease, and the use of combination therapy for leishmaniasis and human African trypanosomiasis.\n\n【1】AL ( artemether-lumefantrine ), CBC ( complete blood cell count ), CL ( cutaneous leishmaniasis ), CNS ( central nervous system ), DEC ( diethylcarbamazine ), G6PD ( glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ), HAT ( human African trypanosomiasis ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), LF ( lymphatic filariasis ), ML ( mucocutaneous leishmaniasis ), NCC ( neurocysticercosis ), STH ( soil-transmitted helminth ), TMP-SMX ( trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ), VL ( visceral leishmaniasis ), VLM ( visceral larva migrans )\n\n【2】Parasitic diseases cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, taking the heaviest toll among the world's poorest people. This article reviews the treatment of the major protozoan and helminth infections in humans.\n\n【3】PROTOZOA AND THE DISEASES THEY CAUSE\n------------------------------------\n\n【4】Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotes that cause a diverse array of human diseases. They are generally categorized as systemic or intestinal and usually do not cause eosinophilia.\n\n【5】### Systemic Protozoa\n\n【6】**Malaria.** Human malaria is caused by the mosquitoborne parasites _Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae_ , and _Plasmodium knowlesi_ , which parasitize red blood cells and cause hemolytic anemia. Malaria kills nearly 1 million people and causes almost 300 million symptomatic illnesses annually. It is found in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Oceania, and Latin America. Uncomplicated malaria can manifest as fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, myalgias, cough, and diarrhea. Severe malaria is defined in part by respiratory distress, renal failure, altered mental status or seizures, intolerance of oral medications, metabolic acidosis or hypoglycemia, and parasitemia greater than 5%. The mortality rate of severe malaria is high.\n\n【7】**Treatment of Uncomplicated _P falciparum_ Malaria.** The preferred treatment for uncomplicated _P falciparum_ malaria acquired in areas with chloroquine resistance is atovaquone-proguanil, artemether-lumefantrine (AL), or oral quinine plus doxycycline.\n\n【8】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n【9】Guidelines for treatment of malaria in the United States.\n\n【10】删除3:<u>http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/treatmenttable.pdf</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【12】Atovaquone-proguanil is a well-tolerated, oral fixed-dose combination. Atovaquone inhibits parasite mitochondrial electron transport. Proguanil inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase step in purine synthesis and lowers the concentration of atovaquone necessary to kill _Plasmodium_ species. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and hepatitis.\n\n【13】Artemether-lumefantrine is an oral fixed-dose combination recently approved in the United States. Artemether is a semisynthetic derivative of artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone. Lumefantrine, a fluorene derivative, may interfere with heme metabolism. Artemether-lumefantrine is rapidly effective against all erythrocytic stages of malaria. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, and possibly QT prolongation.\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   Maude RJ\n*   Plewes K\n*   Faiz MA\n\n【15】Does artesunate prolong the electrocardiograph QT interval in patients with severe malaria?\n\n【16】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Trop Med Hyg._ 2009; 80 : 126-132</u></u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【18】It should be taken with fatty foods to increase absorption.\n\n【19】Oral quinine plus doxycycline (or plus tetracycline or clindamycin) is effective for uncomplicated malaria. Quinine is an aryl-amino alcohol, which may cause toxic heme accumulation in the parasite. It can cause cinchonism (nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, high-frequency hearing loss, and dizziness). Both tetracyclines and clindamycin inhibit expression of the _Plasmodium_ apicoplast genome. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, candidiasis, and photosensitivity for doxycycline and nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea for clindamycin.\n\n【20】Mefloquine, an aryl-amino quinoline, has the same mechanism of action as quinine. Due to resistance, it is not recommended for patients infected in much of Southeast Asia. It can cause neuropsychiatric disturbances and QT prolongation at treatment doses and is a second-line agent.\n\n【21】Chloroquine is recommended for uncomplicated _P falciparum_ malaria acquired in areas without chloroquine resistance. It is a 4-aminoquinoline and may act by disrupting heme metabolism. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and blurred vision. Pruritis also occurs, mostly in African patients. Hydroxychloroquine is an acceptable alternative.\n\n【22】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n【23】Guidelines for treatment of malaria in the United States.\n\n【24】删除3:<u>http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/treatmenttable.pdf</u>\n\n【25】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【26】**Treatment of Severe Malaria.** Severe malaria (usually caused by _P falciparum_ ) should be treated with parenteral medications, such as intravenous artesunate, quinine, or quinidine.

Patients should be monitored with telemetry and have blood glucose and drug levels followed up closely. Adverse effects include infusion-related hypotension, QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and hypoglycemia. Although less cardiotoxic than quinidine, parenteral quinine is not available in the United States. It can cause infusion-related hypotension, hypoglycemia, and cinchonism. Both quinine and quinidine should be combined with doxycycline, tetracycline, or clindamycin, and patients can transition to oral therapy after improvement.\n\n【52】**Treatment of Uncomplicated Non- _falciparum_ Malaria.** Chloroquine plus primaquine is effective for uncomplicated _P vivax_ and _P ovale_ malaria in most of the world. Patients infected in areas with chloroquine-resistant _P vivax_ and _P ovale_ (particularly Papua New Guinea and Indonesia) should be treated with atovaquone-proguanil, mefloquine, or quinine plus doxycycline. Patients infected with _P vivax_ or _P ovale_ should receive primaquine (an 8-aminoquinolone) for 14 days to prevent relapse. Because primaquine can cause hemolytic anemia in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)–deficient patients, G6PD levels should be measured before use. Other adverse effects include nausea and vomiting. _P malariae_ or _P knowlesi_ infections can usually be treated with chloroquine.\n\n【53】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n【54】Guidelines for treatment of malaria in the United States.\n\n【55】删除3:<u>http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/treatmenttable.pdf</u>\n\n【56】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【57】无关删除-2:<u>*   Daneshvar C\n*   Davis TM\n*   Cox-Singh J\n\n【58】Clinical and parasitological response to oral chloroquine and primaquine in uncomplicated human _Plasmodium knowlesi_ infections.\n\n【59】删除3:<u>_Malar J._ 2010; 9 : 238</u>\n\n【60】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (0)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【61】**_Resistance._** Chloroquine resistance is widespread.

In the United States, only 1 or 2 cases occur annually (among returning travelers). _T brucei rhodesiense_ causes a rapidly progressive disease in Eastern and Southern Africa, whereas _T brucei gambiense_ causes a more indolent disease in West and Central Africa. Initially, patients develop fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and rash. Later, a chronic meningoencephalitis occurs with headaches, listlessness, disordered sleep, and neuromuscular dysfunction. Drugs for HAT are toxic; however, left untreated, the disease is fatal.\n\n【120】**_T b gambiense._** Pentamidine and suramin are available for early-stage _T b gambiense_ disease. Neither drug crosses the blood-brain barrier, and for late-stage (central nervous system \\[CNS\\]) disease, eflornithine and melarsoprol are used 删除4:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【121】Pentamidine, an aromatic diamidine, is preferred for early-stage disease. Pentamidine reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential and binds to nucleic acids. It is given intramuscularly and can cause hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukopenia, nephrotoxicity, hepatitis, and pancreatitis.\n\n【122】Suramin, a sulfonated naphthylamine, inhibits multiple trypanosome metabolic enzymes. It is a second-line treatment for early-stage disease because of toxicity, including exfoliative dermatitis, peripheral neuropathy, nephrotoxicity, myelosuppression, and a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction. Suramin is active against _Onchocerca volvulus_ , and reactions (from dying parasites) can occur in coinfected patients.\n\n【123】无关删除-2:<u>*   Brun R\n*   Blum J\n*   Chappuis F\n*   Burri C</u>\n\n【124】Human African trypanosomiasis.\n\n【125】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Lancet._ 2010; 375 : 148-159</u></u>\n\n【126】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (655)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【127】Eflornithine, which inhibits ornithine decarboxylase, is the preferred drug for late-stage _T b gambiense_ disease.

Acute infection is often asymptomatic, but patients may have unilateral palpebral edema or an erythematous, indurated skin lesion with regional lymphadenopathy. Fever, diffuse lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and (less commonly) meningoencephalitis and myocarditis may occur. Acute disease is generally self-limited. Most patients are subsequently asymptomatic (a state termed _indeterminate Chagas_ ). Years to decades later, 20% to 40% of cases progress to chronic Chagas disease, which affects the heart (eg, cardiomyopathy, chronic heart failure, and arrhythmias) and the gastrointestinal tract (eg, achalasia, megaesophagus, constipation, obstruction, and megacolon).\n\n【178】The nitroheterocyclic compounds nifurtimox and benznidazole are used to treat Chagas disease 删除4:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.

After acute infection, _T gondii_ remains latent and persists for life. Although acute infection is usually asymptomatic, 10% to 20% of patients develop lymphadenopathy or a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. _T gondii_ can also cause chorioretinitis. Immunocompromised patients can develop toxoplasmic encephalitis (usually reactivation of latent disease) and, less commonly, disseminated disease. Toxoplasmosis acquired during pregnancy can cause spontaneous abortion, hydrocephalus, intracranial calcifications, mental retardation, and seizures in the baby. Nonpregnant, immunocompetent patients with acute toxoplasmosis generally do not require antimicrobial therapy. For eye disease, treatment usually includes anti- _Toxoplasma_ agents plus systemic corticosteroids.

Adverse effects include dose-dependent myelosuppression (which can be ameliorated with concurrent folinic acid), abdominal pain, rash, and headaches. Pyrimethamine is combined with sulfadiazine, another folate antagonist. In addition to rash and myelosuppression, sulfadiazine can cause crystal-induced nephropathy. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has similar efficacy to pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine for toxoplasmic encephalitis and chorioretinitis; however, unlike pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine, it is also available intravenously.\n\n【378】无关删除-2:<u>*   Soheilian M\n*   Sadoughi MM\n*   Ghajarnia M\n\n【379】Prospective randomized trial of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole versus pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine in the treatment of ocular toxoplasmosis.\n\n【380】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ophthalmology._ 2005; 112 : 1876-1882</u></u>\n\n【381】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (0)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【382】无关删除-2:<u>*   Torre D\n*   Casari S\n*   Speranza F\n\n【383】Italian Collaborative Study Group  \nRandomized trial of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine for therapy of toxoplasmic encephalitis in patients with AIDS.\n\n【384】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Antimicrob Agents ChemoTher._ 1998; 42 : 1346-1349</u></u>\n\n【385】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【386】Pyrimethamine plus clindamycin is also effective.

free-range pigs are raised. Taeniasis, intestinal infection with the adult tapeworm, results from eating undercooked pork containing cysticerci (larval cysts). Cysticercosis (tissue infection with _T solium_ larval cysts) results from ingestion of _T solium_ eggs, which are spread from a person with intestinal taeniasis or via fecal-oral autoinfection. Cysticercosis involving subcutaneous tissue or skeletal muscle is usually asymptomatic. With neurocysticercosis (NCC), cysts in the CNS can cause seizures, hydrocephalus, or chronic meningitis.\n\n【575】Although _T solium_ intestinal infection is usually asymptomatic, patients are treated to prevent cysticercosis. Praziquantel is first-line treatment, and niclosamide is an alternative 删除4:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The decision to treat NCC with antiparasitic agents is complex; the location, number, and type of cysts and clinical manifestations should be considered. Corticosteroids are given concurrently to decrease the inflammatory response and risk of seizures as the parasite degenerates. In general, patients with intraparenchymal cysts should be treated with albendazole plus corticosteroids. Patients with only intraparenchymal calcifications generally do not require antiparasitic therapy. Patients with subarachnoid cysts should generally receive prolonged courses of albendazole plus corticosteroids. Surgical removal is indicated for intraventicular, intraocular, and spinal cysts. Intraocular cysts should be excluded before initiating antiparasitic therapy for cysticercosis. If present, intraocular cysts should be surgically removed before administration of antiparasitic treatment to avoid irreversible eye damage due to the resulting inflammatory response.\n\n【576】Albendazole is a broad-spectrum benzimidazole that inhibits microtubule formation. It can cause nausea, abdominal pain, rash, alopecia, leukopenia, and hepatitis. Emerging evidence suggests that antiparasitic therapy decreases seizures in patients with live intraparenchymal cysts.\n\n【577】无关删除-2:<u>*   Garcia HH\n*   Pretell EJ\n*   Gilman RH\n\n【578】A trial of antiparasitic treatment to reduce the rate of seizures due to cerebral cysticercosis.\n\n【579】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 2004; 350 : 249-258</u></u>\n\n【580】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (322)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【581】Praziquantel is a second-line agent for NCC.

They are categorized as intestinal or extraintestinal. Except for _Strongyloides_ and filarial infections, benzimidazoles are the treatments of choice.\n\n【684】#### Intestinal Nematodes\n\n【685】**_Soil-Transmitted Helminths._** The most common intestinal nematodes are _Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura_ (whipworm), and the human hookworms _Ancylostoma duodenale_ and _Necator americanus._ These organisms are also termed _soil-transmitted helminths_ (STHs) because their eggs or larvae must develop in soil before becoming infectious. More than 1 billion people are infected with _Ascaris_ , and nearly as many with whipworm or hookworm, most commonly in tropical areas with poor sanitation. Humans acquire _Ascaris_ and _Trichuris_ primarily through the fecal-oral route and hookworm primarily by walking barefoot on infested soil. Although pulmonary symptoms can occur early after infection with _Ascaris_ or hookworm, adult worms in the bowel lumen generally cause no symptoms or only mild abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhea. _Ascaris_ can rarely cause intestinal or biliary obstruction, appendicitis, and intestinal perforation. Whipworm can cause rectal prolapse, and hookworm causes chronic anemia.

Recent advances in the treatment of malaria, leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease have brought needed improvements to the management of these diseases. Helminth infections are managed with a smaller pharmaceutical armamentarium than protozoal infections, but good treatment options are now available for many trematode, intestinal cestode, and intestinal nematode infections.

The identification of all human genes and their regulatory regions provides the framework to expedite our understanding of the molecular basis of disease. This advance has also formed the foundation for a broad range of genomic tools that can be applied to medical science. These developments in global gene and gene product analysis as well as targeted molecular genetic testing are destined to change the practice of modern medicine. Despite these exciting advances, many practicing clinicians perceive that the role of molecular genetics, especially that of genomics, is confined primarily to the research arena with little current clinical applicability.

Nearly everyone snores now and then, but for some people it can be a chronic problem. Sometimes it may also indicate a serious health condition. In addition, snoring can be a nuisance to your partner.\n\n【2】Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, avoiding alcohol close to bedtime or sleeping on your side, can help stop snoring.\n\n【3】In addition, medical devices and surgery are available that may reduce disruptive snoring. However, these aren't suitable or necessary for everyone who snores.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Snoring is often associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Not all snorers have OSA, but if snoring is accompanied by any of the following symptoms, it may be an indication to see a doctor for further evaluation for OSA:\n\n【6】*   Witnessed breathing pauses during sleep\n*   Excessive daytime sleepiness\n*   Difficulty concentrating\n*   Morning headaches\n*   Sore throat upon awakening\n*   Restless sleep\n*   Gasping or choking at night\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Chest pain at night\n*   Your snoring is so loud it's disrupting your partner's sleep\n*   In children, poor attention span, behavioral issues or poor performance in school\n\n【7】OSA often is characterized by loud snoring followed by periods of silence when breathing stops or nearly stops. Eventually, this reduction or pause in breathing may signal you to wake up, and you may awaken with a loud snort or gasping sound.\n\n【8】You may sleep lightly due to disrupted sleep. This pattern of breathing pauses may be repeated many times during the night.\n\n【9】People with obstructive sleep apnea usually experience periods when breathing slows or stops at least five times during every hour of sleep.\n\n【10】### When to see a doctor\n\n【11】See your doctor if you have any of the above symptoms. These may indicate your snoring is associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).\n\n【12】If your child snores, ask your pediatrician about it. Children can have OSA, too. Nose and throat problems — such as enlarged tonsils — and obesity often can narrow a child's airway, which can lead to your child developing OSA.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】Snoring can be caused by a number of factors, such as the anatomy of your mouth and sinuses, alcohol consumption, allergies, a cold, and your weight.\n\n【15】When you doze off and progress from a light sleep to a deep sleep, the muscles in the roof of your mouth (soft palate), tongue and throat relax. The tissues in your throat can relax enough that they partially block your airway and vibrate.\n\n【16】The more narrowed your airway, the more forceful the airflow becomes. This increases tissue vibration, which causes your snoring to grow louder.\n\n【17】The following conditions can affect the airway and cause snoring:\n\n【18】*   **Your mouth anatomy.** Having a low, thick soft palate can narrow your airway. People who are overweight may have extra tissues in the back of their throats that may narrow their airways. Likewise, if the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the soft palate (uvula) is elongated, airflow can be obstructed and vibration increased.\n*   **Alcohol consumption.** Snoring can also be brought on by consuming too much alcohol before bedtime. Alcohol relaxes throat muscles and decreases your natural defenses against airway obstruction.\n*   **Nasal problems.** Chronic nasal congestion or a crooked partition between your nostrils (deviated nasal septum) may contribute to your snoring.\n*   **Sleep deprivation.** Not getting enough sleep can lead to further throat relaxation.\n*   **Sleep position.** Snoring is typically most frequent and loudest when sleeping on the back as gravity's effect on the throat narrows the airway.\n\n【19】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【20】Risk factors that may contribute to snoring include:\n\n【21】*   **Being a man.** Men are more likely to snore or have sleep apnea than are women.\n*   **Being overweight.** People who are overweight or obese are more likely to snore or have obstructive sleep apnea.\n*   **Having a narrow airway.** Some people may have a long soft palate, or large tonsils or adenoids, which can narrow the airway and cause snoring.\n*   **Drinking alcohol.** Alcohol relaxes your throat muscles, increasing the risk of snoring.\n*   **Having nasal problems.** If you have a structural defect in your airway, such as a deviated septum, or your nose is chronically congested, your risk of snoring is greater.\n*   **Having a family history of snoring or obstructive sleep apnea.** Heredity is a potential risk factor for OSA.\n\n【22】Complications\n-------------\n\n【23】Habitual snoring may be more than just a nuisance. Aside from disrupting a bed partner's sleep, if snoring is associated with OSA, you may be at risk for other complications, including:\n\n【24】*   Daytime sleepiness\n*   Frequent frustration or anger\n*   Difficulty concentrating\n*   A greater risk of high blood pressure, heart conditions and stroke\n*   An increased risk of behavior problems, such as aggression or learning problems, in children with OSA\n*   An increased risk of motor vehicle accidents due to lack of sleep\n\n【25】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Although resistant gram-positive infections have been concerning to clinicians, the increasing incidence of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative infections has become the most pressing issue in bacterial resistance. Indiscriminate antimicrobial use in humans and animals coupled with increased global connectivity facilitated the transmission of gram-negative infections harboring extended-spectrum β-lactamases in the 1990s. Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, such as those containing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamases, have been the latest scourge since the late 1990s to 2000s. Besides β-lactam resistance, these gram-negative infections are often resistant to multiple drug classes, including fluoroquinolones, which are commonly used to treat community-onset infections. In certain geographic locales, these pathogens, which have been typically associated with health care–associated infections, are disseminating into the community, posing a significant dilemma for clinicians treating community-onset infections. In this Concise Review, we summarize emerging trends in antimicrobial resistance. We also review the current knowledge on the detection, treatment, and prevention of infection with these organisms, with a focus on the carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli.

From the emergence of penicillin and methicillin resistance in _Staphylococcus aureus_ to vancomycin-resistant enterococci, we are now faced with the specter of resistant superbug gram-negative infections, some of which have become virtually untreatable.\n\n【27】Although resistant gram-positive infections have been of most concern, the spread of resistant gram-negative infections is currently the most pressing emerging issue in bacterial resistance. In this Concise Review, we present current knowledge with respect to the detection, treatment, and prevention of infection with these organisms, with a focus on the carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli (CPGNB). We also discuss emerging therapies and areas that need further efforts and research to stem the spread of antimicrobial resistance.\n\n【28】Why Should We Be Concerned?\n---------------------------\n\n【29】Antimicrobial resistance should concern clinicians for several important reasons. First, treatment options are limited and sometimes nonexistent. Among the Enterobacteriaceae (eg, _Escherichia coli, Klebsiella,_ and _Enterobacter_ ), the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) mediate resistance to the first- through fourth-generation cephalosporins. The more recently developed carbapenemases, such as _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases (KPCs) and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamases (NDMs), also hydrolyze carbapenems, the preferred agents of the β-lactam class when treating serious ESBL gram-negative infections. Both ESBL and CPGNB often exhibit multiclass resistance. Non-Enterobacteriaceae gram-negative bacilli (GNB), such as _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Acinetobacter baumannii_ , are significant nosocomial pathogens found in the environment and on medical equipment that frequently possess multiple-resistance mechanisms beyond β-lactamases. These pathogens are especially problematic in intensive care units, where multi- or even pan-drug resistance is commonly encountered.\n\n【30】Second, resistance has spread widely on several fronts. On a biologic level, genes that encode resistance are often carried on plasmids, which are shared easily among the GNB, in particular the Enterobacteriaceae. This exchange of resistance genes can occur within a host\n\n【31】无关删除-2:<u>*   Borgia S.\n*   Lastovetska O.\n*   Richardson D.\n\n【32】Outbreak of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae containing blaNDM-1, Ontario, Canada.\n\n【33】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin Infect Dis._ 2012; 55 : e109-e117</u></u>\n\n【34】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (87)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【35】and in the environment.\n\n【36】无关删除-2:<u>*   Walsh T.R.\n*   Weeks J.\n*   Livermore D.M.\n*   Toleman M.A.</u>\n\n【37】Dissemination of NDM-1 positive bacteria in the New Delhi environment and its implications for human health: an environmental point prevalence study.\n\n【38】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Lancet Infect Dis._ 2011; 11 : 355-362</u></u>\n\n【39】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (965)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【40】Gram-negative organisms, such as _E coli_ and _K pneumoniae,_ are important causes of community-onset and health care–associated infections, respectively, and these 2 species have been most frequently associated with ESBL and carbapenemase carriage.

A basic understanding, however, is necessary to appreciate the epidemiology, treatment options, and infection control implications. Several important definitions are reviewed in Table 1 . The Ambler classification system classifies β-lactamases into 4 groups (class A, B, C, and D) on the basis of their amino acid sequences and their active site 删除4:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【105】Table 1 Definitions of Common Terms Used to Describe Resistant Gram-Negative Bacilli\n\n| β-lactam antibiotics: | These antibiotics comprise the penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, which share the common basic chemical structure of a 4-member β-lactam ring. |\n| --- | --- |\n| β-lactamases: | These enzymes hydrolyze the β-lactam ring and inactivate the β-lactam class of antibiotics. |\n| Ambler classification: | This is a classification system for β-lactamases on the basis of their amino acid sequences and their active site residue. |\n| Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs): | These are broad-spectrum, Ambler class A β-lactamases, which hydrolyze the penicillins, and first- to fourth-generation cephalosporins, which are cefoxitin susceptible and are inhibited by the β-lactamase inhibitors (eg, clavulanate). |\n| Cephalosporinases: | ESBLs are technically cephalosporinases, but the term _cephalosporinase_ is generally reserved to describe Ambler class C AmpC β-lactamases, which are cefoxitin resistant, hydrolyze the penicillins and first to third-generation cephalosporins, and are not inhibited by the β-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanate. |\n| Carbapenemases: | These are broad-spectrum β-lactamases (usually Ambler class A, B, or D), which have the ability to hydrolyze carbapenems, in addition to the penicillins and also the first- to fourth-generation cephalosporins, although activity may vary depending on the exact type of carbapenemase. |\n| Carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli (CRGNB) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae vs carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli (CPGNB) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae: | CPGNB are most often CRGNB (susceptibility testing may yield rare isolates and may have low carbapenem minimum inhibitory concentrations); however, not all CRGNB are carbapenemase producers.

These enzymes are most commonly found in Enterobacteriaceae and are usually plasmid-borne. The ESBLs hydrolyze penicillins, first- through fourth-generation cephalosporins, and aztreonam but may be inhibited by β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combinations, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam. Cephamycins such as cefoxitin also retain susceptibility despite these enzymes. However, in serious ESBL infections (eg, bacteremia or high-inoculum infections), BLBLIs may not be reliable, making the existing combination products unsuitable; therefore, carbapenems are the β-lactams of choice. In addition to possessing the hydrolytic activity of ESBLs, KPCs also hydrolyze carbapenems. Few choices are left for treatment because other resistant determinants (eg, to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides) are almost invariably cocarried on plasmids. Among the aminoglycosides, however, gentamicin seems to retain the most activity against the KPC producers.\n\n【117】无关删除-2:<u>*   Munoz-Price L.S.\n*   Poirel L.\n*   Bonomo R.A.\n\n【118】Clinical epidemiology of the global expansion of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases.\n\n【119】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Lancet Infect Dis._ 2013; 13 : 785-796</u></u>\n\n【120】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1170)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【121】Class B enzymes are metallo-β-lactamases and examples include NDM, imipenem (IMP), and Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM). Metallo-β-lactamases hydrolyze penicillins, first- through fourth-generation cephalosporins, BLBLIs, and the carbapenems. Of interest, the monobactam aztreonam retains activity. However, because most isolates coproduce ESBLs, aztreonam is usually rendered ineffective.\n\n【122】The class C enzymes are the cephalosporinases or AmpC enzymes.

In some of these (eg, _Enterobacter, Serratia_ , and _Citrobacter_ ), AmpC can become induced during treatment with cephalosporins. Organisms initially testing susceptible to cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) may develop resistance during treatment with this class. This is an important point for clinicians to note and especially a problem with _Enterobacter_ species; one study with 213 isolates found that 38% possessed inducible AmpC.\n\n【123】无关删除-2:<u>*   Tamma P.D.\n*   Girdwood S.C.\n*   Gopaul R.\n\n【124】The use of cefepime for treating AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.\n\n【125】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin Infect Dis._ 2013; 57 : 781-788</u></u>\n\n【126】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (110)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【127】AmpCs are sometimes plasmid encoded and also inducible but sporadically found in other Enterobacteriaceae; one study in 70 sites and 25 US states found an incidence of plasmid-borne AmpC to be 4% in _E coli_ and 8.5% in _K pneumonia_ .\n\n【128】无关删除-2:<u>*   Alvarez M.\n*   Tran J.H.\n*   Chow N.\n*   Jacoby G.A.</u>\n\n【129】Epidemiology of conjugative plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases in the United States.\n\n【130】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Antimicrob Agents Chemother._ 2004; 48 : 533-537</u></u>\n\n【131】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (184)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【132】AmpCs hydrolyze the penicillins, first- to third-generation cephalosporins, BLBLIs, and aztreonam.

Isolates that are ESBL or AmpC producers when coupled with a porin loss may be resistant to carbapenems. Porins are protein channels that allow entry of solutes into the bacterial cell, including antibiotics. Resistance to carbapenems may also result from efflux pumps, which extrude antibiotics from the bacterial cell.\n\n【148】Why Are ESBL and CPGNB Often Resistant to Other (Non–β-Lactam) Drug Classes?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【149】Plasmids encoding β-lactamases often carry other antibiotic-resistance genes, for example, enzymes that modify antibiotic targets (eg, ribosomal RNA methylation conferring high-level aminoglycoside resistance), or antibiotics themselves (eg, acetyltransferases modifying quinolones and aminoglycosides).

Confirmation of ESBL or carbapenemase production typically comprises a phenotypic test (eg, a double disk diffusion test for ESBLs and the modified Hodge test, Carba NP test, or other inhibitor-based tests for carbapenemases) or a molecular test, which typically is a polymerase chain reaction assay for a specific resistance gene encoding the β-lactamase (eg, KPC and NDM).\n\n【169】无关删除-2:<u>*   Tzouvelekis L.S.\n*   Markogiannakis A.\n*   Psichogiou M.\n*   Tassios P.T.\n*   Daikos G.L.</u>\n\n【170】Carbapenemases in _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and other Enterobacteriaceae: an evolving crisis of global dimensions.\n\n【171】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin Microb Rev._ 2012; 25 : 682-707</u></u>\n\n【172】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (919)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【173】无关删除-2:<u>*   Vasoo S.\n*   Cunningham S.A.\n*   Kohner P.C.\n\n【174】Comparison of a novel, rapid chromogenic biochemical assay, the Carba NP test, with the modified Hodge test for detection of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli.\n\n【175】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Microbiol._ 2013; 51 : 3097-3101</u></u>\n\n【176】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (89)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【177】Identification of colonized patients is important as part of infection control because asymptomatic carriage is a reservoir for further propagation.

Expert consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for invasive or high-inoculum infections caused by ESBL and AmpC producers. For CPGNB, treatment options are even more limited. Often the polymyxin (colistin or polymyxin B), tigecycline, and sometimes select aminoglycosides are the only active agents 删除4:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>. The polymyxins are limited by nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity and have no activity against _Proteus, Providencia_ , _Morganella_ , and _Serratia_ . We have only started to understand how to optimize the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of these agents. Tigecycline has no activity against _Pseudomonas_ , _Proteus_ , _Providencia_ , and _Morganella._ In addition, it is a bacteriostatic agent, achieves poor serum and urine levels, and thus should not be used as monotherapy in bloodstream or urinary tract infections. Other legacy antimicrobials, such as oral fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin, can be used if found to be active, but their use is generally limited to lower urinary tract infections. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or the quinolones may also be used if these test susceptible, but this is uncommon. For the acutely ill or septic patient, empiric therapy with agents active against ESBL and CPGNB may have to be considered if the patient possesses appropriate risk factors; clinicians should also take into account the local epidemiology of ESBL and CPGNB in their area of practice. A local hospital antibiogram can be very helpful in this respect.

Although the climate for the development of novel, active agents against CPGNB has improved somewhat in recent years, and indeed several new agents are in the pipeline, these agents will most certainly not be a panacea. A holistic approach must be embraced, including continued health care professional education, attention to infection control, adoption of new technologies and algorithms in screening, diagnosing and interrupting the chain of infection, antimicrobial stewardship in both humans and animals, and greater regional and international collaboration.\n\n【261】无关删除-1:<u>Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------</u>\n\n【262】无关删除-1:<u>*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIwZjIxYzk1YmIyZTRmNjcxYWJjMzY4MWQ1ZWNjZWRmYiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDIyOTg5fQ.qkAS5JsvMkvpdwiqrQ28DXOUT1xeFx91RU11LIbCA\\_IJTQ3wCYjUAc2g2hzjSYFkjI8j-4NoIhDNK3fmanQB\\_7DDZowqRkK7hNNzi\\_e1zMleQlhx8e0sSEUU-AzAu4iXuqDmDiAcgT8PHpm8xq7i8V65Rogpt6gYBBkHcL8QFNec28NbPKwJ4w6TWdf-ayxydOPJqPJ4TdOJhkuiK6-wkC-0K0TROuqAadouyNKmbrwERDyDhiWpKhhtFPSHjJYLGnYUMK3P62dOzIacNmPyPdUP0x0WuL\\_5aMi\\_jIRpoqBvU5ENvEeSEQC6MdK4xbKfBHT28IXAjqJ9A5q64W6ALA\n\n【263】    Download .mp4 (30.56 MB)\n\n【264】    Help with .mp4 files\n\n【265】    Video 1</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Record abstraction was performed to select individuals with radiographic confirmation of rickets. Age- and sex-matched controls were identified for the evaluation of risk factors. The main outcome measure was radiographic evidence of rickets without identifiable inherited, genetic, or nonnutritional causes. Incidence rates were calculated using Rochester Epidemiology Project census data.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 768 children with eligible diagnostic codes, 23 had radiographic evidence of rickets; of these, 17 children had nutritional rickets. All 17 children were younger than 3 years, and 13 (76%) were of nonwhite race/ethnicity. Clinical presentation included poor growth (n=12), leg deformity (n=8), motor delay (n=5), leg pain (n=3), weakness (n=3), and hypocalcemia or tetany (n=2). The incidence of nutritional rickets in children younger than 3 years was 0, 2.2, 3.7, and 24.1 per 100,000 for the decades beginning in 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively ( _P_ \\=.003 for incidence trend). Nutritional rickets was associated with black race, breast-feeding, low birth weight, and stunted growth ( _P_ <.05 for all). Four of 13 patients (31%) who underwent 25-hydroxyvitamin D testing had values less than 10 ng/mL.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Nutritional rickets remains rare, but its incidence has dramatically increased since 2000. Not all cases of rickets can be attributed to vitamin D deficiency.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】25(OH)D ( 25-hydroxy-vitamin D ), REP ( Rochester Epidemiology Project )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Two months earlier he was hospitalized for weakness and was noted to have pronounced hypokalemia (potassium, 1.2 mEq/L). The patient's medical problems included coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, long-standing essential hypertension, and polymyalgia rheumatica. His medication was switched from hydrochlorothiazide to a potassium-sparing diuretic, and he was dismissed. Shortly thereafter, the patient felt so weak that he was unable to climb a flight of stairs without support and noticed great difficulty in rising from a squatting position. Over the past few months, his diabetes and blood pressure control had worsened considerably. His medications included glipizide, metformin, spironolactone, amiloride, atenolol, digoxin, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, and aspirin. The patient had been taking low-dose prednisone (5 mg/d) for polymyalgia rheumatica, but use of this drug had been discontinued 6 months previously.\n\n【1】*   1.\n\n【2】    **_Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?_**\n\n【3】    *   a.\n\n【4】        _Cushing syndrome_\n\n【5】    *   b.\n\n【6】        _Primary aldosteronism_\n\n【7】    *   c.\n\n【8】        _Familial periodic paralysis_\n\n【9】    *   d.\n\n【10】        _Thyrotoxicosis_\n\n【11】    *   e.\n\n【12】        _Bartter syndrome_\n\n【13】Cushing syndrome is the likely diagnosis in this patient.

Familial periodic paralysis is a rare disease that causes episodic muscle weakness associated with hypokalemia, and attacks are often precipitated by ingestion of a carbohydrate-rich meal. This patient's weakness was not episodic, and the initial manifestation of this disease at his age is unlikely. Also, hypertension and diabetes are not associated with this disorder. Thyrotoxicosis usually leads to weight loss (weight gain can occur rarely in some patients with markedly stimulated appetites). It can lead to worsening diabetes and is rarely associated with hypokalemia in the syndrome of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, in which weakness is episodic. Bartter syndrome can be a cause of unexplained hypokalemia, but patients are usually normotensive and do not have symptoms of weight gain and worsening diabetes.\n\n【19】On examination, our patient had many of the classic signs of Cushing syndrome, including central obesity, plethoric facies, prominent dorsocervical fat pad, marked proximal muscle weakness, and multiple wide purple abdominal striae. Admission laboratory tests revealed the following: hemoglobin, 13 g/dL; white blood cell count, 8.2 × 10  /L; platelet count, 193 × 10  /L; serum sodium, 143 mEq/L; serum potassium, 4.0 mEq/L; and serum creatinine, 1.5 mg/dL.\n\n【20】*   2.\n\n【21】    **_Which one of the following is the best test to screen for the suspected diagnosis in this patient?_**\n\n【22】    *   a.\n\n【23】        _Morning serum cortisol level_\n\n【24】    *   b.\n\n【25】        _Serum corticotropin level_\n\n【26】    *   c.\n\n【27】        _24-Hour urinary free cortisol level_\n\n【28】    *   d.\n\n【29】        _Overnight dexamethasone suppression test_\n\n【30】    *   e.\n\n【31】        _Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen_\n\n【32】The next essential step is to screen for Cushing syndrome with biochemical tests. Measurement of morning cortisol levels is not a useful screening test because in both healthy subjects and patients with Cushing syndrome, the secretion of cortisol increases and decreases episodically, leading to a considerable overlap of values between these groups. Thus, patients with Cushing syndrome (particularly mild disease) frequently have morning cortisol levels within the reference range. Measurement of corticotropin is also not a useful screening test because patients with pituitary-dependent Cushing disease have corticotropin levels that overlap with those in healthy subjects.\n\n【33】The most reliable screening test for Cushing syndrome is a 24-hour urinary free cortisol because it integrates serum free cortisol levels during the entire day. The upper limit of normal for our radioimmunoassay is 108 µg/ 24 h. A urinary free cortisol level greater than a 3- to 4fold elevation is considered highly suggestive of Cushing syndrome.\n\n【34】无关删除-2:<u>*   Boscaro M\n*   Barzon L\n*   Sonino N</u>\n\n【35】The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: atypical presentations and laboratory shortcomings.\n\n【36】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Intern Med._ 2000; 160 : 3045-3053</u></u>\n\n【37】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (63)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【38】The overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test may be used as a screening test if collection of 24-hour urinary free cortisol is not possible and suspicion of Cushing syndrome is low. However, the test has limitations because some patients with a corticotropin-secreting pituitary adenoma may suppress cortisol production and some pseudo-Cushing states may be resistant to suppression. Thus, the test is inappropriate when clinical suspicion of Cushing syndrome is high (as in our patient). The 1-mg overnight dexamethasone test is best used to rule out subclinical hypercortisolism in patients with adrenal incidentalomas.\n\n【39】Imaging studies cannot provide information about function and should not be used as a screening test for Cushing syndrome. Furthermore, the finding of an incidentaloma may lead to diagnostic confusion. As is true with many endocrine disorders, the general rule is to confirm the diagnosis biochemically before proceeding with localization studies.\n\n【40】Our patient's clinical presentation was highly suggestive of Cushing syndrome. His urinary free cortisol level was 874 µg/24 h. Thus, the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome was confirmed.\n\n【41】*   3.\n\n【42】    **_At this point in the patient's evaluation, which one of the following tests is most appropriate?_**\n\n【43】    *   a.\n\n【44】        _Serum corticotropin level_\n\n【45】    *   b.\n\n【46】        _Metyrapone test_\n\n【47】    *   c.\n\n【48】        _Inferior petrosal sinus sampling_\n\n【49】    *   d.\n\n【50】        _CT of the abdomen_\n\n【51】    *   e.\n\n【52】        _Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary gland_\n\n【53】The next step in evaluating this patient is to determine whether secretion of excess cortisol is corticotropin dependent (corticotropin-secreting pituitary adenoma or ectopic corticotropin-producing tumor) or corticotropin independent (primary adrenal disease). This so-called subtype classification is essential to guide further investigations and is best achieved by measurement of serum corticotropin. Patients with a primary adrenal cause of Cushing syndrome (15%) will have an undetectable corticotropin concentration (<5 pg/mL \\[immunoradiometric assay\\]) due to feedback of hypercortisolism at the pituitary gland. Patients with pituitary or ectopic disease will have a corticotropin level that is within the normal or high range.\n\n【54】Metyrapone blocks the conversion of 11-ß-deoxycortisol to cortisol. Therefore, the metyrapone test can assess the ability of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to respond to low cortisol levels. The test is not helpful in differentiating between corticotropin-dependent and corticotropin-independent disease.\n\n【55】Because we do not yet know whether this patient has corticotropin-dependent or corticotropin-independent disease, localizing studies such as inferior petrosal sampling, CT of the abdomen, and MRI of the pituitary gland are inappropriate at this time.\n\n【56】This patient's corticotropin level was 71 pg/mL (reference range, 10-60 pg/mL) and thus consistent with corticotropin-dependent disease.\n\n【57】*   4.\n\n【58】    **_Which one of the following will most accurately determine the source of corticotropin hypersecretion in this patient?_**\n\n【59】    *   a.\n\n【60】        _Degree of corticotropin elevation_\n\n【61】    *   b.\n\n【62】        _MRI of the pituitary gland_\n\n【63】    *   c.\n\n【64】        _MRI of the chest_\n\n【65】    *   d.\n\n【66】        _Inferior petrosal sinus sampling_\n\n【67】    *   e.\n\n【68】        _High-dose dexamethasone suppression test_\n\n【69】Once our patient was diagnosed with corticotropin-dependent disease, the next essential step was to determine the source of excess corticotropin secretion (pituitary vs ectopic disease).\n\n【70】Measurement of corticotropin, although useful in distinguishing adrenal from nonadrenal causes, does not reliably distinguish between pituitary microadenomas and ectopic corticotropin secretion. With use of the immunoradiometric assay, corticotropin levels in patients with pituitary- dependent disease tend to range from 10 to 200 pg/mL, whereas those with ectopic disease tend to have corticotropin values that range from 50 pg/mL to greater than 200 pg/ mL. Thus, overlap in corticotropin values between these 2 groups is considerable.\n\n【71】Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland should be performed in all patients with corticotropin- dependent disease in whom the source of corticotropin hypersecretion is unknown. However, the results of MRI can be misleading because most corticotropin-producing pituitary adenomas are smaller than 1 cm, and only 50% are visible on MRI. Furthermore, the presence of a pituitary incidentaloma may confuse the picture.

Inferior petrosal sinus sampling is indicated in patients with normal findings on MRI of the pituitary gland or those with a clinical presentation suggestive of ectopic disease. The test is based on the fact that pituitary venous blood drains into the inferior petrosal sinuses, and thus patients with a pituitary source of corticotropin will have a centralto-peripheral gradient in corticotropin concentration. A central-to-peripheral corticotropin gradient greater than 3fold after corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) administration is diagnostic of pituitary-dependent disease.\n\n【84】The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, once widely used to differentiate between pituitary-dependent disease and the ectopic corticotropin syndrome, is now considered of little use for the differentiation of corticotropin-dependent disease.\n\n【85】无关删除-2:<u>*   Aron DC\n*   Raff H\n*   Findling JW</u>\n\n【86】Effectiveness versus efficacy: the limited value in clinical practice of high dose dexamethasone suppression testing in the differential diagnosis of adrenocorticotropin-dependent Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【87】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Endocrinol Metab._ 1997; 82 : 1780-1785</u></u>\n\n【88】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【89】This is because up to 30% of corticotropin-secreting bronchial carcinoid tumors show suppression of cortisol production with use of traditional diagnostic criteria.\n\n【90】Our patient underwent MRI of the pituitary and chest, both of which showed normal findings. Abdominal CT also showed normal findings. The patient then underwent inferior petrosal sinus sampling (with CRH stimulation). This showed no substantial difference in corticotropin levels between petrosal sinus blood and the peripheral blood. The inferior petrosal sinus-peripheral ratio for corticotropin was 1.30, 1.32, 1.29, and 1.14 at baseline, 2, 5, and 10 minutes after CRH administration, respectively. A ratio less than 3 in our patient was consistent with ectopic disease.\n\n【91】*   5.\n\n【92】    **_At this time, which one of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient?_**\n\n【93】    *   a.\n\n【94】        _Bilateral adrenalectomy_\n\n【95】    *   b.\n\n【96】        _Repeated CT of the chest in 6 months_\n\n【97】    *   c.\n\n【98】        _Initiation of ketoconazole therapy_\n\n【99】    *   d.\n\n【100】        _Initiation of mitotane therapy_\n\n【101】    *   e.\n\n【102】        _Unilateral adrenalectomy_\n\n【103】This patient has severe Cushing syndrome, a debilitating and life-threatening disease. The ectopic source of corticotropin had not been detected. Therefore, immediate treatment is needed to resolve his hypercortisolism. The most appropriate management is bilateral adrenalectomy. Although the source of excess corticotropin production remains unknown, removal of the adrenal glands will prevent production of cortisol and hence further effects of hypercortisolism. Patients who undergo bilateral adrenalectomy are maintained on replacement glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. In patients with ectopic corticotropin secretion, the tumor may be undetectable at the time of investigation in approximately 35% but may be evident a few months or years later on a repeated imaging study. Therefore, it is important that patients with unlocalized ectopic disease undergo CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen at regular intervals.\n\n【104】Ketoconazole suppresses cortisol production by directly affecting adrenal gland steroidogenesis and is sometimes used as an interim agent to control hypercortisolism, particularly in patients with mild disease. Ketoconazole therapy in our patient would be unlikely to control his severe degree of hypercortisolism. Mitotane is an antineo- plastic agent that is often used in patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma. It can also be used in conjunction with ketoconazole in patients with severe Cushing syndrome who are not surgical candidates. Mitotane has severe adverse effects and was not considered appropriate management for this patient. Unilateral adrenalectomy would serve no purpose because the ectopic corticotropin production would still stimulate the remaining adrenal gland to produce excess cortisol.\n\n【105】The patient underwent bilateral adrenalectomy and was discharged home while taking corticosteroid therapy.\n\n【106】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【107】Evaluating Cushing syndrome can be a challenging task for a physician. Although the confirmation of Cushing syndrome in a patient with florid symptoms and signs may be relatively straightforward, the differentiation of mild Cushing syndrome from endogenous cortisol hypersecretion due to a pseudo-Cushing state may be difficult. Once the disorder is clinically suspected, accurate diagnosis relies on performing a logical sequence of the following diagnostic steps.\n\n【108】### Biochemical Screening and Confirmation of Cushing Syndrome and Exclusion of Pseudo-Cushing States\n\n【109】Conditions such as depression, infection, stress, and alcohol abuse (so-called pseudo-Cushing states) can be associated with elevated urinary free cortisol levels and lead to diagnostic confusion. Furthermore, approximately 10% to 15% of patients with Cushing syndrome in 1 study\n\n【110】无关删除-2:<u>*   Nieman LK\n*   Cutler Jr, GB</u>\n\n【111】The sensitivity of the urine free cortisol measurement as a screening test for Cushing's syndrome \\[abstract\\].\n\n【112】删除3:<u>_Endocr Soc Program Abstr._ 1990; 72 ( Abstract 822. ) : 230</u>\n\n【113】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【114】had at least 1 normal urinary free cortisol result from 4 collections. Therefore, clinical suspicion of Cushing syndrome with a negative urinary test mandates repeated urinary free cortisol measurement. Situations in which cortisol-binding globulin levels are elevated (eg, with estrogen- containing medications) can be associated with misleadingly elevated plasma cortisol values.\n\n【115】The low-dose dexamethasone test (0.5 mg 4 times daily for 2 days) has been used traditionally to confirm the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. The test can be used to assess for autonomous Cortisol hypersecretion when the urinary free Cortisol level is elevated less than 3-fold. Unfortunately, this test has limitations; some patients with a corticotropin-secreting pituitary adenoma may suppress cortisol production, and some pseudo-Cushing states may be resistant to suppression. Therefore, the results of the test should be interpreted in light of the index of clinical suspicion of Cushing syndrome. If the diagnosis remains unclear, it is appropriate to reevaluate the patient in a few months.\n\n【116】### Subtype Classification Into Corticotropin-Dependent and Corticotropin-Independent Disease\n\n【117】Once the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is confirmed, the next step is to determine whether the hypercortisolemia is corticotropin dependent or corticotropin independent. As discussed previously, a normal to elevated serum corticotropin level in a patient with Cushing syndrome suggests corticotropin-driven hypercortisolemia, and suppressed corticotropin levels indicate primary adrenal disease. This distinction is critical because it determines subsequent investigation and management.\n\n【118】### Differentiation Between Pituitary and Ectopic Sources of Corticotropin in Corticotropin-Dependent Disease\n\n【119】Often, the most challenging part of the evaluation of Cushing syndrome is differentiation between pituitary-dependent disease and ectopic corticotropin disorders. Pituitary adenomas account for most corticotropin-dependent causes of Cushing syndrome (85%); the rest are due to ectopic sources of corticotropin secretion (including bronchial carcinoid tumors, small cell carcinoma of the lung, islet cell carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma). The clinical history may give a clue to the source of corticotropin production. Pituitary-dependent disease is 5 times more common in women and usually occurs between the third and fifth decades of life. These patients often present with slow development of symptoms and signs during the course of a few years. The rapid onset of symptoms and signs of Cushing syndrome associated with hypokalemia is more consistent with an ectopic source of corticotropin. However, patients with ectopic tumors (particularly bronchial carcinoid tumors) can present with insidious onset of disease and a clinical picture indistinguishable from pituitary-dependent disease. In some patients an ectopic tumor may be recognized before onset of Cushing syndrome.\n\n【120】The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is not useful for distinguishing between pituitary and ectopic sources of corticotropin secretion. At least 30% of patients with corticotropin-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors will suppress plasma and urinary steroids to less than 50% of baseline values during high-dose dexamethasone suppression, and as many as 20% to 30% of patients with pituitary-dependent disease (particularly pituitary macro- adenomas) fail to suppress urinary free cortisol to less than 50%. Thus, the diagnostic accuracy of the high-dose dexa- methasone test is only 70% to 80%.\n\n【121】Inferior petrosal sinus sampling is currently the most accurate test to differentiate between pituitary and ectopic corticotropin-driven Cushing syndrome but is not readily available at all medical centers. Misleading results may be obtained when catheter placement is incorrect or when hypercortisolism is not present at the time of the procedure because of cyclic secretion of corticotropin. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling should be considered in the patient with documented hypercortisolism and normal findings on MRI of the pituitary gland. Of note, the test is invasive and may be associated with pronounced risks, including deep venous thrombosis and neurologic complications. Therefore, the procedure should not be considered routine and should be performed only by an experienced operator after careful review of the patient's clinical presentation and biochemical profile.\n\n【122】For appropriate evaluation, patients suspected of having Cushing syndrome need to undergo various tests, none of which is 100% accurate in confirming the presence or cause of the disorder. Each individual test has limitations. This knowledge will help clinicians avoid potential pitfalls in test interpretation that otherwise could lead to unnecessary further testing, inaccurate diagnosis, and inappropriate therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. The 2007 data set (N=211,410) served as the training set, and the 2008 data set (N=257,385) served as the validation set.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In the training set, 3825 patients (1.8%) experienced postoperative pneumonia. Patients who experienced postoperative pneumonia had a significantly higher 30-day mortality (17.0% vs 1.5%; _P_ <.001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, 7 preoperative predictors of postoperative pneumonia were identified: age, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dependent functional status, preoperative sepsis, smoking before operation, and type of operation. The risk model based on the training data set was subsequently validated on the validation data set, with model performance being very similar (C statistic: 0.860 and 0.855, respectively). The high C statistic indicates excellent predictive performance. The risk model was used to develop an interactive risk calculator.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Preoperative variables associated with an increased risk of postoperative pneumonia include age, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dependent functional status, preoperative sepsis, smoking before operation, and type of operation. The validated risk calculator provides a risk estimate for postoperative pneumonia and is anticipated to aid in surgical decision making and informed patient consent.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ASA ( American Society of Anesthesiologists ), COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ), NSQIP ( National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ), VA ( Veterans Affairs )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

All patients were covered with a carbon-fiber resistive warming blanket and a wool blanket, but the warming blanket was activated only in those assigned to resistive heating. Core (tympanic membrane) and oral temperatures, heart rate, pain, fear, and overall satisfaction of patients were compared between the 2 groups on arrival at a hospital.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Hypothermia was noted in 80 patients at the time of rescue. Mean initial core temperatures were 35.4°C (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 35.2°C-35.6°C) in the patients who received passive warming and 35.3°C (95% CI, 35.1°C-35.5°C) in those who received resistive heating. From the time of rescue until arrival at the hospital, mean core temperature decreased 0.4°C/h (95% CI, 0.3°C/h-0.5°C/h) with passive warming, whereas it increased 0.8°C/h (95% CI, 0.7°C/h-0.9°C/h) with resistive heating. Oral and tympanic membrane temperatures were similar. Mean heart rate decreased 23 beats/min in those assigned to resistive heating but remained unchanged in those assigned to passive warming. Patients in the resistive heating group felt warmer, had less pain and anxiety, and overall were more satisfied with their care.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Oral temperatures are sufficiently accurate for field use. Hypothermia is common even in persons with minor trauma. Resistive heating during transport augments thermal comfort, increases core temperature, reduces pain and anxiety, and improves overall patient satisfaction.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing the use of melphalan in the elderly with use in other age groups.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【31】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【32】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【33】*   Bone marrow suppression or\n*   Leukopenia (low white blood cells in the blood) or\n*   Thrombocytopenia (low platelets in the blood)—May make these conditions worse.\n\n【34】*   Chickenpox, including recent exposure or\n*   Herpes zoster (shingles)—May increase the risk of severe disease in other parts of the body.\n\n【35】*   Gout, history of or\n*   Kidney stones, history of—May increase uric acid levels, which can cause gout or kidney stones.\n\n【36】*   Infection—May decrease your body's ability to fight an infection.\n\n【37】*   Kidney disease—Use with caution. The effects of this medicine may be increased because of slower removal from the body.\n\n【38】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【39】Take melphalan only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more or less of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. The exact amount of medicine you need has been carefully worked out. Taking too much may increase the chance of side effects, while taking too little may not improve your condition.\n\n【40】Melphalan is sometimes given together with certain other medicines. If you are using a combination of medicines, it is important that you receive each one at the proper time. If you are taking some of these medicines by mouth, ask your health care professional to help you plan a way to remember to take your medicine at the right times.\n\n【41】While you are using melphalan, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids so that you will pass more urine. This will help prevent kidney problems and keep your kidneys working well.\n\n【42】This medicine may cause nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. However, it is very important that you continue to receive the medicine, even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your health care professional for ways to lessen these effects.\n\n【43】If you vomit shortly after taking a dose of melphalan, check with your doctor. You will be told whether to take the dose again or to wait until the next scheduled dose.\n\n【44】### Dosing\n\n【45】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【46】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【47】### Missed Dose\n\n【48】If you miss a dose of this medicine, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【49】### Storage\n\n【50】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【51】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【52】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【53】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【54】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【55】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【56】While you are being treated with melphalan, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Melphalan may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take or should not have taken oral polio vaccine within the last several months since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid other persons who have taken oral polio vaccine. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.\n\n【57】Melphalan can lower the number of white blood cells in your blood temporarily, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【58】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【59】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【60】Along with their needed effects, medicines like melphalan can sometimes cause unwanted effects such as blood problems and other side effects. These and others are described below. Also, because of the way these medicines act on the body, there is a chance that they might cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used. These delayed effects may include certain types of cancer, such as leukemia. Discuss these possible effects with your doctor.\n\n【61】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【62】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【63】#### Less common\n\n【64】1.  Black, tarry stools\n2.  blood in urine or stools\n3.  cough or hoarseness, accompanied by fever or chills\n4.  fast or irregular heart beat\n5.  fever or chills\n6.  lower back or side pain, accompanied by fever or chills\n7.  painful or difficult urination, accompanied by fever or chills\n8.  pinpoint red spots on skin\n9.  shortness of breath\n10.  skin rash or itching (sudden)\n11.  troubled breathing\n12.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n\n【65】#### Rare\n\n【66】1.

{"seq_id": "413e1934-2282-4b6e-bf0e-9c163c579c72", "title": "Lead poisoning", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Lead poisoning occurs when lead builds up in the body, often over months or years. Even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems. Children younger than 6 years are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal.\n\n【2】Lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust in older buildings are common sources of lead poisoning in children. Other sources include contaminated air, water and soil. Adults who work with batteries, do home renovations or work in auto repair shops also might be exposed to lead.\n\n【3】There is treatment for lead poisoning, but taking some simple precautions can help protect you and your family from lead exposure before harm is done.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Initially, lead poisoning can be hard to detect — even people who seem healthy can have high blood levels of lead. Signs and symptoms usually don't appear until dangerous amounts have accumulated.\n\n【6】### Lead poisoning symptoms in children\n\n【7】Signs and symptoms of lead poisoning in children include:\n\n【8】*   Developmental delay\n*   Learning difficulties\n*   Irritability\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Weight loss\n*   Sluggishness and fatigue\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Vomiting\n*   Constipation\n*   Hearing loss\n*   Seizures\n*   Eating things, such as paint chips, that aren't food (pica)\n\n【9】### Lead poisoning symptoms in newborns\n\n【10】Babies exposed to lead before birth might:\n\n【11】*   Be born prematurely\n*   Have lower birth weight\n*   Have slowed growth\n\n【12】### Lead poisoning symptoms in adults\n\n【13】Although children are primarily at risk, lead poisoning is also dangerous for adults. Signs and symptoms in adults might include:\n\n【14】*   High blood pressure\n*   Joint and muscle pain\n*   Difficulties with memory or concentration\n*   Headache\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Mood disorders\n*   Reduced sperm count and abnormal sperm\n*   Miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth in pregnant women\n\n【15】Causes\n------\n\n【16】Lead is a metal that occurs naturally in the earth's crust, but human activity — mining, burning fossil fuels and manufacturing — has caused it to become more widespread. Lead was also once used in paint and gasoline and is still used in batteries, solder, pipes, pottery, roofing materials and some cosmetics.\n\n【17】### Lead in paint\n\n【18】Lead-based paints for homes, children's toys and household furniture have been banned in the United States since 1978. But lead-based paint is still on walls and woodwork in many older homes and apartments. Most lead poisoning in children results from eating chips of deteriorating lead-based paint.\n\n【19】### Water pipes and imported canned goods\n\n【20】Lead pipes, brass plumbing fixtures and copper pipes soldered with lead can release lead particles into tap water. Lead solder in food cans, banned in the United States, is still used in some countries.\n\n【21】### Other sources of lead exposure\n\n【22】Lead sometimes can also be found in:\n\n【23】*   **Soil.** Lead particles from leaded gasoline or paint settle on soil and can last years. Lead-contaminated soil is still a major problem around highways and in some urban settings. Some soil close to walls of older houses contains lead.\n*   **Household dust.** Household dust can contain lead from lead paint chips or from contaminated soil brought in from outside.\n*   **Pottery.** Glazes found on some ceramics, china and porcelain can contain lead that can leach into food served or stored in the pottery.\n*   **Toys.** Lead is sometimes found in toys and other products produced abroad.\n*   **Cosmetics.** Tiro, an eye cosmetic from Nigeria, has been linked to lead poisoning. Kohl is another eye makeup that may contain lead.\n*   **Herbal or folk remedies.** Lead poisoning has been linked to greta and azarcon, traditional Hispanic medicines, as well as some from India, China and other countries.\n*   **Mexican candy.** Tamarind, an ingredient used in some candies made in Mexico, might contain lead.\n*   **Lead bullets.** Time spent at firing ranges can lead to exposure.\n*   **Occupations.** People are exposed to lead and can bring it home on their clothes when they work in auto repair, mining, pipe fitting, battery manufacturing, painting, construction and certain other fields.\n\n【24】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【25】Factors that may increase your risk of lead poisoning include:\n\n【26】*   **Age.** Infants and young children are more likely to be exposed to lead than are older children. They might chew paint that flakes off walls and woodwork, and their hands can be contaminated with lead dust. Young children also absorb lead more easily, and it's more harmful for them than it is for adults and older children.\n*   **Living in an older home.** Although the use of lead-based paints has been banned since the 1970s, older homes and buildings often retain remnants of this paint. People renovating an older home are at even higher risk.\n*   **Certain hobbies.** Making stained glass and some jewelry requires the use of lead solder. Refinishing old furniture might put you in contact with layers of lead paint.\n*   **Living in developing countries.** Developing countries often have less strict rules regarding exposure to lead than do developed countries. American families who adopt a child from another country might want to have the child's blood tested for lead poisoning. Immigrant and refugee children also should be tested.\n\n【27】Lead can harm an unborn child. If you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy, be especially careful to avoid exposure to lead.\n\n【28】Complications\n-------------\n\n【29】Exposure to even low levels of lead can cause damage over time, especially in children. The greatest risk is to brain development, where irreversible damage can occur. Higher levels can damage the kidneys and nervous system in both children and adults. Very high lead levels may cause seizures, unconsciousness and death.\n\n【30】Prevention\n----------\n\n【31】Simple measures can help protect you and your family from lead poisoning:\n\n【32】*   **Wash hands and toys.** To help reduce hand-to-mouth transfer of contaminated dust or soil, wash your children's hands after outdoor play, before eating and at bedtime. Wash their toys regularly.\n*   **Clean dusty surfaces.** Clean your floors with a wet mop and wipe furniture, windowsills and other dusty surfaces with a damp cloth.\n*   **Remove shoes before entering the house.** This will help keep lead-based soil outside.\n*   **Run cold water.** If you have older plumbing containing lead pipes or fittings, run your cold water for at least a minute before using. Don't use hot tap water to make baby formula or for cooking.\n*   **Prevent children from playing on soil.** Provide them with a sandbox that's covered when not in use. Plant grass or cover bare soil with mulch.\n*   **Eat a healthy diet.** Regular meals and good nutrition might help lower lead absorption. Children especially need enough calcium, vitamin C and iron in their diets to help keep lead from being absorbed.\n*   **Keep your home well maintained.** If your home has lead-based paint, check regularly for peeling paint and fix problems promptly. Try not to sand, which generates dust particles that contain lead.\n\n【33】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

As a result, the uterus slips down into or protrudes out of the vagina.\n\n【2】Uterine prolapse most often affects people after menopause who've had one or more vaginal deliveries.\n\n【3】Mild uterine prolapse usually doesn't require treatment. But uterine prolapse that causes discomfort or disrupts daily life might benefit from treatment.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Mild uterine prolapse is common after childbirth. It generally doesn't cause symptoms. Symptoms of moderate to severe uterine prolapse include:\n\n【6】*   Seeing or feeling tissue bulge out of the vagina\n*   Feeling heaviness or pulling in the pelvis\n*   Feeling like the bladder doesn't empty all the way when you use the bathroom\n*   Problems with leaking urine, also called incontinence\n*   Trouble having a bowel movement and needing to press the vagina with your fingers to help have a bowel movement\n*   Feeling as if you're sitting on a small ball\n*   Feeling as if you have vaginal tissue rubbing on clothing\n*   Pressure or discomfort in the pelvis or low back\n*   Sexual concerns, such as feeling as though the vaginal tissue is loose\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】See a health care provider to talk about treatment options if symptoms of uterine prolapse bother you and keep you from doing daily activities.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Uterine prolapse results from the weakening of pelvic muscles and supportive tissues. Causes of weakened pelvic muscles and tissues include:\n\n【11】*   Vaginal delivery\n*   Age at first delivery (older women are at higher risk of pelvic floor injuries compared with younger women)\n*   Difficult labor and delivery or trauma during childbirth\n*   Delivery of a large baby\n*   Being overweight\n*   Lower estrogen level after menopause\n*   Chronic constipation or straining with bowel movements\n*   Chronic cough or bronchitis\n*   Repeated heavy lifting\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】Factors that can increase the risk of uterine prolapse include:\n\n【14】*   Having one or more vaginal births\n*   Being older when you have your first baby\n*   Giving birth to a large baby\n*   Aging\n*   Obesity\n*   Prior pelvic surgery\n*   Chronic constipation or often straining during bowel movements\n*   Family history of weak connective tissue\n*   Being Hispanic or white\n*   Chronic coughing, such as from smoking\n\n【15】Complications\n-------------\n\n【16】Uterine prolapse often happens with prolapse of other pelvic organs. These types of prolapse can also happen:\n\n【17】*   **Anterior prolapse.** Anterior prolapse results from weak connective tissue between the bladder and roof of the vagina. It can cause the bladder to bulge into the vagina. This is called a cystocele or prolapsed bladder.\n*   **Posterior vaginal prolapse.** Weak connective tissue between the rectum and the floor of the vagina can cause the rectum to bulge into the vagina. This might cause difficulty with bowel movements. Posterior vaginal prolapse is also called a rectocele.\n\n【18】Prevention\n----------\n\n【19】To reduce the risk of uterine prolapse, try to:\n\n【20】*   **Prevent constipation.** Drink plenty of fluids and eat high-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables, beans and whole-grains.\n*   **Avoid heavy lifting.** If you have to lift something heavy, do it correctly. Correct lifting uses the legs instead of the waist or back.\n*   **Control coughing.** Get treatment for a chronic cough or bronchitis. Don't smoke.\n*   **Avoid weight gain.** Talk with your doctor about your ideal weight and get advice on how to lose weight, if you need to.\n\n【21】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Treatments were varenicline 1 mg twice daily, bupropion sustained-release 150 mg twice daily, and nicotine patch 21 mg once daily with tapering (12-week treatment, 12-week nontreatment follow-up), with incidence, time to onset, and duration of frequently reported AEs (≥5% of participants in any treatment group) measured. Risk differences for AEs for varenicline and bupropion vs nicotine patch were compared.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Across frequently reported AEs, nausea, insomnia, abnormal dreams, anxiety, irritability, dry mouth, fatigue, and application site pruritus differed significantly in active treatment vs placebo groups. Risk differences were as follows: for nausea with varenicline vs nicotine patch, 15.50% (95% CI, 13.20% to 17.80%); for insomnia with bupropion vs nicotine patch, 2.58% (CI, 0.65% to 4.51%); and for abnormal dreams with varenicline and bupropion vs nicotine patch, –2.49% (CI, –4.35% to –0.64%) and –5.60% (CI, –7.27% to –3.93%), respectively. Frequently reported AEs of severe intensity and treatment discontinuation were experienced by less than 1.5% and less than 3% of participants across all groups, respectively.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Active treatments were well tolerated with comparable AE profiles. Most AEs are not clinically important, and prescribers can reassure patients that those experienced will be manageable.\n\n【9】### Trial Registration\n\n【10】Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01456936.\n\n【11】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【12】AE ( adverse event ), EAGLES ( Evaluating Adverse Events in a Global Smoking Cessation Study ), FDA ( US Food and Drug Administration ), HCP ( health care professional ), NRT ( nicotine replacement therapy )\n\n【13】Global deaths due to tobacco-related diseases exceed 7 million per year.\n\n【14】World Health Organization  \nTobacco.\n\n【15】删除3:<u>https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco</u>\n\n【16】删除6:<u>Date accessed: February 4, 2019</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【18】The use of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved smoking cessation pharmacotherapies can markedly increase the chance of a successful quit attempt\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>*   Cahill K.\n*   Lindson-Hawley N.\n*   Thomas K.H.\n*   Fanshawe T.R.\n*   Lancaster T.</u>\n\n【20】Nicotine receptor partial agonists for smoking cessation.\n\n【21】删除3:<u>_Cochrane Database Syst Rev._ 2016; 2016 : CD006103</u>\n\n【22】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【23】删除7:<u>;</u> however, most quit attempts do not involve an approved treatment.\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>*   Caraballo R.S.\n*   Shafer P.R.\n*   Patel D.\n*   Davis K.C.\n*   McAfee T.A.</u>\n\n【25】无关删除-2:<u>Quit methods used by US adult cigarette smokers, 2014-2016.</u>\n\n【26】删除3:<u>_Prev Chronic Dis._ 2017; 14 : E32</u>\n\n【27】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (114)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【28】Approved therapies include nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), such as gum, lozenge, patch, inhalers, and nasal spray, as well as the non-nicotine medications varenicline and bupropion.\n\n【29】US Food & Drug Administration  \nWant to quit smoking?

The study included a 12-week treatment phase and a 12-week nontreatment follow-up.\n\n【118】EAGLES captured all volunteered, observed, and solicited AEs, regardless of whether the study site physician assessed them to be causally related to study medications. AE reporting was conducted at up to 15 face-to-face clinic visits and 11 telephone visits during the 24-week trial. This post hoc analysis reports treatment-emergent AEs, which included all AEs reported from the date of first dosing of study drug until the last date of dosing of study drug plus 30 days. The EAGLES population evaluated in this analysis consisted of as-treated participants, that is, those who received at least 1 partial dose of study drug (N=8058).\n\n【119】### Statistical Analyses\n\n【120】A summary of all AEs in the EAGLES as-treated population as well as of AEs stratified by nonpsychiatric/psychiatric cohort was performed. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). Incidence tables were prepared for all reported AEs and for the most frequently reported AEs, defined as those reported by 5% or more of participants in any treatment group, sorted by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 21.0 preferred terms. Counts were tabulated of participants reporting the first occurrence of each frequently reported AE at defined levels of intensity: mild, no interference with daily functioning; moderate, some interference with daily functioning; or severe, significant interference with daily functioning. The timing of all AEs on a given day was not recorded; therefore, if a participant had experienced the same AE (ie, as defined by the preferred term) multiple times with the same onset dates, the occurrence with the worst intensity was counted as the first occurrence. If all had the same intensity, the occurrence with the latest end date was considered to be the first occurrence.\n\n【121】To focus on AEs with greatest clinical relevance, additional statistical testing was performed on each frequently reported AE to determine whether an event rate in any active treatment group differed significantly from placebo. Pairwise comparisons of active treatment vs placebo were constructed. By use of a _χ_  test in conjunction with Bonferroni adjustment, an AE would be selected for further analyses if 1 or more adjusted _P_ values were less than .05.\n\n【122】For each frequently reported AE, estimated risk differences were calculated to compare incidence in varenicline or bupropion vs NRT treatment groups. Statistical comparison of the active treatments (varenicline and bupropion) vs the EAGLES active control (NRT patch), rather than vs placebo, was considered to provide greatest clinical relevance because these approved pharmacotherapies would typically be compared in general practice. Risk differences were calculated on the basis of a general linear model with terms for treatment, psychiatric/nonpsychiatric cohort, region (United States or non–United States), and treatment by psychiatric/nonpsychiatric cohort interaction. For any impact of the psychiatric cohort on the risk differences of the combined population to be taken into consideration, separate cohort analyses were also conducted for comparison.\n\n【123】Analyses of time to onset and duration of first occurrence of frequently reported AEs were presented using schematic box and whisker plots and included all as-treated patients.\n\n【124】### Ethics\n\n【125】EAGLES was reviewed and approved by each site’s Institutional Review Board or ethics committee and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All participants provided written, informed consent.\n\n【126】Results\n-------\n\n【127】### Study Population\n\n【128】The EAGLES study randomized 8144 smokers between November 30, 2011, and January 13, 2015, of whom 8058 participants received a study drug as follows: varenicline, n=2016; bupropion, n=2006; NRT, n=2022; and placebo, n=2014 删除4:<u>( Figure )</u>.

Pairwise comparisons of active treatment vs placebo were constructed. By use of a _χ_  test in conjunction with Bonferroni adjustment, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache were eliminated from further analyses because of less noteworthy difference in incidence between treatment groups.\n\n【160】At least 1 frequently reported AE was experienced by 3805 of 8058 (47.2%) participants 删除4:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. However, the number of participants reporting 1 or more frequently reported AE of severe intensity was low (84/8058 \\[1.0%\\]), and the overall incidence was similar across the active treatment groups (range, 0.7%-1.3%).

Whereas median time to onset of first occurrence of nausea was similar across active treatment groups and placebo (range, 8-10 days), varenicline was associated with the longest median duration of nausea (13 days) compared with bupropion, NRT, and placebo (6 or 7 days). Participants reported abnormal dreams approximately 9 days after starting any active treatment or placebo, which continued for the longest duration in those who received varenicline (median, 41 days). The median time to onset of first occurrence of insomnia was shortest in bupropion-treated participants (6 days) compared with 12 days for varenicline and NRT and 17 days for participants who received placebo; however, duration of first occurrence of insomnia was similar across all treatments and placebo. Participants who reported first occurrence of application site pruritus with NRT reported a median duration of 40 days.\n\n【195】The median time to onset of first occurrence of anxiety was shortest for bupropion-treated participants (12 days), 25 days for varenicline and NRT, and 23 days for placebo; however, median duration of first occurrence of anxiety was similar across all active treatments and placebo (range, 11-15 days). Likewise, time to onset and duration of first occurrence of irritability were similar across all active treatments and placebo.\n\n【196】Discussion\n----------\n\n【197】The results of this post hoc analysis of EAGLES safety data indicate that most frequently reported AEs were of mild intensity, and the overall incidence of AEs of severe intensity was less than 1.5% across all active treatments and placebo. AEs associated with FDA-approved smoking cessation pharmacotherapies have been documented. The results of the current analyses with regard to the most frequently reported AEs for each pharmacotherapy and their perceived intensities are consistent with published findings for varenicline, NRT, and bupropion.\n\n【198】无关删除-2:<u>*   Cahill K.\n*   Lindson-Hawley N.\n*   Thomas K.H.\n*   Fanshawe T.R.\n*   Lancaster T.</u>\n\n【199】Nicotine receptor partial agonists for smoking cessation.\n\n【200】删除3:<u>_Cochrane Database Syst Rev._ 2016; 2016 : CD006103</u>\n\n【201】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【202】无关删除-2:<u>*   Mills E.J.\n*   Wu P.\n*   Lockhart I.\n*   Wilson K.\n*   Ebbert J.O.</u>\n\n【203】Adverse events associated with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation.

Overall, the median time to onset for the most frequently reported AEs was 5 days or more after starting therapy, whereas median duration was 41 days or less.\n\n【211】We observed that nausea was the most frequently reported AE in participants who received varenicline, with median onset of about 1 to 2 weeks after the start of treatment and median duration of about 2 weeks. Insomnia was the most frequently reported AE in participants who received bupropion, with median onset about 6 days after start of treatment; median duration was approximately 2 to 3 weeks. Participants who received NRT most frequently reported abnormal dreams, with median onset 1 to 2 weeks after start of treatment and median duration of about 4 weeks.\n\n【212】Quitting smoking without the aid of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies is associated with nicotine withdrawal symptoms, onset of which commonly occurs within 4 to 24 hours after nicotine withdrawal, with greatest intensity during the first week.\n\n【213】无关删除-2:<u>*   McLaughlin I.\n*   Dani J.A.\n*   De Biasi M.</u>\n\n【214】Nicotine withdrawal.\n\n【215】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Curr Top Behav Neurosci._ 2015; 24 : 99-123</u></u>\n\n【216】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (94)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【217】The target quit date for all patients was day 8 in this study.

Therefore, a strength of this analysis is that the participant population is likely to provide an accurate representation of smokers seen in general medical practice, and it confirms that AEs associated with each of the FDA-approved pharmacotherapies are generally of mild intensity and tolerable.\n\n【233】All 3 classes of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies result in a similar AE experience and do not appreciably differ in rates of severe AEs. Notably, of the 3 smoking cessation therapies included in EAGLES, only NRT patch is currently available as an over-the-counter therapy. Given the same limited indication for NRT and varenicline (ie, smoking cessation) and in the absence of major differences in AEs reported after treatment with varenicline or NRT, these analyses along with previously reported efficacy data suggest that varenicline may be a suitable candidate for over-the-counter designation.\n\n【234】无关删除-2:<u>*   Leischow S.J.</u>\n\n【235】Increasing smoking cessation in the United States: expanding the availability of over-the-counter medications.\n\n【236】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 2019; 321 : 541-542</u></u>\n\n【237】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (5)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【238】Among the most frequently reported AEs, 2 were categorized as neuropsychiatric: anxiety and irritability.

This level of support is likely to be greater than that provided in a real-world setting.

Episodes can last for hours or days and alternate with symptom-free periods. Episodes are similar, meaning that they tend to start at the same time of day, last the same length of time, and occur with the same symptoms and intensity.\n\n【2】Cyclic vomiting syndrome occurs in all age groups, though it often begins in children around 3 to 7 years old. Although it's more common in children, the number of cases diagnosed in adults is increasing.\n\n【3】The syndrome is difficult to diagnose because vomiting is a symptom of many disorders. Treatment often involves lifestyle changes to help prevent the events that can trigger vomiting episodes. Medications, including anti-nausea and migraine therapies, may help lessen symptoms.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The symptoms of cyclic vomiting syndrome often begin in the morning. Signs and symptoms include:\n\n【6】*   Three or more recurrent episodes of vomiting that start around the same time and last for a similar length of time\n*   Varying intervals of generally normal health without nausea between episodes\n*   Intense nausea and sweating before an episode starts\n\n【7】Other signs and symptoms during a vomiting episode may include:\n\n【8】*   Abdominal pain\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Dizziness\n*   Sensitivity to light\n*   Headache\n*   Retching or gagging\n\n【9】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【10】Call your doctor if you see blood in your or your child's vomit.\n\n【11】Continued vomiting may cause severe dehydration that can be life-threatening. Call your doctor if you or your child is showing symptoms of dehydration, such as:\n\n【12】*   Excess thirst or dry mouth\n*   Less urination\n*   Dry skin\n*   Sunken eyes or cheeks\n*   No tears when crying\n*   Exhaustion and listlessness\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】The underlying cause of cyclic vomiting syndrome is unknown. Some possible causes include genes, digestive difficulties, nervous system problems and hormone imbalances. Specific bouts of vomiting may be triggered by:\n\n【15】*   Colds, allergies or sinus problems\n*   Emotional stress or excitement, especially in children\n*   Anxiety or panic attacks, especially in adults\n*   Certain foods and drinks, such as alcohol, caffeine, chocolate or cheese\n*   Overeating, eating right before going to bed or fasting\n*   Hot weather\n*   Physical exhaustion\n*   Exercising too much\n*   Menstruation\n*   Motion sickness\n\n【16】Identifying the triggers for vomiting episodes may help with managing cyclic vomiting syndrome.\n\n【17】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【18】The relationship between migraines and cyclic vomiting syndrome isn't clear. But many children with cyclic vomiting syndrome have a family history of migraines or have migraines themselves when they get older. In adults, cyclic vomiting syndrome is also associated with a personal or family history of migraines.\n\n【19】Chronic use of marijuana (Cannabis sativa) also has been associated with cyclic vomiting syndrome because some people use marijuana to relieve their nausea. However, chronic marijuana use can lead to a condition called cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, which typically leads to persistent vomiting without normal intervening periods. People with this syndrome often demonstrate frequent showering or bathing behavior.\n\n【20】Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome can be confused with cyclic vomiting syndrome. To rule out cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, you need to stop using marijuana for at least one to two weeks to see if vomiting lessens. If it doesn't, your doctor will continue testing for cyclic vomiting syndrome.\n\n【21】Complications\n-------------\n\n【22】Cyclic vomiting syndrome can cause these complications:\n\n【23】*   **Dehydration.** Excessive vomiting causes the body to lose water quickly. Severe cases of dehydration may need to be treated in the hospital.\n*   **Injury to the food tube.** The stomach acid that comes up with the vomit can damage the tube that connects the mouth and stomach (esophagus). Sometimes the esophagus becomes so irritated it bleeds.\n*   **Tooth decay.** The acid in vomit can corrode tooth enamel.\n\n【24】Prevention\n----------\n\n【25】Many people know what triggers their cyclic vomiting episodes. Avoiding those triggers can reduce the frequency of episodes. While you may feel well between episodes, it's very important to take medications as prescribed by your doctor.\n\n【26】If episodes occur more than once a month or require hospitalization, your doctor may recommend preventive medicine, such as amitriptyline, propranolol (Inderal), cyproheptadine and topiramate.\n\n【27】Lifestyle changes also may help, including:\n\n【28】*   Getting adequate sleep\n*   For children, downplaying the importance of upcoming events because excitement can be a trigger\n*   Avoiding trigger foods, such as alcohol, caffeine, cheese and chocolate\n*   Eating small meals and low-fat snacks daily at regular times\n\n【29】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Adrenal glands produce hormones that give instructions to virtually every organ and tissue in your body.\n\n【2】Adrenal cancer, also called adrenocortical cancer, can occur at any age. But it's most likely to affect children younger than 5 and adults in their 40s and 50s.\n\n【3】When adrenal cancer is found early, there is a chance for cure. But if the cancer has spread to areas beyond the adrenal glands, cure becomes less likely. Treatment can be used to delay progression or recurrence.\n\n【4】Most growths that form in the adrenal glands are noncancerous (benign). Benign adrenal tumors, such as adenoma or pheochromocytoma, also can develop in the adrenal glands.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms of adrenal cancer include:\n\n【7】*   Weight gain\n*   Muscle weakness\n*   Pink or purple stretch marks on the skin\n*   Hormone changes in women that might cause excess facial hair, hair loss on the head and irregular periods\n*   Hormone changes in men that might cause enlarged breast tissue and shrinking testicles\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n*   Abdominal bloating\n*   Back pain\n*   Fever\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Loss of weight without trying\n\n【8】Causes\n------\n\n【9】It's not clear what causes adrenal cancer.\n\n【10】Adrenal cancer forms when something creates changes (mutations) in the DNA of an adrenal gland cell. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutations can tell the cell to multiply uncontrollably and to continue living when healthy cells would die. When this happens, the abnormal cells accumulate and form a tumor. The tumor cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body.\n\n【11】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【12】Adrenal cancer happens more often in people with inherited syndromes that increase the risk of certain cancers. These inherited syndromes include:\n\n【13】*   Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome\n*   Carney complex\n*   Li-Fraumeni syndrome\n*   Lynch syndrome\n*   Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1)\n\n【14】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "cd4c4b39-43f2-473d-a1cd-c9e8de6ea48b", "title": "Bone density test", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】A bone density test determines if you have osteoporosis — a disorder characterized by bones that are more fragile and more likely to break.\n\n【2】The test uses X-rays to measure how many grams of calcium and other bone minerals are packed into a segment of bone. The bones that are most commonly tested are in the spine, hip and sometimes the forearm.\n\n【3】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【4】Doctors use bone density testing to:\n\n【5】*   Identify decreases in bone density before you break a bone\n*   Determine your risk of broken bones (fractures)\n*   Confirm a diagnosis of osteoporosis\n*   Monitor osteoporosis treatment\n\n【6】The higher your bone mineral content, the denser your bones are. And the denser your bones, the stronger they generally are and the less likely they are to break.\n\n【7】Bone density tests differ from bone scans. Bone scans require an injection beforehand and are usually used to detect fractures, cancer, infections and other abnormalities in the bone.\n\n【8】Although osteoporosis is more common in older women, men also can develop the condition. Regardless of your sex or age, your doctor may recommend a bone density test if you've:\n\n【9】*   **Lost height.** People who have lost at least 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) in height may have compression fractures in their spines, for which osteoporosis is one of the main causes.\n*   **Fractured a bone.** Fragility fractures occur when a bone becomes so fragile that it breaks much more easily than expected. Fragility fractures can sometimes be caused by a strong cough or sneeze.\n*   **Taken certain drugs.** Long-term use of steroid medications, such as prednisone, interferes with the bone-rebuilding process — which can lead to osteoporosis.\n*   **Had a drop in hormone levels.** In addition to the natural drop in hormones that occurs after menopause, women's estrogen may also drop during certain cancer treatments. Some treatments for prostate cancer reduce testosterone levels in men. Lowered sex hormone levels weaken bone.\n\n【10】Risks\n-----\n\n【11】Limitations of bone density testing include:\n\n【12】*   **Differences in testing methods.** Devices that measure density of the bones in the spine and hip are more accurate but cost more than do devices that measure density of the peripheral bones of the forearm, finger or heel.\n*   **Previous spinal problems.** Test results may not be accurate in people who have structural abnormalities in their spines, such as severe arthritis, previous spinal surgeries or scoliosis.\n*   **Radiation exposure.** Bone density testing uses X-rays, but the amount of radiation exposure is usually very small. Even so, pregnant women should avoid these tests.\n*   **Lack of information about the cause.** A bone density test can confirm that you have low bone density, but it can't tell you why. To answer that question, you need a more complete medical evaluation.\n*   **Limited insurance coverage.** Not all health insurance plans pay for bone density tests, so ask your insurance provider beforehand if this test is covered.\n\n【13】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【14】Bone density tests are easy, fast and painless. Virtually no preparation is needed.\n\n【15】Be sure to tell your doctor beforehand if you've recently had a barium exam or had contrast material injected for a CT scan or nuclear medicine test. Contrast materials might interfere with your bone density test.\n\n【16】### Food and medications\n\n【17】Avoid taking calcium supplements for at least 24 hours before your bone density test.\n\n【18】### Clothing and personal items\n\n【19】Wear loose, comfortable clothing and avoid wearing clothes with zippers, belts or buttons. Leave your jewelry at home and remove all metal objects from your pockets, such as keys, money clips or change. At some facilities, you may be asked to change into an examination gown.\n\n【20】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【21】Bone density tests are usually done on bones that are most likely to break because of osteoporosis, including:\n\n【22】*   Lower spine bones (lumbar vertebrae)\n*   The narrow neck of your thighbone (femur), next to your hip joint\n*   Bones in your forearm\n\n【23】If you have your bone density test done at a hospital, it'll probably be done on a device where you lie on a padded platform while a mechanical arm passes over your body. The amount of radiation you're exposed to is very low, much less than the amount emitted during a chest X-ray. The test usually takes about 10 to 30 minutes.\n\n【24】A small, portable machine can measure bone density in the bones at the far ends of your skeleton, such as those in your finger, wrist or heel. The instruments used for these tests are called peripheral devices and are often used at health fairs.\n\n【25】Because bone density can vary from one location in your body to another, a measurement taken at your heel usually isn't as accurate a predictor of fracture risk as a measurement taken at your spine or hip. Consequently, if your test on a peripheral device is positive, your doctor might recommend a follow-up scan at your spine or hip to confirm your diagnosis.\n\n【26】Results\n-------\n\n【27】Your bone density test results are reported in two numbers: T-score and Z-score.\n\n【28】### T-score\n\n【29】Your T-score is your bone density compared with what is normally expected in a healthy young adult of your sex. Your T-score is the number of units — called standard deviations — that your bone density is above or below the average.\n\n| T-score | What your score means |\n| --- | --- |\n| \\-1 and above | Your bone density is considered normal.  |\n| Between -1 and -2.5 | Your score is a sign of osteopenia, a condition in which bone density is below normal and may lead to osteoporosis.  |\n| \\-2.5 and below | Your bone density indicates you likely have osteoporosis.  |\n\n【31】### Z-score\n\n【32】Your Z-score is the number of standard deviations above or below what's normally expected for someone of your age, sex, weight, and ethnic or racial origin. If your Z-score is significantly higher or lower than the average, you may need additional tests to determine the cause of the problem.\n\n【33】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Clinical Pearls is designed with the 3 qualities of physician-learners in mind. First, we physicians enjoy learning from cases. Second, we like concise, practical points that we can use in our practice. Finally, we take pleasure in problem solving.\n\n【1】In the Clinical Pearls format, speakers present a number of short cases in their specialty to a general internal medicine audience. Each case is followed by a multiple-choice question answered live by attendees using an audience response system. The answer distribution is shown to attendees. The correct answer is then displayed and the speaker discusses teaching points, clarifying why one answer is most appropriate. Each case presentation ends with a Clinical Pearl, defined as a practical teaching point that is supported by the literature but generally not well known to most internists.\n\n【2】Clinical Pearls is currently one of the most popular sessions at the American College of Physicians meeting. As a service to its readers, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ has invited a selected number of these Clinical Pearl presentations to be published in our Concise Reviews for Clinicians section. “Clinical Pearls in Palliative Medicine 2012 _”_ is one of them.\n\n【3】Case 1\n------\n\n【4】A 79-year-old woman with moderate Alzheimer dementia suffered a ground-level fall at her skilled-care facility. She has a history of obesity, essential hypertension (well controlled with oral metoprolol), and chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine level, 2.1 mg/dL). On presentation to the emergency department, she is found to have a shortened and laterally rotated right lower extremity. Vital signs include the following: pulse rate, 120/min (regular); blood pressure, 178/98 mm Hg; and respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min. Hip radiography reveals a displaced femoral neck fracture. The patient is moaning and yelling out with the slightest movement but is not able to rate pain using a visual analog scale or numerical rating scale.\n\n【5】### Question\n\n【6】**Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ next step in her management?**\n\n【7】*   a\n\n【8】    Morphine, 4 mg intravenously once\n\n【9】*   b\n\n【10】    Hydromorphone, 0.4 mg intravenously once\n\n【11】*   c\n\n【12】    Oxycodone, 5 mg orally once\n\n【13】*   d\n\n【14】    Metoprolol, 5 mg intravenously; may repeat every 5 minutes for 3 doses\n\n【15】*   e\n\n【16】    Fentanyl, 12-μg/h transdermal patch applied immediately\n\n【17】### Discussion\n\n【18】Based on the time required to achieve maximal pain relief and the presence of concurrent renal insufficiency in this patient, the best option is intravenous hydromorphone. This elderly patient presents with a hip fracture. Although it is important to elucidate the patient's goals of care regarding operative management, currently she is in severe pain, as indicated by her agitation, her sensitivity to any movement, her vocalizations, and sympathetic activation due to pain (tachycardia and hypertension). The most appropriate treatment for her severe, acute pain is intravenous opiates titrated to effect. Although intravenous morphine and intravenous hydromorphone at the listed doses are both reasonable starting doses in an opiate-naive patient, this patient has a history of stage 4 chronic kidney disease with an estimated creatinine clearance of 28 mL/min per 1.73 m  , making morphine a less desirable choice.\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>*   Pergolizzi J.\n*   Böger R.H.\n*   Budd K.\n\n【20】Opioids and the management of chronic severe pain in the elderly: consensus statement of an International Expert Panel with focus on the six clinically most often used World Health Organization Step III opioids (buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone).\n\n【21】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Pain Pract._ 2008; 8 : 287-313</u></u>\n\n【22】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (669)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【23】Morphine has active metabolites that accumulate in the setting of renal failure, increasing the risk of opioid-induced neurotoxicity. Therefore, intravenous hydromorphone is the most appropriate choice in this patient.\n\n【24】Oral analgesics are not indicated for this type of severe, acute pain. The time to peak effect of oral opiates, such as oxycodone, is up to 60 minutes, as compared to 6 to 15 minutes for intravenous opiates. The effect of transdermal fentanyl is even more delayed, and it is best used in the setting of chronic, stable pain. Transdermal fentanyl is not indicated for opioid-naive patients. Intravenous fentanyl could be appropriate in this setting, but physicians should be mindful of the short half-life of intravenous fentanyl and utilize an appropriate redosing interval. Metoprolol is a poor choice in that it does not address the etiology of the patient's hypertension and tachycardia, which is most likely pain.\n\n【25】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【26】Opioids (selected, dosed, and administered appropriately) are indicated for management of moderate to severe pain, even in elderly patients with a history of cognitive impairment and renal insufficiency.\n\n【27】Case 2\n------\n\n【28】A 58-year-old woman with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis presents to your outpatient primary care clinic. She has experienced progressive dyspnea on exertion and reports shortness of breath with minimal activity. Her condition has been relatively stable with use of 4 L/min of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula prior to this visit. The patient does not appear anxious, but she is frustrated that minimal activity triggers dyspnea. Pulmonary examination reveals “Velcro” crackles in all lung fields bilaterally. The following vital signs are recorded in your office: pulse rate, 86/min (regular); blood pressure, 125/77 mm Hg; and respiratory rate, 16 breaths/min at rest with pulse oximetry at 94% while the patient received 4 L/min of supplemental oxygen, which is unchanged from previous evaluations. After walking from the examination table to a chair in the office, her pulse rate is 125/min, respiratory rate is 24 breaths/min, and pulse oximetry is 91%, and she feels moderately dyspneic.\n\n【29】### Question\n\n【30】**Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ treatment for the patient's shortness of breath?**\n\n【31】*   a\n\n【32】    Haloperidol, 1 mg orally once\n\n【33】*   b\n\n【34】    Oxycodone, 5 mg orally once\n\n【35】*   c\n\n【36】    Morphine, 2.5 mg preservative-free solution mixed with 2.5 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride and inhaled via nebulizer\n\n【37】*   d\n\n【38】    Lorazepam, 1 mg orally once\n\n【39】*   e\n\n【40】    Change supplemental oxygen delivery system to deliver a higher concentration of oxygen\n\n【41】### Discussion\n\n【42】Multiple studies, including controlled trials and systematic reviews, have demonstrated that systemically delivered opioids are beneficial in the management of dyspnea,\n\n【43】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ben-Aharon I.\n*   Gafter-Gvili A.\n*   Paul M.\n*   Leibovici L.\n*   Stemmer S.M.</u>\n\n【44】Interventions for alleviating cancer-related dyspnea: a systematic review.\n\n【45】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Oncol._ 2008; 26 : 2396-2404</u></u>\n\n【46】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (131)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【47】including dyspnea associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease as well as with malignant neoplasms. Although major comparison studies among opioids are lacking, given their common effect on the μ-opioid receptor, it is believed that all types of systemic opioids are effective in the treatment of dyspnea, and opioid selection should be based on adverse effects and metabolic considerations for the individual patient.\n\n【48】None of the other medications listed have been convincingly shown to decrease breathlessness. Lorazepam can address anxiety related to dyspnea and can be an effective adjunctive therapy, but it has no direct effect on the sensation of air hunger. Haloperidol may help with agitation but also has no direct mechanism for addressing shortness of breath.

However, larger randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with nebulized opioids are unavailable to support their routine or first-line use for the treatment of dyspnea.\n\n【59】Oxygen therapy has been shown to have beneficial effects on the outcomes of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other life-limiting illnesses who are hypoxic, including improved survival, pulmonary hemodynamics, exercise capacity, and neuropsychological function and decreased sensation of dyspnea. However, in nonhypoxic patients, multiple studies have demonstrated that oxygen does not relieve dyspnea. A recent review of the management of dyspnea commented on the equivalence of nasal cannula delivery of oxygen vs nasal cannula delivery of room air in dyspneic patients with life-limiting illness who were not hypoxic.\n\n【60】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kamal A.H.\n*   Maguire J.M.\n*   Wheeler J.L.\n*   Currow D.C.\n*   Abernethy A.P.</u>\n\n【61】Dyspnea review for the palliative care professional: treatment goals and therapeutic options.\n\n【62】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Palliat Med._ 2012; 15 : 106-114</u></u>\n\n【63】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (72)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【64】Compassionate use of oxygen is common in the treatment of dyspnea, even for patients who do not meet criteria for oxygen therapy. Additionally, oxygen is a potent symbol of medical care. However, oxygen therapy is not without burdens, including cost, supply logistics, and flammability. This data may help clinicians guide their patients as they consider the potential benefits and burdens of oxygen therapy for themselves. Some nonhypoxic patients believe that oxygen therapy is helpful and gives them an added feeling of security.\n\n【65】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【66】Systemic opioids (selected and dosed appropriately) are the mainstay of therapy in the treatment of dyspnea refractory to medical management and can be used safely without inducing respiratory compromise.\n\n【67】Case 3\n------\n\n【68】A 70-year-old retired policeman with a 100-pack-year history of cigarette use has been diagnosed with stage IV non–small cell lung cancer. His performance status allows him to walk daily, tend to his garden, and perform all activities of daily living. On initiation of chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed, he experienced some fatigue, anorexia, and chest wall pain at the site of his largest tumor. However, radiographic studies show that the tumors are stable or slightly improved. He, his wife, and his oldest daughter present to you in the primary care clinic after visiting with his oncologist. His granddaughter is getting married in 3 months, and he hopes to attend the wedding and dance with her. He asks you about the possibility of palliative care consultation and asks for your opinion regarding his overall prognosis. His wife and daughter are concerned that the patient is giving up and that if he discusses prognosis he will lose hope and not fight on, and thus not make it to his granddaughter's wedding.\n\n【69】### Question\n\n【70】**Which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ response to this patient?**\n\n【71】*   a\n\n【72】    “Discussing prognosis, particularly if poor, may cause depression, and you may prematurely give up.”\n\n【73】*   b\n\n【74】    “It sounds like you might be considering hospice, and I support you.

As your primary care doctor, I am not best able to help you in this regard.”\n\n【81】### Discussion\n\n【82】The patient presents with lung cancer and adverse effects that are likely attributable to both the disease and its treatment. The role of palliative care is to assist with management of symptoms and quality-of-life issues in patients with serious illness. Although some physicians and patients may worry that initiating palliative care earlier in a disease and treatment course might lead to shortened survival, a recent randomized clinical trial did not support this concern.\n\n【83】无关删除-2:<u>*   Temel J.S.\n*   Greer J.A.\n*   Muzikansky A.\n\n【84】Early palliative care for patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.\n\n【85】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 2010; 363 : 733-742</u></u>\n\n【86】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (5224)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【87】Patients with advanced lung cancer who had palliative care concurrently with standard tumor-directed oncologic care had improved quality of life and symptom management, and data do not support that initiation of palliative care will shorten survival.\n\n【88】无关删除-2:<u>*   Temel J.S.\n*   Greer J.A.\n*   Muzikansky A.\n\n【89】Early palliative care for patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.\n\n【90】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 2010; 363 : 733-742</u></u>\n\n【91】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (5224)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【92】It has been further demonstrated that having open and honest discussions with a patient engaged to the degree that he or she desires is not associated with loss of hope but may be life affirming and allow for decisions to be made according to the patient's understanding of the prognosis.\n\n【93】无关删除-2:<u>*   Smith T.J.\n*   Dow L.A.\n*   Virago E.\n*   Khatcheressian J.\n*   Lyckholm L.J.\n*   Matsuyama R.</u>\n\n【94】Giving honest information to patients with advanced cancer maintains hope.\n\n【95】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Oncology (Williston Park)._ 2010; 24 : 521-525</u></u>\n\n【96】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【97】It is important to recognize that hospice and palliative care are separate entities and that physicians in all specialties may have a role in maximizing a patient's quality of life in the face of serious illness. Primary care physicians retain an especially vital role in being present with patients and maintaining their therapeutic relationship in order to avoid feelings of abandonment by the patient or family.\n\n【98】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【99】The involvement of palliative care has been shown to improve quality of life without worsening survival or causing patients to give up in the setting of a life-limiting illness.\n\n【100】Case 4\n------\n\n【101】A 79-year-old woman with moderate Alzheimer dementia is admitted to your hospital with abdominal pain. She has a history of obesity and essential hypertension controlled with oral metoprolol; she has mild chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine level, 1.7 mg/dL) and normal hepatic synthetic function. Cholecystitis is diagnosed, and the patient undergoes laparoscopic cholecystectomy. You are consulted by the surgical team to assist with medical management. The patient has been receiving oxycodone, 2.5 mg every 6 hours, and acetaminophen, 650 mg every 4 hours, while awake for her pain. Her other medications, including metoprolol and donepezil, are continued, and “administer as needed” orders are also placed: senna for constipation, albuterol nebulization solution for wheezing, zolpidem for sleep, and sliding-scale insulin to maintain a glucose level of 150 mg/dL or less (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555). The pain appears to be well controlled, but on postoperative day 3, you are called at 1 am to evaluate her altered mental status. She has received each of her administer-as-needed medications once in the preceding 24 hours, and she is now actively hallucinating. Her vital signs include a blood pressure of 135/82 mm Hg and a respiratory rate 16 breaths/min at rest with pulse oximetry at 94% while the patient breathes room air.\n\n【102】### Question\n\n【103】**While evaluating causes of her delirium, which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ next step in the management of her pain?**\n\n【104】*   a\n\n【105】    Discontinue oxycodone and replace it with ibuprofen, 400 mg every 6 hours for the next 48 hours\n\n【106】*   b\n\n【107】    Discontinue oxycodone and replace it with tramadol, 50 mg orally every 6 hours\n\n【108】*   c\n\n【109】    Discontinue oxycodone and replace it with morphine, 5 mg orally every 6 hours\n\n【110】*   d\n\n【111】    Discontinue oxycodone and replace it with lorazepam, 1 mg intravenously once to help calm the patient.

She has done well on her opioid regimen to date and has excellent pain control.

Nonpharmacologic causes of delirium such as urinary retention, constipation, infection, or infarction should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen is not recommended given the patient's renal insufficiency. Tramadol, although often thought to be safer than traditional opiates, has more drug-drug interactions and a more unpredictable and troublesome adverse effect profile due to both its opiate and nonopiate effects, including serotonin and norepinephrine augmentation. Lorazepam may worsen delirium and cause worsening sedation or a paradoxical response of increased agitation.\n\n【126】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【127】Opioids may be a cause of altered mental status in elderly patients with pain, but other causes of delirium should be considered, particularly in patients who appear to have tolerated opioids well previously.\n\n【128】Case 5\n------\n\n【129】An 80-year-old man with end-stage renal failure who has been undergoing hemodialysis 3 times weekly presents to your hospital with increased cough, lethargy, and fever. In the emergency department, laboratory studies demonstrate leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 23.3 × 10  /L with a left-shifted leukocyte differential) and mixed acidosis on arterial blood gas determination (pH, 7.23; P o <sub>2 </sub> , 52 mm Hg \\[to convert to kPa, multiply by 0.133\\]; P co <sub>2, </sub> 52 mm Hg \\[to convert to kPa, multiply by 0.133\\]; and bicarbonate, 20 mEq/L \\[to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0\\]). Chest radiography reveals a large right lower lobe infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia. Health care–associated pneumonia is diagnosed, and the patient is admitted to the medical intensive care unit, where levofloxacin, meropenem, and vancomycin are administered along with noninvasive bilevel positive pressure ventilation (Bi-Pap). His condition does not improve after 48 hours, and he continues to be dyspneic, febrile, and agitated. The patient retains decision-making capacity and requests discontinuation of Bi-Pap and hemodialysis and to be kept comfortable and allowed to die. His son, who has legal power of attorney for health care, agrees that this request is consistent with his father's previously expressed wishes. The patient's wife of 62 years pleads with the son and the physician to continue intensive care measures. An empathetic discussion ensues, and later that day, the patient is taken off Bi-Pap and comfort measures are instituted. The patient receives a fentanyl infusion at 25 μg/h and 25-μg boluses of fentanyl intravenously every 20 minutes for pain or air hunger and subsequently dies a few hours later. The grief-stricken wife is crying at the bedside and tells her son and the attending physician, “You killed my husband!”\n\n【130】### Question\n\n【131】**Which _one_ of the following terms _best_ describes the cause of death for this patient?**\n\n【132】*   a\n\n【133】    Physician aid-in-dying (also known as physician-assisted suicide)\n\n【134】*   b\n\n【135】    Euthanasia\n\n【136】*   c\n\n【137】    Manslaughter by the physician\n\n【138】*   d\n\n【139】    Manslaughter by the physician and the patient's son\n\n【140】*   e\n\n【141】    Death of natural causes (pneumonia, end-stage renal failure, respiratory failure)\n\n【142】### Discussion\n\n【143】This case illustrates the nuances of distinctions between “killing” and “allowing to die” and also the aspects of appropriate surrogate decision making. The withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments is generally accepted as permissible as an aspect of patient autonomy and the right to be left alone. If patients do not have decision-making capacity, their autonomy can be exercised via a surrogate decision maker. In this case, the son is the legal surrogate decision maker and appears to be acting in accord with the patient's wishes. Opioids or other medications that are used in appropriate doses to palliate symptoms, even at the risk of decreasing respiratory drive, are often cited as illustrative of the principle of “double effect.” The double-effect principle contends that if a benefit (symptom relief) of a treatment outweighs an adverse effect (respiratory depression) and if intention is clear and the response is proportionate, that a treatment may be deemed morally acceptable.\n\n【144】无关删除-2:<u>*   Sulmasy D.P.\n*   Pellegrino E.D.</u>\n\n【145】The rule of double effect: clearing up the double talk.\n\n【146】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Intern Med._ 1999; 159 : 545-550</u></u>\n\n【147】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (184)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【148】However, some investigators have recently criticized this concept as moot because studies have demonstrated that symptom palliation with opioids at the end of life does not shorten life if used appropriately (proportionately).\n\n【149】无关删除-2:<u>*   Maltoni M.\n*   Pittureri C.\n*   Scarpi E.\n\n【150】Palliative sedation therapy does not hasten death: results from a prospective multicenter study.\n\n【151】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Oncol._ 2009; 20 : 1163-1169</u></u>\n\n【152】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (171)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【153】The doses of the medications administered in this case seem appropriate for an opioid-naive patient and hence do not appear to represent physician aid-in-dying or homicide. The response of the patient's wife is an understandable grief response and does not necessarily place culpability for a wrongful act by the physician.\n\n【154】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【155】Patients with decision-making capacity may personally request (or request via an appropriate surrogate decision maker) to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatments that are not consistent with their goals of care. This decision and ensuring that the patient is comfortable with appropriate analgesia constitute death from an underlying pathology (natural causes) and are not considered physician aid-in-dying.\n\n【156】Case 6\n------\n\n【157】A 46-year-old woman with stage III ovarian cancer presents to your outpatient clinic with nausea. She notes that the nausea has worsened over the past 2 days and that she is able to consume little more than her medications and a few sips of water without vomiting. She is receiving chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel and notes that she has not had difficulty with nausea during or after chemotherapy because her oncologist administers antiemetics prophylactically before each session. It has been 17 days since her last chemotherapy. The nausea does not seem to occur with movement, is worse after eating solids or liquids, and is accompanied by abdominal distention. She has minimal abdominal pain, which is managed with oxycodone, 10 mg orally taken regularly 3 times a day. Her last bowel movement was 4 days ago. Abdominal radiography (obstruction series) shows no air-fluid levels, no free air, and no evidence of obstruction, but there is a moderate amount of stool in the colon.\n\n【158】### Question\n\n【159】**Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ antiemetic to prescribe initially for this patient?**\n\n【160】*   a\n\n【161】    Metoclopramide, 10 mg orally 4 times a day\n\n【162】*   b\n\n【163】    Ondansetron, 8 mg orally twice a day\n\n【164】*   c\n\n【165】    Promethazine, 25 mg orally (or by suppository) every 6 hours\n\n【166】*   d\n\n【167】    Lorazepam, 1 mg orally every 6 hours\n\n【168】*   e\n\n【169】    Granisetron, 1 mg orally once daily\n\n【170】### Discussion\n\n【171】The mechanism of this patient's nausea is likely gastrointestinal distention and irritation from both constipation and her ovarian cancer, and possibly a direct effect of her opioid.\n\n【172】无关删除-2:<u>*   Wood G.J.\n*   Shega J.W.\n*   Lynch B.\n*   Von Roenn J.H.</u>\n\n【173】Management of intractable nausea and vomiting in patients at the end of life: “I was feeling nauseous all of the time … nothing was working.”.\n\n【174】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 2007; 298 : 1196-1207</u></u>\n\n【175】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (87)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【176】Opioid-induced nausea is mostly dopamine mediated. In this case, serotonin receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, serosa, and viscera are also involved. In addition to intensifying the patient's bowel regimen, dopamine blockade is most likely to be helpful for this patient. Metoclopramide is a dopamine D <sub>2 </sub> receptor antagonist that has some peripheral serotonin antagonism and would be the best choice. Prochlorperazine and haloperidol would also be reasonable choices.\n\n【177】Enough time has passed since the patient's most recent chemotherapy that it should not be a major contributor to her nausea at this time. She does not appear to have a bowel obstruction, which is important to rule out in this scenario because of the potential need for surgical intervention or nasogastric tube placement and also should be ruled out before administering metoclopramide given its promotility effects. Anxiety does not seem to be a major component of the patient's condition, and lorazepam alone has poor antiemetic effects.\n\n【178】Toxin-mediated nausea such as medication effects and electrolyte disturbances (eg, hypercalcemia) are mediated through the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), located at the area postrema in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The 2 neurotransmitters that are most active in the CTZ are serotonin and dopamine. Serotonin antagonists, such as ondansetron or granisetron, or dopamine antagonists, such as haloperidol, metoclopramide, or prochlorperazine, are most effective in the setting of CTZ-mediated nausea. Promethazine is a weak antagonist of dopamine, and its mechanism of action is generally through inducing sedation via antihistaminic and anticholinergic pathways. The use of promethazine is not routinely recommended for nausea given its limited efficacy and wide range of potential adverse effects.\n\n【179】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【180】Selection of an antiemetic is best made by considering the mechanism of the drug's action and the putative factors that are contributing to the nausea.\n\n【181】无关删除-1:<u>Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------</u>\n\n【182】无关删除-1:<u>*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI3ODc5M2NlMzYxZWU3ZDJlZjA0OTQ2ZTUwMWVlZDU2NSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDIzNDQzfQ.f4-Vno6X4GzUMmCnd5XYI9TfH12dljmeN80FjVUZAglguvD\\_uGF524ae3fpC9q0Ecg1vVOMDSno1ICeQBj-EFKtI4mJJU1esEuh21M4zaEmo9gbgEV31plAiSiZBWFtHPh-V\\_4gx2yIpGkgDNSPF1a-4BM6SGiGwkFKTTcIofdguVTaOCj\\_\\_Js86fKp2AF95w0cXzzv0kD36lBD4Qw7gZwfiwlWCQi9bSFqy8VgbyrvMxqRY92AavZbTwyiPf3s88cON3LRlLtZQE4rXPj20pC8MD8N08P1gVFccJ0mscZnYL8lQIGRTcmTEpxFQ-IWn7E0JyR6Tkeigy66gFTaDAQ\n\n【183】    Download .mp4 (13.84 MB)\n\n【184】    Help with .mp4 files\n\n【185】    Video 1\n\n【186】    Author Interview Video</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The lack of excess adverse effects relating to the gastrointestinal system in individuals enrolled in the ROADMAP study, half of whom were actively treated with olmesartan, puts our report in perspective. Their data suggest that the association we had described is likely quite rare. This finding should be reassuring for both prescribers and patients who are doing well with olmesartan. Drs Menne and Haller rightly point out that our report was based on patients drawn from a wide referral base. Rare associations of other drug therapies can be clinically important, yet not seen in many of the often quite large initial clinical trials. In particular, Drs Menne and Haller report on just more than 2200 individuals exposed to olmesartan (40 mg) followed up for a mean of 3 years, or approximately 6600 years of patient follow-up. Our research reported on a relatively small number of patients (22 total) who were drawn from a likely much larger population of individuals taking olmesartan. Further, the population from which our patients were drawn likely had more heterogeneous clinical characteristics than permitted by the strict inclusion criteria used in the ROADMAP study. We have since identified more patients with a similar syndrome, including 1 patient with diabetes who was prescribed olmesartan for microalbuminuria prevention (ie, a profile similar to that of the patients enrolled in the ROADMAP research). Larger postmarketing surveillance studies will be necessary, along with other studies, for example, pharmacogenetic studies, to understand the mechanisms of this important, albeit rare, association.\n\n【1】In his letter, Dr Talbot described a 59-year-old man who had abnormal intestinal biopsy findings (intraepithelial lymphocytosis on a first biopsy specimen and intraepithelial lymphocytosis with mild villous blunting on a subsequent biopsy specimen) without diarrhea and also had “symptoms consistent with worsening gastric reflux” and mild constipation. This profile suggests the possibility of a spectrum of severity in olmesartan-associated enteropathy. In addition to diarrhea, many of our patients also experienced upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Other clinical characteristics of Dr Talbot's reported case are consistent with our observations. Demonstration of complete recovery of the mucosa of the duodenum after suspension of olmesartan therapy in his patient will be required to support an association between olmesartan and histologic abnormalities in the absence of symptomatic malabsorption.\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【4】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.10.006</u></u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>© 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Top diagnostic groups were otologic/vestibular (32.9%), cardiovascular (21.1%), respiratory (11.5%), neurologic (11.2%, including 4% cerebrovascular), metabolic (11.0%), injury/poisoning (10.6%), psychiatric (7.2%), digestive (7.0%), genitourinary (5.1%), and infectious (2.9%). Nearly half of the cases (49.2%) were given a medical diagnosis, and 22.1% were given only a symptom diagnosis. Predefined dangerous disorders were diagnosed in 15%, especially among those older than 50 years (20.9% vs 9.3%; _P_ <.001). Dizziness cases were evaluated longer (mean 4.0 vs 3.4 hours), imaged disproportionately (18.0% vs 6.9% undergoing computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), and admitted more often (18.8% vs 14.8%) (all _P_ <.001).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Dizziness is not attributed to a vestibular disorder in most ED cases and often is associated with cardiovascular or other medical causes, including dangerous ones. Resource use is substantial, yet many patients remain undiagnosed.\n\n【8】CI ( confidence interval ), CT ( computed tomography ), ED ( emergency department ), HCUP-CCS ( Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's Clinical Classifications Software ), ICD-9-CM ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ), MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ), NHAMCS ( National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey ), NOS ( not otherwise specified ), OR ( odds ratio ), RFV code ( NHAMCS reason-for-visit classification )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Macleod—Nobel Prize for Discovery of Insulin", "text": "【0】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【1】**A** lthough Canadian surgeon Frederick G. Banting (1891-1941) and Canadian physiologist Charles H. Best (1899-1978) are given credit for the discovery of insulin, Scottish physiologist John James Rickard Macleod shared the 1923 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine for “his discovery of insulin.” A stamp (Scott No. 3701) issued in 2002 by Guyana honored Macleod as a Nobel laureate.\n\n【2】Macleod, the son of a clergyman, was born on September 6, 1876, in Cluny, near Dienkeld, Perthshire, in central Scotland. He received his early education at Aberdeen Grammar School (northeastern Scotland). In 1893, he enrolled in Marischal College of the University of Aberdeen to study medicine and received MB and ChB degrees in 1898. Macleod was awarded an Anderson Traveling Fellowship that enabled him to spend 1899 at the Institute of Physiology of the University of Leipzig (Germany), where he studied biochemistry.\n\n【3】Macleod returned to England and obtained a position as demonstrator in physiology at the London Hospital Medical School in 1899. He was appointed lecturer in biochemistry at the same institution in 1902 and was also selected as Mackinnon research scholar of The Royal Society. That same year, he was awarded a DPH degree from Cambridge University (England).\n\n【4】After he received his doctorate in public health, Macleod was appointed professor of physiology at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, where he remained until 1918. While at Western Reserve University, he became interested (1905) in diabetes and began investigating the metabolism of carbohydrates, particularly the physiology of diabetes mellitus. He also investigated air sickness, electric shock, purine bases, carbamates, and bacterium that causes tuberculosis.\n\n【5】In 1918, Macleod joined the University of Toronto (Canada) as associate dean of medicine and subsequently became director of its physiology laboratory. In May 1921, Macleod gave Banting permission to use the laboratory for his research on insulin.\n\n【6】Best, who was an undergraduate medical student in Macleod's classes, joined Banting, and together they began investigating the secretions of the pancreas. Eventually (1921), Banting and Best succeeded in isolating and purifying insulin. The name “insulin” was provided by Macleod, who changed the original name “insuline,” suggested by the British physiologist Edward A. Sharpey-Schafer (1850-1935), who had been one of the first investigators to support the hypothesis of a pancreatic hormone. During this time, Macleod was made dean of the faculty of medicine at the University of Toronto.\n\n【7】The Canadian researchers were aware of the work of German physician Joseph von Mering (1849-1908) and German physiologist Oskar Minkowski (1858-1931), who in 1889 announced their discovery that removal of the pancreas in dogs led to their death.\n\n【8】Controversy surrounded the 1923 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine because it was awarded only to Banting and Macleod. Banting suggested that Best also be included. Although Best was never added as a recipient, Banting shared the prize money with him. Many historians believe that Macleod should not have been awarded the prize because he had little or nothing to do with the actual work on insulin. Macleod credited the work done on the project by Canadian biochemist James Bertram Collip (1892-1965), who assisted in the purification of insulin.\n\n【9】In 1928, Macleod was appointed Regius Professor of Physiology at the University of Aberdeen. On March 16, 1935, after years of crippling arthritis, Macleod died in Aberdeen at the age of 58 years. He was honored by many scientific groups and societies. Among his numerous publications are _Practical Physiology_ (1903), _Physiology and Biochemistry in Modern Medicine_ (1918), _Insulin and Its Use in Diabetes_ (1925), and _Carbohydrate Metabolism and Insulin_ (1926).\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【12】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/81.8.1006</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>© 2006 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

In a female fetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes. As the fetus grows, the tubes typically join to create one larger, hollow organ. This organ is the uterus.\n\n【2】Sometimes the tubes don't join completely. Instead, each one develops into a separate organ. A double uterus may have one opening into one vagina. This opening is called the cervix. In other cases, each uterus has its own cervix. Often, there's also a thin wall of tissue that runs down the length of the vagina. This divides the vagina in two, with two separate openings.\n\n【3】Women who have a double uterus often have successful pregnancies. But the condition can make you more likely to have a miscarriage or premature birth.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】A double uterus often causes no symptoms. The condition may be discovered during a regular pelvic exam. Or it may be found during imaging tests to find the cause of repeated miscarriages.\n\n【6】Women who have a double vagina along with a double uterus may first see a health care provider for menstrual bleeding that isn't stopped by a tampon. This can happen when a tampon is placed in one vagina, but blood still flows from the second uterus and vagina.\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Seek medical advice if you have a menstrual flow despite using a tampon. Or if you have severe pain during your periods or you have repeated miscarriages.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Health experts don't know exactly why some fetuses develop a double uterus. Genetics may play a role. That's because this rare condition sometimes runs in families.\n\n【11】Complications\n-------------\n\n【12】Many women with a double uterus have active sex lives. They also may have routine pregnancies and successful deliveries. But sometimes a double uterus and other uterine factors can cause:\n\n【13】*   Infertility.\n*   Miscarriage.\n*   Premature birth.\n*   Kidney problems.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

She attended a one-room school and grew up on a dairy farm, on which she milked cows and drove a tractor as a child. Her father, Charles, died suddenly in 1923, when she was 11 years old, and left her mother Rebecca Mair – a schoolteacher – with 7 children.\n\n【2】Following high school graduation at age 16, Peters enrolled at the University of Toronto and studied mathematics and physics. The following year, she transferred to the University of Toronto’s medical school – her 6 siblings pooled their earnings to help pay for her tuition – and graduated in 1934. She was one of 10 women out of a graduating class of 115 students, and by the time of graduation she was using her middle name, Vera. Her mother died in 1933, from metastatic breast cancer and did not get to see her graduate.\n\n【3】Following two years as a surgical resident at St. John’s Hospital in Toronto, she started working with Dr Gordon Richards, director of the Department of Radiology at the Toronto General Hospital — and later first president of the National Cancer Institute of Canada — who developed the first radiology training program in Canada in 1923, and had treated Peters’ mother. She began working with him as a trainee at the Ontario Radiotherapy Institute at Toronto General Hospital, and in 1937, became a member of his department.\n\n【4】At that time, Hodgkin lymphoma was considered incurable. However, by the 1940s, Dr Richards and a few other radiation specialists such as Dr René Gilbert of Geneva, Switzerland, had noticed there were a few patients with Hodgkin lymphoma who did not relapse after radiotherapy and thought that radiation could be curative. In 1947, Richards suggested that Dr Peters examine the records of previously treated patients to see how many long-term survivors there were. After collecting 247 lymphoma patients treated over the previous 2 decades, Peters reported 5- and 10-year overall survival rates of 50% and 35%, respectively, in a landmark paper in 1950. Dr Richards proudly saw Dr Peters present this work at a departmental conference. He died in 1949, from leukemia, which presumably was related to his many years of radiation exposure, and did not live to see the publication of Dr Peters’ work.\n\n【5】With no time during her busy clinical day, Dr Peters had written the paper in the evenings after dinner with her husband, schoolteacher Kenneth Lobb, and their two daughters, Sandy and Jenny. However, the medical community did not pay much attention to her findings until she published a follow-up paper in 1956, which was endorsed by an influential radiation oncologist Henry Kaplan of Stanford. Soon radiotherapy became the treatment of choice for localized Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n【6】Until the late 1970s, the preferred treatment of breast cancer was the radical mastectomy popularized by William Halsted at Johns Hopkins in the 1890s, which included surgical removal of the entire breast tissue and the axillary and sometimes supraclavicular lymph nodes, as well as the chest muscles. Robert McWhirter, a surgeon at the University of Edinburgh, had reported in 1948 that the 5- and 10-year survival for patients with breast cancer following simple mastectomy (ie, without removal of the chest muscles, and with less extensive nodal dissection) and radiation therapy was the same as that following a radical mastectomy, but less invasive approaches were not widely adopted.\n\n【7】In 1975, Dr Peters presented a large study of women in Toronto showing that local resection of the breast tumor (“lumpectomy”) plus radiation with preservation of the breast produced results comparable to those from mastectomy. Initially, there was considerable skepticism about her findings. However, eventually treatment of breast cancer changed markedly because of the work of Dr Peters and others, with disfiguring radical mastectomy falling out of favor and more conservative approaches now routinely used.\n\n【8】Dr Peters’ bibliography is modest in size, with 48 peer-reviewed publications, on which she was often the first author. She was described as a modest and unassuming individual who did not like to argue, which limited recognition of her research accomplishments. However, her clinical and research skills were widely appreciated in Toronto. Among her most satisfying invited lectureships were the 1968 Gordon Richards Memorial Lecture of the Canadian Association of Radiologists, and her Royal College lecture, which she entitled “Cutting the Gordian Knot in Early Breast Cancer.”\n\n【9】She had worked in the Ontario Institute of Radiotherapy, which after 1958 became part of the Ontario Cancer Institute and the Princess Margaret Hospital. She retired at 65 years of age in 1976, and subsequently had a part-time consulting practice in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto. The last three months of her life was spent as a patient in the Princess Margaret Hospital, where she died of metastatic cancer on October 1, 1993, at age 82.\n\n【10】Dr Peters became a member and subsequently officer of the Order of Canada. She also received the Gold Medal of the American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO), and received honorary doctoral degrees from York University in Toronto and Queens University in Kingston, Ontario. She accomplished her groundbreaking achievements at a time when few women had leadership roles in medical advances or were elected as leaders of scientific societies. One female radiation oncologist in Toronto said that, “She left footprints in the snow for us to follow.”\n\n【11】Dr Peters met her husband-to-be when she was a medical student, while working as a waitress on a two-day cruise on Lake Ontario back and forth between Toronto and Kingston, Ontario. Her husband died in 1967. One of their two daughters became an internist.\n\n【12】Dr Peters is remembered for her caring, compassionate, and sensitive approach for each patient. Her warmth combined with an air of competence, confidence, and hope characterized her approach to patients. She was honored philatelically by Canada Post in September 2020, (Scott # pending.)\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Footnotes</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>_Stamp Vignettes focus on biographical details and accomplishments related to science and medicine, and not individual views and prejudices except where they had a major impact on the subject's life.

However, the valve that releases food to the small intestine (the pyloric valve) remains, along with a limited portion of the small intestine that normally connects to the stomach (duodenum).\n\n【3】The second step bypasses the majority of the intestine by connecting the end portion of the intestine to the duodenum near the stomach. A BPD/DS both limits how much you can eat and reduces the absorption of nutrients, including proteins and fats.\n\n【4】BPD/DS is generally performed as a single procedure; however, in select circumstances, the procedure may be performed as two separate operations — sleeve gastrectomy followed by intestinal bypass once weight loss has begun.\n\n【5】While a BPD/DS is very effective, it has more risks, including malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. This procedure is generally recommended for people with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 50.\n\n【6】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【7】A BPD/DS is done to help you lose excess weight and reduce your risk of potentially life-threatening weight-related health problems, including:\n\n【8】*   Heart disease\n*   High blood pressure\n*   High cholesterol\n*   Severe sleep apnea\n*   Type 2 diabetes\n*   Stroke\n*   Infertility\n\n【9】A BPD/DS is typically done only after you've tried to lose weight by improving your diet and exercise habits.\n\n【10】But a BPD/DS isn't for everyone who is severely overweight. You likely will have an extensive screening process to see if you qualify.\n\n【11】You must also be willing to make permanent changes to lead a healthier lifestyle both before and after surgery. This may include long-term follow-up plans that involve monitoring your nutrition, your lifestyle and behavior, and your medical conditions.\n\n【12】Check with your health insurance plan or your regional Medicare or Medicaid office to find out if your policy covers weight-loss surgery.\n\n【13】Risks\n-----\n\n【14】As with any major surgery, a BPD/DS poses potential health risks, both in the short term and long term.\n\n【15】Risks associated with BPD/DS are similar to any abdominal surgery and can include:\n\n【16】*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Infection\n*   Adverse reactions to anesthesia\n*   Blood clots\n*   Lung or breathing problems\n*   Leaks in your gastrointestinal system\n\n【17】Longer term risks and complications of a BPD/DS may include:\n\n【18】*   Bowel obstruction\n*   Dumping syndrome, causing diarrhea, nausea or vomiting\n*   Gallstones\n*   Hernias\n*   Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)\n*   Malnutrition\n*   Stomach perforation\n*   Ulcers\n*   Vomiting\n\n【19】Rarely, complications of a BPD/DS can be fatal.\n\n【20】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【21】If you qualify for a BPD/DS, your health care team gives you instructions on how to prepare for surgery. You may need to have various lab tests and exams before surgery.\n\n【22】### Food and medications\n\n【23】Before your surgery, give your surgeon and any other health care providers a list of all medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbal or dietary supplements you take. You may have restrictions on eating and drinking and which medications you can take.\n\n【24】If you take blood-thinning medications, talk with your doctor before your surgery. Because these medications affect clotting and bleeding, your blood-thinning medication routine may need to be changed.\n\n【25】If you have diabetes, talk with the doctor who manages your insulin or other diabetes medications for specific instructions on taking or adjusting them after surgery.\n\n【26】### Other precautions\n\n【27】You may be required to start a physical activity program and to stop any tobacco use.\n\n【28】You may also need to prepare by planning ahead for your recovery after surgery. For instance, arrange for help at home if you think you'll need it.\n\n【29】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【30】BPD/DS is done in the hospital. The length of your hospital stay will depend on your recovery and which procedure you're having done. When performed laparoscopically, your hospital stay may last around two days.\n\n【31】### Before the procedure\n\n【32】Before you go to the operating room, you will change into a gown and will be asked several questions by both doctors and nurses. In the operating room, you are given general anesthesia before your surgery begins. Anesthesia is medicine that keeps you asleep and comfortable during surgery.\n\n【33】### During the procedure\n\n【34】The specifics of your surgery depend on your individual situation and your doctor's practices. Some surgeries are done with traditional large, or open, incisions in your abdomen, while some may be performed laparoscopically, which involves inserting instruments through multiple small incisions in your abdomen.\n\n【35】*   **The first step of a BPD/DS.** The first step in a BPD/DS involves removing a portion of the stomach. After making the incisions with the open or laparoscopic technique, your surgeon removes a large portion of the stomach and forms the remaining portion into a narrow sleeve. Your surgeon leaves intact the valve that releases food to the small intestine (the pyloric valve), along with a limited portion of the small intestine that normally connects to the stomach (duodenum).\n*   **The second step of a BPD/DS.** During the second step, your surgeon makes one cut through the part of the small intestine just below the duodenum, and a second cut farther down, near the lower end of the small intestine. Then your surgeon brings the cut end near the bottom of the small intestine up to the other cut end, just below the duodenum. The effect is to bypass a large segment of the small intestine.\n\n【36】Each part of the surgery usually takes a few hours. After surgery, you awaken in a recovery room, where medical staff monitors you for any complications.\n\n【37】### After the procedure\n\n【38】Immediately after a BPD/DS procedure, you may have liquids but no solid food as your stomach and intestines begin to heal. You'll then follow a special diet plan that changes slowly from liquids to pureed foods. After that, you can eat soft foods, then move on to firmer foods as your body is able to tolerate them.\n\n【39】Your diet after surgery may continue to be quite restricted, with specified limits on how much and what you can eat and drink. Your doctor will recommend that you take vitamin and mineral supplements after surgery, including a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin B12. These are vital to prevent micronutrient deficiency.\n\n【40】You'll also have frequent medical checkups to monitor your health in the first several months after weight-loss surgery. You may need laboratory testing, bloodwork and various exams.\n\n【41】You may experience changes as your body reacts to the rapid weight loss in the first three to six months after a BPD/DS, including:\n\n【42】*   Body aches\n*   Feeling tired, as if you have the flu\n*   Feeling cold\n*   Dry skin\n*   Hair thinning and hair loss\n*   Mood changes\n\n【43】Results\n-------\n\n【44】After a BPD/DS, it may be possible to lose 70 to 80 percent of your excess weight within two years. However, the amount of weight you lose also depends on your change in lifestyle habits.\n\n【45】In addition to weight loss, a BPD/DS may improve or resolve conditions often related to being overweight, including:\n\n【46】*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease\n*   Heart disease\n*   High blood pressure\n*   High cholesterol\n*   Obstructive sleep apnea\n*   Type 2 diabetes\n*   Stroke\n*   Infertility\n\n【47】A BPD/DS can also improve your ability to perform routine daily activities, which could help improve your quality of life.\n\n【48】### When weight-loss surgery doesn't work\n\n【49】It's possible to not lose enough weight or to regain weight after weight-loss surgery. This weight gain can happen if you don't follow the recommended lifestyle changes. If you frequently snack on high-calorie foods, for instance, you may have inadequate weight loss. To help avoid regaining weight, you must make permanent healthy changes in your diet and get regular physical activity and exercise.\n\n【50】It's important to keep all of your scheduled follow-up appointments after weight-loss surgery so your doctor can monitor your progress. If you notice that you aren't losing weight or you develop complications after your surgery, see your doctor immediately.\n\n【51】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

We studied sex differences among married physicians in time spent on household activities (eg, cleaning and cooking) and child care (eg, bathing and homework) from 2003 through 2016 using the American Time Use Survey, a detailed time use survey administered by the US Census. Overall, we found that female physicians with children spent 100.2 minutes (95% CI, 67.0-133.3 minutes) more per day on household activities and child care than did male physicians, a finding that was qualitatively similar after adjustment for work hours outside the home of both spouses. These patterns may reflect societal norms that ultimately influence physician sex differences in hours worked professionally.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviation and Acronym:\n\n【3】ATUS ( American Time Use Survey )\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Dermotic\n2.  Earsol-HC\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Otic corticosteroids (cortisone-like medicines) are used in the ear to relieve the redness, itching, and swelling caused by certain ear problems.\n\n【6】Otic corticosteroids are available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Oil\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】### Allergies\n\n【11】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【12】### Pediatric\n\n【13】There is no specific information about the use of otic corticosteroids in children. Children born to mothers taking otic corticosteroid therapy during their pregnancy should be observed for decrease in growth and for hypoadrenalism (anorexia, low blood pressure, and weakness).\n\n【14】### Geriatric\n\n【15】Although there is no specific information about the use of otic corticosteroids in the elderly, they are not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than they do in younger adults.\n\n【16】### Pregnancy\n\n【17】Studies with otic corticosteroids have not been done in pregnant women. However, in animal studies, corticosteroids have been shown to cause birth defects. Before taking this medicine, make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant or if you may become pregnant.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】Corticosteroids pass into breast milk. Be sure you have discussed the risks to the child and benefits of the medicine with your doctor.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【22】### Other Interactions\n\n【23】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【24】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【25】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【26】*   Type 2 diabetes mellitus or\n*   Epilepsy—Using otic corticosteroids may worsen this condition.\n\n【27】*   Fungal infections or\n*   Tuberculosis or\n*   Viral infections or\n*   Otitis media, chronic or\n*   Any other ear infection or condition (or history of)—Otic corticosteroids may worsen existing infections or cause new infections.\n\n【28】*   Glaucoma or\n*   High blood pressure—Otic corticosteroids may increase the pressure in the blood vessels of the eye and throughout the body.\n\n【29】*   Heart disease—Irregular heartbeat and change in blood pressure are more likely to occur.\n\n【30】*   Osteoporosis—Otic corticosteroids increase the risk of bone fractures.\n\n【31】*   Punctured ear drum—Using otic corticosteroids with a punctured ear drum may damage the ear.\n\n【32】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【33】To use ear drops:\n\n【34】*   Lie down or tilt the head so that the affected ear faces up. Gently pull the earlobe up and back for adults (down and back for children) to straighten the ear canal. Drop the medicine into the ear canal. Keep the ear facing up for several (about 5) minutes to allow the medicine to run to the bottom of the ear canal. A sterile cotton plug may be gently inserted into the ear opening to prevent the medicine from leaking out. At first, your doctor may want you to put more medicine on the cotton plug during the day to keep it moist.\n\n【35】To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the dropper or applicator tip to any surface (including the ear). Also, keep the container tightly closed.\n\n【36】Do not use corticosteroids more often or for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.\n\n【37】Do not use any leftover medicine for future ear problems without first checking with your doctor. This medicine should not be used if certain kinds of infections are present. To do so may make the infection worse.\n\n【38】### Dosing\n\n【39】The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【40】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【41】#### For betamethasone\n\n【42】*   For redness, itching, and swelling:\n    *   Adults and children—Use two or three drops in the ear every two or three hours. After symptoms are relieved, your doctor may lower the dose.\n\n【43】#### For dexamethasone\n\n【44】*   For redness, itching, and swelling:\n    *   Adults and children—Use three or four drops in the ear two or three times a day. After symptoms are relieved, your doctor may lower the dose.\n\n【45】### Missed Dose\n\n【46】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【47】### Storage\n\n【48】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【49】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【50】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【51】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【52】If your condition does not improve within 5 to 7 days, or if it becomes worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【53】While you are being treated with otic corticosteroids, and after you stop treatment, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Otic corticosteroids may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is trying to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take or have recently taken oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid other persons who have taken oral polio vaccine. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.\n\n【54】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【55】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【56】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【57】#### Less common\n\n【58】1.

{"seq_id": "a05e69d6-4280-4417-b946-f6bd15a80f9e", "title": "Hyponatremia", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Hyponatremia occurs when the concentration of sodium in your blood is abnormally low. Sodium is an electrolyte, and it helps regulate the amount of water that's in and around your cells.\n\n【2】In hyponatremia, one or more factors — ranging from an underlying medical condition to drinking too much water — cause the sodium in your body to become diluted. When this happens, your body's water levels rise, and your cells begin to swell. This swelling can cause many health problems, from mild to life-threatening.\n\n【3】Hyponatremia treatment is aimed at resolving the underlying condition. Depending on the cause of hyponatremia, you may simply need to cut back on how much you drink. In other cases of hyponatremia, you may need intravenous electrolyte solutions and medications.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Hyponatremia signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【6】*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Headache\n*   Confusion\n*   Loss of energy, drowsiness and fatigue\n*   Restlessness and irritability\n*   Muscle weakness, spasms or cramps\n*   Seizures\n*   Coma\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Seek emergency care for anyone who develops severe signs and symptoms of hyponatremia, such as nausea and vomiting, confusion, seizures, or lost consciousness.\n\n【9】Call your doctor if you know you are at risk of hyponatremia and are experiencing nausea, headaches, cramping or weakness. Depending on the extent and duration of these signs and symptoms, your doctor may recommend seeking immediate medical care.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Sodium plays a key role in your body. It helps maintain normal blood pressure, supports the work of your nerves and muscles, and regulates your body's fluid balance.\n\n【12】A normal blood sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Hyponatremia occurs when the sodium in your blood falls below 135 mEq/L.\n\n【13】Many possible conditions and lifestyle factors can lead to hyponatremia, including:\n\n【14】*   **Certain medications.** Some medications, such as some water pills (diuretics), antidepressants and pain medications, can interfere with the normal hormonal and kidney processes that keep sodium concentrations within the healthy normal range.\n*   **Heart, kidney and liver problems.** Congestive heart failure and certain diseases affecting the kidneys or liver can cause fluids to accumulate in your body, which dilutes the sodium in your body, lowering the overall level.\n*   **Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH).** In this condition, high levels of the anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) are produced, causing your body to retain water instead of excreting it normally in your urine.\n*   **Chronic, severe vomiting or diarrhea and other causes of dehydration.** This causes your body to lose electrolytes, such as sodium, and also increases ADH levels.\n*   **Drinking too much water.** Drinking excessive amounts of water can cause low sodium by overwhelming the kidneys' ability to excrete water. Because you lose sodium through sweat, drinking too much water during endurance activities, such as marathons and triathlons, can also dilute the sodium content of your blood.\n*   **Hormonal changes.** Adrenal gland insufficiency (Addison's disease) affects your adrenal glands' ability to produce hormones that help maintain your body's balance of sodium, potassium and water. Low levels of thyroid hormone also can cause a low blood-sodium level.\n*   **The recreational drug Ecstasy.** This amphetamine increases the risk of severe and even fatal cases of hyponatremia.\n\n【15】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【16】The following factors may increase your risk of hyponatremia:\n\n【17】*   **Age.** Older adults may have more contributing factors for hyponatremia, including age-related changes, taking certain medications and a greater likelihood of developing a chronic disease that alters the body's sodium balance.\n*   **Certain drugs.** Medications that increase your risk of hyponatremia include thiazide diuretics as well as some antidepressants and pain medications. In addition, the recreational drug Ecstasy has been linked to fatal cases of hyponatremia.\n*   **Conditions that decrease your body's water excretion.** Medical conditions that may increase your risk of hyponatremia include kidney disease, syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) and heart failure, among others.\n*   **Intensive physical activities.** People who drink too much water while taking part in marathons, ultramarathons, triathlons and other long-distance, high-intensity activities are at an increased risk of hyponatremia.\n\n【18】Complications\n-------------\n\n【19】In chronic hyponatremia, sodium levels drop gradually over 48 hours or longer — and symptoms and complications are typically more moderate.\n\n【20】In acute hyponatremia, sodium levels drop rapidly — resulting in potentially dangerous effects, such as rapid brain swelling, which can result in a coma and death.\n\n【21】Premenopausal women appear to be at the greatest risk of hyponatremia-related brain damage. This may be related to the effect of women's sex hormones on the body's ability to balance sodium levels.\n\n【22】Prevention\n----------\n\n【23】The following measures may help you prevent hyponatremia:\n\n【24】*   **Treat associated conditions.** Getting treatment for conditions that contribute to hyponatremia, such as adrenal gland insufficiency, can help prevent low blood sodium.\n*   **Educate yourself.** If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of hyponatremia or you take diuretic medications, be aware of the signs and symptoms of low blood sodium. Always talk with your doctor about the risks of a new medication.\n*   **Take precautions during high-intensity activities.** Athletes should drink only as much fluid as they lose due to sweating during a race. Thirst is generally a good guide to how much water or other fluids you need.\n*   **Consider drinking sports beverages during demanding activities.** Ask your doctor about replacing water with sports beverages that contain electrolytes when participating in endurance events such as marathons, triathlons and other demanding activities.\n*   **Drink water in moderation.** Drinking water is vital for your health, so make sure you drink enough fluids. But don't overdo it. Thirst and the color of your urine are usually the best indications of how much water you need. If you're not thirsty and your urine is pale yellow, you are likely getting enough water.\n\n【25】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "12acc48d-e9a2-4ee9-9af6-07aad2ad3aca", "title": "Borderline personality disorder", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder that impacts the way you think and feel about yourself and others, causing problems functioning in everyday life. It includes self-image issues, difficulty managing emotions and behavior, and a pattern of unstable relationships.\n\n【2】With borderline personality disorder, you have an intense fear of abandonment or instability, and you may have difficulty tolerating being alone. Yet inappropriate anger, impulsiveness and frequent mood swings may push others away, even though you want to have loving and lasting relationships.\n\n【3】Borderline personality disorder usually begins by early adulthood. The condition seems to be worse in young adulthood and may gradually get better with age.\n\n【4】If you have borderline personality disorder, don't get discouraged. Many people with this disorder get better over time with treatment and can learn to live satisfying lives.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Borderline personality disorder affects how you feel about yourself, how you relate to others and how you behave.\n\n【7】Signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【8】*   An intense fear of abandonment, even going to extreme measures to avoid real or imagined separation or rejection\n*   A pattern of unstable intense relationships, such as idealizing someone one moment and then suddenly believing the person doesn't care enough or is cruel\n*   Rapid changes in self-identity and self-image that include shifting goals and values, and seeing yourself as bad or as if you don't exist at all\n*   Periods of stress-related paranoia and loss of contact with reality, lasting from a few minutes to a few hours\n*   Impulsive and risky behavior, such as gambling, reckless driving, unsafe sex, spending sprees, binge eating or drug abuse, or sabotaging success by suddenly quitting a good job or ending a positive relationship\n*   Suicidal threats or behavior or self-injury, often in response to fear of separation or rejection\n*   Wide mood swings lasting from a few hours to a few days, which can include intense happiness, irritability, shame or anxiety\n*   Ongoing feelings of emptiness\n*   Inappropriate, intense anger, such as frequently losing your temper, being sarcastic or bitter, or having physical fights\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】If you're aware that you have any of the signs or symptoms above, talk to your doctor or a mental health provider.\n\n【11】### If you have suicidal thoughts\n\n【12】If you have fantasies or mental images about hurting yourself or have other suicidal thoughts, get help right away by taking one of these actions:\n\n【13】*   Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.\n*   Contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S. call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat. Services are free and confidential.\n*   Call your mental health provider, doctor or other health care provider.\n*   Reach out to a loved one, close friend, trusted peer or co-worker.\n*   Contact someone from your faith community.\n\n【14】If you notice signs or symptoms in a family member or friend, talk to that person about seeing a doctor or mental health provider. But you can't force someone to seek help. If the relationship causes you significant stress, you may find it helpful to see a therapist yourself.\n\n【15】Causes\n------\n\n【16】As with other mental health disorders, the causes of borderline personality disorder aren't fully understood. In addition to environmental factors — such as a history of child abuse or neglect — borderline personality disorder may be linked to:\n\n【17】*   **Genetics.** Some studies of twins and families suggest that personality disorders may be inherited or strongly associated with other mental health disorders among family members.\n*   **Brain abnormalities.** Some research has shown changes in certain areas of the brain involved in emotion regulation, impulsivity and aggression. In addition, certain brain chemicals that help regulate mood, such as serotonin, may not function properly.\n\n【18】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【19】Some factors related to personality development can increase the risk of developing borderline personality disorder. These include:\n\n【20】*   **Hereditary predisposition.** You may be at a higher risk if a close relative — your mother, father, brother or sister — has the same or a similar disorder.\n*   **Stressful childhood.** Many people with the disorder report being sexually or physically abused or neglected during childhood. Some people have lost or were separated from a parent or close caregiver when they were young or had parents or caregivers with substance misuse or other mental health issues. Others have been exposed to hostile conflict and unstable family relationships.\n\n【21】Complications\n-------------\n\n【22】Borderline personality disorder can damage many areas of your life. It can negatively affect intimate relationships, jobs, school, social activities and self-image, resulting in:\n\n【23】*   Repeated job changes or losses\n*   Not completing an education\n*   Multiple legal issues, such as jail time\n*   Conflict-filled relationships, marital stress or divorce\n*   Self-injury, such as cutting or burning, and frequent hospitalizations\n*   Involvement in abusive relationships\n*   Unplanned pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, motor vehicle accidents and physical fights due to impulsive and risky behavior\n*   Attempted or completed suicide\n\n【24】In addition, you may have other mental health disorders, such as:\n\n【25】*   Depression\n*   Alcohol or other substance misuse\n*   Anxiety disorders\n*   Eating disorders\n*   Bipolar disorder\n*   Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n*   Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n*   Other personality disorders\n\n【26】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "77418f08-0205-4148-8f29-9b761b5f270e", "title": "Septoplasty", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Septoplasty (SEP-toe-plas-tee) is a surgical procedure to straighten the bone and cartilage dividing the space between your two nostrils (septum). When the septum is crooked, it's known as a deviated septum. A deviated septum can make it harder to breathe through your nose and can increase the risk of sinus infections due to poor drainage.\n\n【2】During septoplasty, your nasal septum is repositioned to the middle of your nose. This may require your surgeon to cut and remove parts of your nasal septum before reinserting them in the proper position.\n\n【3】Once a septoplasty is healed, you'll likely find it's easier to breathe. Your surgeon can discuss what septoplasty can achieve for you.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】A crooked septum is common. But when it's severe, a deviated septum can block one side of your nose and reduce airflow, causing difficulty breathing through one or both sides of your nose.\n\n【6】Septoplasty straightens the nasal septum by trimming, repositioning and replacing cartilage, bone or both.\n\n【7】If you experience symptoms — such as difficulty breathing through your nose — that affect your quality of life, you may consider surgery to fix a deviated septum.\n\n【8】Risks\n-----\n\n【9】As with any major surgery, septoplasty carries risks, such as bleeding, infection and an adverse reaction to the anesthetic. Other possible risks specific to septoplasty include:\n\n【10】*   Continued symptoms, such as nasal obstruction\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   A change in the shape of your nose\n*   A hole in the septum\n*   Decreased sense of smell\n*   Clotted blood in the nasal space that has to be drained\n*   Temporary numbness in the upper gum, teeth or nose\n\n【11】You may need additional surgery to treat some of these complications. You may also need additional surgery if the outcome of septoplasty doesn't match your expectations. Talk to your doctor about your specific risks before surgery.\n\n【12】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【13】Before scheduling septoplasty, you'll meet with your surgeon to discuss benefits and risks of the surgery. This meeting generally includes:\n\n【14】*   **Your medical history.** Your doctor will ask about conditions you have or have had, as well as any current medications or supplements that you're taking.\n*   **A physical examination.** You'll have a physical exam, including any relevant tests. The doctor will inspect your skin and the inside and outside of your nose.\n*   **Photographs.** Someone from your doctor's office may take photographs of your nose from different angles. Your doctor can use these photos for discussion before septoplasty or for reference during and after surgery.\n*   **A discussion of your expectations.** You and your doctor should talk about your expectations. He or she will explain what septoplasty can and can't do for you and what your results might be.\n\n【15】### Food and medications\n\n【16】Avoid medications containing aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) before and after surgery. These medications may increase bleeding. Take only those medications approved or prescribed by your surgeon.\n\n【17】### Other precautions\n\n【18】If you smoke, stop smoking. Smoking increases your risk of having problems during and after surgery. Smoking can slow the healing process.\n\n【19】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【20】Septoplasty straightens the nasal septum by trimming, repositioning and replacing cartilage or bone. The surgeon works through incisions inside the nose. Occasionally it is necessary to make a small incision between the nostrils.\n\n【21】If the nasal bones are crooked and pushing the septum off to one side, it may be necessary to make cuts in the bones of the nose to reposition them. Spreader grafts are small, reinforcing strips of cartilage that can be used to help correct a deviated septum when the problem is along the bridge of the nose. Sometimes these are necessary to effectively straighten the septum.\n\n【22】### During the procedure\n\n【23】The procedure may be done with either local or general anesthesia. Which type of anesthesia is used depends on how complex your surgery is, and what you and your surgeon prefer.\n\n【24】*   **Local anesthesia.** This type of anesthesia is limited to your nose. Your doctor injects pain-numbing medication (anesthetic) into your nasal tissues. If you'll also be sedated, this is done using IV medication. The medication makes you groggy but not fully unconscious.\n*   **General anesthesia.** With general anesthesia, you inhale an anesthetic agent or receive an anesthetic through an IV line. This type of anesthesia affects your entire body and induces a temporary state of unconsciousness.\n\n【25】Talk with your doctor beforehand about which kind of anesthesia is best for you.\n\n【26】During surgery, the incision is closed with absorbable suture. Soft silicone splints may be inserted inside each nostril to support the septum. To prevent postoperative bleeding, your doctor may place bandage-like material in your nose (packing).\n\n【27】After surgery, you're moved to a recovery room, where the staff monitors you and watches for any complications. This procedure is typically performed on an outpatient basis, so you'll likely be able to go home the same day. You will need someone to drive you home, however.\n\n【28】### After the procedure\n\n【29】To further decrease the chances of bleeding and swelling, your doctor may ask that you follow these precautions for several weeks after surgery. Depending on the extent of your surgery, you may not need to do all of these:\n\n【30】*   Elevate your head when you're sleeping.\n*   Don't blow your nose for several weeks.\n*   Wear clothes that fasten in the front; don't pull clothing, such as shirts or sweaters, over your head.\n*   Avoid strenuous activities, such as aerobics and jogging, for up to five weeks to avoid potentially causing a nosebleed.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】By three to six months after surgery, your nasal tissues will be relatively stable. It's still possible that cartilage and tissue may gradually move or reshape over time. Some changes can still occur for up to a year or more after surgery.\n\n【33】Most people find that septoplasty improves their symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, that were caused by a deviated septum. The level of improvement you can expect with septoplasty varies by person.\n\n【34】Some people find that their symptoms continue even after surgery and opt to undergo a second septoplasty to further refine the nose and septum.\n\n【35】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Documentation of control (15.0%) and factors that affect control (inhaler technique education, 7.6%; medication adherence assessment, 32.5%; and allergy evaluation, 32.5%) was not common and even less common for adults compared with children. A total of 22.2% of the enrolled patients had no asthma-related visit in the year before enrollment. Adherence to the nonmedication elements were higher in practices located in cities of more than 250,000 people and cities that used electronic medical records. Older patient age was negatively associated with guideline adherence.\n\n【7】### Conclusion and Relevance\n\n【8】Adherence to asthma guidelines is poor in primary care practices, leaving many opportunities for improvement.\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

This leaves the inner eyelid surface exposed and prone to irritation.\n\n【2】Ectropion is more common in older adults, and it generally affects only the lower eyelid. In severe ectropion, the entire length of the eyelid is turned out. In less severe ectropion, only one segment of the eyelid sags away from the eye.\n\n【3】Artificial tears and lubricating ointments can help relieve symptoms of ectropion. But usually surgery is needed to fully correct the condition.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Normally when you blink, your eyelids distribute tears evenly across your eyes, keeping the surfaces of the eyes lubricated. These tears drain into small openings on the inner part of your eyelids (puncta).\n\n【6】If you have ectropion, your lower lid pulls away from your eye and tears don't drain properly into the puncta. The resulting signs and symptoms can include:\n\n【7】*   **Watery eyes (excessive tearing).** Without proper drainage, your tears may pool and constantly flow over your eyelids.\n*   **Excessive dryness.** Ectropion can cause your eyes to feel dry, gritty and sandy.\n*   **Irritation.** Stagnant tears or dryness can irritate your eyes, causing a burning sensation and redness in your eyelids and the whites of your eyes.\n*   **Sensitivity to light.** Stagnant tears or dry eyes can irritate the surface of the cornea, making you sensitive to light.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】See your doctor if your eyes are constantly watering or irritated, or your eyelid seems to be sagging or drooping.\n\n【10】Seek immediate care if you have been diagnosed with ectropion and you experience:\n\n【11】*   Rapidly increasing redness in your eyes\n*   Sensitivity to light\n*   Decreasing vision\n\n【12】These are signs and symptoms of cornea exposure or ulcers, which can harm your vision.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】Ectropion can be caused by:\n\n【15】*   **Muscle weakness.** As you age, the muscles under your eyes tend to weaken, and tendons stretch out. These muscles and tendons hold your eyelid taut against your eye. When they weaken, your eyelid can begin to droop.\n*   **Facial paralysis.** Certain conditions, such as Bell's palsy, and certain types of tumors can paralyze facial nerves and muscles. Facial paralysis that affects eyelid muscles can lead to ectropion.\n*   **Scars or previous surgeries.** Skin that has been damaged by burns or trauma, such as a dog bite, can affect the way that your eyelid rests against your eye. Previous eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) can cause ectropion, particularly if a considerable amount of skin was removed from the eyelid at the time of surgery.\n*   **Eyelid growths.** Benign or cancerous growths on your eyelid can cause the lid to turn outward.\n*   **Genetic disorders.** Rarely is ectropion present at birth (congenital). When it is, it's usually associated with genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】Factors that increase your risk of developing ectropion include:\n\n【18】*   **Age.** The most common cause of ectropion is weakening muscle tissue associated with aging.\n*   **Previous eye surgeries.** People who have had eyelid surgery are at higher risk of developing ectropion later.\n*   **Previous cancer, burns or trauma.** If you've had spots of skin cancer on your face, facial burns or trauma, you're at higher risk of developing ectropion.\n\n【19】Complications\n-------------\n\n【20】Ectropion leaves your cornea irritated and exposed, making it more susceptible to drying. The result can be abrasions and ulcers on the cornea, which can threaten your vision.\n\n【21】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The diagnosis of STEMI is based on clinical characteristics and persistent ST-segment elevation as demonstrated by 12-lead electrocardiography. Patients with STEMI should undergo rapid assessment for reperfusion therapy, and a reperfusion strategy should be implemented promptly after the patient's contact with the health care system. Two methods are currently available for establishing timely coronary reperfusion: primary percutaneous coronary intervention and fibrinolytic therapy. Percutaneous coronary intervention is the preferred method but is not always available. Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants are critical adjuncts to reperfusion. This article summarizes the current evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of STEMI.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【30】### Dosing\n\n【31】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【32】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【33】To use levofloxacin ophthalmic solution (eye drops):\n\n【34】*   First, wash your hands. Then tilt the head back and pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to form a pouch. Drop the medicine into the pouch and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to come into contact with the infection.\n*   If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eyes properly, use another drop.\n*   To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed.\n\n【35】*   For ophthalmic solution dosage form:\n    *   For bacterial conjunctivitis:\n        *   Adults and children 1 year of age and older—Days 1 and 2: Put one to two drops in the affected eye(s) every two hours while awake. Do not put drops in more than 8 times a day. Days 3 through 7: Put one to two drops in the affected eye(s) every 4 hours while awake. Do not put drops in more than 4 times a day.\n        *   Infants and children up to 1 year of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【36】### Missed Dose\n\n【37】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【38】### Storage\n\n【39】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【40】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【41】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【42】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【43】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【44】If your eye infection does not improve within a few days, or if it becomes worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【45】This medicine may cause your eyes to become more sensitive to light than they are normally. Wearing sunglasses and avoiding too much exposure to bright light may help lessen the discomfort.\n\n【46】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【47】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【48】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【49】#### Less common\n\n【50】1.  body aches or pain\n2.  congestion\n3.  dryness or soreness of throat\n4.  runny nose\n5.  swelling of the eyelid\n6.  tender, swollen glands in neck\n7.  trouble in swallowing\n\n【51】1.

These two medicines belong to the group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) stimulants.\n\n【8】Amphetamine and dextroamphetamine combination works in the treatment of ADHD to increase attention and decrease restlessness in patients who are overactive, cannot concentrate, or are easily distracted.

Prescriptions cannot be refilled. A new prescription must be obtained from your doctor each time you need this medicine.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Capsule, Extended Release\n*   Tablet\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Blood pressure data were collected from medical records at Mayo Clinic, and serum cholesterol data were derived from the Mayo Clinic laboratory database. Data were stratified into 6 age groups.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】A total of 624 women and 608 men responded to the questionnaire. Population blood pressure data were available for 1956 women and 1084 men. Population serum cholesterol data were available for 17,042 women and 12,511 men. Except for women in the 30- to 39-yearold age group, less than 10% of the population sampled met 4 or 5 goals. Conversely, about 90% of the population met at least 1 goal, and about 80% met 1, 2, or 3 of the goals.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】The data from the Olmsted County population indicate considerable opportunity to reduce this population's burden of cardiovascular disease.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other effects may also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.\n\n【9】This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Powder for Solution\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

{"seq_id": "257b4151-a898-41af-8ff1-df62bc9f4359", "title": "Transverse myelitis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Transverse myelitis is an inflammation of both sides of one section of the spinal cord. This neurological disorder often damages the insulating material covering nerve cell fibers (myelin).\n\n【2】Transverse myelitis interrupts the messages that the spinal cord nerves send throughout the body. This can cause pain, muscle weakness, paralysis, sensory problems, or bladder and bowel dysfunction.\n\n【3】There are many different causes of transverse myelitis, including infections and immune system disorders that attack the body's tissues. It could also be caused by other myelin disorders, such as multiple sclerosis. Other conditions, such as a stroke of the spinal cord, are often confused with transverse myelitis, and these conditions require different treatment approaches.\n\n【4】Treatment for transverse myelitis includes medications and rehabilitative therapy. Most people with transverse myelitis recover at least partially. Those with severe attacks sometimes are left with major disabilities.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms of transverse myelitis usually develop over a few hours to a few days and may sometimes progress gradually over several weeks.\n\n【7】Transverse myelitis usually affects both sides of the body below the affected area of the spinal cord, but sometimes there are symptoms on just one side of the body.\n\n【8】Typical signs and symptoms include:\n\n【9】*   **Pain.** Transverse myelitis pain may begin suddenly in your lower back. Sharp pain may shoot down your legs or arms or around your chest or abdomen. Pain symptoms vary based on the part of your spinal cord that's affected.\n*   **Abnormal sensations.** Some people with transverse myelitis report sensations of numbness, tingling, coldness or burning. Some are especially sensitive to the light touch of clothing or to extreme heat or cold. You may feel as if something is tightly wrapping the skin of your chest, abdomen or legs.\n*   **Weakness in your arms or legs.** Some people notice heaviness in the legs, or that they're stumbling or dragging one foot. Others may develop severe weakness or even total paralysis.\n*   **Bladder and bowel problems.** This may include needing to urinate more frequently, urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating and constipation.\n\n【10】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【11】Call your doctor or get emergency medical care if you're experiencing signs and symptoms of transverse myelitis. A number of neurological disorders can cause sensory problems, weakness, and bladder or bowel dysfunction including compression of the spinal cord, which is a surgical emergency.\n\n【12】Another less common cause is a stroke of the spinal cord due to impaired blood circulation. This can be caused by blockage of a blood vessel that supplies blood to the spinal cord, which may occur with surgery of the aorta or increased clotting of the blood. It's important to get a prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】The exact reason for transverse myelitis is not known. Sometimes there is no known cause.\n\n【15】Viral, bacterial and fungal infections affecting the spinal cord may cause transverse myelitis. In most cases, the inflammatory disorder appears after recovery from the infection.\n\n【16】Viruses associated with transverse myelitis are:\n\n【17】*   Herpes viruses, including the one that causes shingles and chickenpox (zoster)\n*   Cytomegalovirus\n*   Epstein-Barr\n*   HIV\n*   Enteroviruses such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus\n*   West Nile\n*   Echovirus\n*   Zika\n*   Influenza\n*   Hepatitis B\n*   Mumps, measles and rubella\n\n【18】Other viruses may trigger an autoimmune reaction without directly infecting the spinal cord.\n\n【19】Bacterial infections that are associated with transverse myelitis include:\n\n【20】*   Lyme disease\n*   Syphilis\n*   Tuberculosis\n*   Actinomyces\n*   Pertussis\n*   Tetanus\n*   Diphtheria\n\n【21】Bacterial skin infections, gastroenteritis and certain types of bacterial pneumonia also may cause transverse myelitis.\n\n【22】Rarely, parasites and fungal infections may infect the spinal cord.\n\n【23】There are a number of inflammatory conditions that appear to cause the disorder:\n\n【24】*   **Multiple sclerosis** is a disorder in which the immune system destroys myelin surrounding nerves in your spinal cord and brain. Transverse myelitis can be the first sign of multiple sclerosis or represent a relapse. Transverse myelitis as a sign of multiple sclerosis usually causes symptoms on only one side of your body.\n*   **Neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease)** is a condition that causes inflammation and myelin loss around the spinal cord and the nerve in your eye that transmits information to your brain. Transverse myelitis associated with neuromyelitis optica usually affects both sides of your body.\n\n【25】    In addition to transverse myelitis, you may experience symptoms of damage to myelin of the optic nerve, including pain in the eye with movement and temporary vision loss. This can happen with or separately from transverse myelitis symptoms. However, some people with neuromyelitis optica don't experience eye-related problems and might have only recurrent episodes of transverse myelitis.\n\n【26】*   **Autoimmune disorders** probably contribute to transverse myelitis in some people. These disorders include lupus, which can affect multiple body systems, and Sjogren's syndrome, which causes severe dryness of the mouth and eyes.\n\n【27】    Transverse myelitis associated with an autoimmune disorder may be a warning sign of neuromyelitis optica. Neuromyelitis optica occurs more frequently in people with other autoimmune diseases.\n\n【28】*   **Vaccinations** for infectious diseases have occasionally been associated as a possible trigger. However, at this time the association is not strong enough to warrant limiting any vaccine.\n*   **Sarcoidosis** is a condition that leads to inflammation in many areas of the body, including the spinal cord and optic nerve. It may mimic neuromyelitis optica, but typically sarcoidosis symptoms develop more slowly. The cause of sarcoidosis isn't understood.\n\n【29】Complications\n-------------\n\n【30】People with transverse myelitis usually experience only one episode. However, complications often linger, including the following:\n\n【31】*   **Pain,** one of the most common debilitating long-term complications of the disorder.\n*   **Stiffness, tightness or painful spasms** in your muscles (muscle spasticity). This is most common in the buttocks and legs.\n*   **Partial or total paralysis** of your arms, legs or both. This may persist after the first symptoms.\n*   **Sexual dysfunction,** a common complication of transverse myelitis. Men may experience difficulty achieving an erection or reaching orgasm. Women may have difficulty reaching orgasm.\n*   **Depression or anxiety,** which is common in those with long-term complications because of the significant changes in lifestyle, the stress of chronic pain or disability, and the impact of sexual dysfunction on relationships.\n\n【32】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Rotation of nonopioids has not been found to be an effective strategy in clinical practice in most patients with RLS, but there have not been adequate studies of this approach.

The overall hazard ratio (HR) of osteoporosis after SOT was 5.14 (95% CI, 3.13-8.43), and the HR of related fractures was 5.76 (95% CI, 3.80-8.74). The highest HRs were observed in male patients (HR, 7.09; 95% CI, 3.09-16.3) and in those aged 50 years or younger (HR, 7.38; 95% CI, 2.46-22.1). In addition, SOT patients without any comorbidities had a 9.03-fold higher risk of osteoporosis than non-SOT participants (HR, 9.03; 95% CI, 5.29-15.4). To compare the risk of osteoporosis and related fractures in different recipients of SOT, the highest risk of osteoporosis and fractures was noted in patients receiving lung transplantation, followed by other types of SOT.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】We report high rates of metabolic bone disorders after SOT in chronic transplant patients over a long follow-up.

From October 27, 1967, through December 29, 2017, 1631 deaths (54%), 183 leukemic transformations (6%), 244 fibrotic progressions (14%), and 516 thrombotic events (17%) were recorded. Median overall survival (OS) was 18 years for ET, 15 years for PV, and 4.4 years for PMF ( _P_ <.05 for all intergroup comparisons). Inferior survival was documented in patients with ET diagnosed more recently (post-1990) ( _P_ <.001), whereas survival data were time independent in PV and PMF. After conventional risk stratification, OS in low-risk ET and low-risk PV were superimposed ( _P_ \\=.89) but each differed significantly from that of age- and sex-matched controls ( _P_ <.001). Leukemia-free survival was similar for ET and PV ( _P_ \\=.22) and significantly worse with PMF ( _P_ <.001). Compared with ET, PV was associated with higher risk of fibrotic progression ( _P_ <.001). Thrombosis risk after diagnosis was highest in PV and lowest in PMF ( _P_ \\=.002 for PV vs ET; _P_ \\=.56 for ET vs PMF; and _P_ \\=.001 for PV vs PMF).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】This study provides the most mature survival and outcomes data in MPNs and highlights MPN subgroup risk categorization as key in appraising disease natural history.

However, in most people, pain begins around the navel and then moves. As inflammation worsens, appendicitis pain typically increases and eventually becomes severe.\n\n【3】Although anyone can develop appendicitis, most often it occurs in people between the ages of 10 and 30. Standard treatment is surgical removal of the appendix.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of appendicitis may include:\n\n【6】*   Sudden pain that begins on the right side of the lower abdomen\n*   Sudden pain that begins around your navel and often shifts to your lower right abdomen\n*   Pain that worsens if you cough, walk or make other jarring movements\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Low-grade fever that may worsen as the illness progresses\n*   Constipation or diarrhea\n*   Abdominal bloating\n*   Flatulence\n\n【7】The site of your pain may vary, depending on your age and the position of your appendix. When you're pregnant, the pain may seem to come from your upper abdomen because your appendix is higher during pregnancy.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】Make an appointment with a doctor if you or your child has worrisome signs or symptoms. Severe abdominal pain requires immediate medical attention.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】A blockage in the lining of the appendix that results in infection is the likely cause of appendicitis. The bacteria multiply rapidly, causing the appendix to become inflamed, swollen and filled with pus. If not treated promptly, the appendix can rupture.\n\n【12】Complications\n-------------\n\n【13】Appendicitis can cause serious complications, such as:\n\n【14】*   **A ruptured appendix.** A rupture spreads infection throughout your abdomen (peritonitis). Possibly life-threatening, this condition requires immediate surgery to remove the appendix and clean your abdominal cavity.\n*   **A pocket of pus that forms in the abdomen.** If your appendix bursts, you may develop a pocket of infection (abscess). In most cases, a surgeon drains the abscess by placing a tube through your abdominal wall into the abscess. The tube is left in place for about two weeks, and you're given antibiotics to clear the infection.\n\n【15】    Once the infection is clear, you'll have surgery to remove the appendix. In some cases, the abscess is drained, and the appendix is removed immediately.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Dietary factors were based on a Viocare, Inc, food frequency questionnaire administered during a baseline in-person study visit. Logistic regression compared dietary risk factors between incident symptomatic stone formers and controls. Incident stone formers were followed up for validated symptomatic recurrence in the medical record. Cox proportional hazards models estimated risk of symptomatic recurrence with dietary factors. Analyses adjusted for fluid intake, energy intake, and nondietary risk factors.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In fully adjusted analyses, lower dietary calcium, potassium, caffeine, phytate, and fluid intake were all associated with a higher odds of an incident symptomatic kidney stone. Among incident stone formers, 73 experienced symptomatic recurrence during a median 4.1 years of follow-up. Adjusting for body mass index, fluid intake, and energy intake, lower dietary calcium and lower potassium intake were predictive of symptomatic kidney stone recurrence. With further adjustment for nondietary risk factors, lower dietary calcium intake remained a predictor of recurrence, but lower potassium intake only remained a predictor of recurrence among those not taking thiazide diuretics or calcium supplements.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Enriching diets in stone formers with foods high in calcium and potassium may help prevent recurrent symptomatic kidney stones.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AIC ( Akaike Information Criterion ), BMI ( body mass index ), FFQ ( food frequency questionnaire ), IQR ( interquartile range ), ROKS ( Recurrence of Kidney Stone )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "5a95a6d1-88fd-450b-ac44-4f33ad4e3f41", "title": "Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS)", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a type of motor neuron disease that causes the nerve cells in the brain that control movement to fail over time. PLS causes weakness in your voluntary muscles, such as those you use to control your legs, arms and tongue. You may experience movement problems, such as difficulty with balance, slow movements and clumsiness. You may eventually experience problems with chewing, swallowing and speaking.\n\n【2】This rare condition can develop at any age, but it usually occurs between ages 40 and 60 and is more common in males than females. A very rare subtype of PLS, known as juvenile primary lateral sclerosis, begins in early childhood and is caused by an abnormal gene passed from parents to children.\n\n【3】PLS is often mistaken for another, more common motor neuron disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While likely related to ALS, PLS progresses more slowly than ALS and in most cases isn't fatal.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of primary lateral sclerosis usually take years to progress and generally begin in the legs. Rarely, PLS begins in your tongue or hands and then progresses down your spinal cord to your legs. However, the disease has highly variable effects from person to person. Signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【6】*   Stiffness, weakness and muscle spasms (spasticity) in your legs, rarely starting in one leg, and eventually progressing to your arms, hands, tongue and jaw\n*   Slowed movement\n*   Tripping, clumsiness and difficulty with balance\n*   Hand clumsiness\n*   Hoarseness, as well as slowed, slurred speech and drooling\n*   Difficulties with chewing and swallowing\n*   Sometimes, frequent, rapid and intense shifts in emotions (mood lability)\n*   Rarely, breathing problems and bladder problems late in the disease\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Make an appointment to see your doctor if you have persistent problems with stiffness or weakness in your legs or arms, or with swallowing or speaking.\n\n【9】If your child develops involuntary muscle spasms or seems to be losing balance more often than usual, make an appointment with a pediatrician for an evaluation.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】In primary lateral sclerosis, the nerve cells in the brain that control movement (upper motor neurons) slowly break down and fail over time. This makes the nerves unable to activate the motor neurons in the spinal cord, which control voluntary muscles. This loss causes movement problems, such as difficulty with balance, weakness, slowed movement and clumsiness, and problems with speech and swallowing.\n\n【12】### Adult-onset primary lateral sclerosis\n\n【13】The cause of PLS that begins in adulthood is unknown. In most cases, it's not an inherited disease, and it's not known why or how it begins.\n\n【14】### Juvenile primary lateral sclerosis\n\n【15】Juvenile PLS is caused by mutations in a gene called ALS2.\n\n【16】Although researchers don't understand how this gene causes the disease, they know that the ALS2 gene gives instructions for creating a protein called alsin, which is present in motor neuron cells. When the instructions are changed in someone with juvenile PLS, the protein alsin becomes unstable and doesn't work properly, which in turn impairs normal muscle function.\n\n【17】Juvenile PLS is an autosomal recessive inherited disease, meaning that both parents have to be carriers of the gene to pass it to their child, even though they don't have the disease themselves.\n\n【18】Complications\n-------------\n\n【19】Average progression of primary lateral sclerosis can take as long as 20 years and has highly variable effects from person to person. Some people continue to walk, but others eventually need to use wheelchairs or other assistive devices.\n\n【20】In most cases, adult-onset PLS isn't thought to shorten life expectancy, but it can gradually affect the quality of your life as more muscles become disabled. Weaker muscles can cause you to fall, which can result in injuries. Problems with chewing and swallowing may result in poor nutrition. Performing activities of daily living, such as bathing and dressing, may become difficult.\n\n【21】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Bursitis occurs when bursae become inflamed.\n\n【2】The most common locations for bursitis are in the shoulder, elbow and hip. But you can also have bursitis by your knee, heel and the base of your big toe. Bursitis often occurs near joints that perform frequent repetitive motion.\n\n【3】Treatment typically involves resting the affected joint and protecting it from further trauma. In most cases, bursitis pain goes away within a few weeks with proper treatment, but recurrent flare-ups of bursitis are common.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】If you have bursitis, the affected joint might:\n\n【6】*   Feel achy or stiff\n*   Hurt more when you move it or press on it\n*   Look swollen and red\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Consult your doctor if you have:\n\n【9】*   Disabling joint pain\n*   Sudden inability to move a joint\n*   Excessive swelling, redness, bruising or a rash in the affected area\n*   Sharp or shooting pain, especially when you exercise or exert yourself\n*   A fever\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】The most common causes of bursitis are repetitive motions or positions that put pressure on the bursae around a joint. Examples include:\n\n【12】*   Throwing a baseball or lifting something over your head repeatedly\n*   Leaning on your elbows for long periods\n*   Extensive kneeling for tasks such as laying carpet or scrubbing floors\n\n【13】Other causes include injury or trauma to the affected area, inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and infection.\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】Anyone can develop bursitis, but certain factors can increase your risk:\n\n【16】*   **Age.** Bursitis becomes more common with aging.\n*   **Occupations or hobbies.** If your work or hobby requires repetitive motion or pressure on particular bursae, your risk of developing bursitis increases. Examples include carpet laying, tile setting, gardening, painting and playing a musical instrument.\n*   **Other medical conditions.** Certain systemic diseases and conditions — such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and diabetes — increase your risk of developing bursitis. Being overweight can increase your risk of developing hip and knee bursitis.\n\n【17】Prevention\n----------\n\n【18】While not all types of bursitis can be prevented, you can reduce your risk and the severity of flare-ups by changing the way you do certain tasks. Examples include:\n\n【19】*   **Using kneeling pads.** Use some type of padding to reduce the pressure on your knees if your job or hobby requires a lot of kneeling.\n*   **Lifting properly.** Bend your knees when you lift. Failing to do so puts extra stress on the bursae in your hips.\n*   **Wheeling heavy loads.** Carrying heavy loads puts stress on the bursae in your shoulders. Use a dolly or a wheeled cart instead.\n*   **Taking frequent breaks.** Alternate repetitive tasks with rest or other activities.\n*   **Maintaining a healthy weight.** Being overweight places more stress on your joints.\n*   **Exercising.** Strengthening your muscles can help protect your affected joint.\n*   **Warming up and stretching** before strenuous activities to protect your joints from injury.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "415aad54-8454-40c3-bbe5-b5c38ba24814", "title": "Cyclothymia (cyclothymic disorder)", "text": "【0】Cyclothymia (cyclothymic disorder)\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】Cyclothymia (sy-kloe-THIE-me-uh), also called cyclothymic disorder, is a rare mood disorder. Cyclothymia causes emotional ups and downs, but they're not as extreme as those in bipolar I or II disorder.\n\n【2】With cyclothymia, you experience periods when your mood noticeably shifts up and down from your baseline. You may feel on top of the world for a time, followed by a low period when you feel somewhat down. Between these cyclothymic highs and lows, you may feel stable and fine.\n\n【3】Although the highs and lows of cyclothymia are less extreme than those of bipolar disorder, it's critical to seek help managing these symptoms because they can interfere with your ability to function and increase your risk of bipolar I or II disorder.\n\n【4】Treatment options for cyclothymia include talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications and close, ongoing follow-up with your doctor.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Cyclothymia symptoms alternate between emotional highs and lows. The highs of cyclothymia include symptoms of an elevated mood (hypomanic symptoms). The lows consist of mild or moderate depressive symptoms.\n\n【7】Cyclothymia symptoms are similar to those of bipolar I or II disorder, but they're less severe. When you have cyclothymia, you can typically function in your daily life, though not always well. The unpredictable nature of your mood shifts may significantly disrupt your life because you never know how you're going to feel.\n\n【8】### Hypomanic symptoms\n\n【9】Signs and symptoms of the highs of cyclothymia may include:\n\n【10】*   An exaggerated feeling of happiness or well-being (euphoria)\n*   Extreme optimism\n*   Inflated self-esteem\n*   Talking more than usual\n*   Poor judgment that can result in risky behavior or unwise choices\n*   Racing thoughts\n*   Irritable or agitated behavior\n*   Excessive physical activity\n*   Increased drive to perform or achieve goals (sexual, work related or social)\n*   Decreased need for sleep\n*   Tendency to be easily distracted\n*   Inability to concentrate\n\n【11】### Depressive symptoms\n\n【12】Signs and symptoms of the lows of cyclothymia may include:\n\n【13】*   Feeling sad, hopeless or empty\n*   Tearfulness\n*   Irritability, especially in children and teenagers\n*   Loss of interest in activities once considered enjoyable\n*   Changes in weight\n*   Feelings of worthlessness or guilt\n*   Sleep problems\n*   Restlessness\n*   Fatigue or feeling slowed down\n*   Problems concentrating\n*   Thinking of death or suicide\n\n【14】### When to see a doctor\n\n【15】If you have any symptoms of cyclothymia, seek medical help as soon as possible. Cyclothymia generally doesn't get better on its own. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, work up the courage to confide in someone who can help you take that first step.\n\n【16】If a loved one has symptoms of cyclothymia, talk openly and honestly with that person about your concerns. You can't force someone to seek professional help, but you can offer support and help find a qualified doctor or mental health provider.\n\n【17】### Suicidal thoughts\n\n【18】Although suicidal thoughts might occur with cyclothymia, they're more likely to occur if you have bipolar I or II disorder. If you're considering suicide right now:\n\n【19】*   Call 911 or your local emergency services number, or go to a hospital emergency department.\n*   Contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S. call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat. Services are free and confidential.\n\n【20】If you just can't make that call, reach out to someone else — immediately — such as your doctor, mental health provider, family member, friend or someone in your faith community.\n\n【21】Causes\n------\n\n【22】It's not known specifically what causes cyclothymia. As with many mental health disorders, research shows that it may result from a combination of:\n\n【23】*   **Genetics,** as cyclothymia tends to run in families\n*   **Differences in the way the brain works,** such as changes in the brain's neurobiology\n*   **Environmental issues,** such as traumatic experiences or prolonged periods of stress\n\n【24】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【25】Cyclothymia is thought to be relatively rare. But true estimates are hard to make because people may be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as having other mood disorders, such as depression.\n\n【26】Cyclothymia typically starts during the teenage years or young adulthood. It affects about the same number of males and females.\n\n【27】Complications\n-------------\n\n【28】If you have cyclothymia:\n\n【29】*   Not treating it can result in significant emotional problems that affect every area of your life\n*   There is a high risk of later developing bipolar I or II disorder\n*   Substance misuse is common\n*   You may also have an anxiety disorder\n*   You may be at increased risk of suicidal thoughts and suicide\n\n【30】Prevention\n----------\n\n【31】There's no sure way to prevent cyclothymia. However, treatment at the earliest indication of a mental health disorder can help prevent cyclothymia from worsening. Long-term preventive treatment also can help prevent minor symptoms from becoming full-blown episodes of hypomania, mania or major depression.\n\n【32】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The study involved pre- and posttest genetic counseling and completion of 4 surveys related to the experience and outcomes. Whole-exome sequencing was conducted on DNA from blood from each person.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Most variants (76,305 per person; range, 74,505-77,387) were known benign allelic variants, variants in genes of unknown function, or variants of uncertain significance in genes of known function. The results of suspected pathogenic/pathogenic variants in Mendelian disorders and pharmacogenomic variants were disclosed.

She had experienced falls and walking into lockers in her new school. The patient had no recent infections or vaccinations. She recounted several vertiginous episodes, with the first occurring 1 year previously, each resolving in 1 week. Neurologic examination showed inconsistent responses to visual field testing, right-sided hemiparesis, and gait ataxia. She had no headache, meningismus, or confusion. An ophthalmologic examination documented normal visual acuity and pupil responses. T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1 axial and sagittal magnetic resonance images showed numerous hyperintense lesions in the periventricular white matter, brainstem, and spinal cord, many of which showed enhancement with gadolinium.

For each ERT case, up to 2 controls matched for age (±10 years), sex, and type of procedure were identified. A chart review was performed to identify factors that may be associated with ERT activation.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We identified 181 postoperative ERT calls, 113 (62%) of which occurred within 12 hours of discharge from the postanesthesia care unit, for an incidence of 2 per 1000 anesthetic administrations (0.2%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed the following factors to be associated with increased odds for postoperative ERT activation: preoperative central nervous system comorbidity (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 2.53; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.20-5.32; _P_ \\=.01), preoperative opioid use (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.30-3.10; _P_ \\=.002), intraoperative use of phenylephrine infusion (OR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.08-8.66; _P_ \\=.04), and increased intraoperative fluid administration (per 500-mL increase, OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; _P_ \\=.03). ERT patients had longer hospital stays, higher complication rates, and increased 30-day mortality compared with controls.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Preoperative opioid use, history of central neurologic disease, and intraoperative hemodynamic instability are associated with postoperative decompensation requiring ERT intervention. Patients with these clinical characteristics may benefit from discharge to progressive or intensive care units in the early postoperative period.\n\n【9】Emergency response teams (ERTs) have been introduced by hospitals to evaluate and manage hospitalized patients whose condition is acutely deteriorating.

Because we were primarily interested in perioperative factors, our study was limited to ERTs activated within the first 48 postoperative hours. Identification of factors associated with increased risk for these events may help to better triage patients and minimize adverse postoperative outcomes.\n\n【41】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【42】The approval for review of medical records was obtained from the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board in Rochester, MN. This study employed a retrospective case-control design that assessed potential factors associated with the need for an ERT activation after either surgery or diagnostic procedures that required anesthesia.\n\n【43】The Department of Anesthesiology at Mayo Clinic prospectively maintains a log of all ERT activations that occur at 2 Mayo Clinic-affiliated hospitals in Rochester: Saint Marys and Methodist. Using this log, we identified adult patients who required ERT activation within 48 hours of discharge from the PACU to regular wards from June 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009. (Regular ward refers to a standard nursing ward where patient vital signs are assessed at protocol-defined intervals as well as when clinically indicated. Care may include continuous pulse oximetry but not invasive monitoring as in an ICU or progressive care unit setting.) By June 1, 2008, the ERT activation log system had been fully implemented and was capturing 100% of events. The 48-hour time window was selected to allow identification of factors directly related to the intraoperative course. Surgical patients discharged to monitored wards were excluded. ( _Monitored ward_ is defined as an advanced patient care ward where patient vital signs are continually monitored as in an ICU or other specialized patient care areas where continual monitoring is indicated, eg, progressive care unit.) Patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, bronchoscopy, or childbirth were excluded. For each patient who required ERT activation, we used the Mayo Clinic medical record database to identify potential controls of the same sex and similar age (±10 years) who underwent the same procedure (as determined from _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision_ procedure codes) during the study period and did not have ERT activation in the first 48 postoperative hours. From these pools of potential controls, we randomly selected up to 2 controls for each ERT patient. For cases in which fewer than 2 potential controls could be identified, we did not select alternative controls.\n\n【44】### Indications for ERT Activations\n\n【45】At our institution an ERT consists of either a rapid response team (RRT) or code team. An RRT call can be initiated by any health care team member concerned about the acutely deteriorating medical condition of a patient. Typically at our institution, RRT calls are prompted as described by others,\n\n【46】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bellomo R.\n*   Goldsmith D.\n*   Uchino S.\n\n【47】Prospective controlled trial of effect of medical emergency team on postoperative morbidity and mortality rates.\n\n【48】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Crit Care Med._ 2004; 32 : 916-921</u></u>\n\n【49】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (377)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【50】and indications include the following: decline in oxyhemoglobin saturation (assessed by either pulse oximetry or clinical assessment), bradypnea, tachypnea, profound bradycardia or tachycardia, hypotension, concern for possible heart attack (“chest pain”), stroke (acute neurologic deficits), or acute mental status changes (agitation, delirium). However, an RRT call can be initiated for any other indication at the discretion of the health care team member. The RRT consists of an attending physician board-certified in critical care medicine, a critical care fellow or senior anesthesia resident, a respiratory therapist, and a critical care registered nurse. Code team activations are reserved for immediate life-threatening events (cardiopulmonary arrest, severe respiratory compromise that is assessed to require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation) or profoundly unstable cardiac conditions (possibly requiring cardioversion, defibrillation). The code team is similar in structure to the RRT but consists of an additional critical care registered nurse, an internal medicine resident, and a pharmacist. The level of ERT (RRT or code team) activation is left to the discretion of the individual health care team member (ie, nurse caring for an unstable patient); thus it is prone to subjectivity. Therefore, the level of activation occasionally is erroneous (making a “mistake on the safe side” by activating the code team when the RRT would have been more appropriate). Regardless, the roles and capabilities of these 2 teams are closely interrelated. Because our interest was to examine patients who had an acute postoperative deterioration, we analyzed all ERT interventions, regardless of the level of activation.\n\n【51】### Data Abstraction\n\n【52】Electronic medical records were abstracted for demographics; comorbid conditions; preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables; postoperative course and complications; and details of the ERT activation.

Data abstracted included the probable primary cause of the ERT activation: hypotension from hypovolemia or distributive shock, respiratory cause, cardiac cause, hypertensive crisis, neurologic causes such as mental status changes, uncontrolled pain, psychiatric reasons, or drug reactions. The following interventions were recorded: respiratory (tracheal intubation, application of a noninvasive ventilatory device such as a continuous positive airway pressure device, bronchodilator administration), cardiac (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation or cardioversion, administration of vasoactive drugs, nitroglycerin, antiarrhythmic drugs, or diuretics), intravenous fluid bolus or blood product administration, glucose administration, or administration of analgesics, sedatives, naloxone, flumazenil, or antipsychotics. Immediate outcome of the ERT was categorized as follows: remained in the previous hospital setting with or without intervention, transfer to a monitored ward, transfer to the operating room for exploration or treatment, or death.\n\n【65】### Outcomes\n\n【66】Postoperative complications that occurred within the first 30 postoperative days were reported. Information was obtained from the medical records from the index hospitalization, rehospitalization, or outpatient visits. A 30-day mortality rate was calculated. Postoperative complications included myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, respiratory failure requiring tracheal reintubation, acute kidney injury (serum creatinine increase >1 mg/dL and above 1.5 mg/dL \\[to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4\\]), thromboembolic event, sepsis or multiorgan failure, blood transfusion requirement, or death. Causes of death were recorded. Total days in the ICU and hospital were recorded.\n\n【67】### Statistical Analyses\n\n【68】Data are summarized using mean ± SD or median with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables and frequency percentage for nominal variables. To estimate the incidence of ERT activation, a denominator was obtained using information provided by the revenue accounting office; it was based on patient counts after excluding all surgical or procedural categories of patients expected to be admitted to monitored wards (eg, cardiac, major vascular, thoracic). Of note, this denominator was not reduced to account for other planned or unplanned admissions to monitored wards in patients undergoing operations that do not routinely require this level of postoperative care. Two sets of analyses comparing characteristics between ERT cases and controls were performed. One analysis included all ERT cases and compared characteristics between cases and controls using the 2-sample _t_ test for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. The other analysis excluded ERT cases for which no matched controls could be identified and was performed using conditional logistic regression, taking into account the matched study design. Characteristics found to have evidence ( _P_ <.05) of an association in univariate analyses were included as explanatory variables in a multiple logistic regression model with ERT activation as the dependent variable. In all cases, 2-tailed _P_ values of .05 or less were considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (Version 9.2, SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC).\n\n【69】Results\n-------\n\n【70】During the study period approximately 95,000 patients underwent surgery or diagnostic procedures requiring anesthesia and were discharged to a regular ward. Of those, 181 patients required ERT activation within 48 hours; therefore, the estimated rate of ERT activation in this population was 2 per 1000 anesthetic administrations (0.2%). Of these events, 168 (93%) were RRT, and 13 (7%) were code team activations. Of the code team activations, 6 met the institutional definition of a code (5 patients received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and in one patient the trachea was intubated to protect the airway in the context of acute mental status changes). In the other 7 patients, the code team was activated for reasons other than cardiopulmonary collapse (eg, transient syncope, hypotension). Of the entire cohort, 81 patients (45%) underwent general or urologic surgery; 62 (34%), orthopedic surgery; 19 (10%), gynecologic surgery; 11 (6%), otolaryngological surgery; 5 (3%), neurosurgery; and l3 (7%), diagnostic procedures or minor operations requiring anesthetic care outside the operating room.\n\n【71】The majority (N=113; 62.4%) of ERT interventions occurred during the first 12 hours after surgery, and more than three-fourths (142; 78.5%) occurred within the first 24 hours 删除4:<u>( Figure )</u>. The mean time from ERT activation to team arrival was 4±2 minutes. Table 1 describes the reasons for ERT activation and types of interventions. The most frequent reasons for ERT activation were hypotension in 58 patients (32%), cardiac in 36 (20%), and pulmonary in 31 (17%). In all cases a physician on the ERT assessed the patient and made decisions regarding treatment and disposition. Immediate outcomes of ERT activation are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【72】FIGURE Cumulative frequency of time to emergency response team (ERT) activation.\n\n【73】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【74】TABLE 1 Causes for Emergency Response Team (ERT) Activation and Specific Interventions During ERT Call\n\n| Characteristic | Patients (N=181) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes for ERT activation | Causes for ERT activation |\n| Hypotension | 58 (32) |\n| Cardiac | 36 (20) |\n| Pulmonary | 31 (17) |\n| Neurologic | 23 (13) |\n| Pain/psychiatric issues | 17 (9) |\n| Drug interactions | 12 (7) |\n| Hypertension | 3 (2) |\n| Epistaxis | 1 (1) |\n| Specific interventions | Specific interventions |\n| Chest compressions | 5 (3) |\n| Defibrillation/cardioversion | 2 (1) |\n| Tracheal intubation | 5 (3) |\n| Noninvasive ventilation | 9 (5) |\n| Other interventions and medications administered | Other interventions and medications administered |\n| Intravenous fluid bolus | 63 (35) |\n| Naloxone | 16 (9) |\n| Opioids | 12 (7) |\n| Blood transfusion | 10 (6) |\n| Vasopressors (epinephrine, phenylephrine) | 5 (3) |\n| Bronchodilator | 5 (3) |\n| Benzodiazepine | 3 (2) |\n| Anticholinergic (atropine) | 2 (1) |\n| Flumazenil | 2 (1) |\n| Antiarrhythmic (amiodarone) | 2 (1) |\n| Diuretic (furosemide) | 1 (1) |\n| 50% glucose intravenous bolus | 2 (1) |\n| Antihypertensive (labetalol, hydralazine) | 1 (1) |\n| Nitroglycerin | 1 (1) |\n| Immediate outcome | Immediate outcome |\n| Death | 2 (1) |\n| Transfer to surgery | 4 (2) |\n| Transfer to monitored ward | 71 (39) |\n| Treatment on regular ward | 57 (32) |\n| Continued observation on regular ward | 47 (26) |\n\n【76】Data are presented as No. (percentage).\n\n【77】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【78】The median ICU length of stay of patients transferred to a monitored ward was 2 days (IQR, 2-4 days).

Clinical and demographic features of ERT cases and controls are summarized in Table 2 . ERT and control groups were similar with the exceptions of higher rates of central neurologic diseases and preoperative use of opioid analgesics in ERT patients. Among 18 ERT patients (10%) with preexisting central neurologic diseases, 5 (28%) had an ERT activation for worsening neurologic status.

To avoid serious morbidities, it is important to anticipate potential problems so that preemptive measures can be implemented. Our study demonstrated that preoperative scheduled use of opioids, history of central neurologic disease, and hemodynamic instability during surgery were characteristics independently associated with unexpected deterioration within the first 48 postoperative hours. The majority of ERT calls occurred within the first 24 postoperative hours, most often for hypotension, mental status changes, or respiratory problems. Despite the fact that some patients in the ERT cohort required minimal to no intervention, ERT patients had more severe in-hospital complications.\n\n【115】ERTs have been established to intervene quickly to mitigate sudden deterioration of patients' health. Although this initiative intuitively appears effective, ERT outcomes are difficult to assess.

At our institution we correct brief episodes of hypotension with boluses of ephedrine or phenylephrine but typically initiate phenylephrine infusions, in addition to fluid boluses, when hypotension persists. Of note, these patients received more intraoperative fluids (crystalloids and colloids) compared with the average amounts given to the remainder of ERT patients 删除4:<u>(see footnote to Table 3 )</u>. We consequently used the initiation of “phenylephrine infusion” as a surrogate for more pronounced hemodynamic instability. At our institution, phenylephrine infusion is considered a temporizing measure to correct for factors associated with perioperative hypotension, and it is widely viewed as a benign intervention. However, among ERT patients who required phenylephrine infusion, postoperative hypotension was the most common indication for ERT activation. Therefore, our perception that a phenylephrine infusion is not a marker for subsequent instability, even after a stable hemodynamic course in the PACU, needs to be reexamined. Another study demonstrated that intraoperative hypotension predicts postoperative adverse events.\n\n【204】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kheterpal S.\n*   O'Reilly M.\n*   Englesbe M.J.\n\n【205】Preoperative and intraoperative predictors of cardiac adverse events after general, vascular, and urological surgery.\n\n【206】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Anesthesiology._ 2009; 110 : 58-66</u></u>\n\n【207】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (196)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【208】A third predictor was a history of central neurologic disease.

This suggests that the aggressive volume replacement combined with intensive monitoring maintained hemodynamic stability throughout the PACU stay. However, the underlying comorbidities or conditions that led to subsequent instability after discharge to a regular ward were either not manifest or not recognized in the PACU.\n\n【234】This is a retrospective study with all inherent limitations. Because we limited our study to ERT calls during the first 48 postoperative hours, we could have missed significant complications that occurred outside that time frame but still were related to anesthesia and surgery. Despite the existence of well-defined clinical criteria for ERT activation, considerable subjectivity is involved. More specifically, activation is triggered typically by allied health care professionals with varied levels of training; therefore, some ERT activations were initiated for noncritical reasons (eg, epistaxis), which affects the ability to identify factors associated with increased odds for more severe events. This is reflected in our data in that 47 ERT activations (26%) resulted in no intervention by the team. This is also the reason why we decided to include cases from both RRT and code team activations; ie, the reasons why one team was activated over the other are at times arbitrary. Regardless, we think that activation of either team represents an acute unexpected health decompensation and thus is relevant for study. We believe our reported incidence represents an underestimate because invariably some patients were discharged to the ICU for other reasons but were still included in the denominator. However, our incidence of 0.2% is similar to a previous report.\n\n【235】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lee A.\n*   Lum M.E.\n*   O'Regan W.J.\n*   Hillman K.M.</u>\n\n【236】Early postoperative emergencies requiring an intensive care team intervention: the role of ASA physical status and after-hours surgery.\n\n【237】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Anaesthesia._ 1998; 53 : 529-535</u></u>\n\n【238】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (30)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【239】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【240】Patients with preoperative central neurologic disease, scheduled preoperative opioid use, or intraoperative hemodynamic instability were found to be at increased risk for ERT activation within 48 postoperative hours.

Cech (1947- ) for their discovery that RNA actively aids chemical reactions in cells. Working independently, Altman and Cech discovered a new role for RNA. It was believed that enzymatic activity—the triggering and acceleration of vital chemical reactions within living cells—was exclusively the work of proteins. Their revolutionary discovery was that RNA, considered to be a carrier of genetic codes between parts of the cell, also had an enzymatic function. This discovery opened up new fields of scientific research and biotechnology and provided insight into how cells function.\n\n【2】Altman was born on May 7, 1939, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Although he became a US citizen in 1984, he retained his Canadian citizenship. In 1960, he received a BS degree in physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. From 1960 to 1962, he was a teaching assistant at Columbia University in New York City. Later, he enrolled at the University of Colorado in Boulder, from which he received a PhD degree in biophysics in 1967.\n\n【3】From 1967 to 1969, Altman was a research fellow in molecular biology at Harvard University in Cambridge. In 1969 and 1970, he worked in the group headed by Drs Sydney Brenner (1927-) and Francis Crick (1916-2004) at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, University of Cambridge, England. In 1971, he joined the biology department of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and rose from assistant professor to full professor in 1980. From 1983 to 1985, he was department chair at Yale University, and from 1985 to 1989, he was Dean of Yale College.\n\n【4】In 1982, Thomas Cech, working at the University of Colorado in Boulder, had shown that RNA sometimes served as a biocatalyst—a role previously believed to belong exclusively to proteins. Cech's work was related to a reaction in which the RNA was a self-catalyst.\n\n【5】Altman investigated other catalytic activity of RNA. He worked with ribonuclease-P (an enzyme composed of RNA and a protein), which catalyzes the processing of transfer RNA. Both the protein and RNA were thought to be necessary for the enzyme to work at the cellular level. Altman found that, in vitro, ribonuclease-P alone could splice the transfer RNA molecule at the correct site. The unaccompanied protein showed no such activity.\n\n【6】The final proof of Altman's work came when a recombinant RNA template was used to produce only the RNA part of ribonuclease-P. The artificial RNA still catalyzed the appropriate activity without any associated protein. Altman's work undercut the dogma that molecules could either carry information, like RNA, or catalyze chemical reactions, like proteins, but could not do both. For this work on ribonuclease-P, Sidney Altman was awarded a share of the 1989 Nobel Prize for chemistry. In 2001, the islands of Antigua and Barbuda issued a stamp (Scott No. 2518d) to honor Sidney Altman.\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【9】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.01.022</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>© 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

{"seq_id": "ff60f381-37d4-4a74-9f43-20ce007096e6", "title": "Hiccups", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Hiccups are repeated spasms or sudden movements of the diaphragm that you can't control. The diaphragm is the muscle that separates your chest from your stomach area and plays an important role in breathing. A spasm in your diaphragm causes your vocal cords to suddenly close, producing a \"hic\" sound.\n\n【2】Eating a large meal, drinking alcoholic or carbonated beverages, or getting excited suddenly may cause hiccups. In some cases, hiccups may be a sign of an underlying medical issue. For most people, hiccups usually last only a few minutes. Rarely, hiccups may continue for months. When they last that long, they can result in weight loss and extreme tiredness.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Symptoms include uncontrolled spasms in your diaphragm and a \"hic\" sound. Sometimes you may feel a slight tightening sensation in your chest, stomach area or throat.\n\n【5】### When to see a doctor\n\n【6】Make an appointment to see your health care provider if your hiccups last more than 48 hours or if they're so severe that they cause issues with eating, sleeping or breathing.\n\n【7】Causes\n------\n\n【8】The most common triggers for hiccups that last less than 48 hours include:\n\n【9】*   Drinking carbonated beverages.\n*   Drinking too much alcohol.\n*   Eating too much.\n*   Being excited or under emotional stress.\n*   Experiencing sudden temperature changes.\n*   Swallowing air, such as when chewing gum or smoking.\n\n【10】Issues that may cause hiccups to last more than 48 hours include nerve damage or irritation, central nervous system disorders, metabolic issues, and certain drug and alcohol problems.\n\n【11】### Nerve damage or irritation\n\n【12】A cause of long-term hiccups is damage to, or irritation of, the vagus nerves or phrenic nerves. These nerves supply the diaphragm muscle.\n\n【13】Factors that may damage or irritate these nerves include:\n\n【14】*   A hair or something else in your ear touching your eardrum.\n*   A tumor, cyst or growth on the thyroid gland in your neck.\n*   Stomach acid that backs up into your esophagus, the muscular tube that delivers food from your mouth to your stomach.\n*   Sore throat or laryngitis.\n\n【15】### Central nervous system disorders\n\n【16】A tumor or infection in your central nervous system or damage to your central nervous system due to an injury can disrupt your body's normal control of the hiccup reflex.\n\n【17】Examples include:\n\n【18】*   Inflammation of the brain, which also is known as encephalitis.\n*   Inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, which also is known as meningitis.\n*   Multiple sclerosis, which is the hardening of tissue in the brain or spinal cord that can result in paralysis or tremors.\n*   Stroke.\n*   Serious brain injury.\n*   Tumors.\n\n【19】### Metabolic issues\n\n【20】Long-term hiccups may result when your body's metabolism doesn't work properly.\n\n【21】Examples of metabolic issues include:\n\n【22】*   Diabetes.\n*   Electrolyte imbalance, which is when your levels of potassium, sodium and other electrolytes are too high or too low.\n*   Kidney disease.\n\n【23】### Certain drugs and alcohol issues\n\n【24】Use of certain drugs or problems with alcohol may cause long-term hiccups.\n\n【25】Examples include:\n\n【26】*   Medicines that cause you to feel relaxed and sleepy, such as sedatives or other drugs used for anesthesia.\n*   A steroid called dexamethasone, which is used to relieve inflammation in conditions such as arthritis, asthma and kidney problems.\n*   Other steroids.\n*   Alcohol use disorder.\n\n【27】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【28】Males are much more likely to develop long-term hiccups than females. Other factors that may increase your risk of hiccups include:\n\n【29】*   **Mental or emotional issues.** Anxiety, stress and excitement have been linked with some cases of hiccups.\n*   **Surgery.** Some people develop hiccups after general anesthesia or procedures that involve organs in the stomach area.\n\n【30】Complications\n-------------\n\n【31】Ongoing hiccups may interfere with eating, drinking, sleeping and speaking. Hiccups also can worsen pain.\n\n【32】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Is the association with use of the drug real? Yes, until proved otherwise. One could argue that this is a report of only 3 patients and that we should wait for more cases; however, try telling that topatients and families of those who subsequently develop VHD that requires valve replacement.\n\n【19】Some important questions need to be answered with regard to use of pergolide. (1) What is the incidence of associated VHD? (2) What is the severity of VHD? (3) Is the occurrence of VHD related to the dosage and duration of therapy? (4) Is the valve disease progressive despite discontinuation of pergolide? (5) Does the valve disease regress or do the valves perhaps even become “normal” after discontinuation of pergolide, and if so, over what period? (6) Is the VHD progressive if continued use of pergolide is deemed essential or necessary?\n\n【20】A precise estimate of incidence of valve disease with use of pergolide may not be possible at this time because these patients probably did not undergo a full cardiac evaluation, including 2-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler studies before initiation of therapy. However, we can obtain a reasonable estimate of the incidence of VHD and answer the other questions. One way to proceed is as follows.\n\n【21】A well-designed prospective study should be conducted at 3 to 4 centers that have (1) excellent clinical cardiologists experienced in VHD and outstanding 2-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler laboratories with experienced and knowledgeable interpreters of VHD and (2) an adequate number of patients who have used pergolide. Ideally all patients at these medical centers who have taken or are still taking pergolide should undergo clinical cardiac evaluation (history, physical examination, electrocardiography, chest radiography) and 2-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler studies. All patients should have a prospective comprehensive follow-up at regular intervals.\n\n【22】Obviously, this approach will be costly, but in the long term good patient care should be more important than cost. Eventually, this approach may be cost-effective, especially if the cost of possible litigation is considered.\n\n【23】Appropriate interpretation of 2-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler studies is important because in some or many patients, results of these studies could be the “linchpin” for the diagnosis of VHD, especially if a murmur is not easily heard. Some features of such tests to consider are as follows.\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>*   1.\n\n【25】    Ideally, the observer should be blinded about whether the patient being examined is taking pergolide.\n\n【26】*   2.\n\n【27】    *   Williams JCP\n    *   O'Donovan TPB\n    *   Cronin L\n    *   Wood EH\n\n【28】    Influence of sequence of atrial and ventricular systoles on closure of mitral valve.\n\n【29】删除3:<u>    _J Appl Physiol._ 1967; 22 : 786-792</u>\n\n【30】    *   PubMed\n    *   Google Scholar\n\n【31】    *   Williams JCP\n    *   Vandenberg RA\n    *   O'Donovan TPB\n    *   Sturm RE\n    *   Wood EH\n\n【32】    Roentgen video densitometer study of mitral valve closure during atrial fibrillation.\n\n【33】删除3:<u>    _J Appl Physiol._ 1968; 24 : 217-224</u>\n\n【34】    *   PubMed\n    *   Google Scholar\n\n【35】    *   Williams JCP\n    *   O'Donovan TPB\n    *   Vandenberg RA\n    *   Sturm RE\n    *   Wood EH\n\n【36】    Atriogenic mitral valve reflux: diastolic mitral incompetence following isolated atrial systoles.\n\n【37】删除3:<u>    _Circ Res._ 1968; 22 : 19-27</u>\n\n【38】    *   Crossref\n    *   PubMed\n    *   Google Scholar\n\n【39】    *   Williams JCP\n    *   Vandenberg RA\n    *   Sturm RE\n    *   Wood EH\n\n【40】    Presystolic atriogenic mitral reflux developed at abnormally long PR intervals.\n\n【41】删除3:<u>    _Cardiovasc Res._ 1968; 2 : 271-277</u>\n\n【42】    *   Crossref\n    *   PubMed\n    *   Scopus (14)\n    *   Google Scholar\n\n【43】    *   Vandenberg RA\n    *   Williams JCP\n    *   Sturm RE\n    *   Wood EH\n\n【44】    Effect of ventricular extrasystoles on closure of mitral valve.\n\n【45】删除3:<u>    _Circulation._ 1969; 39 : 197-204</u>\n\n【46】    *   Crossref\n    *   PubMed\n    *   Scopus (14)\n    *   Google Scholar\n\n【47】    from Earl Wood's laboratory at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, were sensitive for detecting mitral regurgitation (MR) and provided important information. These investigators placed sampling catheters just above and below the mitral valve, and “slight retrograde flow of indicator” was uniformly found in dogs with normal sinus rhythm. They also showed that, when the distance between the catheters was moved by even 1 to 2 mm, the retrograde flow could not be detected.

The severity of this “MR” was dependent on the PR interval. This was particularly important in the failing heart: the degree of MR varied with atrial fibrillation at different ventricular rates, atrial systole without subsequent ventricular systoles produced MR, and single ventricular ectopic systoles (VES) rarely produced MR.

Patients with PAD may experience a multitude of problems, such as claudication, ischemic rest pain, ischemic ulcerations, repeated hospitalizations, revascularizations, and limb loss. This may lead to a poor quality of life and a high rate of depression. From the standpoint of the limb, the prognosis of patients with PAD is favorable in that the claudication remains stable in 70% to 80% of patients over a 10-year period. However, the rate of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death in patients with both symptomatic and asymptomatic PAD is markedly increased. The ankle brachial index is an excellent screening test for the presence of PAD. Imaging studies (duplex ultrasonography, computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, catheter-based angiography) may provide additional anatomic information if revascularization is planned. The goals of therapy are to improve symptoms and thus quality of life and to decrease the cardiovascular event rate (myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death). The former is accomplished by establishing a supervised exercise program and administering cilostazol or performing a revascularization procedure if medical therapy is ineffective. A comprehensive program of cardiovascular risk modification (discontinuation of tobacco use and control of lipids, blood pressure, and diabetes) will help to prevent the latter.\n\n【1】ABI ( ankle brachial index ), ACE ( angiotensin-converting enzyme ), CAD ( coronary artery disease ), CI ( confidence interval ), CTA ( computed tomographic angiography ), LDL-C ( low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), MRA ( magnetic resonance angiography ), NHANES ( National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ), PAD ( peripheral artery disease )\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "090d75ce-7709-43ab-8e92-eedc157737d7", "title": "Heat exhaustion", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Heat exhaustion is a condition that happens when your body overheats. Symptoms may include heavy sweating and a rapid pulse. Heat exhaustion is one of three heat-related illnesses, with heat cramps being the mildest and heatstroke being the most serious.\n\n【2】Causes of heat illness include exposure to high temperatures, particularly when there is also high humidity, and strenuous physical activity. Without prompt treatment, heat exhaustion can lead to heatstroke, a life-threatening condition. Fortunately, heat exhaustion is preventable.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Symptoms of heat exhaustion may start suddenly or progress over time, especially with prolonged periods of exercise. Possible heat exhaustion symptoms include:\n\n【5】*   Cool, moist skin with goose bumps when in the heat.\n*   Heavy sweating.\n*   Faintness.\n*   Dizziness.\n*   Fatigue.\n*   Weak, rapid pulse.\n*   Low blood pressure upon standing.\n*   Muscle cramps.\n*   Nausea.\n*   Headache.\n\n【6】### When to see a doctor\n\n【7】If you think you have heat exhaustion:\n\n【8】*   Stop all activity and rest.\n*   Move to a cooler place.\n*   Drink cool water or sports drinks.\n\n【9】Contact your doctor if your symptoms get worse or they don't improve within one hour.\n\n【10】If you're with someone who has heat exhaustion, seek immediate medical help if they become confused or distressed, lose consciousness, or are unable to drink. If their core body temperature — measured by a rectal thermometer — reaches 104 F (40 C) or higher, they need immediate cooling and urgent medical attention.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】The body's heat combined with environmental heat results in what's called your core temperature. This is your body's inner temperature. Your body needs to regulate heat gain in hot weather or heat loss in cold weather to keep a core temperature that's typical for you. The average core temperature is about 98.6 F (37 C).\n\n【13】### When your body can't cool itself\n\n【14】In hot weather, your body cools itself mainly by sweating. The evaporation of your sweat regulates your body temperature. But when you exercise strenuously or otherwise overexert in hot, humid weather, your body is less able to cool itself efficiently.\n\n【15】As a result, heat cramps may start in your body. Heat cramps are the mildest form of heat-related illness. Symptoms of heat cramps often include heavy sweating, fatigue, thirst and muscle cramps. Prompt treatment may prevent heat cramps from progressing to more-serious heat illnesses such as heat exhaustion.\n\n【16】Drinking fluids or sports drinks that have electrolytes (Gatorade, Powerade, others) can help treat heat cramps. Other treatments for heat cramps include getting into cooler temperatures, such as an air-conditioned or shaded place, and resting.\n\n【17】### Other causes\n\n【18】Besides hot weather and strenuous activity, other causes of heat exhaustion include:\n\n【19】*   **Dehydration,** which lessens your body's ability to sweat and keep a normal temperature.\n*   **Alcohol use,** which can affect your body's ability to regulate your temperature.\n*   **Overdressing,** particularly in clothes that don't allow sweat to evaporate easily.\n\n【20】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【21】Anyone can get heat illness, but certain factors increase your sensitivity to heat. They include:\n\n【22】*   **Young age or old age.** Infants and children younger than 4 and adults older than 65 are at higher risk of heat exhaustion. The body's ability to regulate its temperature isn't fully developed in children. In older adults, illness, medicines or other factors can affect the body's ability to control temperature.\n*   **Certain drugs.** Some medicines can affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond properly to heat. These include some medicines used to treat high blood pressure and heart problems (beta blockers, diuretics), reduce allergy symptoms (antihistamines), calm you (tranquilizers), or reduce psychiatric symptoms such as delusions (antipsychotics). Some illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can increase your core temperature.\n*   **Obesity.** Carrying excess weight can affect your body's ability to regulate its temperature and cause your body to keep more heat.\n*   **Sudden temperature changes.** If you're not used to the heat, you're more susceptible to heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion. The body needs time to get used to higher temperatures. Traveling to a warm climate from a cold one or living in an area that experiences an early heat wave can put you at risk of a heat-related illness. The body hasn't had a chance to get used to the higher temperatures.\n*   **A high heat index.** The heat index is a single temperature value that considers how both the outdoor temperature and humidity make you feel. When the humidity is high, your sweat can't evaporate as easily, and your body has more trouble cooling itself. This makes you more prone to heat exhaustion and heatstroke. When the heat index is 91 F (33 C) or higher, you should take precautions to keep cool.\n\n【23】Complications\n-------------\n\n【24】If heat exhaustion isn't treated, it can lead to heatstroke. Heatstroke is a life-threatening condition. It happens when your core body temperature reaches 104 F (40 C) or higher. Heatstroke needs immediate medical attention to prevent permanent damage to your brain and other vital organs that can result in death.\n\n【25】Prevention\n----------\n\n【26】There are a lot of things you can do to prevent heat exhaustion and other heat-related illnesses. When temperatures climb, remember to:\n\n【27】*   **Wear loose fitting, lightweight clothing.** Wearing too much clothing or clothing that fits tightly won't allow your body to cool properly.\n*   **Protect against sunburn.** Sunburn affects your body's ability to cool itself. Protect yourself outdoors with a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Apply sunscreen generously and reapply every two hours. Reapply more often if you're swimming or sweating.\n*   **Drink plenty of fluids.** Staying hydrated helps your body sweat and keep a normal body temperature.\n*   **Be careful with certain medicines.** Watch for heat-related problems if you take medicines that can affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond to heat.\n*   **Never leave anyone in a parked car.** This is a common cause of heat-related deaths in children. When parked in the sun, the temperature in your car can rise 20 degrees Fahrenheit (more than 11 C) in 10 minutes.\n\n【28】    It's not safe to leave someone in a parked car in warm or hot weather, even if the windows are cracked or the car is in shade. Keep parked cars locked to prevent a child from getting inside.\n\n【29】*   **Take it easy during the hottest parts of the day.** If you can't avoid strenuous activity in hot weather, drink fluids and rest often in a cool spot. Try to schedule exercise or physical labor for cooler parts of the day, such as early morning or evening.\n*   **Get acclimated.** Limit time spent working or exercising in heat until you're conditioned to it. People who aren't used to hot weather are especially susceptible to heat-related illness. It can take several weeks for your body to adjust to hot weather.\n*   **Be cautious if you're at increased risk.** If you take medicines or have a condition that increases your risk of heat-related problems, such as a history of prior heat illness, be cautious. Avoid the heat and act quickly if you notice symptoms of overheating. If you take part in a strenuous sporting event or activity in hot weather, make sure there are medical services ready in case of a heat emergency.\n\n【30】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The procedure is performed by a doctor who specializes in the urinary system and male sex organs (urologist).\n\n【3】Your urologist may recommend a prostate biopsy if results from initial tests, such as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test or digital rectal exam, suggest that you may have prostate cancer. Tissue samples from the prostate biopsy are examined under a microscope for cell abnormalities that are a sign of prostate cancer. If cancer is present, it is evaluated to determine how quickly it's likely to progress and to determine your best treatment options.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】A prostate biopsy is used to detect prostate cancer.\n\n【6】Your doctor may recommend a prostate biopsy if:\n\n【7】*   A PSA test shows levels higher than normal for your age\n*   Your doctor finds lumps or other abnormalities during a digital rectal exam\n*   You've had a previous biopsy with a normal result, but you still have elevated PSA levels\n*   A previous biopsy revealed prostate tissue cells that were abnormal but not cancerous\n\n【8】Risks\n-----\n\n【9】Risks associated with a prostate biopsy include:\n\n【10】*   **Bleeding at the biopsy site.** Rectal bleeding is common after a prostate biopsy.\n*   **Blood in your semen.** It's common to notice red or rust coloring in your semen after a prostate biopsy. This indicates the presence of blood, and it's not a cause for concern. Blood in your semen may persist for a few weeks after the biopsy.\n*   **Blood in your urine.** This bleeding is usually minor.\n*   **Difficulty urinating.** Prostate biopsy can sometimes cause difficulty with urination after the procedure. Rarely, a temporary urinary catheter must be inserted.\n*   **Infection.** Rarely, a prostate biopsy can cause an infection of the urinary tract or prostate that requires treatment with antibiotics.\n\n【11】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【12】To prepare for your prostate biopsy, your urologist may have you:\n\n【13】*   Provide a urine sample to analyze for a urinary tract infection. If you have a urinary tract infection, your prostate biopsy will likely be postponed while you take antibiotics to clear the infection.\n*   Stop taking medication that can increase the risk of bleeding — such as warfarin (Jantoven), aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and certain herbal supplements — for several days before the procedure.\n*   Do a cleansing enema at home before your biopsy appointment.\n*   Take antibiotics before your prostate biopsy to help prevent infection from the procedure.\n\n【14】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【15】### Types of prostate biopsy procedures\n\n【16】Prostate biopsy samples can be collected in different ways. Your prostate biopsy may involve:\n\n【17】*   **Passing the needle through the wall of the rectum (transrectal biopsy).** This is the most common way of performing a prostate biopsy.\n*   **Inserting the needle through the area of skin between the anus and scrotum (transperineal biopsy).** A small cut is made in the area of skin (perineum) between the anus and the scrotum. The biopsy needle is inserted through the cut and into the prostate to draw out samples of tissue. An MRI or CT scan is generally used to guide this procedure.\n\n【18】### What to expect during transrectal prostate biopsy\n\n【19】You will be asked to lie on your side with your knees pulled up to your chest. You might be asked to lie on your stomach. After cleaning the area and applying gel, your doctor will gently insert a thin ultrasound probe into your rectum.\n\n【20】Transrectal ultrasonography uses sound waves to create images of your prostate. Your doctor will use the images to identify the area that needs to be numbed with an injection to reduce discomfort associated with the biopsy. The ultrasound images are also used to guide the prostate biopsy needle into place.\n\n【21】Once the area is numbed and the biopsy device is situated, your doctor will retrieve thin, cylindrical sections of tissue with a spring-propelled needle. The procedure typically causes a very brief uncomfortable sensation each time the spring-loaded needle takes a sample.\n\n【22】Your doctor may target a suspicious area to biopsy or may take samples from several places in your prostate. Generally, 10 to 12 tissue samples are taken. The entire procedure usually takes about 20 minutes.\n\n【23】### After the procedure\n\n【24】Your doctor will likely recommend that you do only light activities for 24 to 48 hours after your prostate biopsy.\n\n【25】Your doctor might recommend taking an antibiotic for a few days. You might also:\n\n【26】*   Feel slight soreness and have some light bleeding from your rectum.\n*   Have blood in your urine or stools for a few days.\n*   Notice that your semen has a red or rust-colored tint caused by a small amount of blood in your semen. This can last for several weeks.\n\n【27】Call your doctor if you have:\n\n【28】*   Fever\n*   Difficulty urinating\n*   Prolonged or heavy bleeding\n*   Pain that gets worse\n\n【29】Results\n-------\n\n【30】A doctor who specializes in diagnosing cancer and other tissue abnormalities (pathologist) will evaluate the prostate biopsy samples. The pathologist can tell if the tissue removed is cancerous and, if cancer is present, estimate how aggressive it is. Your doctor will explain the pathologist's findings to you.\n\n【31】Your pathology report may include:\n\n【32】*   **A description of the biopsy sample.** Sometimes called the gross description, this section of the report might evaluate the color and consistency of the prostate tissue.\n*   **A description of the cells.** Your pathology report will describe the way the cells appear under the microscope. Prostate cancer cells may be referred to as adenocarcinoma. Sometimes the pathologist finds cells that appear abnormal but aren't cancerous. Words used to describe these noncancerous conditions include \"prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia\" and \"atypical small acinar proliferation.\"\n*   **Cancer grading.** If the pathologist finds cancer, it's graded on a scale called the Gleason score. Gleason scoring combines two numbers and can range from 2 (nonaggressive cancer) to 10 (very aggressive cancer), though the lower part of the range isn't used as often. Most Gleason scores used to assess prostate biopsy samples range from 6 to 10. A score of 6 indicates a low-grade prostate cancer. A score of 7 indicates a medium-grade prostate cancer. Scores from 8 to 10 indicate high-grade cancers.\n*   **The pathologist's diagnosis.** This section of the pathology report lists the pathologist's diagnosis. It may also include comments, such as whether other tests are recommended.\n\n【33】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

A total of 49 participants diagnosed with mild-to-moderate CTS were randomized into D5W and control groups. Participants in the D5W group received 1 session of ultrasound-guided PIT with 5 cc of D5W, and the control group received PIT with normal saline. The visual analog scale measured pain as a primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire scores, the cross-sectional area of the median nerve, and electrophysiological measurement results. Assessment was performed before injection and at 1, 3, and 6 months post-injection.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】All patients (data from 30 wrists in each group) completed the study. Compared with the control group, at all post-injection time points, the D5W group had a significant reduction in pain and disability, improvement on electrophysiological response measures, and decreased cross-sectional area of the median nerve.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Our study reveals that ultrasound-guided PIT with D5W is an effective treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate CTS.\n\n【9】### Trial Registration\n\n【10】删除3:<u>www.ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT02809261.</u>\n\n【11】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【12】BCTQ ( Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire ), CSA ( cross-sectional area ), CTS ( carpal tunnel syndrome ), D5W ( 5% dextrose ), DML ( distal motor latency ), MN ( median nerve ), PIT ( perineural injection therapy ), SNCV ( sensory nerve conduction velocity ), VAS ( visual analog scale )\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【20】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Many different types of pediatric brain tumors exist — some are noncancerous (benign) and some are cancerous (malignant).\n\n【2】Treatment and chance of recovery (prognosis) depend on the type of tumor, its location within the brain, whether it has spread, and your child's age and general health. Because new treatments and technologies are continually being developed, several options may be available at different points in treatment.\n\n【3】Treatment for brain tumors in children is typically quite different from treatment for adult brain tumors, so it's very important to enlist the expertise and experience of pediatric specialists in neurology and cancer.\n\n【4】Care at Mayo Clinic for pediatric brain tumors\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms of a brain tumor in children vary greatly and depend on the brain tumor type, size, location and rate of growth. Some signs and symptoms may not be easy to detect because they're similar to symptoms of other conditions.\n\n【7】Some of the more common symptoms of a brain tumor in children include:\n\n【8】*   Headaches, which may become more frequent and more severe\n*   Feeling of increased pressure in the head\n*   Unexplained nausea or vomiting\n*   Abrupt onset of vision problems, such double vision\n\n【9】Other possible signs and symptoms, depending on the tumor location, include:\n\n【10】*   A fuller soft spot (fontanel) on the skull in babies\n*   Seizures, especially when there's no history of seizures\n*   Abnormal eye movement\n*   Slurred speech\n*   Trouble swallowing\n*   Loss of appetite; or in babies, difficulty feeding\n*   Difficulty with balance\n*   Trouble walking\n*   Weakness or loss of sensation in an arm or a leg\n*   Weakness or drooping on one side on the face\n*   Confusion, irritability\n*   Memory problems\n*   Personality or behavior changes\n*   Hearing problems\n\n【11】### When to see a doctor\n\n【12】Make an appointment with your child's doctor if your child has signs and symptoms that concern you.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】In most cases, the exact cause of a pediatric brain tumor is not known.\n\n【15】Pediatric brain tumors typically are primary brain tumors — tumors that start in the brain or in tissues close to it. Primary brain tumors begin when normal cells have errors (mutations) in their DNA. These mutations allow cells to grow and divide at increased rates and to continue living when healthy cells would die. The result is a mass of abnormal cells, which forms a tumor.\n\n【16】Many different types of brain tumors — which may or may not be cancerous — can occur in children.\n\n【17】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【18】In most children with primary brain tumors, the cause of the tumor isn't clear. But certain types of brain tumors, such as medulloblastoma or ependymoma, are more common in children. Though uncommon, a family history of brain tumors or a family history of genetic syndromes may increase the risk of brain tumors in some children.\n\n【19】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

They develop on areas of skin that often flex — such as the lower abdomen, upper thighs or armpits. Bullous pemphigoid is most common in older adults.\n\n【2】Bullous pemphigoid occurs when your immune system attacks a thin layer of tissue below your outer layer of skin. The reason for this abnormal immune response is unknown, although it sometimes can be triggered by taking certain medications.\n\n【3】Bullous pemphigoid often goes away on its own in a few months, but may take as many as five years to resolve. Treatment usually helps heal the blisters and ease any itching. It may include corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, and other drugs that suppress the immune system. Bullous pemphigoid can be life-threatening, especially for older people who are already in poor health.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The signs and symptoms of bullous pemphigoid may include:\n\n【6】*   Itching skin, weeks or months before blisters form\n*   Large blisters that don't easily rupture when touched, often along creases or folds in the skin\n*   Skin around the blisters that is normal, reddish or darker than normal\n*   Eczema or a hive-like rash\n*   Small blisters or sores in the mouth or other mucous membranes (benign mucous membrane pemphigoid)\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】See your doctor if you develop:\n\n【9】*   Unexplained blistering\n*   Blisters on your eyes\n*   Signs of infection\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】The blisters occur because of a malfunction in your immune system.\n\n【12】Your body's immune system normally produces antibodies to fight bacteria, viruses or other potentially harmful foreign substances. For reasons that are not clear, the body may develop an antibody to a particular tissue in your body.\n\n【13】In bullous pemphigoid, the immune system produces antibodies to the fibers that connect the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and the next layer of skin (dermis). These antibodies trigger inflammation that produces the blisters and itching of bullous pemphigoid.\n\n【14】### Contributing factors\n\n【15】Bullous pemphigoid usually appears randomly with no clear factors contributing to the onset of disease. Some cases may be triggered by:\n\n【16】*   **Medications.** Prescription drugs that may cause bullous pemphigoid include etanercept (Enbrel), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), furosemide (Lasix) and penicillin.\n*   **Light and radiation.** Ultraviolet light therapy to treat certain skin conditions may trigger bullous pemphigoid, as can radiation therapy to treat cancer.\n*   **Medical conditions.** Disorders that may trigger bullous pemphigoid include psoriasis, lichen planus, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis.\n\n【17】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【18】Bullous pemphigoid most commonly occurs in older adults, and the risk increases with age.\n\n【19】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "5e428a88-da2b-46c0-856b-dd421886a718", "title": "Altretamine (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Altretamine (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Hexalen\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Altretamine belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics. It is used to treat cancer of the ovaries. It may also be used to treat other kinds of cancer, as determined by your doctor.\n\n【6】Altretamine interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by altretamine, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.\n\n【7】Before you begin treatment with altretamine, you and your doctor should talk about the good this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.\n\n【8】Altretamine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【11】### Allergies\n\n【12】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【13】### Pediatric\n\n【14】There is no specific information comparing use of altretamine in children with use in other age groups.\n\n【15】### Geriatric\n\n【16】Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of altretamine in the elderly with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.\n\n【17】### Breastfeeding\n\n【18】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【21】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【22】*   Pyridoxine\n\n【23】### Other Interactions\n\n【24】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【25】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【26】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【27】*   Chickenpox (including recent exposure) or\n*   Herpes zoster (shingles)—Risk of severe disease affecting other parts of the body\n\n【28】*   Nervous system problems—May be worsened by altretamine\n\n【29】*   Infection—Altretamine may decrease your body's ability to fight infection\n\n【30】*   Kidney disease—Effects of altretamine may be increased because of slower removal from the body\n\n【31】*   Liver disease—Effects may be changed because altretamine is activated and cleared from the body by the liver\n\n【32】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【33】This medicine often causes nausea and vomiting. However, it is very important that you continue to receive the medicine even if you begin to feel ill. Taking this medicine after meals will lessen stomach upset. Ask your health care professional for other ways to lessen these effects.\n\n【34】### Dosing\n\n【35】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【36】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【37】### Missed Dose\n\n【38】Call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions.\n\n【39】### Storage\n\n【40】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【41】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【42】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【43】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【44】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【45】While you are being treated with altretamine, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Altretamine may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have taken oral polio vaccine within the last several months. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.\n\n【46】Altretamine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【47】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【48】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【49】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【50】Also, because of the way these medicines act on the body, there is a chance that they might cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used. These delayed effects may include certain types of cancer, such as leukemia. Discuss these possible effects with your doctor.\n\n【51】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【52】#### Less common or rare\n\n【53】1.  Black, tarry stools\n2.  blood in urine or stools\n3.  cough or hoarseness, accompanied by fever or chills\n4.  fever or chills\n5.  lower back or side pain, accompanied by fever or chills\n6.  painful or difficult urination, accompanied by fever or chills\n7.  pinpoint red spots on skin\n8.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n9.  unusual tiredness\n\n【54】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【55】#### More common\n\n【56】1.  Anxiety\n2.  clumsiness\n3.  confusion\n4.  convulsions (seizures)\n5.  dizziness\n6.  mental depression\n7.  numbness in arms or legs\n8.  weakness\n\n【57】#### Rare\n\n【58】1.  Skin rash or itching\n\n【59】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【60】#### More common\n\n【61】1.

{"seq_id": "6ff70dc5-8376-42dd-9626-db23fbf0b7d1", "title": "Acoustic neuroma", "text": "【0】Acoustic neuroma\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】An acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous tumor that develops on the main nerve leading from the inner ear to the brain. This nerve is called the vestibular nerve. Branches of the nerve directly affect balance and hearing. Pressure from an acoustic neuroma can cause hearing loss, ringing in the ear and problems with balance. Another name for an acoustic neuroma is vestibular schwannoma.\n\n【2】An acoustic neuroma develops from the Schwann cells covering the vestibular nerve. An acoustic neuroma is usually slow-growing. Rarely, it may grow quickly and become large enough to press against the brain and affect vital functions.\n\n【3】Treatments for an acoustic neuroma include monitoring, radiation and surgical removal.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often easy to miss and may take years to develop. Symptoms may occur because of the tumor's effects on the hearing and balance nerves. The tumor also can put pressure on nearby nerves controlling facial muscles, known as the facial nerve, and sensation, known as the trigeminal nerve. Blood vessels or brain structures also can be affected by an acoustic neuroma.\n\n【6】As the tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause more noticeable or worse symptoms.\n\n【7】Common symptoms of an acoustic neuroma include:\n\n【8】*   Hearing loss, usually gradually over months to years. In rare cases, hearing loss can be sudden. Hearing loss usually occurs on one side or is worse on one side.\n*   Ringing in the affected ear, known as tinnitus.\n*   Loss of balance or not feeling steady.\n*   Dizziness.\n*   Facial numbness and, very rarely, weakness or loss of muscle movement.\n\n【9】Rarely, an acoustic neuroma may grow large enough to compress the brainstem and become life-threatening.\n\n【10】### When to see your doctor\n\n【11】See a health care professional if you notice hearing loss in one ear, ringing in your ear or balance problems.\n\n【12】Early diagnosis of an acoustic neuroma may help keep the tumor from growing large enough to cause complications such as total hearing loss.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】The cause of acoustic neuromas can sometimes be linked to a problem with a gene on chromosome 22. Typically, this gene produces a tumor suppressor protein that helps control the growth of Schwann cells covering the nerves.\n\n【15】Experts don't know what causes this problem with the gene. Often there is no known cause for an acoustic neuroma. This gene change is inherited in people with a rare disorder called neurofibromatosis type 2. People with neurofibromatosis type 2 usually have growth of tumors on the hearing and balance nerves on both sides of the head. These tumors are known as bilateral vestibular schwannomas.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】### Neurofibromatosis type 2\n\n【18】The only confirmed risk factor for acoustic neuromas is having a parent with the rare genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 2. However, neurofibromatosis type 2 only accounts for about 5% of acoustic neuroma cases.\n\n【19】A hallmark characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 2 is noncancerous tumors on the balance nerves on both sides of the head. Tumors also may develop on other nerves.\n\n【20】Neurofibromatosis type 2 is known as an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that the gene related to the disorder can be passed to a child by just one parent. Each child of an affected parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting it.\n\n【21】Complications\n-------------\n\n【22】An acoustic neuroma may cause permanent complications, including:\n\n【23】*   Hearing loss.\n*   Facial numbness and weakness.\n*   Balance problems.\n*   Ringing in the ear.\n\n【24】Large tumors may press on the brainstem, occasionally preventing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid between the brain and spinal cord. Fluid can build up in your head, a condition known as hydrocephalus. This increases the pressure inside the skull.\n\n【25】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "2dd2a061-da22-4562-995e-81ec9d1755fb", "title": "Genital herpes", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). The herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes genital herpes. Genital herpes can often be spread by skin-to-skin contact during sexual activity.\n\n【2】Some people infected with the virus may have very mild symptoms or no symptoms. They can still able to spread the virus. Other people have pain, itching and sores around the genitals, anus or mouth.\n\n【3】There is no cure for genital herpes. Symptoms often show up again after the first outbreak. Medicine can ease symptoms. It also lowers the risk of infecting others. Condoms can help prevent the spread of a genital herpes infection.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Most people infected with HSV don't know they have it. They may have no symptoms or have very mild symptoms.\n\n【6】Symptoms start about 2 to 12 days after exposure to the virus. They may include:\n\n【7】*   Pain or itching around the genitals\n*   Small bumps or blisters around the genitals, anus or mouth\n*   Painful ulcers that form when blisters rupture and ooze or bleed\n*   Scabs that form as the ulcers heal\n*   Painful urination\n*   Discharge from the urethra, the tube that releases urine from the body\n*   Discharge from the vagina\n\n【8】During the first outbreak, you may commonly have flu-like symptoms such as:\n\n【9】*   Fever\n*   Headache\n*   Body aches\n*   Swollen lymph nodes in the groin\n\n【10】### Differences in symptom location\n\n【11】Sores appear where the infection enters the body. You can spread the infection by touching a sore and then rubbing or scratching another area of your body. That includes your fingers or eyes.\n\n【12】Sore can develop on or in the:\n\n【13】*   Buttocks\n*   Thighs\n*   Rectum\n*   Anus\n*   Mouth\n*   Urethra\n*   Vulva\n*   Vagina\n*   Cervix\n*   Penis\n*   Scrotum\n\n【14】### Repeat outbreaks\n\n【15】After the first outbreak of genital herpes, symptoms often appear again. These are called recurrent outbreaks or recurrent episodes.\n\n【16】How often recurrent outbreaks happen varies widely. You'll usually have the most outbreaks the first year after infection. They may appear less often over time. Your symptoms during recurrent outbreaks usually don't last as long and aren't as severe as the first.\n\n【17】You may have warning signs a few hours or days before a new outbreak starts. These are called prodromal symptoms. They include:\n\n【18】*   Genital pain\n*   Tingling or shooting pain in the legs, hips or buttocks\n\n【19】### When to see a doctor\n\n【20】If you suspect you have genital herpes, or any other STI, see your health care provider.\n\n【21】Causes\n------\n\n【22】Genital herpes is caused by two types of herpes simplex virus. These types include herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). People with HSV infections can pass along the virus even when they have no visible symptoms.\n\n【23】### HSV-2\n\n【24】HSV-2 is the most common cause of genital herpes. The virus can be present:\n\n【25】*   On blisters and ulcers or the fluid from ulcers\n*   The moist lining or fluids of the mouth\n*   The moist lining or fluids of the vagina or rectum\n\n【26】The virus moves from one person to another during sexual activity.\n\n【27】### HSV-1\n\n【28】HSV-1 is a version of the virus that causes cold sores or fever blisters. People may be exposed to HSV-1 as children due to close skin-to-skin contact with someone infected.\n\n【29】A person with HSV-1 in tissues of the mouth can pass the virus to the genitals of a sexual partner during oral sex. The newly caught infection is a genital herpes infection.\n\n【30】Recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes caused by HSV-1 are often less frequent than outbreaks caused by HSV-2.\n\n【31】Neither HSV-1 nor HSV-2 survives well at room temperature. So the virus is not likely to spread through surfaces, such as a faucet handle or a towel. But kissing or sharing a drinking glass or silverware might spread the virus.\n\n【32】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【33】A higher risk of getting genital herpes is linked to:\n\n【34】*   **Contact with genitals through oral, vaginal or anal sex.** Having sexual contact without using a barrier increases your risk of genital herpes. Barriers include condoms and condom-like protectors called dental dams used during oral sex. Women are at higher risk of getting genital herpes. The virus can spread more easily from men to women than from women to men.\n*   **Having sex with multiple partners.** The number of people you have sex with is a strong risk factor. Contact with genitals through sex or sexual activity puts you at higher risk. Most people with genital herpes do not know they have it.\n*   **Having a partner who has the disease but is not taking medicine to treat it.** There is no cure for genital herpes, but medicine can help limit outbreaks.\n*   **Certain groups within the population.** Women, people with a history of sexually transmitted diseases, older people, Black people in in the United States and men who have sex with men diagnosed with genital herpes at a higher than average rate. People in groups at higher risk may choose to talk to a health care provider about their personal risk.\n\n【35】Complications\n-------------\n\n【36】Complications associated with genital herpes may include:\n\n【37】*   **Other sexually transmitted infections.** Having genital sores raises your risk of giving or getting other STIs, including HIV/AIDS.\n*   **Newborn infection.** A baby can be infected with HSV during delivery. Less often, the virus is passed during pregnancy or by close contact after delivery. Newborns with HSV often have infections of internal organs or the nervous system. Even with treatment, these newborns have a high risk of developmental or physical problems and a risk of death.\n*   **Internal inflammatory disease.** HSV infection can cause swelling and inflammation within the organs associated with sexual activity and urination. These include the ureter, rectum, vagina, cervix and uterus.\n*   **Finger infection.** An HSV infection can spread to a finger through a break in the skin causing discoloration, swelling and sores. The infections are called herpetic whitlow.\n*   **Eye infection.** HSV infection of the eye can cause pain, sores, blurred vision and blindness.\n*   **Swelling of the brain.** Rarely, HSV infection leads to inflammation and swelling of the brain, also called encephalitis.\n*   **Infection of internal organs.** Rarely, HSV in the bloodstream can cause infections of internal organs.\n\n【38】Prevention\n----------\n\n【39】Prevention of genital herpes is the same as preventing other sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【40】*   Have one long-term sexual partner who has been tested for STIs and isn't infected.\n*   Use a condom or dental dam during sexual activity. These reduce the risk of disease, but they don't prevent all skin-to-skin contact during sex.\n*   Don't have sex when a partner with genital herpes has symptoms.\n\n【41】### Pregnancy precautions\n\n【42】If you are pregnant and know you have genital herpes, tell your health care provider. If you think you might have genital herpes, ask your provider if you can be tested for it.\n\n【43】Your provider may recommend that you take herpes antiviral medicines late in pregnancy. This is to try to prevent an outbreak around the time of delivery. If you have an outbreak when you go into labor, your provider may suggest a cesarean section. That is a surgery to remove the baby from your uterus. It lowers the risk of passing the virus to your baby.\n\n【44】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

We examined correlations between responses and created a multivariable logistic regression model to explore which factors were associated with patients' discussion of natural product use with their primary care physicians.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】The survey was given to 198 patients, 174 of whom responded (response rate, 87.9%). Most respondents (161 \\[92.5%\\] of 174) made use of natural products, and many (61 \\[41.5%\\] of 147) reported that they did not discuss natural product use with their primary care physician. The most significant factor predictive of patients having discussed natural product use with their primary care physician was having their primary care physician ask about natural product use (odds ratio, 18.77; 95% confidence interval, 5.06-69.62). Most respondents (107 \\[69.9%\\] of 153) indicated that their primary care physician did not ask about natural product use.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】An important number of patients who visit a naturopathic clinic do not disclose natural product use to their primary care physicians. Our findings suggest that disclosure rates could be improved by physicians taking a more active role in asking their patients about natural product use.\n\n【8】CAM ( complementary and alternative medicine ), CCNM ( Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine ), CI ( confidence interval ), H-L ( Hosmer-Lemeshow ), OR ( odds ratio )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

It's caused by compression of the nerve that provides sensation to the skin covering your thigh.\n\n【2】Tight clothing, obesity or weight gain, and pregnancy are common causes of meralgia paresthetica. However, meralgia paresthetica can also be due to local trauma or a disease, such as diabetes.\n\n【3】In most cases, you can relieve meralgia paresthetica with conservative measures, such as wearing looser clothing. In severe cases, treatment may include medications to relieve discomfort or, rarely, surgery.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Meralgia paresthetica may cause these symptoms affecting the outer (lateral) part of your thigh:\n\n【6】*   Tingling and numbness\n*   Burning pain\n*   Decreased sensation\n*   Increased sensitivity and pain to even a light touch\n\n【7】These symptoms commonly occur on one side of your body and might intensify after walking or standing.\n\n【8】### When to see your doctor\n\n【9】See your doctor if you have symptoms of meralgia paresthetica.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Meralgia paresthetica occurs when the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve — which supplies sensation to the surface of your outer thigh — is pinched (compressed). The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve only affects sensation and doesn't affect your ability to use your leg muscles.\n\n【12】In most people, this nerve passes through the groin to the upper thigh without trouble. But in meralgia paresthetica, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve becomes trapped — often under the inguinal ligament, which runs along your groin from your abdomen to your upper thigh.\n\n【13】Common causes of this compression include any condition that increases pressure on the groin, including:\n\n【14】*   Tight clothing, such as belts, corsets and tight pants\n*   Obesity or weight gain\n*   Wearing a heavy tool belt\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Fluid accumulation in the abdomen causing increased abdominal pressure\n*   Scar tissue near the inguinal ligament due to injury or past surgery\n\n【15】Nerve injury, which can be due to diabetes, trauma after surgery or seat belt injury after a motor vehicle accident, for example, also can cause meralgia paresthetica.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】The following might increase your risk of meralgia paresthetica:\n\n【18】*   **Extra weight.** Being overweight or obese can increase the pressure on your lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.\n*   **Pregnancy.** A growing belly puts added pressure on your groin, through which the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve passes.\n*   **Diabetes.** Diabetes-related nerve injury can lead to meralgia paresthetica.\n*   **Age.** People between the ages of 30 and 60 are at a higher risk.\n\n【19】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Heart, lung, and liver transplantations were excluded. Postoperative ARDS (within 7 days after surgery) was defined according to the Berlin criteria.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We identified 316 patients who underwent 541 major surgical procedures. Only 7 patients met the criteria for postoperative ARDS; all were white men, and 6 were current or former smokers. On univariate analysis, we observed an increased risk of postoperative ARDS in patients who were current or former smokers. Furthermore, significantly greater crystalloid and colloid administration was found in patients with postoperative ARDS. We also observed a trend toward longer surgical duration and red blood cell transfusion in patients with postoperative ARDS, although this finding was not significant. Intraoperative fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with postoperative ARDS. In bleomycin-exposed patients, the incidence of postoperative ARDS after major surgery with general anesthesia is approximately 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.6%). For first major procedures after bleomycin therapy, the incidence is 1.9% (95% CI, 0.9%-4.1%).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The risk of postoperative ARDS in patients exposed to systemic bleomycin appears to be lower than expected. Smoking status may be an important factor that modifies the risk of postoperative ARDS in these patients.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ARDS ( acute respiratory distress syndrome ), Fio2 ( fraction of inspired oxygen ), ICU ( intensive care unit ), MCLSS/DDQB ( Mayo Clinic Life Sciences Services/Data Discovery Query Builder ), PEEP ( positive end expiratory pressure )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Quadramet\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Samarium Sm 153 lexidronam injection is a radiopharmaceutical. Radiopharmaceuticals are radioactive agents that may be used to find and treat certain diseases or to study the function of the body's organs.\n\n【6】Samarium Sm 153 lexidronam injection is used to help relieve bone pain that may occur with certain kinds of cancer. The radioactive samarium is taken up in the bone cancer area and gives off radiation that helps provide relief from pain.\n\n【7】Samarium Sm 153 lexidronam is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor with specialized training in nuclear medicine or radiation oncology.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Solution\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam injection in children younger than 16 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam injection in the elderly.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【22】### Other Interactions\n\n【23】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【24】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【25】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【26】*   Bladder control problem (eg, urinary incontinence)—Special precautions will need to be taken to prevent radiation contamination of clothing, bed linens, and the environment.\n\n【27】*   Blood problems (eg, bone marrow problems, blood clots) or\n*   Congestive heart failure, history of or\n*   Heart rhythm problems (eg, arrhythmia)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【28】*   Kidney disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of the slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【29】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【30】A doctor or other health professional will give you this medicine. It is given through a needle placed into a vein.\n\n【31】Drink plenty of fluids before and after receiving this medicine so you will pass more urine. This will help flush the medicine from your body.\n\n【32】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【33】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests are needed to check for unwanted effects\n\n【34】You will be exposed to radiation when you are given this medicine. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about this.\n\n【35】This medicine is passed mainly in the urine where radioactivity is present. Follow these guidelines for 12 hours after receiving samarium Sm 153 lexidronam injection, to help reduce the chance of contaminating other persons or the environment with radiation:\n\n【36】*   Use a normal toilet, if available, instead of a urinal.\n*   To prevent contamination of your home environment, flush the toilet several times after using.\n*   Wipe any spilled urine with a tissue and flush it away.\n*   Wash your hands after using or cleaning the toilet.\n*   Wash your clothes and bed linens right away if they become soiled with your urine or blood. Wash them separately from other clothes or store them for 1 to 2 weeks.\n*   If you cut yourself, wash away any spilled blood.\n\n【37】Samarium Sm 153 lexidronam can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【38】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor right away if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【39】This medicine may increase your risk of developing blood clots (eg, disseminated intravascular coagulation). This is more likely if you have cancer that has spread to other parts of your body. Check with your doctor right away if you have swelling and pain in your arms, legs, or stomach, chest pain, shortness of breath, loss of sensation, confusion, or problems with muscle control or speech.\n\n【40】The vial stopper contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before receiving this medicine.\n\n【41】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【42】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【43】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【44】#### More common\n\n【45】1.  Black, tarry stools\n2.  bleeding gums\n3.  blood in the urine or stools\n4.  chest pain\n5.  chills\n6.  cough\n7.  dizziness\n8.  fainting\n9.  fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat\n10.  fever\n11.  hoarseness\n12.  lower back or side pain\n13.  painful or difficult urination\n14.  pinpoint red spots on the skin\n15.  sore throat\n16.  sores, ulcers, or white spots on the lips or in the mouth\n17.  swollen glands\n18.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n19.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n20.  worsening of pain, temporary\n\n【46】#### Less common\n\n【47】1.

The cardiac arrest was witnessed, and immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun by a bystander and a trained first responder who was nearby. The patient was moved into a building across the street for continued resuscitation. First responders arrived with an automated external defibrillator, and ventricular fibrillation was documented. First responders delivered 6 defibrillation shocks, 4 of which transiently restored an organized electrocardiographic rhythm but with no pulse at any time. Additional emergency medical services personnel from nearby communities and an advanced life support (ALS) flight crew arrived. The flight crew initiated ALS care. The trachea was intubated, ventilation controlled, and end-tidal carbon dioxide tension continuously monitored. Antiarrhythmic and inotropic drugs were administered intravenously. An additional 6 shocks were delivered using the ALS defibrillator. End-tidal carbon dioxide measurements confirmed good pulmonary blood flow with chest compressions, and resuscitation was continued until a stable cardiac rhythm was restored after 96 minutes of pulselessness. The patient was transported by helicopter to the hospital. He was in cardiogenic shock but maintained a spontaneous circulation. Coronary angiography confirmed a left anterior descending coronary artery thrombotic occlusion that was treated successfully. After hospital admission, the patient required circulatory and ventilatory support and hemodialysis for acute renal failure. He experienced a complete neurologic recovery to his pre-cardiac arrest state. To our knowledge, this is the longest duration of pulselessness in an out-of-hospital arrest with a good outcome. Good pulmonary blood flow was documented throughout by end-tidal carbon dioxide measurements.\n\n【1】AED ( automated external defibrillator ), ALS ( advanced life support ), CPR ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation ), VF ( ventricular fibrillation )\n\n【2】Prolonged resuscitation attempts in patients with cardiac arrest are technically difficult and usually futile. There is no documentation in the literature describing resuscitation attempts in an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest longer than 60 minutes with a successful patient outcome.\n\n【3】We describe an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without prior hypothermia in which the patient made a complete neurologic recovery after 96 minutes of sustained pulselessness caused by recurrent ventricular fibrillation (VF). To our knowledge, this report describes the longest duration of continuous cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a normothermic person experiencing an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that resulted in a good clinical outcome.\n\n【4】REPORT OF A CASE\n----------------\n\n【5】After completing a daily workout exercise regimen in a small community gymnasium, a 54-year-old man returned to his home and began preparing dinner. Realizing that he needed a propane tank for his grill, he proceeded to a grocery store, where he collapsed from cardiac arrest just outside the door. The arrest was witnessed, and prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated by a bystander and a nearby CPR-trained first responder. In the next 4 to 5 minutes, additional first responders arrived with an automated external defibrillator (AED) (Zoll EMS Pro, Zoll Medical Corp, Chelmsford, MA). The AED was attached and VF documented 删除4:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【6】FIGURE 1 Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showing ventricular fibrillation and the first shock from the first responder automated external defibrillator. Ventricular fibrillation persisted after the shock.\n\n【7】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【8】These events unfolded on a cold day in January 2011 with an outside temperature of −4°C. The patient was moved out of the cold into a fire hall garage across the street from the site of arrest for continued resuscitation. While a Mayo Clinic medical transport helicopter and flight crew were en route, the first responders continued CPR and, during the next 24 minutes, 6 rectilinear biphasic waveform defibrillation shocks with escalating energy (120-200 J) were delivered at intervals separated by CPR. Four of the 6 shocks terminated VF transiently, with recurrence of VF from 11 to 420 seconds after each shock. At no time were the first responders able to palpate a pulse, despite the transient presence of an organized electrocardiographic rhythm after 4 of the shocks.\n\n【9】The flight crew arrived on the scene 34 minutes after receiving the 911 call. By this time, several other emergency medical services agencies from neighboring communities had arrived to assist, and thereafter chest compressions and ventilations were rotated among all the personnel. After a period of uninterrupted CPR, the flight crew attached their advanced life support (ALS) monitor-defibrillator (Zoll M Series CCT defibrillator). Ventricular fibrillation was observed;the trachea was intubated, ventilation provided by a bag-valve-tube device, intravenous access obtained, CPR continued, and the first defibrillation shock from the ALS defibrillator delivered. The ALS defibrillator also delivered rectilinear biphasic waveform shocks. An end-tidal carbon dioxide sensor (Respironics Novametrix, Wallingford, CT) was attached to the endotracheal tube and, throughout the remainder of the resuscitation, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension was continuously monitored. This measurement is an objective indicator of pulmonary and therefore systemic blood flow during CPR\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ahrens T\n*   Schallom L\n*   Bettorf K\n\n【11】End-tidal carbon dioxide measurements as a prognostic indicator of outcome in cardiac arrest.\n\n【12】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Crit Care._ 2001; 10 : 391-398</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (88)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   White RD\n*   Asplin BR</u>\n\n【15】Out-of-hospital quantitative monitoring of end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure during CPR.\n\n【16】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Emerg Med._ 1994; 23 : 25-30</u></u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (42)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【18】and of the efficacy of chest compressions.\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kalenda Z</u>\n\n【20】The capnogram as a guide to the efficacy of cardiac massage.\n\n【21】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Resuscitation._ 1978; 6 : 259-263</u></u>\n\n【22】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (123)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【23】It has been used to determine the likelihood of a successful resuscitation in an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kolar M\n*   Krizmaric M\n*   Klemen P\n*   Grmec S</u>\n\n【25】Partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide successfully predicts cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the field: a prospective observational study.\n\n【26】删除3:<u>_Crit Care._ 2008; 12 : R115</u>\n\n【27】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (150)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【28】无关删除-2:<u>*   Weil MH</u>\n\n【29】Partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide predicts successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the field.\n\n【30】删除3:<u>_Crit Care._ 2008; 12 : 90</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (6)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【32】Throughout the following 41 minutes, 5 mg of epinephrine, 300 mg of amiodarone, 1 mg of atropine, and 200 mg of lidocaine were administered intravenously. Despite the long period of arrest and resuscitation, the dose of epinephrine was limited to 5 mg because of documentation of good perfusion pressure by end-tidal carbon dioxide measurements and because of concern that further doses of epinephrine might perpetuate the recurrence of VF. Five defibrillation shocks interspersed with CPR were administered, 3 of which transiently restored an organized but pulseless rhythm for up to a maximum of 40 seconds. Throughout resuscitation, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension was consistently in the 28- to 36-mm Hg range during VF. These levels were consistent with good chest compression–generated blood flow 删除4:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>, justifying continuation of the resuscitation with the hope of a good outcome. Continued rotation of rescuers performing chest compression ensured avoidance of rescuer fatigue. During chest compressions after the third ALS shock, a pulseless wide QRS complex rhythm was restored. The fourth shock changed the amplitude of this rhythm, which then degenerated back into VF. After the fifth ALS shock, with VF still present, a decision was made to administer 300 mg of additional amiodarone, rather than the protocol-authorized 150 mg. Following continued CPR, the sixth shock was delivered. After this shock, the end-tidal carbon dioxide tension was 37 mm Hg, and an organized rhythm was present 删除4:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Although a pulse could not yet be palpated, it was assumed that a spontaneous circulation had resumed, and CPR was discontinued. The time from collapse to restoration of a sustained spontaneous circulation using this end point was 96 minutes. After several minutes, with sustained end-tidal carbon dioxide tensions observed on the monitor screen, an organized electrocardiographic rhythm resumed, and carotid and femoral pulses were palpated.\n\n【33】FIGURE 2 Electrocardiogram (ECG) showing ongoing ventricular fibrillation while cardiopulmonary resuscitation was in progress.

The flight took approximately 20 minutes. From the time of collapse to restoration of pulses, a total of 12 defibrillation shocks were delivered: 6 from the first responder AED and 6 with the ALS defibrillator.\n\n【38】On admission of the patient to the emergency department, a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed a sinus tachycardia, a nonspecific intraventricular conduction block, and ventricular premature complexes 删除4:<u>( Figure 4 )</u>. After additional amiodarone was administered in the emergency department (for an episode of nonsustained ventriculartachycardia) and the patient was stabilized, he was urgently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where a 100% occlusion of the mid-left anterior descending coronary artery with thrombus was confirmed. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stent deployment, and thrombectomy were performed successfully 删除4:<u>( Figure 5 )</u>. Multivessel coronary artery disease was present, with chronic right coronary artery and obtuse marginal artery occlusions. Because the patient was experiencing acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock, an intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted, and he was returned to the coronary care unit. Mechanical ventilation, begun during helicopter transport, was continued. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% to 35%. Therapeutic hypothermia was not used because of hemodynamic instability that required an intra-aortic balloon pump and inotropic support. During the next several days, hemodynamic factors stabilized, pulmonary edema resolved, and acute renal failure, treated with continuous venovenous hemodialysis, also resolved.\n\n【39】FIGURE 4 A 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained after admission of the patient to the emergency department.\n\n【40】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【41】FIGURE 5 Left, Coronary angiogram obtained before intervention showing complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery.

Before the patient was discharged, the calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was 44%.\n\n【44】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【45】In our patient, recurrent VF after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery resulted in 96 minutes of life-sustaining CPR; efficacy was documented throughout with physiologically normal end-tidal carbon dioxide tensions. Recurrent VF was ultimately terminated with an additional dose of amiodarone followed by another shock. Despite the extremely long period of cardiac arrest with no return of a pulse until the end, provision of life-sustaining CPR throughout enabled a complete neurologic recovery as determined by clinical examination by numerous physicians. To date, the patient has not been referred for formal neurologic assessment because consulting physicians concluded that his postresuscitation neurologic recovery was complete and his neurologic and cognitive function had returned to pre-arrest baseline.\n\n【46】A previous case report described resuscitation of 107 minutes with patient survival.

{"seq_id": "19aef5ca-8eb4-4f0f-8443-7f8d28615a12", "title": "Alpha-gal syndrome", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Alpha-gal syndrome is a type of food allergy. It makes people allergic to red meat and other products made from mammals.\n\n【2】In the United States, the condition usually begins with the bite of the Lone Star tick. The bite transfers a sugar molecule called alpha-gal into the body. In some people, this triggers a reaction from the body's defenses, also called the immune system. It causes mild to severe allergic reactions to red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb. It also can cause reactions to other foods that come from mammals, such as dairy products or gelatins.\n\n【3】The Lone Star tick is found mainly in the southeastern United States. Most cases of alpha-gal syndrome are reported in the south, east and central United States. But the condition appears to be spreading farther north and west. Deer are carrying the Lone Star tick to new parts of the country. Other types of ticks carry alpha-gal molecules in different parts of the world. Alpha-gal syndrome has been diagnosed in parts of Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa, and South and Central America.\n\n【4】Some people may have alpha-gal syndrome and not know it. There are people who often have serious allergic reactions, also called anaphylactic reactions, for no clear reason. Tests also show that they don't have other food allergies. Researchers think that some of these people may be affected by alpha-gal syndrome.\n\n【5】There's no treatment other than avoiding red meat and other products made from mammals. If you have a serious allergic reaction, you may need medicine called epinephrine and treatment at the emergency room.\n\n【6】Avoid tick bites to prevent alpha-gal syndrome. Wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts when you're in wooded, grassy areas. Use bug spray too. Check your whole body for ticks after you spend time outside.\n\n【7】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【8】The symptoms of an alpha-gal allergic reaction usually take longer to start compared with those of other food allergies. Most reactions to common food allergens — peanuts or shellfish, for example — happen within minutes after you are exposed to them. In alpha-gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about 3 to 6 hours after you are exposed. Foods that can cause a reaction include:\n\n【9】*   Red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb.\n*   Organ meats.\n*   Products made from mammals, such as gelatins or dairy products.\n\n【10】Symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may include:\n\n【11】*   Hives, itching, or itchy, scaly skin.\n*   Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other body parts.\n*   Wheezing or shortness of breath.\n*   Stomach pain, diarrhea, upset stomach or vomiting.\n\n【12】The time delay between eating meat products and getting an allergic reaction may be one reason alpha-gal syndrome was not understood at first. For example, a possible connection between a T-bone steak with dinner and hives at midnight is far from clear.\n\n【13】Researchers think they know the reason for the delayed reaction. They say it's due to the alpha-gal molecules taking longer than other allergens to be digested and enter the system that moves blood through the body.\n\n【14】### When to see a doctor\n\n【15】Get help if you have food allergy symptoms after you eat, even several hours after you eat. See your primary care health care provider or an allergy specialist, called an allergist.\n\n【16】Don't rule out red meat as a possible cause of your reaction. That's even more important if you live or spend time in parts of the world where alpha-gal syndrome has been reported.\n\n【17】Get emergency medical treatment if you have symptoms of a serious allergic reaction that causes trouble breathing, called anaphylaxis, such as:\n\n【18】*   Trouble breathing.\n*   Rapid, weak pulse.\n*   Dizzy or lightheaded feeling.\n*   Drooling and not being able to swallow.\n*   Full-body redness and warmth, called flushing.\n\n【19】Causes\n------\n\n【20】Most people with alpha-gal syndrome in the U.S. get the condition when a Lone Star tick bites them. Bites from other types of ticks can lead to the condition too. These other ticks cause alpha-gal syndrome in parts of Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa, and South and Central America.\n\n【21】### Tick bites\n\n【22】Experts think the ticks that cause alpha-gal syndrome carry alpha-gal molecules. These come from the blood of the animals they usually bite, such as cows and sheep. When a tick that carries these molecules bites a human, the tick sends alpha-gal into the person's body.\n\n【23】For unknown reasons, some people have a strong immune response to these molecules. The body makes proteins called antibodies. These antibodies target alpha-gal as something the immune system needs to clear out. The response is so strong that people with this allergy can no longer eat red meat. They cannot eat any foods made from mammals without having an allergic reaction. People who get many tick bites over time may develop worse symptoms.\n\n【24】### The cancer drug cetuximab\n\n【25】People with antibodies related to alpha-gal syndrome can have allergic reactions to the cancer drug cetuximab (Erbitux).\n\n【26】Research appears to show that cases of this drug allergy are linked to alpha-gal syndrome. The antibodies that the immune system makes to alpha-gal seem to react to the structure of the drug as well.\n\n【27】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【28】Health care providers don't yet know why some people get alpha-gal syndrome after exposure and others don't. The condition mostly happens in the south, east and central United States. You're at higher risk if you live or spend time in these regions and:\n\n【29】*   Spend a lot of time outdoors.\n*   Have gotten multiple Lone Star tick bites.\n\n【30】In the past 20 to 30 years, the Lone Star tick has been found in large numbers as far north as Maine. This tick also has been found as far west as central Texas and Oklahoma.\n\n【31】Alpha-gal syndrome also happens in other parts of the world. This includes parts of Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa, and South and Central America. In those places, bites from certain types of ticks also appear to raise the risk of the condition.\n\n【32】Complications\n-------------\n\n【33】Alpha-gal syndrome can cause a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. It can be deadly without treatment. Anaphylaxis is treated with prescription medicine called epinephrine, also known as adrenaline. You can give yourself a shot of epinephrine with a device called an auto-injector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others). You also need to go to the emergency room.\n\n【34】Anaphylaxis symptoms can include:\n\n【35】*   Tight, narrow airways.\n*   Swelling of the throat that makes it hard to breathe.\n*   A serious drop in blood pressure, called shock.\n*   Rapid pulse.\n*   Feeling dizzy or lightheaded, or passing out\n\n【36】Health care providers think that some people who get anaphylaxis often and for no clear reason may be living with alpha-gal syndrome. They just haven't been diagnosed with it.\n\n【37】Prevention\n----------\n\n【38】The best way to prevent alpha-gal syndrome is to avoid areas where ticks live. Be careful in wooded, bushy areas with long grass. You can lower your risk of getting alpha-gal syndrome by following some simple tips:\n\n【39】*   **Cover up.** Dress to protect yourself when you're in wooded or grassy areas. Wear shoes, long pants tucked into your socks, a long-sleeved shirt, a hat and gloves. Also try to stick to trails and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass. If you have a dog, keep it on a leash too.\n*   **Use bug spray.** Apply insect repellent with a 20% or higher concentration of the ingredient DEET to your skin. If you're a parent, put the bug spray on your children. Avoid their hands, eyes and mouths. Keep in mind that chemical repellents can be toxic, so follow directions carefully. Apply products with the ingredient permethrin to clothing, or buy pre-treated clothing.\n*   **Do your best to tick-proof your yard.** Clear brush and leaves where ticks live. Keep woodpiles in sunny areas.\n*   **Check yourself, your children and your pets for ticks.** Be watchful after you spend time in wooded or grassy areas.\n*   **It's helpful to shower as soon as you come indoors.** Ticks often stay on your skin for hours before they attach themselves. Shower and use a washcloth to try to remove any ticks.\n*   **Remove a tick with tweezers as soon as possible.** Gently grasp the tick near its head or mouth. Don't squeeze or crush the tick. Pull it off with a careful, steady grip. Once you've removed the entire tick, throw it out. Put on an antiseptic where it bit you. That can help prevent an illness.\n\n【40】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Evaluation included freedom from relapse (FFR) and response rates after treatment with rituximab or splenectomy as single or sequential interventions.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 218 eligible patients with ITP who were treated according to standard of care were included in this analysis. Patients failing steroids treated with splenectomy had a higher 5-year FFR than did those treated with rituximab (67.4% vs 19.2%; _P_ <.001, propensity-score matched). Patients who failed splenectomy and were then treated with rituximab had a 2-year FFR similar to that of patients who failed rituximab and were then treated with splenectomy (73.4% vs 59.9%; _P_ \\=.52). Patients treated with rituximab after splenectomy had a longer 2-year FFR than did patients treated with rituximab as a second-line treatment (73.4% vs 29.0%; _P_ <.001).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】For patients with ITP that relapse after treatment with steroids, splenectomy provides longer FFR than rituximab as a second-line therapy. Among patients who fail second-line treatment with splenectomy or rituximab, those who end up receiving sequential splenectomy-rituximab or rituximab-splenectomy therapy seem to derive similar benefit in the long term. Patients who received rituximab after splenectomy seem to derive superior benefit than do those who are treated with rituximab with an intact spleen.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】FFR ( freedom from relapse ), ITP ( immune thrombocytopenia ), sr-ITP ( steroid-refractory immune thrombocytopenia )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

If this condition occurs, your doctor may give you some medicines that can lower the amount of cholesterol and fats in the blood.\n\n【50】This medicine may increase prolactin blood levels if used for a long time. Check with your doctor if you have breast swelling or soreness, unusual breast milk production, absent, missed, or irregular menstrual periods, stopping of menstrual bleeding, loss in sexual ability, desire, drive, or performance, decreased interest in sexual intercourse, or an inability to have or keep an erection.\n\n【51】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you suddenly get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. If this problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【52】Paliperidone injection can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection.

Your doctor may need to check your weight on a regular basis while you are receiving this medicine. Talk to your doctor about ways to prevent weight gain.\n\n【57】Check with your doctor before using this medicine with alcohol or other medicines that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The use of alcohol or other medicines that affect the CNS with risperidone may worsen the side effects of this medicine, including dizziness, poor concentration, drowsiness, unusual dreams, and trouble with sleeping. Some examples of medicines that affect the CNS are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicines, medicine for depression, medicine for anxiety, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics.\n\n【58】If you plan to have children, talk with your doctor before using this medicine.

Trelegy Ellipta\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol combination is used to help control the symptoms of asthma and improve lung function. It is used when a patient's asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines, or when a patient's condition is so severe that more than one medicine is needed every day. This medicine will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.\n\n【6】Fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol combination is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is used long term to improve breathing problems and to reduce the number of COPD flare-ups (worsening of your COPD symptoms for several days). This medicine will not relieve a COPD attack that has already started.\n\n【7】Inhaled fluticasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids or steroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing certain cells in the lungs and breathing passages from releasing substances that cause asthma and COPD symptoms.\n\n【8】Inhaled umeclidinium and vilanterol are long-acting bronchodilators. These are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Powder\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Use of fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol combination is not recommended in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【18】### Geriatric\n\n【19】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

{"seq_id": "e5c16228-03f6-4112-aa25-0959d30d5f31", "title": "Fetal alcohol syndrome", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Fetal alcohol syndrome is a condition in a child that results from alcohol exposure during the mother's pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome causes brain damage and growth problems. The problems caused by fetal alcohol syndrome vary from child to child, but defects caused by fetal alcohol syndrome are not reversible.\n\n【2】There is no amount of alcohol that's known to be safe to consume during pregnancy. If you drink during pregnancy, you place your baby at risk of fetal alcohol syndrome.\n\n【3】If you suspect your child has fetal alcohol syndrome, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. Early diagnosis may help to reduce problems such as learning difficulties and behavioral issues.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The severity of fetal alcohol syndrome symptoms varies, with some children experiencing them to a far greater degree than others. Signs and symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome may include any mix of physical defects, intellectual or cognitive disabilities, and problems functioning and coping with daily life.\n\n【6】### Physical defects\n\n【7】Physical defects may include:\n\n【8】*   Distinctive facial features, including small eyes, an exceptionally thin upper lip, a short, upturned nose, and a smooth skin surface between the nose and upper lip\n*   Deformities of joints, limbs and fingers\n*   Slow physical growth before and after birth\n*   Vision difficulties or hearing problems\n*   Small head circumference and brain size\n*   Heart defects and problems with kidneys and bones\n\n【9】### Brain and central nervous system problems\n\n【10】Problems with the brain and central nervous system may include:\n\n【11】*   Poor coordination or balance\n*   Intellectual disability, learning disorders and delayed development\n*   Poor memory\n*   Trouble with attention and with processing information\n*   Difficulty with reasoning and problem-solving\n*   Difficulty identifying consequences of choices\n*   Poor judgment skills\n*   Jitteriness or hyperactivity\n*   Rapidly changing moods\n\n【12】### Social and behavioral issues\n\n【13】Problems in functioning, coping and interacting with others may include:\n\n【14】*   Difficulty in school\n*   Trouble getting along with others\n*   Poor social skills\n*   Trouble adapting to change or switching from one task to another\n*   Problems with behavior and impulse control\n*   Poor concept of time\n*   Problems staying on task\n*   Difficulty planning or working toward a goal\n\n【15】### When to see a doctor\n\n【16】If you're pregnant and can't stop drinking, ask your obstetrician, primary care doctor or mental health professional for help.\n\n【17】Because early diagnosis may help reduce the risk of long-term problems for children with fetal alcohol syndrome, let your child's doctor know if you drank alcohol while you were pregnant. Don't wait for problems to arise before seeking help.\n\n【18】If you have adopted a child or are providing foster care, you may not know if the biological mother drank alcohol while pregnant — and it may not initially occur to you that your child may have fetal alcohol syndrome. However, if your child has problems with learning and behavior, talk with his or her doctor so that the underlying cause might be identified.\n\n【19】Causes\n------\n\n【20】When you're pregnant and you drink alcohol:\n\n【21】*   Alcohol enters your bloodstream and reaches your developing fetus by crossing the placenta\n*   Alcohol causes higher blood alcohol concentrations in your developing baby than in your body because a fetus metabolizes alcohol slower than an adult does\n*   Alcohol interferes with the delivery of oxygen and optimal nutrition to your developing baby\n*   Exposure to alcohol before birth can harm the development of tissues and organs and cause permanent brain damage in your baby\n\n【22】The more you drink while pregnant, the greater the risk to your unborn baby. However, any amount of alcohol puts your baby at risk. Your baby's brain, heart and blood vessels begin to develop in the early weeks of pregnancy, before you may know you're pregnant.\n\n【23】Impairment of facial features, the heart and other organs, including the bones, and the central nervous system may occur as a result of drinking alcohol during the first trimester. That's when these parts of the fetus are in key stages of development. However, the risk is present at any time during pregnancy.\n\n【24】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【25】The more alcohol you drink during pregnancy, the greater the chance of problems in your baby. There's no known safe amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.\n\n【26】You could put your baby at risk even before you realize you're pregnant. Don't drink alcohol if:\n\n【27】*   You're pregnant\n*   You think you might be pregnant\n*   You're trying to become pregnant\n\n【28】Complications\n-------------\n\n【29】Problem behaviors not present at birth that can result from having fetal alcohol syndrome (secondary disabilities) may include:\n\n【30】*   Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n*   Aggression, inappropriate social conduct, and breaking rules and laws\n*   Alcohol or drug misuse\n*   Mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety or eating disorders\n*   Problems staying in or completing school\n*   Problems with independent living and with employment\n*   Inappropriate sexual behaviors\n*   Early death by accident, homicide or suicide\n\n【31】Prevention\n----------\n\n【32】Experts know that fetal alcohol syndrome is completely preventable if women don't drink alcohol at all during pregnancy.\n\n【33】These guidelines can help prevent fetal alcohol syndrome:\n\n【34】*   **Don't drink alcohol if you're trying to get pregnant.** If you haven't already stopped drinking, stop as soon as you know you're pregnant or if you even think you might be pregnant. It's never too late to stop drinking during your pregnancy, but the sooner you stop, the better it is for your baby.\n*   **Continue to avoid alcohol throughout your pregnancy.** Fetal alcohol syndrome is completely preventable in children whose mothers don't drink during pregnancy.\n*   **Consider giving up alcohol during your childbearing years** if you're sexually active and you're having unprotected sex. Many pregnancies are unplanned, and damage can occur in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.\n*   **If you have an alcohol problem, get help before you get pregnant.** Get professional help to determine your level of dependence on alcohol and to develop a treatment plan.\n\n【35】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "1128317e-6a54-4835-8bf5-a72e94d09188", "title": "Encephalitis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is inflammation of the brain. There are several causes, including viral infection, autoimmune inflammation, bacterial infection, insect bites and others. When inflammation is caused by an infection in the brain, it's known as infectious encephalitis. And when it's caused by your own immune system attacking the brain, it's known as autoimmune encephalitis. Sometimes there is no known cause.\n\n【2】In some cases, encephalitis can be life-threatening. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important because it's difficult to predict how encephalitis will affect each individual.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Encephalitis may cause many different symptoms including confusion, personality changes, seizures or problems with movement. Encephalitis also may cause changes in sight or hearing.\n\n【5】Most people with infectious encephalitis have flu-like symptoms, such as:\n\n【6】*   Headache.\n*   Fever.\n*   Aches in muscles or joints.\n*   Fatigue or weakness.\n\n【7】Typically, these are followed by more-severe symptoms over a period of hours to days, such as:\n\n【8】*   Stiff neck.\n*   Confusion, agitation or hallucinations.\n*   Seizures.\n*   Loss of sensation or being unable to move certain areas of the face or body.\n*   Irregular movements.\n*   Muscle weakness.\n*   Problems with speech or hearing.\n*   Loss of consciousness, including coma.\n\n【9】In infants and young children, signs and symptoms also might include:\n\n【10】*   Bulging in the soft spots of an infant's skull, known as fontanels.\n*   Nausea and vomiting.\n*   Stiffness affecting the whole body.\n*   Poor feeding or not waking for a feeding.\n*   Irritability.\n\n【11】In cases of autoimmune encephalitis, symptoms may develop more slowly over several weeks. Flu-like symptoms are less common, but can sometimes happen weeks before more-severe symptoms start. Symptoms are different for everyone, but it's common for people to have a combination of symptoms including:\n\n【12】*   Changes in personality.\n*   Memory loss.\n*   Problems understanding what is real and what is not, known as psychosis.\n*   Seeing or hearing things that aren't there. These are called hallucinations.\n*   Seizures.\n*   Changes in vision.\n*   Sleep problems.\n*   Muscle weakness.\n*   Loss of sensation.\n*   Problems walking.\n*   Abnormal movements.\n*   Bladder and bowel problems.\n\n【13】### When to see a doctor\n\n【14】Get immediate care if you are experiencing any of the more-severe symptoms associated with encephalitis. A severe headache, fever and change in consciousness require urgent care.\n\n【15】Infants and young children with any signs or symptoms of encephalitis should receive urgent care.\n\n【16】Causes\n------\n\n【17】In approximately half of patients, the exact cause of encephalitis is not known.\n\n【18】In those for whom a cause is identified, there are two main types of encephalitis:\n\n【19】*   **Infectious encephalitis.** This condition occurs when a virus or other agent directly infects the brain. The infection may affect one area or be widespread. Viruses are the most common causes of infectious encephalitis, including some that can be passed by mosquitoes or ticks. Very rarely, encephalitis may be caused by bacteria, fungus or parasites.\n*   **Autoimmune encephalitis.** This condition occurs when your own immune cells mistakenly attack the brain or make antibodies targeting proteins and receptors in the brain. The exact reason why this happens is not completely understood. Sometimes the abnormal immune response can be triggered by benign or cancerous tumors, known as paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis. Other types of autoimmune encephalitis such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) can be triggered by infection in your body. This is known as post-infectious autoimmune encephalitis. In many instances, no definitive trigger for the abnormal immune response is identified.\n\n【20】### Common viral causes\n\n【21】The viruses that can cause encephalitis include:\n\n【22】*   **Herpes simplex virus (HSV).** Both HSV type 1 — associated with cold sores and fever blisters around your mouth — and HSV type 2 — associated with genital herpes — can cause encephalitis. Encephalitis caused by HSV type 1 is rare but can result in significant brain damage or death.\n*   **Other herpes viruses.** These include the Epstein-Barr virus, which commonly causes infectious mononucleosis, and the varicella-zoster virus, which commonly causes chickenpox and shingles.\n*   **Enteroviruses.** These viruses include the poliovirus and the coxsackievirus, which usually cause an illness with flu-like symptoms, eye inflammation and abdominal pain.\n*   **Mosquito-borne viruses.** These viruses can cause infections such as West Nile, La Crosse, St. Louis, western equine and eastern equine encephalitis. Symptoms of an infection might appear within a few days to a couple of weeks after exposure to a mosquito-borne virus.\n*   **Tick-borne viruses.** The Powassan virus is carried by ticks and causes encephalitis in the Midwestern United States. Symptoms usually appear about a week after a bite from an infected tick.\n*   **Rabies virus.** Infection with the rabies virus, which is usually transmitted by a bite from an infected animal, causes a rapid progression to encephalitis once symptoms begin. Rabies is a rare cause of encephalitis in the United States.\n\n【23】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【24】Anyone can develop encephalitis. Factors that may increase the risk include:\n\n【25】*   **Age.** Some types of encephalitis are more common or more-severe in certain age groups. In general, young children and older adults are at greater risk of most types of viral encephalitis. Similarly, some forms of autoimmune encephalitis are more common in children and young adults, whereas others are more common in older adults.\n*   **Weakened immune system.** People who have HIV/AIDS, take immune-suppressing medicines or have another condition causing a weakened immune system are at increased risk of encephalitis.\n*   **Geographical regions.** Mosquito- or tick-borne viruses are common in particular geographical regions.\n*   **Season of the year.** Mosquito- and tick-borne diseases tend to be more common in summer in many areas of the United States.\n*   **Autoimmune disease.** People who already have an autoimmune condition may be more prone to develop autoimmune encephalitis.\n*   **Smoking.** Smoking increases the chances of developing lung cancer, which in turn increases the risk of developing paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis.\n\n【26】Complications\n-------------\n\n【27】The complications of encephalitis vary, depending on factors such as:\n\n【28】*   Your age.\n*   The cause of your infection.\n*   The severity of your initial illness.\n*   The time from disease onset to treatment.\n\n【29】People with relatively mild illness usually recover within a few weeks with no long-term complications.\n\n【30】### Complications of severe illness\n\n【31】Inflammation can injure the brain, possibly resulting in a coma or death.\n\n【32】Other complications may last for months or be permanent. These complications can vary widely in severity and can include:\n\n【33】*   Persistent fatigue.\n*   Weakness or lack of muscle coordination.\n*   Personality changes.\n*   Memory problems.\n*   Hearing or vision defects.\n*   Speech impairments.\n\n【34】Prevention\n----------\n\n【35】The best way to prevent viral encephalitis is to take precautions to avoid exposure to viruses that can cause the disease. Try to:\n\n【36】*   **Practice good hygiene.** Wash hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before and after meals.\n*   **Don't share utensils.** Don't share tableware and beverages.\n*   **Teach your children good habits.** Make sure they practice good hygiene and avoid sharing utensils at home and school.\n*   **Get vaccinations.** Keep your own and your children's vaccinations current. Before traveling, talk to your health care provider about recommended vaccinations for different destinations.\n\n【37】### Protection against mosquitoes and ticks\n\n【38】To minimize your exposure to mosquitoes and ticks:\n\n【39】*   **Dress to protect yourself.** Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants if you're outside between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active, and when you're in a wooded area with tall grasses and shrubs where ticks are more common.\n*   **Apply mosquito repellent.** Chemicals such as DEET can be applied to both the skin and clothes. To apply repellent to your face, spray it on your hands and then wipe it on your face. If you're using both sunscreen and a repellent, apply sunscreen first.\n*   **Use insecticide.** The Environmental Protection Agency recommends the use of products containing permethrin, which repels and kills ticks and mosquitoes. These products can be sprayed on clothing, tents and other outdoor gear. Permethrin shouldn't be applied to the skin.\n*   **Avoid mosquitoes.** Refrain from unnecessary activity in places where mosquitoes are most common. If possible, avoid being outdoors from dusk till dawn, when mosquitoes are most active. Repair broken windows and screens.\n*   **Get rid of water sources outside your home.** Eliminate standing water in your yard, where mosquitoes can lay their eggs. Common problems include flowerpots or other gardening containers, flat roofs, old tires, and clogged gutters.\n*   **Look for outdoor signs of viral disease.** If you notice sick or dying birds or animals, report your observations to your local health department.\n\n【40】### Protection for young children\n\n【41】Insect repellents aren't recommended for use on infants younger than 2 months of age. Instead, cover an infant carrier or stroller with mosquito netting.\n\n【42】For older infants and children, repellents with 10% to 30% DEET are considered safe. Products containing both DEET and sunscreen aren't recommended for children because reapplication — which might be necessary for the sunscreen component — will expose the child to too much DEET.\n\n【43】Tips for using mosquito repellent with children include:\n\n【44】*   Always assist children with the use of mosquito repellent.\n*   Spray on clothing and exposed skin.\n*   Apply the repellent when outdoors to lessen the risk of inhaling the repellent.\n*   Spray repellent on your hands and then apply it to your child's face. Take care around the eyes and ears.\n*   Don't use repellent on the hands of young children who may put their hands in their mouths.\n*   Wash treated skin with soap and water when you come indoors.\n\n【45】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Although RCTs provide the best assessment of the overall value of a therapy, high-quality evidence from RCTs is often incomplete, contradictory, or absent even in areas that have been most exhaustively studied. Moreover, the likelihood of the success or failure of a therapy is not identical in all the individuals treated in any trial because therapy is not the only determinant of outcome. Therefore, the overall results of a trial cannot be assumed to apply to any particular individual, not even someone who corresponds to all the entry criteria for the trial. In addition, the potential for bias due to financial conflicts remains in many guideline groups. Guidelines are key sources of knowledge. Nevertheless, limitations in the extent, quality, generalizability, and transferability of evidence mean that we clinicians must still reason through the best choices for an individual because even in the absence of full and secure knowledge, clinical decisions must still be made. Clinical reasoning is the pragmatic, tried-and-true process of expert clinical problem solving that does value mechanistic reasoning and clinical experience as well as RCTs and observational studies. Clinicians must continue to value clinical reasoning if our aim is the best clinical care for all the individuals we treat.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】EBM ( evidence-based medicine ), LDL ( low-density lipoprotein ), RCT ( randomized clinical trial )\n\n【4】Evidence-based medicine (EBM) was originally defined as the process of “integrating individual clinical expertise and the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.”\n\n【5】无关删除-2:<u>*   Sackett D.J.\n*   Rosenberg W.M.\n*   Gray J.A.\n*   Haynes R.B.\n*   Richardson W.S.</u>\n\n【6】Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn’t.\n\n【7】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_BMJ._ 1996; 312 : 71-72</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【9】The patient and the physician remained the central decision makers, but the physician was alerted to the randomized clinical trial (RCT) as the best experimental model to determine the potential benefits of new therapies. Evidence-based medicine, so defined, was unquestionably a major advance and an overdue corrective to medical opinions and decisions that too often were not based on rigorously obtained evidence, but rather were the products of inappropriate extensions of mechanistic reasoning and selective recall of personal experience. Beliefs, sometimes, became evidence. Patients with coronary disease died of ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, suppressing ventricular extrasystoles with antiarrhythmic agents should save lives. However, this is not true. Indeed, the opposite was found in an RCT,\n\n【10】Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) Investigators  \nPreliminary report: effect of encainide and flecainide on mortality in a randomized trial of arrhythmia suppression after myocardial infarction.\n\n【11】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1989; 321 : 406-412</u></u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (3132)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【13】and the death of that unfounded belief gave birth to EBM.\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   Howick J.H.</u>\n\n【15】The Philosophy of Evidence-Based Medicine.\n\n【16】Wiley-Blackwell/BMJ Books , Chichester, United Kingdom 2011\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (342)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【18】Randomized clinical trials are essential to evaluate therapies that reduce rather than eliminate a complication of a disease. However, EBM in its first formulation failed because most physicians did not think that they were sufficiently expert or had enough time to evaluate research publications that appeared with exponentially increasing frequency and often reported conflicting results that were described in a highly technical and recondite language, language that sometimes seemed designed to intimidate, not inform. In response, the guideline process was created. Experts were gathered and charged to evaluate the evidence and to issue recommendations regarding actions that should or should not be taken. The decisional process became codified and displaced from the individual patient and physician.\n\n【19】Much good has been achieved from the guideline process. As the guideline process has evolved, the categorization and weighting of evidence has been progressively formalized such that the “best” evidence is separated from the rest, and recommendations are to be based on the best. Thus, RCTs, and, even better, meta-analyses of RCTs, are the highest quality evidence, whereas clinical experience and mechanistic reasoning are not accepted either as evidence or as tests of evidence.\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>*   Howick J.H.</u>\n\n【21】The Philosophy of Evidence-Based Medicine.\n\n【22】Wiley-Blackwell/BMJ Books , Chichester, United Kingdom 2011\n\n【23】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (342)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【24】Guideline recommendations have become the standard of care, and quality of care is increasingly assessed on the basis of adherence to these recommendations. To be sure, the recommendations of guideline groups are always accompanied by a brief statement that they can be modified on the basis of individual patient circumstances and preferences. But just how this is to be done and what role clinical expertise and mechanistic reasoning should play in this process are not formally addressed. Indeed, if clinical expertise and mechanistic reasoning are disallowed any role in framing guideline recommendations about care, how can they be legitimate tools to modify such recommendations?\n\n【25】Unfortunately, the insights gained in every age may become its blind spots, just as its advances may become its excesses. Guidelines and EBM are no exception. We accept that RCTs are the best method to test therapies, and we salute the efforts our colleagues make in serving on guideline groups. However, we believe that the evidence RCTs provide is too often incomplete, inconclusive, absent, or outdated. Indeed, guideline writers themselves have documented that most recommendations are not based on RCTs and meta-analyses, but rather are increasingly supported only by lower levels of evidence.\n\n【26】无关删除-2:<u>*   Tricoci P.\n*   Allen J.M.\n*   Dramer J.M.\n*   Califf R.M.\n*   Smith Jr. S.C.</u>\n\n【27】Scientific evidence underlying the ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines.\n\n【28】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 2009; 301 : 831-841</u></u>\n\n【29】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (750)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【30】Therefore, there is an inherent limit as to how definitive guideline recommendations can be.\n\n【31】Finally, and a point not widely understood or commented on, there is, at least for the moment, a critical limitation in our ability to meaningfully translate the overall results of a trial into the likelihood that an individual patient will respond to, or be injured by, the therapy that was tested.\n\n【32】Notwithstanding our colleagues’ best efforts, guidelines have not overcome these limitations in the evidence and its transferability, nor indeed have they generally acknowledged them. Thus, we argue that clinical reasoning—the expert, pragmatic, complex, subtle, analytical process that physicians and surgeons have routinely used to solve clinical problems in individual patients—continues to play an indispensable role in clinical decision making because the individual patient, who is real, and not the “average” patient, who is not, needs to remain the focus of our attention. We do not argue against guidelines being major determinants of care. We do argue against them being the only determinants of care.\n\n【33】Limitations in the Evidence in EBM\n----------------------------------\n\n【34】### No Evidence, Incomplete Evidence, or Conflicting Evidence\n\n【35】We contend that limitations in the evidence are a major limitation of EBM.

The overall probability of benefit documented in the treated group in an RCT would apply only to individuals with characteristics identical to those studied if the likelihood of drug-delivered benefit and drug-produced adverse events was equally probable in all individuals in the group that had been studied. This is almost never the case. Within any clinical trial, individuals are recruited with various characteristics, many of which, even if not specified, will affect outcome. These effects are balanced by randomization into groups in the RCT but come into full play in the clinical outcome of the individual. Moreover, there is frequently substantial heterogeneity in the individual responses to therapy, such as the wide variance in lowering of LDL cholesterol by rosuvastatin,\n\n【154】无关删除-2:<u>*   Awan Z.\n*   Seidah N.G.\n*   MacFadyen J.G.\n\n【155】Rosuvastatin, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 concentrations, and LDL cholesterol response: the JUPITER trial.\n\n【156】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin Chem._ 2012; 58 : 183-189</u></u>\n\n【157】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (120)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【158】a phenomenon that should raise doubt as to the validity of any recommendation of a standard one-size-fits-all regimen–based strategy.\n\n【159】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hayward R.A.\n*   Krumholz H.</u>\n\n【160】Three reasons to abandon low-density lipoprotein targets: an open letter to the adult treatment panel IV of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n【161】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes._ 2012; 5 : 2-5</u></u>\n\n【162】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (115)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【163】An even more dramatic reality is that the same therapy may benefit some and injure others, but the beneficiary and the victim cannot be confidently distinguished by conventional analysis of an RCT. We need to learn how this and identifying the clinical exceptions to the guideline rules and learning from them could provide important new insights into who is particularly likely to benefit from a therapy and who is particularly likely to be harmed.\n\n【164】### Limitations in Meta-analyses\n\n【165】Meta-analyses are considered the highest level of evidence. Meta-analyses integrate the results of a number of studies to calculate more precisely what the average result of an intervention is likely to be. However, meta-analyses select the studies they include on the basis of certain criteria. These restrictions may be reasonable to ensure that all studies are comparable in certain important aspects but will, unfortunately, from time to time, eliminate a particular trial whose design might mirror exactly a specific clinical problem. Moreover, in meta-analyses, the range of possible results is not presented, only the range of the average result. The trials included in a meta-analysis almost inevitably differ somewhat in precisely what treatment was given and to whom it was given. This may increase the robustness of the calculation of the average effect, but it makes less certain to whom this effect applies.\n\n【166】Although the relative benefit of a therapy may be similar in multiple patient groups, the actual benefit is almost always a function of specific patient characteristics. Thus, the older the patient, the higher the blood pressure, and the higher the cholesterol, the greater the absolute benefit of lowering blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\n【167】无关删除-2:<u>*   Baigent C.\n*   Blackwell L.\n*   Emberson J.\n\n【168】Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) Collaboration  \nEfficacy and safety of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol: a meta-analysis of data from 170,000 participants in 26 randomized trials.\n\n【169】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Lancet._ 2010; 376 : 1670-1681</u></u>\n\n【170】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (4756)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【171】So, the irony is that as our knowledge about the outcome in groups becomes stronger, the relation of that outcome to individuals becomes weaker.\n\n【172】### Limitations in the Guideline Process\n\n【173】Guidelines have become the forum in which the evidence is evaluated. Guidelines acquire their authority from multiple sources: from the perceived expertise and integrity of those who participate in them, from the prestige of the societies that sponsor them, from the renown of the journals in which they appear, and, increasingly, from the perceived consequences of not adhering to them. However, there are failings that have not been adequately addressed, which include the persistent challenge of financial conflicts of interest among those who participate,\n\n【174】Lenzer J, Hoffman JR, Furberg CD, Ioannidis JPA.

For science to advance, challenge must be possible.\n\n【182】The guideline process is too important to fail, and we must work together to improve its performance. Nevertheless, even the powerful guidance to care provided by the guidelines does not relieve physicians of their responsibility to determine the most appropriate therapy for the specific patient they are treating.\n\n【183】What is Clinical Reasoning?\n---------------------------\n\n【184】If the highest-quality evidence is incomplete, as it so often is and as guideline writers themselves admit,\n\n【185】无关删除-2:<u>*   Tricoci P.\n*   Allen J.M.\n*   Dramer J.M.\n*   Califf R.M.\n*   Smith Jr. S.C.</u>\n\n【186】Scientific evidence underlying the ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines.\n\n【187】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 2009; 301 : 831-841</u></u>\n\n【188】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (750)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【189】how can the gap to best care be bridged?

Clinical reasoning is certainly not a license to guess or to ignore RCTs. Guidelines, which summarize evidence and offer recommendations, are the starting point of clinical reasoning. However, clinical reasoning accepts the probabilistic nature of decisions and acknowledges that all decisions are provisional. Clinical reasoning is pragmatic to its core because it declares that clinical decisions should be based on an analysis of the consequences of acting or not acting on what we think will happen to the patient immediately in front of us if we do this rather than that.\n\n【201】无关删除-2:<u>*   Thayer H.S.</u>\n\n【202】Meaning and Action: A Critical History of Pragmatism.\n\n【203】2nd ed.

Indeed, it is our individual abilities to imagine all that is possible, to grade the likelihood and the significance of one outcome vs another, to understand the limitations as well as the strengths in our analysis of the evidence, to evaluate accurately the condition and circumstances of the individual patient, to know in detail the multiplicity of possible responses to the therapies we are considering; it is all these skills and reasoning wrapped together that distinguishes the clinical reasoning of the expert clinician.\n\n【206】An example may be helpful. A postoperative patient was not doing well after mitral valve replacement, but there were, as is so often the case, many competing explanations without clear evidence for one as opposed to another. Routine investigations included echocardiography, which documented normal left ventricular systolic function and only mild aortic regurgitation. Nevertheless, the pulmonary hydrostatic pressures were markedly elevated, and no acceptable explanation was apparent. Thus, a decision was made to perform an aortogram; it revealed severe aortic insufficiency, which, by producing high left ventricular diastolic pressures, resulted in high pulmonary pressures. The severe aortic insufficiency was a complication of the insertion of the mitral valve, an unusual complication to be sure, but one that was hemodynamically devastating. Aortic valve replacement was followed by rapid and complete recovery. In retrospect, the echocardiogram apparently underestimated the degree of regurgitation because of the rapid decay in aortic pressure and the rapid increase in left ventricular pressure produced by the severe acute regurgitation.\n\n【207】Clinical reasoning is the problem-solving process that first determined the severity of the clinical problem (the patient might well not survive), then identified a specific feature that needed to be explained (the elevated pulmonary hydrostatic pressures), and finally determined that the evidence that had been gathered by routine processes (the echocardiogram) was inadequate and needed to be set aside. Indeed, our ability to recognize that the evidence may be misleading or inadequate even when we do not know the specific flaw at that moment is a hallmark of clinical reasoning. And so is the confidence to proceed when necessary with incomplete information and incomplete understanding. Only after the aortogram was obtained did the facts that seemed discordant and contradictory fall into place. This example illustrates why we characterize clinical reasoning as a complex, pragmatic, and imaginative reasoning process.\n\n【208】We stand with Bradford Hill, one of the fathers of RCTs, who said that “Any belief that the controlled trial is the only way would mean not that the pendulum had swung too far but that it had come right off the hook.”\n\n【209】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hill A.B.</u>\n\n【210】Reflections on the controlled trial.\n\n【211】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Rheum Dis._ 1966; 25 : 107-113</u></u>\n\n【212】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【213】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【214】Clinical reasoning remains integral to clinical care because the evidence from RCTs remains incomplete and the generalizability and transferability of the results of RCTs remain challenging. Few physicians, if any, have the time or the expertise to review all the relevant knowledge, and therefore, the guideline process remains essential to sort out and evaluate what is known. However, the evaluation of evidence is only one step in the process of care. To be sure, guidelines frequently state, at one point or another, that their recommendations are just that—recommendations—and they should be modified on the basis of the particular wishes and circumstances of the patient. They do not, however, identify this additional step as an integral part of the process, and they do not, specifically and unequivocally, validate clinical reasoning as a copartner in care. On the basis of the actual medical circumstances of individuals and their personal preferences, reasoned and reasonable extrapolations from recommendations remain essential, and guidelines and organizations that oversee care must leave room for this to occur.\n\n【215】Clinical reasoning is essential to integrate the knowledge from RCTs into a specific clinical context. We need to acknowledge this and value and teach clinical reasoning if we are to appropriately value ourselves as caregivers and meet our responsibilities to patients who have placed their trust in us.\n\n【216】无关删除-1:<u>Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------</u>\n\n【217】无关删除-1:<u>*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI4NmUyOGJmNmE0ZDIzMDNjOWNmNzAyMjU2YjEyMjM2YiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDIzMjcxfQ.gV0XSnt1t2GRU2w2CC4YjZdXs5TXKqqhC-ZUbDL-gYG3EywGFt7tVQnunEImmKNGjGRCSEb9H07k-S1O3sD73E5jrrU6Wr1po22Ez57PUVsYU2iZPEJ7A5AFCfAafsyC937ATX3biDaEgoXXHXv6LyyhbQqBka3sM8EhBMeK05m19T\\_DqP\\_kwTAiiXbcZCr66i0rRk2p-ZyzdnX7bkUZ9nb08qNYVXurnkR7oFszW6\\_JK3tZ3b8\\_eHjrJzWxlXHmrAW8jsFIl0c9uAmpwq5tTLWY\\_S2s-cxajnVL35wjiE7ByMOXyezecd7ei2-\\_gsQiEtvcDh-\\_pAxjCwxwWbUqJQ\n\n【218】    Download .mp4 (109.38 MB)\n\n【219】    Help with .mp4 files\n\n【220】    Video 1</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Those with diabetes mellitus or a history of coronary, peripheral, or cerebral vascular disease were excluded. Other information, such as Framingham risk score (FRS), was obtained by a review of clinical and laboratory data.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of 118 patients, 89 (75%) had a CACS of zero and 94 (80%) were men; mean ± SD age was 48.9±5.7 years. The mean FRS of this group was 4.0; 86 patients (97%) were considered at low risk (<1% annualized rate) of cardiovascular events. Evidence of carotid atherosclerosis was found in 42 (47%; 95% confidence interval, 37%-58%) of these 89 patients; carotid plaque was found in 30 (34%); and CIMT above the 75th percentile was found in 12 (13%) of age-, sex-, and race-matched control patients. Of the 40 patients with low-risk CIMT (below the 50th percentile), 4 (10%) had a CACS at or above the 50th percentile.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Subclinical vascular disease can be detected by CIMT evaluation in young to middle-aged patients with a low FRS and a CACS of zero. These findings have important implications for vascular disease screening and the implementation of primary-prevention strategies.\n\n【8】ARIC ( Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ), CACS ( coronary artery calcium score ), CIMT ( carotid intima-media thickness ), CT ( computed tomography ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), FRS ( Framingham risk score )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Supplements provided consisted of full-dose almonds (73±5 g/d), half-dose almonds (38±3 g/d) plus half-dose muffins, and full-dose muffins (control). Energy and macronutrients, including individual fatty acids, were measured in the dietary supplements and fecal samples using gas chromatography and Association of Official Analytical Chemists methods. Serum was measured for lipids and fatty acids. Bioaccessibility of energy and macronutrients from almond consumption was assessed from dietary intake (7-day food records) and fecal output.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Almond-related energy bioaccessibility was 78.5%±3.1%, with an average energy loss of 21.2%±3.1% (40.6 kcal/d in the full-dose almond phase). Bioaccessibility of energy and fat from the diet as a whole was significantly less with almond consumption (in both half- and full-dose phases) compared with the control. Bioaccessibility of fat was significantly different between treatment phases ( _P_ <.001) and on average lower by 5.1% and 6.3% in the half- and full-dose almond phases, respectively, compared with the control phase. Energy bioaccessibility was significantly different between the treatment phases ( _P_ \\=.02), decreasing by approximately 2% with the inclusion of the full dose of almonds compared with the control.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Energy content of almonds may not be as bioaccessible in individuals with hyperlipidemia as predicted by Atwater factors, as suggested by the increased fat excretion with almond intake compared with the control.\n\n【9】### Trial Registration\n\n【10】ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00507520.\n\n【11】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【12】BMI ( body mass index ), FAME ( fatty acid methyl ester ), LDL-C ( low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), NCEP ( National Cholesterol Education Program )\n\n【13】Almonds, a nutrient-dense tree nut, gained the public’s attention because of their serum lipid–lowering effects\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   Spiller G.A.\n*   Jenkins D.A.\n*   Bosello O.\n*   Gates J.E.\n*   Cragen L.N.\n*   Bruce B.</u>\n\n【15】Nuts and plasma lipids: an almond-based diet lowers LDL-C while preserving HDL-C.\n\n【16】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Am Coll Nutr._ 1998; 17 : 285-290</u></u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (159)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>*   Jenkins D.J.\n*   Kendall C.W.\n*   Marchie A.\n\n【19】Dose response of almonds on coronary heart disease risk factors: blood lipids, oxidized low-density lipoproteins, lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, and pulmonary nitric oxide: a randomized, controlled, crossover trial.\n\n【20】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Circulation._ 2002; 106 : 1327-1332</u></u>\n\n【21】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (339)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【22】and additionally for their cardiometabolic health benefits.\n\n【23】无关删除-2:<u>*   Becerra-Tomas N.\n*   Paz-Graniel I.\n*   Kendall C.W.C.\n\n【24】Nut consumption and incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular disease mortality: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.\n\n【25】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Nutr Rev._ 2019; 77 : 691-709</u></u>\n\n【26】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (88)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【27】无关删除-2:<u>*   Mayhew A.J.\n*   de Souza R.J.\n*   Meyre D.\n*   Anand S.S.\n*   Mente A.</u>\n\n【28】A systematic review and meta-analysis of nut consumption and incident risk of CVD and all-cause mortality.\n\n【29】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Br J Nutr._ 2016; 115 : 212-225</u></u>\n\n【30】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (110)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-2:<u>*   Blanco Mejia S.\n*   Kendall C.W.\n*   Viguiliouk E.\n\n【32】Effect of tree nuts on metabolic syndrome criteria: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.\n\n【33】删除3:<u>_BMJ Open._ 2014; 4 : e004660</u>\n\n【34】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (108)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【35】无关删除-2:<u>*   Viguiliouk E.\n*   Kendall C.W.\n*   Blanco Mejia S.\n\n【36】Effect of tree nuts on glycemic control in diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled dietary trials \\[erratum appears in _PLoS One_ . 2014;9(9):e109224\\].\n\n【37】删除3:<u>_PloS One._ 2014; 9 : e103376</u>\n\n【38】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (123)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【39】Despite that almonds are a plant-based protein source providing vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytonutrients, they are also viewed as an energy-dense food choice owing to their high-fat content.

All participants gave informed consent.\n\n【104】### Study Design\n\n【105】The investigation is an exploratory analysis of a randomized crossover trial of participants with hyperlipidemia consuming 3 isoenergetic supplements (ie, 3 phases), each for 1 month, with at least a 2-week washout period between each phase conducted from September 20, 2000, through June 27, 2001. The Figure shows the design of the study. After an overnight fast (12-14 hours), anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and blood samples were obtained at randomization and at the end of each phase. At week 4 of each phase, 7-day weighed diet records, questionnaires on satiety and bowel movements, and fecal samples were collected. Fecal samples consisted of 3-day fecal collections made on an outpatient basis. Participants were provided with under-seat lavatory frames lined with plastic bags to be removed after use. Feces were weighed and stored at −20°C before mixing, homogenizing, and freeze-drying. Given the nature of the foods provided, participants and dietitians providing dietary counseling could not be blinded. However, investigators involved in the preparation of databases and laboratory determinations were blinded with respect to treatment sequence.\n\n【106】Figure Schematic of the randomized, controlled, crossover study design. I, information session; S, screening visit; –2, training visit; R, randomization. The asterisk represents the timings of the collection of the 7-day diet records, serum samples, and fecal samples used in the analyses. The study design consisted of 3 phases and 3 treatments; each participant consumed all 3 treatments in different phases, with the treatment order depending on the randomization. Treatments consisted of isoenergetic intake of a control, half-dose almonds, or full-dose almonds per day, which were consumed as part of a National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step 2 background diet.\n\n【107】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【108】### Study Participants\n\n【109】Men and postmenopausal women with hyperlipidemia but otherwise healthy were recruited by newspaper advertisement and from patients visiting the Risk Factor Modification Centre of St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Inclusion criteria included low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration of more than 4.1 mmol/L at recruitment. People were excluded if they were taking lipid-lowering medications, exhibited clinical or biochemical evidence of diabetes or renal or hepatic disease, had a body mass index (BMI) above 32 kg/m  , used antibiotics within 3 months of the study start date, used hormone replacement therapy, smoked or consumed significant amounts of alcohol (>1 drink/d), or had a triglyceride level above 4.0 mmol/L. Participants were randomized by use of a computer number generator and received treatment allocation by sealed opaque envelopes.\n\n【110】### Study Diets\n\n【111】During all phases, participants were counseled on strategies to facilitate weight maintenance and followed their self-selected, low-fat therapeutic diets (based on National Cholesterol Education Program \\[NCEP\\] Step 2 dietary guideline recommendations) into which they incorporated the provided study supplements. Nuts, soy, and dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, or herbal remedies) were excluded in the background diet during all phases of the study. Raw almonds and the control muffins were supplied, with the control supplement being matched to the calculated energy content of the almond supplement interventions. The 3 isoenergetic dietary supplements provided 22.2% of daily energy. Daily energy requirements were assessed by Lipid Research Clinics tables\n\n【112】Lipid Research Clinics Program  \nPopulation Studies Data Book, vol 2.

The muffins were made from whole-wheat flour with corn oil sufficient to provide the same amount of fiber, saturated fats, and polyunsaturated fats as the almonds, and skim milk powder and egg white to provide a similar level of protein, although the muffin protein was 46% of animal origin. This balance allowed comparison of the effects of monounsaturated fat from almonds with starch from muffins. No directions were provided with respect to mastication of the dietary supplements.\n\n【116】### Analyses\n\n【117】Body weight was measured with a calibrated digital scale, and height was measured with a calibrated stadiometer; BMI was calculated as weight divided by height in meters squared. Body fat was determined using bioelectrical impedance analysis.\n\n【118】The 7-day diet records were analyzed using the computer program ESHA, the Food Processor SQL (version 10.9.0), based on data from the Canadian Nutrient File\n\n【119】Health Canada  \nNutrient Values of Some Common Foods.\n\n【120】Minister of Health Canada , Ottawa, ON 2008\n\n【121】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【122】and the US Department of Agriculture\n\n【123】US Department of Agriculture  \nComposition of Foods, Agriculture Handbook No. 23: The Agriculture Research Service.\n\n【124】US Department of Agriculture , Washington, DC 2010\n\n【125】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【126】with additional measurements made for local foods.

The FAMEs were quantified on a Varian 430-GC gas chromatograph equipped with a Varian FactorFour capillary column (VF-23 ms; 30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter × 0.25 μm film thickness) and a flame ionization detector. Samples were injected in splitless mode. The injector and detector ports were set at 250°C. The FAMEs were eluted using a temperature program set initially at 50°C for 2 minutes, increased at 20°C per minute and held at 170°C for 1 minute, then at 3°C per minute and held at 212°C for 5 minutes to complete the run at 28 minutes. The carrier gas was helium, set to a constant flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Peaks were identified by retention times of FAME standards (Nu-Chek-Prep). Fatty acid concentrations were calculated by proportional comparison of gas chromatography peak areas with that of the heptadecanoic acid internal standard.\n\n【151】A 6-point Likert scale was used to measure ease of bowel movements (from easy to pass to difficult to pass), stool consistency (watery to very hard), flatus (none to severe), abdominal pain (none to severe), and bloating (none to severe). The Lipid Research Clinics protocol was followed to assess serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels after dextran sulfate–magnesium chloride precipitation, and LDL-C concentrations were calculated.\n\n【152】Lipid Research Clinics Program  \nPopulation Studies Data Book, vol 2.

For fat content, as a result of almond enrichment of the diet, the amount excreted was determined by subtracting the fecal fat loss in the control arm from each almond arm. Likewise, the percentage of energy loss from fat content from almond enrichment was determined by dividing the amount of fat excreted related directly or indirectly to almonds by the almond fat intake.\n\n【166】### Statistical Analyses\n\n【167】All statistical analyses were performed with SAS (University Edition).

The statistical model includes the interaction term of diet by sex and by sequence, in addition to accounting for the crossover design by including a random term that represents the individual participant. Associations between dietary intakes and fecal outputs, fecal fatty acids, and serum fatty acids were assessed using the PROC CORR procedure for Pearson correlations. Results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean, and a _P_ value of less than .05 was considered significant for all analyses.\n\n【173】Results\n-------\n\n【174】In the analyses, 22 participants completing 7-day diet records and fecal samples at the end of each phase were included. Supplemental Figure 1  shows the flow of participants. Supplemental Table 2  shows that there were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between completers and noncompleters. Supplemental Table 3  shows the baseline characteristics of the 22 participants (12 men and 10 women) who completed the study, which comprised individuals aged 64.5±9.0 years with body weight of 72.0±13.2 kg, BMI of 25.7±3.2 kg/m  , and LDL-C concentration of 4.5±0.8 mmol/L. There were no significant differences in body weight or other measured indicators of adiposity between the phases.\n\n【175】Table 1 presents the dietary intake, showing that the incorporation of the study supplements into an NCEP Step 2 dietary pattern resulted in higher fat (specifically monounsaturated fatty acids, notably oleic acid) and lower carbohydrate intakes during the almond phases compared with the control phase. Energy, protein, fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acid, and saturated fatty acid intakes remained comparable between the 3 phases. Aside from oleic acid intake, which was significantly increased with almond consumption ( _P_ <.001), there were no differences in the other dietary fatty acids analyzed. Adherence to study supplement intake was more than 90% across all treatments.\n\n【176】Table 1 Dietary Intake and Satiety Evaluation (n=22)\n\n|  | Control | Half-dose almonds | Full-dose almonds | _P_ value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Energy (kJ/d) | 8711.1 (460.2) | 8470.5 (415.9) | 8886.8 (485.3) | .20 |\n| Energy (kcal/d) | 2082.0 (110.0) | 2024.5 (99.4) | 2124.0 (116.0) | .20 |\n| Carbohydrate (%) | 58.4 (1.2) a | 53.6 (1.1) b | 50.2 (1.5) c | <.001 |\n| Total fiber (g/d) | 32.3 (2.1) | 32.9 (2.0) | 34.4 (2.0) | .11 |\n| Protein (%) | 17.1 (0.5) | 17.9 (0.5) | 17.5 (0.5) | .07 |\n| Fat (%) | 26.0 (0.9) a | 30.1 (1.0) b | 33.6 (1.1) c | <.001 |\n| Total fat (g/d) | 60.3 (3.8) a | 67.4 (3.6) b | 79.3 (5.2) b | <.001 |\n| SFA (g/d) | 15.9 (1.4) | 15.0 (1.16) | 15.3 (1.4) | .50 |\n| Lauric acid (g/d) | 0.31 (0.08) | 0.23 (0.03) | 0.26 (0.04) | .67 |\n| Myristic acid (g/d) | 1.05 (0.15) | 0.99 (0.11) | 0.98 (0.12) | .74 |\n| Palmitic acid (g/d) | 9.18 (0.79) | 8.66 (0.59) | 9.03 (0.80) | .39 |\n| Stearic acid (g/d) | 3.43 (0.37) | 3.14 (0.27) | 3.46 (0.36) | .23 |\n| MUFA (g/d) | 20.1 (1.5) a | 29.2 (1.6) b | 39.2 (2.6) c | <.001 |\n| Palmitoleic acid (g/d) | 0.75 (0.08) | 0.82 (0.08) | 0.83 (0.07) | .06 |\n| Oleic acid (g/d) | 17.9 (1.4) a | 26.8 (1.5) b | 36.7 (2.5) c | <.001 |\n| PUFA (g/d) | 18.8 (0.9) | 17.7 (0.8) | 18.7 (1.2) | .18 |\n| Omega-3 (g/d) | 1.64 (0.15) | 1.52 (0.22) | 1.70 (0.27) | .49 |\n| α-Linolenic acid (g/d) | 1.17 (0.14) | 0.93 (0.11) | 1.20 (0.25) | .26 |\n| Omega-6 (g/d) | 16.7 (0.8) | 15.7 (0.6) | 16.5 (1.0) | .28 |\n| Linoleic acid (g/d) | 15.8 (0.82) | 14.8 (0.6) | 15.4 (0.9) | .29 |\n| Ash (mg/d) | 21.0 (1.2) a | 18.9 (1.0) b | 18.4 (1.1) b | .002 |\n| Almonds (g/d) | 0.0 (0.0) | 38.3 (2.5) | 72.7 (4.6) | <.001 |\n| Satiety | 1 (0-2) | 1 (0-2) | 1 (0-2) | .86 |\n\n【178】MUFA, monounsaturated fatty acid; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; SFA, saturated fatty acid.\n\n【179】Data are presented as mean (standard error of the mean), except for satiety, for which data are presented as median (range).\n\n【180】Values in the same row with different superscript letters are significantly different.\n\n【181】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【182】Table 2 shows that the number of bowel movements per day did not significantly differ between the phases; however, fecal composition did differ with almond consumption.

The bioaccessibility of fat was significantly different between treatment phases ( _P_ <.001) and on average lower by 5.1% and 6.3% in the half- and full-dose almond phases, respectively, compared with the control phase. The bioaccessibility of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids was also significantly lower in the half- and full-dose almond phases compared with the control phase ( _P_ <.05). Of the saturated fatty acids, there were greater amounts of stearic acid (18:0) in the fecal matter during the almond phases compared with the control, despite that the quantity consumed was comparable across all 3 phases, resulting in less bioaccessibility of this saturated fatty acid with almond consumption. Oleic acid (18:1 _n_ \\-9) was consumed in higher quantities during the almond phases; still, bioaccessibility for this monounsaturated fatty acid was less during the almond phases compared with the control phase. Whereas intake of the polyunsaturated linoleic acid (18:2 _n_ \\-6) was equivalent across all 3 phases, the fecal composition during the almond phases was higher in linoleic acid, leading to less bioaccessibility. In assessing fat specifically consumed from almonds, bioaccessibility was 78.5%±3.1%, and the average energy loss from almond fat was 21.2%±3.1% (40.6 kcal/d).\n\n【190】Table 3 Bioaccessibility of Energy and Macronutrients for the Diet as a Whole (n=22)\n\n|  | Control | Half-dose almonds | Full-dose almonds | _P_ value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Energy (%) | 92.3 (0.8) a | 91.0 (0.5) b | 90.1 (0.6) b | .02 |\n| Total carbohydrate (%) | 92.9 (0.8) | 94.2 (0.3) | 93.6 (0.6) | .19 |\n| Protein (%) | 84.1 (1.8) | 86.0 (0.9) | 85.8 (1.0) | .41 |\n| Fat (%) | 89.5 (2.0) a | 84.0 (1.3) b | 83.2 (1.2) b | .001 |\n| Fatty acids (%) |  |  |  |  |\n| SFA | 93.5 (0.7) a | 89.0 (1.5) b | 88.5 (1.4) b | .007 |\n| Lauric acid | 94.3 (1.7) | 95.5 (2.0) | 89.6 (5.7) | .48 |\n| Myristic acid | 98.8 (0.4) | 98.9 (0.5) | 97.9 (1.1) | .58 |\n| Palmitic acid | 99.7 (0.1) | 99.8 (0.1) | 99.7 (0.1) | .61 |\n| Stearic acid | 99.8 (0.1) a | 99.2 (0.2) b | 98.8 (0.4) b | .003 |\n| MUFA | 96.6 (0.5) a | 88.2 (1.2) b | 88.2 (1.6) b | .001 |\n| Palmitoleic acid | 91.6 (2.0) a | 68.0 (8.3) b | 54.8 (12.6) b | .003 |\n| Oleic acid | 96.5 (0.6) a | 88.1 (1.3) a,b | 88.5 (1.6) b | <.001 |\n| PUFA | 97.2 (0.4) a | 93.7 (0.8) b | 92.0 (1.2) b | .006 |\n| Omega-3 | 96.2 (1.4) | 94.5 (2.3) | 94.5 (2.2) | .57 |\n| α-Linolenic acid (ALA) | 94.3 (2.3) | 89.5 (4.5) | 93.3 (2.5) | .36 |\n| Omega-6 | 98.2 (0.4) a | 96.4 (0.9) a,b | 94.4 (1.5) b | .003 |\n| Linoleic acid | 97.1 (0.5) a | 93.2 (0.8) b | 91.1 (1.3) b | <.001 |\n| Ash (%) | 63.3 (3.9) | 65.3 (2.0) | 64.4 (2.3) | .89 |\n\n【192】MUFA, monounsaturated fatty acid; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; SFA, saturated fatty acid.\n\n【193】Data are presented as mean (standard error of the mean).\n\n【194】Values in the same row with different superscript letters are significantly different.\n\n【195】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【196】Energy bioaccessibility was significantly different between the treatment phases ( _P_ \\=.019), decreasing by approximately 2% with the inclusion of the full dose of almonds compared with the control. Energy bioaccessibility was positively associated with body fat percentage ( _r_ \\=0.288; _P_ \\=.02), although almond consumption was not correlated with body weight or other measures of adiposity assessed. Almond consumption was positively associated with dietary intake of oleic acid ( _r_ \\=0.839; _P_ <.001) and fecal output of oleic acid ( _r_ \\=0.651; _P_ <.001) but was inversely associated with oleic acid bioaccessibility ( _r_ \\=−0.349; _P_ \\=.004). Yet, the percentage of fecal oleic acid was not associated with the serum percentage ( _r_ \\=−0.233; _P_ \\=.06). There was no relationship between almond consumption and dietary intake of linoleic acid ( _r_ \\=0.172; _P_ \\=.17), but almond consumption was positively associated with fecal output of linoleic acid ( _R_ \\=0.558; _P_ <.001) and inversely associated with linoleic acid bioaccessibility ( _r_ \\=−0.420; _P_ <.001). The percentage of fecal linoleic acid output was not associated with the serum percentage ( _r_ \\=−0.003; _P_ \\=.98).\n\n【197】Discussion\n----------\n\n【198】The analyses investigated the effect of almond consumption on dietary energy and macronutrient bioaccessibility in individuals with hyperlipidemia. Findings indicate that substitution of a carbohydrate-based food with almonds (ie, approximately 75 g or 150 g of a carbohydrate-based food for 38 g or 75 g of almonds, respectively) into an NCEP Step 2 background dietary pattern leads to lower fat and energy bioaccessibility without negatively affecting serum levels of beneficial (18:1 _n_ \\-9) or essential (18:2 _n_ \\-6) fatty acids. The 2% decrease in energy availability observed between the full-dose almond and control phases suggests that by incorporating almonds into a typical 2000- to 3000-kcal daily intake level may result in 40 to 60 kcal/d less than expected being digested and absorbed by the body. During the course of a year, assuming no compensation, this could result in mitigating weight gain or possibly leading to a weight loss by 1.9 to 2.9 kg (4.2 to 6.3 lb). In this trial, body weight was maintained with no difference between phases, yet comparison of the energy intakes showed on average an increase of 42 kcal/d in energy intake during the full-dose almond phase compared with the control phase.\n\n【199】无关删除-2:<u>*   Novotny J.A.\n*   Gebauer S.K.\n*   Baer D.J.</u>\n\n【200】Discrepancy between the Atwater factor predicted and empirically measured energy values of almonds in human diets.\n\n【201】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Clin Nutr._ 2012; 96 : 296-301</u></u>\n\n【202】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (137)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【203】found that compared with no almond consumption, 84 g/d of almonds caused a 5% reduction in overall diet energy bioaccessibility in healthy individuals. The lower dietary fiber content in the control diet compared with the almond arms possibly contributed to the greater differences in fat and energy digestibility seen in their study, whereas dietary fiber was comparable across treatments in these analyses. This is noteworthy as dietary fiber, both soluble and insoluble, has been shown to increase fat excretion and to reduce fat digestibility.\n\n【204】无关删除-2:<u>*   Chen H.L.\n*   Haack V.S.\n*   Janecky C.W.\n*   Vollendorf N.W.\n*   Marlett J.A.</u>\n\n【205】Mechanisms by which wheat bran and oat bran increase stool weight in humans.\n\n【206】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Clin Nutr._ 1998; 68 : 711-719</u></u>\n\n【207】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (121)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【208】The analyses indicate that even when accounting for dietary fiber, there remained a difference in fat and energy bioaccessibility between diets incorporating almonds compared with a control supplement.\n\n【209】Possible interactions with other food components, such as dietary fiber, is one factor that may affect fat bioaccessibility. Several other factors may also influence the proportion of an ingested nutrient that is absorbed by the body, including the food matrix and the level of processing or mastication. Fecal fat excretion has been shown to be significantly higher with less processing (ie, whole nuts vs nut butters vs nut oils) and mastication.\n\n【210】无关删除-2:<u>*   Grundy M.M.\n*   Grassby T.\n*   Mandalari G.\n\n【211】Effect of mastication on lipid bioaccessibility of almonds in a randomized human study and its implications for digestion kinetics, metabolizable energy, and postprandial lipemia.\n\n【212】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Clin Nutr._ 2015; 101 : 25-33</u></u>\n\n【213】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (97)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【214】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ellis P.R.\n*   Kendall C.W.\n*   Ren Y.\n\n【215】Role of cell walls in the bioaccessibility of lipids in almond seeds.\n\n【216】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Clin Nutr._ 2004; 80 : 604-613</u></u>\n\n【217】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (256)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【218】无关删除-2:<u>*   Cassady B.A.\n*   Hollis J.H.\n*   Fulford A.D.\n*   Considine R.V.\n*   Mattes R.D.</u>\n\n【219】Mastication of almonds: effects of lipid bioaccessibility, appetite, and hormone response.\n\n【220】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Clin Nutr._ 2009; 89 : 794-800</u></u>\n\n【221】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (190)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【222】无关删除-2:<u>*   Mandalari G.\n*   Grundy M.M.\n*   Grassby T.\n\n【223】The effects of processing and mastication on almond lipid bioaccessibility using novel methods of in vitro digestion modelling and micro-structural analysis.\n\n【224】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Br J Nutr._ 2014; 112 : 1521-1529</u></u>\n\n【225】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (63)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【226】无关删除-2:<u>*   Levine A.S.\n*   Silvis S.E.</u>\n\n【227】Absorption of whole peanuts, peanut oil, and peanut butter.\n\n【228】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1980; 303 : 917-918</u></u>\n\n【229】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (66)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【230】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ellis P.R.\n*   Kendall C.W.\n*   Ren Y.\n\n【231】Role of cell walls in the bioaccessibility of lipids in almond seeds.\n\n【232】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Clin Nutr._ 2004; 80 : 604-613</u></u>\n\n【233】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (256)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【234】无关删除-2:<u>*   Gebauer S.K.\n*   Novotny J.A.\n*   Bornhorst G.M.\n*   Baer D.J.</u>\n\n【235】Food processing and structure impact the metabolizable energy of almonds.\n\n【236】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Food Funct._ 2016; 7 : 4231-4238</u></u>\n\n【237】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【238】further demonstrated that the amount of energy absorbed from almonds is dependent on the form in which they are consumed, whereby whole (natural and roasted) and chopped almonds, but not almond butter, had significantly lower measured metabolizable energy values compared with Atwater factors.

The present findings are relevant for general consumers as well as clinically for health care practitioners and patients as diabetes, cardiovascular, and general healthy eating guidelines tend to warn consumers against energy-dense foods because of their obesogenic potential; nuts, including almonds, have been stigmatized as a result of their perceived high energy density. Whereas this view has been shifting and nuts have been acknowledged for their health benefits, remnants of this concern remain, with caveats noting the energy density of nuts following statements recommending their consumption for health benefits. Globally, this is reflected by the relatively low estimated average total tree nut and peanut intake levels (15-17 g/d), which are less than half of the amounts generally recommended by dietary and health guidelines and the Food & Drug Administration–qualified health claim.\n\n【291】International Nut & Dried Fruit Council  \nNuts & dried fruits statistical yearbook 2019/2020.\n\n【292】删除3:<u>https://www.nutfruit.org/industry/technical-resources</u>\n\n【293】删除6:<u>Date accessed: April 22, 2020</u>\n\n【294】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【295】International Nut & Dried Fruit Council  \nNuts & dried fruits statistical yearbook 2017/2018.\n\n【296】删除3:<u>https://www.nutfruit.org/industry/technical-resources</u>\n\n【297】删除6:<u>Date accessed: April 25, 2020</u>\n\n【298】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【299】U.S. Food & Drug Administration  \nGuidance for industry: a food labeling guide (12.

Moreover, the study population is relevant to those who are at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, for whom many guidelines recommending nuts, including almonds, are geared to their lipid- and blood glucose–lowering health benefits. These analyses, however, do possess a number of limitations. On the basis of the current investigation, it is difficult to discern whether the increased fecal fat content observed during the almond phase is due to fat excreted from the almonds directly or whether almond consumption induced fat malabsorption from other foods.

Nevertheless, this may be controlled for by the crossover design. The findings are also limited in that urine samples were not available for analyses; thus, the absolute protein and energy bioaccessibility values should be interpreted with caution. Whereas the digestibility values for protein and energy may be lower than currently reported, it is not expected that this would greatly affect the comparison between treatments as urinary excretion of nitrogen was not found to be significantly different between tree nut and control in another investigation.\n\n【309】无关删除-2:<u>*   Baer D.J.\n*   Novotny J.A.</u>\n\n【310】Metabolizable energy from cashew nuts is less than that predicted by Atwater factors.\n\n【311】删除3:<u>_Nutrients._ 2018; 11 : 33</u>\n\n【312】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (29)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【313】In addition, short-chain fatty acids (eg, acetate, propionate, and butyrate) were not able to be assessed. As short-chain fatty acids may provide an extra energy source for de novo lipogenesis, this may have implications in the metabolic responses of the host individual.\n\n【314】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【315】Incorporating almonds into an NCEP dietary pattern resulted in less fat and energy bioaccessibility at both almond doses of 38 g/d and 73 g/d, without an observed dose response, compared with a carbohydrate-based control in hyperlipidemia. These findings in conjunction with previous investigations suggest it is possible that the energy content of almonds may not be as bioaccessible as predicted by Atwater factors. With less fat being bioaccessible, the concern of the “high energy density” of almonds and risk of weight gain may be overstated.\n\n【316】Given that the Atwater system is often used to determine the energy values for mandatory nutrient labeling of food products, food labeling of items with whole almonds may require adjustment to better reflect the metabolizable energy. Future research may investigate other food sources with similar complex food matrices to almonds, such as seeds and pulses, to determine whether there are more appropriate ways to establish and to present energy content of these foods.\n\n【317】无关删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【318】无关删除-1:<u>We wish to thank the volunteer participants, Dr Balachandran Bashyam (laboratory technician), and Dr Dorothea Faulkner (registered dietitian) as well as Chole Kavcic, Diana Ghidanac, and Sarah Muncaster (hospital volunteers) at St. Michael’s Hospital and the University of Toronto for their assistance and expertise.</u>\n\n【319】无关删除-1:<u>None of the sponsors had a role in any aspect of this study, including design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; and preparation, review, and approval of the manuscript or decision to publish.</u>\n\n【320】无关删除-1:<u>Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------</u>\n\n【321】无关删除-2:<u>无关删除-1:<u>*   Download .pdf (.44 MB)\n\n【322】    Help with pdf files\n\n【323】    Supplemental Material</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "82ab1b65-59c5-42ed-aabf-f952b66d1766", "title": "Cavities/tooth decay", "text": "【0】Cavities/tooth decay\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】Cavities are permanently damaged areas in the hard surface of your teeth that develop into tiny openings or holes. Cavities, also called tooth decay or caries, are caused by a combination of factors, including bacteria in your mouth, frequent snacking, sipping sugary drinks and not cleaning your teeth well.\n\n【2】Cavities and tooth decay are among the world's most common health problems. They're especially common in children, teenagers and older adults. But anyone who has teeth can get cavities, including infants.\n\n【3】If cavities aren't treated, they get larger and affect deeper layers of your teeth. They can lead to a severe toothache, infection and tooth loss. Regular dental visits and good brushing and flossing habits are your best protection against cavities and tooth decay.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The signs and symptoms of cavities vary, depending on their extent and location. When a cavity is just beginning, you may not have any symptoms at all. As the decay gets larger, it may cause signs and symptoms such as:\n\n【6】*   Toothache, spontaneous pain or pain that occurs without any apparent cause\n*   Tooth sensitivity\n*   Mild to sharp pain when eating or drinking something sweet, hot or cold\n*   Visible holes or pits in your teeth\n*   Brown, black or white staining on any surface of a tooth\n*   Pain when you bite down\n\n【7】### When to see a dentist\n\n【8】You may not be aware that a cavity is forming. That's why it's important to have regular dental checkups and cleanings, even when your mouth feels fine. However, if you experience a toothache or mouth pain, see your dentist as soon as possible.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Cavities are caused by tooth decay — a process that occurs over time. Here's how tooth decay develops:\n\n【11】*   **Plaque forms.** Dental plaque is a clear sticky film that coats your teeth. It's due to eating a lot of sugars and starches and not cleaning your teeth well. When sugars and starches aren't cleaned off your teeth, bacteria quickly begin feeding on them and form plaque. Plaque that stays on your teeth can harden under or above your gum line into tartar (calculus). Tartar makes plaque more difficult to remove and creates a shield for bacteria.\n*   **Plaque attacks.** The acids in plaque remove minerals in your tooth's hard, outer enamel. This erosion causes tiny openings or holes in the enamel — the first stage of cavities. Once areas of enamel are worn away, the bacteria and acid can reach the next layer of your teeth, called dentin. This layer is softer than enamel and less resistant to acid. Dentin has tiny tubes that directly communicate with the nerve of the tooth causing sensitivity.\n*   **Destruction continues.** As tooth decay develops, the bacteria and acid continue their march through your teeth, moving next to the inner tooth material (pulp) that contains nerves and blood vessels. The pulp becomes swollen and irritated from the bacteria. Because there is no place for the swelling to expand inside of a tooth, the nerve becomes pressed, causing pain. Discomfort can even extend outside of the tooth root to the bone.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】Everyone who has teeth is at risk of getting cavities, but the following factors can increase risk:\n\n【14】*   **Tooth location.** Decay most often occurs in your back teeth (molars and premolars). These teeth have lots of grooves, pits and crannies, and multiple roots that can collect food particles. As a result, they're harder to keep clean than your smoother, easy-to-reach front teeth.\n*   **Certain foods and drinks.** Foods that cling to your teeth for a long time — such as milk, ice cream, honey, sugar, soda, dried fruit, cake, cookies, hard candy and mints, dry cereal, and chips — are more likely to cause decay than foods that are easily washed away by saliva.\n*   **Frequent snacking or sipping.** When you steadily snack or sip sugary drinks, you give mouth bacteria more fuel to produce acids that attack your teeth and wear them down. And sipping soda or other acidic drinks throughout the day helps create a continual acid bath over your teeth.\n*   **Bedtime infant feeding.** When babies are given bedtime bottles filled with milk, formula, juice or other sugar-containing liquids, these beverages remain on their teeth for hours while they sleep, feeding decay-causing bacteria. This damage is often called baby bottle tooth decay. Similar damage can occur when toddlers wander around drinking from a sippy cup filled with these beverages.\n*   **Inadequate brushing.** If you don't clean your teeth soon after eating and drinking, plaque forms quickly and the first stages of decay can begin.\n*   **Not getting enough fluoride.** Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, helps prevent cavities and can even reverse the earliest stages of tooth damage. Because of its benefits for teeth, fluoride is added to many public water supplies. It's also a common ingredient in toothpaste and mouth rinses. But bottled water usually does not contain fluoride.\n*   **Younger or older age.** In the United States, cavities are common in very young children and teenagers. Older adults also are at higher risk. Over time, teeth can wear down and gums may recede, making teeth more vulnerable to root decay. Older adults also may use more medications that reduce saliva flow, increasing the risk of tooth decay.\n*   **Dry mouth.** Dry mouth is caused by a lack of saliva, which helps prevent tooth decay by washing away food and plaque from your teeth. Substances found in saliva also help counter the acid produced by bacteria. Certain medications, some medical conditions, radiation to your head or neck, or certain chemotherapy drugs can increase your risk of cavities by reducing saliva production.\n*   **Worn fillings or dental devices.** Over the years, dental fillings can weaken, begin to break down or develop rough edges. This allows plaque to build up more easily and makes it harder to remove. Dental devices can stop fitting well, allowing decay to begin underneath them.\n*   **Heartburn.** Heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can cause stomach acid to flow into your mouth (reflux), wearing away the enamel of your teeth and causing significant tooth damage. This exposes more of the dentin to attack by bacteria, creating tooth decay. Your dentist may recommend that you consult your doctor to see if gastric reflux is the cause of your enamel loss.\n*   **Eating disorders.** Anorexia and bulimia can lead to significant tooth erosion and cavities. Stomach acid from repeated vomiting (purging) washes over the teeth and begins dissolving the enamel. Eating disorders also can interfere with saliva production.\n\n【15】Complications\n-------------\n\n【16】Cavities and tooth decay are so common that you may not take them seriously. And you may think that it doesn't matter if children get cavities in their baby teeth. However, cavities and tooth decay can have serious and lasting complications, even for children who don't have their permanent teeth yet.\n\n【17】Complications of cavities may include:\n\n【18】*   Pain\n*   Tooth abscess\n*   Swelling or pus around a tooth\n*   Damage or broken teeth\n*   Chewing problems\n*   Positioning shifts of teeth after tooth loss\n\n【19】When cavities and decay become severe, you may have:\n\n【20】*   Pain that interferes with daily living\n*   Weight loss or nutrition problems from painful or difficult eating or chewing\n*   Tooth loss, which may affect your appearance, as well as your confidence and self-esteem\n*   In rare cases, a tooth abscess — a pocket of pus that's caused by bacterial infection — which can lead to more serious or even life-threatening infections\n\n【21】Prevention\n----------\n\n【22】Good oral and dental hygiene can help you avoid cavities and tooth decay. Here are some tips to help prevent cavities. Ask your dentist which tips are best for you.\n\n【23】*   **Brush with fluoride toothpaste after eating or drinking.** Brush your teeth at least twice a day and ideally after every meal, using fluoride-containing toothpaste. To clean between your teeth, floss or use an interdental cleaner.\n*   **Rinse your mouth.** If your dentist feels you have a high risk of developing cavities, he or she may recommend that you use a mouth rinse with fluoride.\n*   **Visit your dentist regularly.** Get professional teeth cleanings and regular oral exams, which can help prevent problems or spot them early. Your dentist can recommend a schedule that's best for you.\n*   **Consider dental sealants.** A sealant is a protective plastic coating applied to the chewing surface of back teeth. It seals off grooves and crannies that tend to collect food, protecting tooth enamel from plaque and acid. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends sealants for all school-age children. Sealants may last for several years before they need to be replaced, but they need to be checked regularly.\n*   **Drink some tap water.** Most public water supplies have added fluoride, which can help reduce tooth decay significantly. If you drink only bottled water that doesn't contain fluoride, you'll miss out on fluoride benefits.\n*   **Avoid frequent snacking and sipping.** Whenever you eat or drink beverages other than water, you help your mouth bacteria create acids that can destroy tooth enamel. If you snack or drink throughout the day, your teeth are under constant attack.\n*   **Eat tooth-healthy foods.** Some foods and beverages are better for your teeth than others. Avoid foods that get stuck in grooves and pits of your teeth for long periods, or brush soon after eating them. However, foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables increase saliva flow, and unsweetened coffee, tea and sugar-free gum help wash away food particles.\n*   **Consider fluoride treatments.** Your dentist may recommend periodic fluoride treatments, especially if you aren't getting enough fluoride through fluoridated drinking water and other sources. He or she may also recommend custom trays that fit over your teeth for application of prescription fluoride if your risk of tooth decay is very high.\n*   **Ask about antibacterial treatments.** If you're especially vulnerable to tooth decay — for example, because of a medical condition — your dentist may recommend special antibacterial mouth rinses or other treatments to help cut down on harmful bacteria in your mouth.\n*   **Combined treatments.** Chewing xylitol-based gum along with prescription fluoride and an antibacterial rinse can help reduce the risk of cavities.\n\n【24】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Litin, MD, who this month ends his term on the Editorial Board after serving 19 years as Associate Editor.\n\n【1】Dr Litin was appointed Associate Editor in 1994 by then Editor-in-Chief Udaya B. Prakash, MD. Together, the two gentlemen were instrumental in initiating the Concise Reviews for Clinicians and Residents' Clinics sections of the journal, which were managed by Dr Litin. During his term as Associate Editor, Dr Litin was an indefatigable advocate for physicians-in-training and young faculty members, whom he coached in their writings for the _Proceedings_ . Further, from 1999 to the present, with the _Proceedings_ attempting to increase its quality of content and national and international stature, Dr Litin was a champion for ensuring that the journal continued to meet the daily clinical and educational needs of practicing physicians. Securing continuing medical education credit for some of the journal's articles and recruiting Clinical Pearls Concise Review articles from both American College of Physicians and Mayo Clinic authors were other innovations he introduced. Thus, the _Proceedings_ of today carries Dr Litin's durable fingerprints, and his influence on the journal will be apparent for many years hence.\n\n【2】During his term on the Editorial Board, Dr Litin's stature rose locally and extramurally through his work as a physician-investigator and educator. He was honored as a Mayo Clinic Distinguished Clinician (the institution's highest recognition for excellence in clinical practice) and was named president of the Mayo Clinic Staff, president of the Mayo Clinic Alumni Association, and Master of the American College of Physicians. He, in turn, used this stature to further assist young and developing authors and to help the _Proceedings_ address its mission: “To promote the best interests of patients by advancing the knowledge and professionalism of the physician community.”\n\n【3】Dr Litin has worked for the past several years to expand and diversify the leadership for those areas of the journal that he has overseen. As a result, he is leaving the journal in very good hands and, because of his collegiality and generosity, there has been a seamless transition to new leadership.\n\n【4】Dr Litin's service to the journal was honored at the 2012 annual meeting of the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ Editorial Board, held in Rochester, Minnesota, on September 21 and 22 删除4:<u>( Figure )</u>. During the ceremony, it was noted that Dr Litin's 19 years on the Editorial Board and as Associate Editor were both records for physician contributions to the journal. Later, Dr Litin shared with attendees his warm and enduring feelings about the journal.\n\n【5】FIGURE At the 2012 annual meeting of the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ Editorial Board, William L.

On average, she reported having one bowel movement per week. Each bowel movement was associated with a prolonged restroom visit as a result of excessive straining. The passage of stool was frequently accompanied by excruciating tearing pain and visible bright red blood mixed with stool and on the toilet paper. The episodes of hematochezia occurred with approximately half of her bowel movements. She also reported abdominal pain that was worse in the evenings, exacerbated by movement and lifting, and alleviated by getting into the fetal position. At times, she experienced a sensation of incomplete evacuation and had to use her fingers to manually remove stool. In addition, she reported difficulty with urination and intermittent incontinence. She had not undergone a colonoscopy previously. Her medical history was notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and obesity with a body mass index of 38 kg/m  . She had no history of anemia. Her family history was notable for colorectal cancer in her maternal grandfather diagnosed at age 78 and small-bowel ischemia in her maternal uncle.\n\n【1】At presentation, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits, with a heart rate of 81 beats/min and blood pressure of 122/60 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed left lower quadrant tenderness to light palpation with normal bowel sounds and no peritoneal signs. Rectal examination revealed a heightened sphincter tone, and nonbleeding external hemorrhoids were present. Insertion of the examining finger was noted to be particularly painful for the patient. There was reduced perineal descent when the patient was asked to bear down as if she were having a bowel movement. Abdominal pain was elicited when the patient tensed her abdominal muscles by lifting her head and shoulders from the examination table.\n\n【2】Laboratory evaluation yielded the following results (reference ranges provided parenthetically): hemoglobin, 13.7 g/dL (12.0-15.5 g/dL); leukocytes, 8.8 × 10  /L (3.5-10.5 × 10  /L); platelets, 250 × 10  /L (150-450 × 10  /L); sodium, 139 mmol/L (135-145 mmol/L); potassium, 4.0 mmol/L (3.6-5.2 mmol/L); calcium, 9.1 mg/dL (8.9-10.1 mg/dL); fasting glucose, 106 mg/dL (70-140 mg/dL); creatinine, 0.82 mg/dL (0.6-1.1 mg/dL); and thyroid-stimulating hormone, 1.7 mIU/L (0.3-4.2 mIU/L).

It is important for health care professionals to assess patients with anorectal outlet bleeding and use history and physical examination to determine the underlying diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of rectal bleeding is broad and includes hemorrhoids, anal fissures, diverticulosis, angiodysplasia, and colorectal cancers.\n\n【21】In general, diverticular bleeds usually present with painless hematochezia. Additionally, the presentation is often acute and may be characterized by higher-volume bleeding. Our patient had a self-reported history of tearing pain associated with passage of stool and visible blood on the toilet paper and in the toilet after defecation. This presentation is strongly suggestive of anal fissure as the underlying disorder. An anal fissure is a tear in the anoderm distal to the dentate line.\n\n【22】无关删除-2:<u>*   Zaghiyan K.N.\n*   Fleshner P.</u>\n\n【23】Anal fissure.\n\n【24】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin Colon Rectal Surg._ 2011; 24 : 22-30</u></u>\n\n【25】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (63)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【26】Anal fissures represent a common anorectal problem and typically occur secondary to local trauma to the anoderm caused by the passage of hard stool. Hemorrhoids also classically present with painless bleeding, and patients often report stools covered with bright red blood. Physical examination, including careful inspection of the anal and perianal area for external hemorrhoids and digital examination for prolapsed internal hemorrhoids, is important for uncovering this diagnosis. Severe pain on insertion of the examining finger may be a clue to a diagnosis of anal fissure, as was the case in our patient. Colorectal cancer can present with a myriad of symptoms, including weight loss, altered bowel habits, hematochezia, and abdominal pain. Malignancy is less likely in this patient given her young age and absence of red flag symptoms such as weight loss. Lastly, angiodysplasia is commonly present in patients older than 60 years of age.\n\n【27】无关删除-2:<u>*   Clouse R.E.\n*   Costigan D.J.\n*   Mills B.A.\n*   Zuckerman G.R.</u>\n\n【28】Angiodysplasia as a cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n【29】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Intern Med._ 1985; 145 : 458-461</u></u>\n\n【30】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (114)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【31】In contrast to our patient, bleeding associated with angiodysplasia is often painless.\n\n【32】Given the patient's symptoms of rectal bleeding, constipation, and abdominal pain, she was referred to gastroenterology for further evaluation.\n\n【33】*   2.\n\n【34】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _best_ treatment approach for this patient's rectal bleeding?**\n\n【35】    *   a.\n\n【36】        Topical nitrate\n\n【37】    *   b.\n\n【38】        Fiber alone\n\n【39】    *   c.\n\n【40】        Botox injection\n\n【41】    *   d.\n\n【42】        Fiber and topical nifedipine\n\n【43】    *   e.\n\n【44】        Lateral internal sphincterotomy\n\n【45】Nonoperative management is the mainstay of treatment for anal fissures.

Botulinum toxin injection has been found to relax the internal and external anal sphincters, but it can often result in mild incontinence, acting as a “chemical sphincterotomy.” Currently, the combination of a stool-bulking agent and a topical vasodilator is recommended for treatment of acute typical anal fissures.

A thorough history and physical examination can aid in narrowing the differential diagnosis and help in deciphering between benign causes and more serious ones that may require more urgent evaluation. Patients with ulcerative colitis often present with colicky abdominal pain, which may be associated with systemic symptoms including fever, fatigue, and weight loss. In addition, bloody diarrhea may be a predominant symptom in ulcerative colitis, except in cases of isolated proctitis in which constipation and tenesmus are more common. Patients with ischemic colitis present with abdominal pain that is often rapid in onset and continuous in nature, usually followed by the passage of bloody stool. Classically, ischemic colitis is seen in older adults with underlying risk factors, such as hypotension and congestive heart failure. Abdominal wall pain is a common, and often overlooked, etiology for abdominal pain. It is the most likely etiology for abdominal pain in our patient given her history of constipation and excessive straining, with the straining likely making the abdominal wall pain worse. History and physical examination provide useful clues in isolating this diagnosis. On physical examination, our patient had a positive Carnett sign, as abdominal pain was elicited with tensing of abdominal muscles. This finding is characteristic of abdominal wall pain.\n\n【75】Abdominal wall tenderness test.\n\n【76】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Lancet._ 1991; 337 : 1606-1607</u></u>\n\n【77】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (10)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【78】Trigger point injection is the mainstay of therapy for abdominal wall pain and has been reported to provide significant and long-term symptomatic relief.\n\n【79】无关删除-2:<u>*   Alnahhas M.F.\n*   Oxentenko S.C.\n*   Locke III, G.R.\n\n【80】Outcomes of ultrasound-guided trigger point injection for abdominal wall pain.\n\n【81】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Dig Dis Sci._ 2016; 61 : 572-577</u></u>\n\n【82】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (18)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【83】Patients with diverticulitis usually have left lower quadrant abdominal pain, with accompanying low-grade fever, nausea, and emesis. Moreover, patients with diverticulitis are typically elderly. Lastly, a solitary rectal ulcer may result in rectal pain but not abdominal pain as seen in our patient.\n\n【84】Given the presence of bright red blood in stool, our patient initially underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy, which revealed a 6-mm polyp in the distal transverse colon and a 10-mm polyp in the rectum. A full colonoscopy was subsequently performed, revealing no additional pathology. Importantly, no findings of inflammatory bowel disease were visualized or appreciated on pathologic review.\n\n【85】*   4.\n\n【86】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _best_ next test for evaluation of the cause of this patient's constipation?**\n\n【87】    *   a.\n\n【88】        Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis\n\n【89】    *   b.\n\n【90】        Defecating proctography\n\n【91】    *   c.\n\n【92】        Anorectal manometry with balloon expulsion\n\n【93】    *   d.\n\n【94】        Full-thickness rectal biopsy\n\n【95】    *   e.\n\n【96】        Gastrointestinal transit study\n\n【97】The clinical features highlighted in this patient scenario are suggestive of pelvic floor dysfunction. The reduced pelvic floor descent on physical examination, excessive straining, incomplete evacuation, and manual digitation support this diagnosis, which represents a dynamic problem. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis would not be helpful in this particular case, as the primary defect is not structural. Defecating proctography may be considered if there is a high clinical suspicion for pelvic floor dysfunction in the setting of equivocal anorectal manometry with balloon expulsion results. Anorectal manometry with balloon expulsion is an effective way to assess anal sphincter and rectal pressures and can provide insight into the dynamics of defecation. Therefore, this is the best next test for evaluation of our patient's constipation. Importantly, before anorectal manometry, the patient's anal fissures must be healed. In clinical practice, therapy is typically undertaken for a full 6 weeks to prevent false-positive results. Full-thickness rectal biopsy is invasive and has no role in the evaluation of pelvic floor dysfunction. In patients with suspected slow transit constipation (less than one bowel movement per week), a gastrointestinal transit study may be a reasonable option. However, in the setting of constipation and abnormal pelvic descent, a colonic transit study is not the most appropriate next test. If anorectal manometry results are negative, a transit study may then be warranted.\n\n【98】Ultimately, anorectal manometry was performed, which revealed elevated anal pressures at rest. When defecation was simulated, the anal pressures remained high with an abnormal rectal anal gradient. As a result, the balloon expulsion test result was grossly abnormal (taking greater than 60 seconds to expel the balloon). Given the patient's clinical history, physical examination findings, and grossly abnormal results on anorectal manometry, a diagnosis of pelvic floor dysfunction was made.\n\n【99】*   5.\n\n【100】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _initial_ treatment of choice for constipation secondary to pelvic floor dysfunction?**\n\n【101】    *   a.\n\n【102】        Osmotic laxative\n\n【103】    *   b.\n\n【104】        Stimulant laxative\n\n【105】    *   c.\n\n【106】        Anopexy\n\n【107】    *   d.\n\n【108】        Linaclotide\n\n【109】    *   e.\n\n【110】        Biofeedback program\n\n【111】Osmotic laxatives are often used in the management of constipation. Stimulant laxatives are sometimes used in those patients with constipation not responding to osmotic laxatives, patients taking narcotics, and those with gastrointestinal tract dysmotility disorders. However, laxatives are often ineffective in patients with pelvic floor dysfunction. Anecdotally, oral laxatives in these patients are often associated with increased abdominal discomfort, bloating, and other adverse effects. A lack of response to laxative therapy can often increase clinical suspicion for pelvic floor dysfunction as the underlying etiology. Anopexy is a surgical option used for advanced hemorrhoidal disease; however, it has no role in the treatment of defecatory disorders.

{"seq_id": "6ba44f35-f3a3-42cf-905d-d94c5c5949c4", "title": "Tacrolimus (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Tacrolimus (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Astagraf XL\n2.  Envarsus XR\n3.  Hecoria\n4.  Prograf\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Tacrolimus is used together with other medicines to prevent the body from rejecting a transplanted organ (eg, kidney, liver, heart, or lung). This medicine may be used with steroids, azathioprine, basiliximab, or mycophenolate mofetil. Tacrolimus belongs to a group of medicines known as immunosuppressive agents.\n\n【6】When a patient receives an organ transplant, the body's white blood cells will try to get rid of (reject) the transplanted organ. Tacrolimus works by suppressing the immune system to prevent the white blood cells from trying to get rid of the transplanted organ.\n\n【7】Tacrolimus is a very strong medicine. It can cause side effects that can be very serious, such as kidney problems. It may also decrease the body's ability to fight infections. You and your doctor should talk about the benefits of this medicine as well as the risks of using it.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet, Extended Release\n*   Capsule\n*   Capsule, Extended Release\n*   Granule\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Astagraf XL® in children 4 years of age and older. Safety and efficacy have been established.\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Prograf® in children with liver, kidney, heart, or lung transplants. Safety and efficacy have been established.\n\n【18】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Envarsus XR® in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【19】### Geriatric\n\n【20】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of tacrolimus in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving tacrolimus.\n\n【21】### Breastfeeding\n\n【22】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【23】### Drug Interactions\n\n【24】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use this medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【34】*   Ethanol\n*   Grapefruit Juice\n\n【35】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【36】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【37】*   Congestive heart failure or\n*   Diabetes or\n*   Heart disease or\n*   Heart rhythm problems (eg, QT prolongation), or history of or\n*   Hyperkalemia (high potassium in the blood) or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) or\n*   Myocardial hypertrophy (heart is larger than normal), history of or\n*   Paresthesia (numbness or tingling in the hands, arms, legs, or feet), history of or\n*   Seizures (convulsions), history of or\n*   Tremors—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【38】*   Cystic fibrosis—May require a higher dose for patients with this condition.\n\n【39】*   Infection, active (eg, bacteria, fungus, or virus)—May decrease your body's ability to fight an infection.\n\n【40】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【41】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【42】Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more or less of it and do not take it more often than your doctor ordered. Using too much will increase the chance for side effects, while using too little may cause rejection of your transplanted organ.\n\n【43】This medicine comes with a Medication Guide or a patient information insert and patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have questions.\n\n【44】This medicine is always used together with other medicines. Make sure you understand when to take all of your medicines during the day. Your doctor will give you a daily plan for taking your medicines.\n\n【45】You may take the immediate-release capsule or oral liquid with or without food. But take it the same way each time.\n\n【46】If you are using the extended-release capsule:\n\n【47】*   Swallow the capsule whole with liquid. Do not crush, break, chew, or divide it.\n*   Take the capsule every morning, preferably on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after a meal.\n*   Do not drink alcohol with the capsule.\n\n【48】If you are using the extended-release tablet:\n\n【49】*   Take it on an empty stomach in the morning, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal, at the same time every day.\n*   Swallow the tablet whole with liquid (preferably water). Do not crush, chew, or divide it.\n*   Do not drink alcohol with the tablet.\n\n【50】If you are using the granule for oral suspension, you may take it with or without food, but you should take it the same way each time. To prepare the oral liquid:\n\n【51】*   Empty the contents of the packet in a glass cup filled with 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of room temperature water and mix. Use a metal spoon to stir the mixture. Do not use plastic.\n*   Drink it right away after preparing.\n*   Refill the glass cup with the same amount of water and gently swirl to mix any remaining granules to get the full dose of this medicine.\n*   You may also use an oral syringe to give this medicine.\n*   Do not inhale the granules or let the oral liquid come in contact with your skin or eyes. If you get the granules or the oral liquid on your skin, wash the area well with soap and water. If you get them into your eyes, rinse with water.\n*   Do not save the prepared oral liquid for later use.\n\n【52】You should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using this medicine. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice will increase the amount of medicine in the body.\n\n【53】Do not stop using this medicine without first checking with your doctor. You might have to take this medicine for the rest of your life to prevent your body from rejecting the transplant.\n\n【54】Use only the brand of this medicine that your doctor prescribed. Different brands may not work the same way.\n\n【55】Do not use Prograf® together with cyclosporine. Tacrolimus or cyclosporine should be stopped at least 24 hours before starting the other.\n\n【56】### Dosing\n\n【57】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【58】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【59】*   For oral dosage form (capsules, granules):\n    *   To prevent heart or lung transplant rejection:\n        *   Adults—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor.

Tacrolimus may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella.

It's different from bruising around one eye from an injury or redness and swelling in one eye caused by an infection.\n\n【2】Dark circles under your eyes usually are not a sign of a medical problem.\n\n【3】Dark circles under the eyes are usually caused by being tired. Sometimes, what appear to be dark circles under your eyes may merely be shadows cast by puffy eyelids or hollows under your eyes that develop as a normal part of aging.\n\n【4】Dark circles under the eyes usually aren't a medical problem. If discoloration and swelling appear under just one eye and seem to get worse over time, talk to your primary care doctor. If you want a more lasting solution than concealers and over-the-counter creams can provide, see a dermatologist for advice.\n\n【5】Depending on what's causing the circles under your eyes, your doctor may recommend prescription creams or a combination of treatments to erase or reduce discoloration. Laser therapy or chemical peels can be helpful in some cases. Hollows that cause shadows can be smoothed with injectable fillers, and surgery can eliminate puffy lids.\n\n【6】Home remedies for dark circles under your eyes may be all you need to help manage this condition.\n\n【7】### Self-care\n\n【8】Mild to moderate dark circles often respond well to simple and inexpensive treatments, such as:\n\n【9】*   **Cold.** Dilated under-eye blood vessels may contribute to dark circles under your eyes. Try holding a cold compress, a chilled teaspoon or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a soft cloth against the area to make these vessels constrict.\n*   **Extra pillows.** Elevate your head with two or more pillows to prevent puffiness that develops when fluid pools in your lower eyelids.\n*   **Extra sleep.** Although short nights don't usually cause under-eye circles, a lack of sleep may make shadows and circles you already have more obvious.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

In 1347, King Edward III of England, who had the French people at his mercy, ordered 6 citizens to come forward with their heads and feet bare. King Edward would do as he desired with these 6 people, and in return he would lift the year-long siege of the city.

This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【11】### Allergies\n\n【12】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【13】### Pediatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of clocortolone topical in children. However, because of this medicine's toxicity, it should be used with caution. Children may absorb large amounts through the skin, which can cause serious side effects. If your child is using this medicine, follow your doctor's instructions very carefully.\n\n【15】### Geriatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of clocortolone topical in the elderly.\n\n【17】### Breastfeeding\n\n【18】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【21】### Other Interactions\n\n【22】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.

Check with your doctor before using it for other conditions, especially if you think that a skin infection may be present.

If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【35】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.

The authors describe 4 boys, aged 10 to 13 years, who were accidentally buried in sand, 2 of whom died as a result of the accident. The mechanism of injury in this report is somewhat different from that in previous publications that focused on sand aspiration and its management.\n\n【5】The current study indicates that the 2 boys died of asphyxia from thoracic compression due to the weight of the sand. The first boy was digging a tunnel in a backyard sandbox that collapsed on him. He was buried for about 10 minutes in dry sand and was unable to extricate himself. The boy had been playing unsupervised. The other 3 boys jumped into a large (30 feet) pile of wet sand at a construction site. As they ran down the sandpile, it collapsed and completely buried 1 boy and partially buried the other 2 boys. The completely buried youngster was under 12 feet of wet sand; he could not be rescued in time and died of thoracic compression asphyxia. One boy extricated himself and successfully sought help for his partially buried friend. These 3 boys were also unsu-pervised, and there was no information regarding the security or safety factors in place at the construction site. Neither of the 2 boys who died had evidence of sand aspiration.\n\n【6】Sand is composed of aluminum silicate, silicon dioxide, and calcium carbonate and is defined as sedimentary particles with a diameter of 0.05 to 2.0 mm. This distinguishes sand from larger particles such as gravel and smaller particles such as silt and clay. What is significant in the current report is the calculated weight of wet sand (in tons) that restricted the boys’ attempts at breathing, resulting in compressive thoracic asphyxia. Although highly unusual, these occurrences document a previously undescribed mechanism of injury in childhood sand burial. Of interest is the fact that all 4 were boys. It is well-known that boys are more frequently involved in accidents, presumably due to more adventurous and risky behavior.\n\n【7】During the summer months, newspapers, magazines, and television commercials often show youngsters building sand castles or instances of intentional sand burial up to the shoulder level, suggesting these activities are popular playtime pursuits 删除4:<u>( Figure 1 , Figure 2 )</u>. The current report unmasks the potential dangers associated with these activities.\n\n【8】Figure 1 Child playing in the sandbox in his backyard.

If either of the 2 reported events had been observed, the chance of prompt extrication and survival would have been better. The authors are to be praised for making this information available to their medical colleagues. However, the message also needs to reach public health and accident-prevention officials in the community.

Neck pain can involve just the neck and shoulders, or it might radiate down an arm. The pain can be dull or feel like an electric shock into the arm. Some symptoms, such as numbness or muscle weakness in an arm, can help pinpoint the cause of neck pain.\n\n【2】Neck pain caused by muscle tension or strain usually goes away on its own within a few days. Neck pain that continues longer than several weeks often responds to exercise, stretching, physical therapy and massage. Sometimes, you may need steroid injections or even surgery to relieve neck pain.\n\n【3】To help relieve discomfort, try these self-care tips:\n\n【4】*   **Ice or heat.** Apply cold, such as an ice pack or ice wrapped in a towel, for up to 15 minutes several times a day during the first 48 hours. After that, use heat. Try taking a warm shower or using a heating pad on the low setting.\n*   **Stretching.** Stretch your neck muscles by turning your neck gently from side to side and up and down.\n*   **Massage.** During a massage, a trained practitioner kneads the muscles in the neck. Massage might help people with chronic neck pain from tightened muscles.\n*   **Good posture.** Practice good posture, especially if you sit at a computer all day. Keep your back supported, and make sure that your computer monitor is at eye level. When using cell phones, tablets and other small screens, keep your head up and hold the device straight out rather than bending your neck to look down at the device.\n\n【5】### Schedule an office visit\n\n【6】Call your doctor if you have neck pain that:\n\n【7】*   Worsens in spite of self-care\n*   Persists after several weeks of self-care\n*   Radiates down your arms or legs\n*   Is accompanied by headache, weakness, numbness or tingling\n\n【8】### Seek emergency medical care\n\n【9】Call 911 or your local emergency number or have someone drive you to the emergency room if you have severe neck pain that's associated with:\n\n【10】*   **Traumatic injury.** Examples include car collisions, diving accidents or falls.\n*   **Muscle weakness.** Weakness in an arm or leg or trouble walking may be a sign of a more serious problem.\n*   **Fever.** If you have severe neck pain with a high fever, you might have meningitis, an infection of the membrane covering your spinal cord and brain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

After initial surgical evaluation, terminal ileitis was suspected, and the patient was referred for prompt endoscopy of the lower gastrointestinal tract. Results of ileocolonoscopy were normal except for the changes in the cecum (depicted in the image). The appendiceal orifice revealed an edematous protuberance with purulent discharge. Consecutive appendectomy and final histology confirmed the diagnosis of subacute appendicitis.\n\n【1】Appendicitis is rarely found during ileocolonoscopy. However, in cases with atypical clinical presentation not demanding immediate surgery or with inconclusive imaging studies, ileocolonoscopy can help rule out other inflammatory or malignant conditions. Endoscopic findings include mucosal hyperemia with edema and bulging orifices. Pus can sometimes drain spontaneously from the lumen, which might have accounted for the attenuated clinical course of appendicitis in this case.\n\n【2】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【5】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/83.6.622</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>© 2008 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Using these codes, we defined the 20 common chronic conditions recommended by the US Department of Health and Human Services. We counted only persons who received at least 2 codes for a given condition separated by more than 30 days, and we calculated the age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific prevalence of multimorbidity.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of the 138,858 study participants, 52.4% were women (n=72,732) and 38.9% had 1 or more conditions (n=54,012), 22.6% had 2 or more conditions (n=31,444), and 4.9% had 5 or more conditions (n=6853). The prevalence of multimorbidity (≥2 conditions) increased steeply with older age and reached 77.3% at 65 years and older. However, the absolute number of people affected by multimorbidity was higher in those younger than 65 years. Although the prevalence of multimorbidity was similar in men and women overall, the most common dyads and triads of conditions varied by sex. Compared with white persons, the prevalence of multimorbidity was slightly higher in black persons and slightly lower in Asian persons.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Multimorbidity is common in the general population; it increases steeply with older age, has different patterns in men and women, and varies by race/ethnicity.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ARR ( cardiac arrhythmia ), ART ( arthritis ), AST ( asthma ), AUT ( autism spectrum disorder ), CAD ( coronary artery disease ), CAN ( cancer ), CHF ( congestive heart failure ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), CMS ( Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ), COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ), DEM ( dementia ), DEP ( depression ), DIA ( diabetes ), HEP ( hepatitis ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), HTN ( hypertension ), ICD-9 ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ), LIP ( hyperlipidemia ), OST ( osteoporosis ), REP ( Rochester Epidemiology Project ), STR ( stroke ), SUB ( substance abuse disorders ), SZO ( schizophrenia )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Initially, the pain was described as sharp and intermittent, located in the right lower quadrant. Gradually, the pain became constant and progressively more severe. The patient also noted occasional crampy pain that extended from the right lower quadrant across to the left lower abdomen. When the pain began, the patient was constipated, but over time her stools became loose. Although onset and resolution of the intermittent pain was often spontaneous, she noticed occasional onset of pain with food intake and occasional relief of pain with passage of a loose stool. She denied having nausea, vomiting, melena, hematochezia, heartburn, or dysuria. She reported losing 3.6 kg over the preceding month and slept poorly because of the abdominal pain. Before the patient came to our clinic, she sought medical attention elsewhere and was given an antispasmodic agent and a narcotic analgesic that helped to relieve her pain temporarily.\n\n【1】*   1.\n\n【2】    **_Based on the symptoms and description of the patient's pain pattern, which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?_**\n\n【3】    *   a.\n\n【4】        _Bowel infarction_\n\n【5】    *   b.\n\n【6】        _Appendicitis_\n\n【7】    *   c.\n\n【8】        _Partial small bowel obstruction_\n\n【9】    *   d.\n\n【10】        _Urinary calculus_\n\n【11】    *   e.\n\n【12】        _Peptic ulcer disease_\n\n【13】Infarction of the bowel due to vascular occlusion usually causes severe pain, and onset is precise. Our patient had a more indolent progression of pain than would likely be seen with a vascular event. Appendicitis is an acute illness, and its natural history precludes a chronic progression of symptoms. Inflammation of the parietal peritoneum due to appendicitis usually causes well-localized pain, most often in the right lower quadrant. The duration of our patient's symptoms makes this diagnosis less likely. Partial small bowel obstruction is characterized by vague, generalized abdominal discomfort and is often associated with diarrhea and/or constipation. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention may occur. Our patient's symptoms and pain pattern most closely resembled this presentation. Urinary calculi cause colicky and severe pain. This pain is more likely to have a relatively sudden onset and to be unilateral. Often the pain extends into a patient's groin and may be associated with hematuria. Peptic ulcer disease often causes a burning or gnawing epigastric discomfort that is accentuated by fasting and is relieved by antacids or food. The pain may extend to the back. Because of the relief of symptoms with food intake, weight gain, rather than weight loss, may be noted in the setting of peptic ulcer disease.\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   O'Leary JP\n*   Lind JF\n*   Joehl RJ\n\n【15】Stomach and duodenum.\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>in: Lawrence PF Bell RM Dayton MT Essentials of General Surgery. 2nd ed.

A squamous cell carcinoma on her perineum was treated with multiple excisions and radiation therapy in 1997. She had also been treated for at least 20 basal cell carcinomas on her face and trunk. Previous operations included bilateral tubal ligation in 1974 and a left salpingo-oophorectomy for a benign ovarian cyst in 1993.\n\n【20】Her medications were hyoscyamine (0.375 mg orally twice daily), dicyclomine (10 mg orally 4 times a day), and propoxyphene/acetaminophen (100 mg/650 mg orally every 4 hours). She lived in Arizona for most of her life. The patient had a 5-pack-year history of smoking and drank alcohol rarely. Her brother and 1 son died of Hodgkin disease; this was the only malignancy in her family.\n\n【21】On examination, the patient was thin and appeared tired. She had no costovertebral angle tenderness. Her abdomen was soft without rebound or guarding. Tenderness to deep palpation was noted in her right lower quadrant and hypogastrium, which decreased when she tensed her abdominal musculature. The patient's abdomen was not distended, and she had normal, active bowel sounds.

Sigmoidoscopy is not helpful in evaluating the proximal colon and terminal ileum, where a possible abnormality was found on colon radiography. Small bowel radiography yields the best visualization of the terminal ileum and is less costly and less invasive than colonoscopy, the other possible choice to evaluate these symptoms. However, colonoscopy is contraindicated if intestinal obstruction is suspected. Hysteroscopy provides visualization of the uterine cavity but is unlikely to increase the diagnostic yield in this patient who has an abnormal finding in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【72】The patient was referred for small bowel radiography, which revealed slow transit of barium through the ileum, an 8- to 10-cm segment of severe stricture of the distal ileum, and a masslike abnormality filling the cecum and proximal ascending colon.

Immediate operative management would facilitate reduction of the intussusception, diagnosis of the lead-point mass, resection of the mass and the portion of affected bowel, and sampling of regional lymph nodes, if necessary. Although most experts agree that surgical resection of intussusception in adults is necessary, the extent of resection and whether the intussusception should be reduced before resection are controversial. Attempted reduction of this intussusception with either barium or air-contrast enemas may be successful, but with a large lead-point mass suggestive of malignancy, the intussusception may recur, and no further diagnostic information would be obtained. Even if a biopsy could be performed and the intussusception reduced by colonoscopy, this approach would delay definitive treatment and could worsen tissue necrosis in the vascularly compromised intussusceptum.\n\n【91】无关删除-2:<u>*   Begos DG\n*   Sandor A\n*   Modlin IM</u>\n\n【92】The diagnosis and management of adult intussusception.\n\n【93】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Surg._ 1997; 173 : 88-94</u></u>\n\n【94】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (435)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【95】Our patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, reduction of the intussusception, and resection of the mass and approximately 20 cm of ileum.

Approximately 1 in 4 new cases is discovered in a person younger than 40 years. Although there are primarily 6 subtypes of melanoma, with superficial spreading melanoma the most common, the prognosis for patients with the disease is irrespective of the histologic subtype and depends predominantly on tumor thickness.\n\n【117】无关删除-2:<u>*   Edman RL\n*   Wolfe JT</u>\n\n【118】Prevention and early detection of malignant melanoma.\n\n【119】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am Fam Physician._ 2000; 62 : 2277-2285</u></u>\n\n【120】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【121】Many factors are associated with an increased risk of the development of a cutaneous melanoma. The exact risk varies among investigators. In general, a high risk of melanoma development is conferred by a personal history of atypical moles and a family history of melanoma in a patient with more than 100 moles, previous nonmelanoma skin cancer, giant congenital nevus, personal history of melanoma, family history of melanoma in a first-degree relative, and immunosuppression. Increased risk but to a lesser degree is conferred by repeated blistering sunburns at an early age, freckling, fair skin and hair, and a single clinically atypical nevus. Other factors that increase melanoma risk include clinically atypical nevi without a family history of melanoma or sporadic atypical nevi, a large number of nevi, and long-term tanning with ultraviolet A light or treatment of other skin conditions, such as psoriasis, with psoralen plus ultraviolet A. Age younger than 10 years and nonwhite skin are associated with a lower than average risk for the development of cutaneous melanoma. Interestingly, although cumulative sun exposure correlates with nonmelanoma skin cancer, intermittent intense sun exposure seems to be more related to a risk of melanoma.\n\n【122】无关删除-2:<u>*   Edman RL\n*   Wolfe JT</u>\n\n【123】Prevention and early detection of malignant melanoma.\n\n【124】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am Fam Physician._ 2000; 62 : 2277-2285</u></u>\n\n【125】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【126】Although the skin may be the organ most accessible to the clinician, the diagnosis of melanoma may be delayed for several reasons.

A skin biopsy is used most often to diagnose skin conditions.\n\n【2】Skin biopsy procedures include:\n\n【3】*   **Shave biopsy.** A tool like a razor is used to scrape the surface of your skin. It gathers a cell sample from the top layers of the skin. These layers are called the epidermis and the dermis. Stitches usually aren't needed after this procedure.\n*   **Punch biopsy.** A round-tipped cutting tool is used to remove a small core of skin, including deeper layers. The sample might include tissue from layers called the epidermis, the dermis and the top layer of fat under the skin. You may need stitches to close the wound.\n*   **Excisional biopsy.** A scalpel is used to remove an entire lump or an area of irregular skin. The sample of removed tissue might include a border of healthy skin and your skin's deeper layers. You may need stitches to close the wound.\n\n【4】The type of skin biopsy you have will depends on your symptoms and how much skin is affected.\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】A skin biopsy is used to diagnose or help treat skin conditions and diseases, including:\n\n【7】*   Actinic keratosis.\n*   Blistering skin disorders.\n*   Skin cancer.\n*   Skin tags.\n*   Irregular moles or other growths.\n\n【8】Risks\n-----\n\n【9】A skin biopsy is usually safe. But unwanted results can occur, including:\n\n【10】*   Bleeding.\n*   Bruising.\n*   Scarring.\n*   Infection.\n*   An allergic reaction.\n\n【11】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【12】Before the skin biopsy, tell your health care provider if you:\n\n【13】*   Have had reactions to creams or gels applied to your skin.\n*   Have had reactions to tape.\n*   Have been diagnosed with a bleeding disorder.\n*   Have had serious bleeding after a medical procedure.\n*   Are taking blood-thinning medicine. Examples include aspirin, aspiring-containing medicine, warfarin (Jantoven) and heparin.\n*   Are taking supplements or homeopathic medicine. At times these can cause bleeding when taken with other medicine.\n*   Have had skin infections.\n\n【14】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【15】Depending on the location of the skin biopsy, you may be asked to undress and change into a clean gown. The skin to be biopsied is cleaned and marked to outline the site.\n\n【16】You then receive medicine to numb the biopsy site. This is called a local anesthetic. It's usually given by injection with a thin needle. The numbing medicine can cause a burning feeling in the skin for a few seconds. After that, you shouldn't feel any pain during the skin biopsy. To make sure the numbing medicine is working, your health care provider may prick your skin with a needle and ask you if you feel anything.\n\n【17】A skin biopsy typically takes about 15 minutes, including:\n\n【18】*   Preparing the skin.\n*   Removing the tissue.\n*   Closing or bandaging the wound.\n*   Getting tips for at-home wound care.\n\n【19】### During the skin biopsy\n\n【20】What you can expect during your skin biopsy depends on the type of biopsy you'll undergo.\n\n【21】*   **For a shave biopsy,** a razor-like tool is used to scrape the tissue. The depth of the cut varies. A shave biopsy causes bleeding. Pressure and a medicine applied to the skin are used to stop the bleeding.\n*   **For a punch biopsy or an excisional biopsy,** a cutting tool collects a sample from the deeper skin layers. Stitches may be needed to close the wound. A bandage is placed over the wound to protect it and prevent bleeding.\n\n【22】### After the skin biopsy\n\n【23】Your health care provider may instruct you to keep the bandage over the biopsy site until the next day. Sometimes the biopsy site bleeds after you leave the clinic. This is more likely in people taking blood-thinning medicine. If this occurs, apply direct pressure to the wound for 20 minutes, then look at it. If bleeding continues, apply pressure for another 20 minutes. If bleeding still continues after that, contact your health care provider.\n\n【24】All biopsies leave scars. They tend to fade with time. The scar's permanent color will be set 1 to 2 years after the biopsy.\n\n【25】Some people develop a thick, raised scar. This type of scar, also called a keloid scar, is more common in people with brown or Black skin. The risk of a keloid scar is also higher when a biopsy is done on the neck, back or chest.\n\n【26】Avoid bumping the area or doing activities that stretch the skin. Stretching the skin could lead to bleeding or a bigger scar. Don't soak in a bathtub, swimming pool or hot tub until your health care provider says it's OK — usually about seven days after the procedure.\n\n【27】Healing can take several weeks. Wounds on the legs and feet tend to heal slower than those on other areas of the body.\n\n【28】Clean the biopsy site two times a day unless it's on your scalp. Scalp wounds can be cleaned once a day. Follow these steps:\n\n【29】*   **Wash your hands** with soap and water before touching the biopsy site.\n*   **Wash the biopsy site** with soap and water. If the biopsy site is on your scalp, use shampoo.\n*   **Rinse well** and pat dry with a clean towel.\n*   **Apply a thin layer** of petroleum jelly. Use a new container of petroleum jelly the first time you do wound care. Use a new cotton swab each time you apply the product.\n*   **Cover the site** with a bandage (Band-Aid, Curad, others) for 2 to 3 days after the procedure.\n\n【30】If you have stitches, continue wound care until they're removed. If you don't have stitches, take these wound care steps until the skin is healed.\n\n【31】If your wound is sore, ask your health care provider if you can apply ice wrapped in a thin towel.\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】Your biopsy sample is sent to the lab to be tested for signs of disease. Ask your health care provider when you may get results. It may take a few days or even months, depending on the type of biopsy, the tests being done and the lab's procedures.\n\n【34】Your health care provider may ask that you schedule an appointment to discuss the results. You might want to bring someone you trust to this appointment. Having someone with you may help with hearing and understanding the discussion.\n\n【35】List questions that you want to ask your health care provider, such as:\n\n【36】*   Based on the results, what are my next steps?\n*   What kind of follow-up, if any, should I expect?\n*   Is there anything that might have affected or altered the test results?\n*   Will I need to repeat the test?\n*   If the skin biopsy showed skin cancer, was all of the cancer removed?\n*   Will I need more treatment?\n\n【37】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

He entered Western Ontario Medical School in 1901, interned at Victoria Hospital in 1905, and entered into general practice in New Jersey in 1906. In 1907, the young general practitioner traveled to Philadelphia, Pa, to hear William Osler, the most prominent physician in the English-speaking world, lecture at the College of Pharmacy. Rowntree recalls half a century later, “I was thrilled, and at \\[the lecture's\\] close had the opportunity to meet \\[Osler\\] personally.” That same night, Rowntree wrote Osler a letter, telling him that he had decided to give up general practice and become an academic physician. Rowntree had so much confidence in Osler after hearing and meeting him that he wrote to Osler, “Whatever you advise, I will do my best to carry out.”\n\n【4】In 1958, looking back on this important juncture in his life, Rowntree saw himself as being “immersed in \\[general practice\\] to the point where I had no time left for study,” exemplifying his career-long concern for preserving time for research as well as for patient care. (Indeed, it may safely be said that to Rowntree, research became more important than patient care as the years progressed.) Osler promptly stated in a return letter that Rowntree should study at Johns Hopkins for at least 6 years. Rowntree went to Johns Hopkins that same year and because he carried Osler's letter, was accepted there.\n\n【5】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rowntree LG</u>\n\n【6】Amid Masters of Twentieth Century Medicine.

Just as Osler was always Rowntree's clinical “guiding star,” Abel became for him the embodiment of the researcher. Rowntree's work with Abel was both fundamental and far-reaching. Together, they introduced the phthalein compounds to the medical world. In 1910, Rowntree and Dr John T. Geraghty were the first to describe the use of these chemicals for the determination of renal function.\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>*   Geraghty JT\n*   Rowntree LG</u>\n\n【11】The phenolsulphonephthalein test for estimating renal function.\n\n【12】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 1911; 57 : 811-816</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (4)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rowntree LG\n*   Geraghty JT</u>\n\n【15】An experimental and clinical study of the functional activity of the kidneys by means of phenolsulphonephthalein.\n\n【16】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Pharmacol Exp Ther._ 1910; 1 : 579-661</u></u>\n\n【17】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rowntree LG\n*   Geraghty JT</u>\n\n【19】The phthalein test.\n\n【20】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Intern Med._ 1912; 9 : 284-338</u></u>\n\n【21】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (6)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【22】This “Rowntree test” was a clinical standard for the next 30 years.\n\n【23】Abel and Rowntree also developed the first artificial kidney in animal research, reporting their success with the apparatus in 1913.\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abel JJ\n*   Rowntree LG\n*   Turner BB</u>\n\n【25】On the removal of diffusible substances from the circulating blood by means of dialysis.\n\n【26】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Trans Assoc Am Phys._ 1913; 28 : 51-54</u></u>\n\n【27】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【28】That same year, Rowntree presented an article with Dr Norman Keith (who later became a member of Rowntree's group at the Mayo Clinic) about a vital red dye method for determining blood and plasma volumes.

He entered the US Army in 1918, where he became interested in aviation medicine, studying aviation accidents and the effects of altitude on health. Rowntree also helped develop a school for flight surgeons.\n\n【41】### The Mayo Clinic\n\n【42】After returning from the war, Rowntree declined numerous offers in order to accept William J. Mayo's invitation to work at the Mayo Clinic. On his arrival in Rochester, Minn, in 1920, Rowntree was made Head of Section and Professor of Medicine of the Mayo Foundation. By this time, Rowntree and W. J. Mayo knew each other well, Mayo having already saved Rowntree's life by performing surgery on him for a perforated ulcer in 1918. In January 1922, Rowntree was given the title of Chief of the Department of Medicine, the Mayo Foundation.\n\n【43】Physicians of the Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation.

J. Mayo's convictions, the rule at the Mayo Clinic well into the second half of the 20th century was that the medical staff function as generalists first, regardless of their subspecialty interests. While they initially saw “all comers” in terms of patients, the various members of the Rowntree group (all with strong research interests) soon tended to narrow their investigative and therapeutic efforts. Wilder concentrated on diabetes; Keith on nephrology; Bargen, McVicar, and Snell on gastrointestinal diseases; and Brown on peripheral vascular diseases. Brown and Keith shared an interest in hypertension, with Brown focused on its early stages and Keith more interested in advanced hypertension and kidney diseases. Snell began to focus on liver and adrenal gland disease. Hench's main interest remained arthritis.\n\n【86】With the divergence of their various interests, the Rowntree group began to disperse. With time, the individual members affiliated more with other medical sections within the clinic, substantially enriching those sections and providing them with a much stronger research orientation. The result, at least in terms of the members’ research interests, led to the formation of new subspecialty groups.\n\n【87】Importantly, all of Rowntree's associates made noteworthy contributions to the medical knowledge of their day. Hench went on to win the Nobel Prize. They attracted the next generation of more research-minded clinicians to the Mayo Clinic and established the clinic in the minds of physicians throughout the world as a research institution.

Over the years, he spent less and less time caring for patients and instead devoted his energies to clinical investigation and the supervision of projects carried out by his fellows. Rowntree also spent much time in the late 1920s attending various national meetings and serving on committees. Apparently, Rowntree saw patients in the diagnostic sections of the clinic only by special request, and his hospital service was taken over gradually by Dr Snell.\n\n【102】Barker N.

The causes of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated wasting may include anorexia, malabsorption, and a variety of altered metabolic states. Malabsorption and diarrhea may result from gastrointestinal tract opportunistic infections or from direct effects of HIV on the gastrointestinal tract. Infection with HIV may produce metabolic derangements that alter nutrient utilization, resulting in loss of BCM. Nutritional assessment of the patient with AIDS should include an evaluation of BCM and physical and psychosocial functioning. Antiretroviral therapy and eradication of opportunistic infections do not always reverse wasting. Treatment should include nutritional counseling. Total parenteral nutrition is sometimes of benefit, particularly in patients with damaged gastrointestinal tracts. Dronabinol and megestrol acetate may promote weight gain; however, dronabinol may have adverse effects, and most of the gain with megestrol acetate is in fat rather than BCM. If gonadal dysfunction is present, testosterone replacement therapy should be included in the treatment plan. Some studies suggest that oral anabolic steroids may improve muscle strength and body composition. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, mammalian-derived human growth hormone (rhGH\\[m\\]) has produced sustained weight and BCM gains in AIDS patients. If a patient continues to lose BCM after the above factors have been addressed and corrected, a 12-week course of rhGH\\[m\\] is indicated. Halting the progression of HIV-associated wasting may improve survival, enhance physical and social functioning, and enrich quality of life.\n\n【1】AIDS ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ), BCM ( body cell mass ), BW ( body weight ), EM ( extracellular material ), GH ( growth hormone ), GI ( gastrointestinal ), HAART ( highly active antiretroviral therapy ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), IBW ( ideal body weight ), LBM ( lean body mass ), rhGH\\[m\\] ( mammalian-derived human growth hormone )\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "b5a0fd1a-9a8e-421f-899a-d390697ef883", "title": "Feminizing hormone therapy", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Feminizing hormone therapy typically is used by transgender women and nonbinary people to produce physical changes in the body that are caused by female hormones during puberty. Those changes are called secondary sex characteristics. This hormone therapy helps better align the body with a person's gender identity. Feminizing hormone therapy also is called gender-affirming hormone therapy.\n\n【2】Feminizing hormone therapy involves taking medicine to block the action of the hormone testosterone. It also includes taking the hormone estrogen. Estrogen lowers the amount of testosterone the body makes. It also triggers the development of feminine secondary sex characteristics. Feminizing hormone therapy can be done alone or along with feminizing surgery.\n\n【3】Not everybody chooses to have feminizing hormone therapy. It can affect fertility and sexual function, and it might lead to health problems. Talk with your health care provider about the risks and benefits for you.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Feminizing hormone therapy is used to change the body's hormone levels. Those hormone changes trigger physical changes that help better align the body with a person's gender identity.\n\n【6】In some cases, people seeking feminizing hormone therapy experience discomfort or distress because their gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth or from their sex-related physical characteristics. This condition is called gender dysphoria.\n\n【7】Feminizing hormone therapy can:\n\n【8】*   Improve psychological and social well-being.\n*   Ease psychological and emotional distress related to gender.\n*   Improve satisfaction with sex.\n*   Improve quality of life.\n\n【9】Your health care provider might advise against feminizing hormone therapy if you:\n\n【10】*   Have a hormone-sensitive cancer, such as prostate cancer.\n*   Have problems with blood clots, such as when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, a condition called deep vein thrombosis, or a there's a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries of the lungs, called a pulmonary embolism.\n*   Have significant medical conditions that haven't been addressed.\n*   Have behavioral health conditions that haven't been addressed.\n*   Have a condition that limits your ability to give your informed consent.\n\n【11】Risks\n-----\n\n【12】Research has found that feminizing hormone therapy can be safe and effective when delivered by a health care provider with expertise in transgender care. Talk to your health care provider about questions or concerns you have regarding the changes that will happen in your body as a result of feminizing hormone therapy.\n\n【13】Complications can include:\n\n【14】*   Blood clots in a deep vein or in the lungs\n*   Heart problems\n*   High levels of triglycerides, a type of fat, in the blood\n*   High levels of potassium in the blood\n*   High levels of the hormone prolactin in the blood\n*   Nipple discharge\n*   Weight gain\n*   Infertility\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Type 2 diabetes\n*   Stroke\n\n【15】Evidence suggests that people who take feminizing hormone therapy may have an increased risk of breast cancer when compared to cisgender men — men whose gender identity aligns with societal norms related to their sex assigned at birth. But the risk is not greater than that of cisgender women.\n\n【16】To minimize risk, the goal for people taking feminizing hormone therapy is to keep hormone levels in the range that's typical for cisgender women.\n\n【17】### Fertility\n\n【18】Feminizing hormone therapy might limit your fertility. If possible, it's best to make decisions about fertility before starting treatment. The risk of permanent infertility increases with long-term use of hormones. That is particularly true for those who start hormone therapy before puberty begins. Even after stopping hormone therapy, your testicles might not recover enough to ensure conception without infertility treatment.\n\n【19】If you want to have biological children, talk to your health care provider about freezing your sperm before you start feminizing hormone therapy. That procedure is called sperm cryopreservation.\n\n【20】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【21】Before you start feminizing hormone therapy, your health care provider assesses your health. This helps address any medical conditions that might affect your treatment. The evaluation may include:\n\n【22】*   A review of your personal and family medical history.\n*   A physical exam.\n*   Lab tests.\n*   A review of your vaccinations.\n*   Screening tests for some conditions and diseases.\n*   Identification and management, if needed, of tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use disorder, HIV or other sexually transmitted infections.\n*   Discussion about sperm freezing and fertility.\n\n【23】You also might have a behavioral health evaluation by a provider with expertise in transgender health. The evaluation may assess:\n\n【24】*   Gender identity.\n*   Gender dysphoria.\n*   Mental health concerns.\n*   Sexual health concerns.\n*   The impact of gender identity at work, at school, at home and in social settings.\n*   Risky behaviors, such as substance use or use of unapproved silicone injections, hormone therapy or supplements.\n*   Support from family, friends and caregivers.\n*   Your goals and expectations of treatment.\n*   Care planning and follow-up care.\n\n【25】People younger than age 18, along with a parent or guardian, should see a medical care provider and a behavioral health provider with expertise in pediatric transgender health to discuss the risks and benefits of hormone therapy and gender transitioning in that age group.\n\n【26】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【27】You should start feminizing hormone therapy only after you've had a discussion of the risks and benefits as well as treatment alternatives with a health care provider who has expertise in transgender care. Make sure you understand what will happen and get answers to any questions you may have before you begin hormone therapy.\n\n【28】Feminizing hormone therapy typically begins by taking the medicine spironolactone (Aldactone). It blocks male sex hormone receptors — also called androgen receptors. This lowers the amount of testosterone the body makes.\n\n【29】About 4 to 8 weeks after you start taking spironolactone, you begin taking estrogen. This also lowers the amount of testosterone the body makes. And it triggers physical changes in the body that are caused by female hormones during puberty.\n\n【30】Estrogen can be taken several ways. They include a pill and a shot. There also are several forms of estrogen that are applied to the skin, including a cream, gel, spray and patch.\n\n【31】It is best not to take estrogen as a pill if you have a personal or family history of blood clots in a deep vein or in the lungs, a condition called venous thrombosis.\n\n【32】Another choice for feminizing hormone therapy is to take gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) analogs. They lower the amount of testosterone your body makes and might allow you to take lower doses of estrogen without the use of spironolactone. The disadvantage is that Gn-RH analogs usually are more expensive.\n\n【33】After you begin feminizing hormone therapy, you'll notice the following changes in your body over time:\n\n【34】*   **Fewer erections and a decrease in ejaculation.** This will begin 1 to 3 months after treatment starts. The full effect will happen within 3 to 6 months.\n*   **Less interest in sex.** This also is called decreased libido. It will begin 1 to 3 months after you start treatment. You'll see the full effect within 1 to 2 years.\n*   **Slower scalp hair loss.** This will begin 1 to 3 months after treatment begins. The full effect will happen within 1 to 2 years.\n*   **Breast development.** This begins 3 to 6 months after treatment starts. The full effect happens within 2 to 3 years.\n*   **Softer, less oily skin.** This will begin 3 to 6 months after treatment starts. That's also when the full effect will happen.\n*   **Smaller testicles.** This also is called testicular atrophy. It begins 3 to 6 months after the start of treatment. You'll see the full effect within 2 to 3 years.\n*   **Less muscle mass.** This will begin 3 to 6 months after treatment starts. You'll see the full effect within 1 to 2 years.\n*   **More body fat.** This will begin 3 to 6 months after treatment starts. The full effect will happen within 2 to 5 years.\n*   **Less facial and body hair growth.** This will begin 6 to 12 months after treatment starts. The full effect happens within three years.\n\n【35】Some of the physical changes caused by feminizing hormone therapy can be reversed if you stop taking it. Others, such as breast development, cannot be reversed.\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】While on feminizing hormone therapy, you meet regularly with your health care provider to:\n\n【38】*   Keep track of your physical changes.\n*   Monitor your hormone levels. Over time, your hormone dose may need to change to ensure you are taking the lowest dose necessary to get the physical effects that you want.\n*   Have blood tests to check for changes in your cholesterol, blood sugar, blood count, liver enzymes and electrolytes that could be caused by hormone therapy.\n*   Monitor your behavioral health.\n\n【39】You also need routine preventive care. Depending on your situation, this may include:\n\n【40】*   **Breast cancer screening.** This should be done according to breast cancer screening recommendations for cisgender women your age.\n*   **Prostate cancer screening.** This should be done according to prostate cancer screening recommendations for cisgender men your age.\n*   **Monitoring bone health.** You should have bone density assessment according to the recommendations for cisgender women your age. You may need to take calcium and vitamin D supplements for bone health.\n\n【41】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

CD34  cellular senescence was quantitated by human telomerase reverse transcriptase expression and telomerase expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) protein expression assayed in plasma. An ECG-based artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm was used to determine cardiac age and difference from chronological age (AI ECG age gap).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】CD34  counts and telomerase expression were significantly reduced and AI ECG age gap and SASP expression increased in all HF groups compared with healthy controls. Expression of SASP protein was closely associated with telomerase activity and severity of HF phenotype and inflammation. Telomerase activity was more closely associated with CD34  cell counts and AI ECG age gap.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】We conclude from this pilot study that HF may promote a senescent phenotype independent of chronological age. We show for the first time that the AI ECG in HF shows a phenotype of cardiac aging beyond chronological age, and appears to be associated with cellular and molecular evidence of senescence.\n\n【9】Graphical abstract\n------------------\n\n【10】Graphical Abstract\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>\n\n【12】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【13】AI ( artificial intelligence ), CCL-3 ( CC-motif chemokine ligand 3 ), CCL-4 ( CC-motif chemokine ligand 4 ), CXCL1 ( C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 ), CD34 ( cluster of differentiation antigen/hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen 34 ), GDF15 ( growth/differentiation factor 15 ), HFpEF ( heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ), HFrEF ( heart failure with reduced ejection fraction ), hTERT ( human telomerase reverse transcriptase ), IL-6 ( interleukin 6 ), LVAD ( left ventricular assist device ), MFI ( median fluorescence intensity ), MMP-1 ( matrix metalloproteinase-1 ), OPN ( osteopontin ), SASP ( senescence-associated secretory phenotype ), TNF-α ( tumor necrosis factor alpha ), TNFR1 ( tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 )\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【20】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【21】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Best practices for effective health communication were implemented in recruitment approaches and informed consent processes. Using logistic regression models, we determined patient characteristics independently associated with patients’ willingness to hear about and participate in the study.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In unadjusted analyses, participants with higher health literacy, and those who were younger, female, or had more education had higher levels of both research interest and research participation.

{"seq_id": "fc80e774-b083-4a4d-be68-06dd6432cbf7", "title": "Sclerotherapy", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Sclerotherapy treats veins that are twisted and enlarged, known as varicose veins. Varicose veins are usually in the legs. Sclerotherapy also treats spider veins, a mild form of varicose veins. Sclerotherapy usually works best on small varicose veins.\n\n【2】Sclerotherapy involves using a needle to put a solution into the vein. The sclerotherapy solution causes the vein to scar. The scarring forces blood through healthier veins. The collapsed vein then fades.\n\n【3】After sclerotherapy, treated veins tend to fade within a few weeks, although they might not disappear completely. It can take a month or more for full results. Some veins need more than one sclerotherapy treatment.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Sclerotherapy is usually done to make the veins look better. The procedure also can improve symptoms related to varicose veins, including:\n\n【6】*   Aching.\n*   Swelling.\n*   Burning.\n*   Cramping at night.\n\n【7】Experts suggest waiting to have sclerotherapy done after pregnancy or breastfeeding.\n\n【8】Risks\n-----\n\n【9】Sclerotherapy generally has few serious complications.\n\n【10】Side effects that can occur where the needle goes into the skin include:\n\n【11】*   Bruising.\n*   Raised red areas, called hives.\n*   Small skin sores.\n*   Darkened skin.\n*   A number of tiny red blood vessels.\n\n【12】These side effects usually go away within days to weeks. Some side effects may take months or longer to go away completely.\n\n【13】Less-common side effects of sclerotherapy that might need treatment include:\n\n【14】*   **Inflammation.** This is usually mild but may cause swelling, warmth and discomfort around the site where the needle went into the skin. Taking a pain reliever you can get without a prescription might help. These include aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others).\n*   **Blood clot.** If a lump of clotted blood forms in a treated vein, it might need to be drained. Rarely, a blood clot can travel to a deeper vein in the leg, a condition known as deep vein thrombosis.\n\n【15】    Deep vein thrombosis carries a risk of a blood clot traveling from the leg to the lungs and blocking a vital artery. This is known as a pulmonary embolism. It's a very rare complication of sclerotherapy that needs immediate medical care. The symptoms include trouble breathing, chest pain or dizziness, or coughing up blood.\n\n【16】*   **Air bubbles.** Tiny air bubbles can rise in the blood. This might not cause symptoms. But symptoms might include seeing light flashes, having headaches, fainting and having nausea.\n\n【17】    These symptoms usually go away. But call your health care provider for problems with moving or feelings in arms or legs after the procedure.\n\n【18】*   **Allergic reaction.** An allergic reaction to the solution used for treatment is possible, but uncommon.\n\n【19】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【20】Before the procedure, a health care provider does a physical exam. The provider examines your veins and checks for blood vessel disease.\n\n【21】The provider asks questions about your medical history. Information needed about your medical history includes:\n\n【22】*   Recent illnesses or medical conditions, such as a heart condition or a history of blood clots.\n*   Allergies.\n*   Other treatments you've had for varicose veins and the results.\n*   Medicines or supplements you take, especially aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox DS), blood thinners, iron supplements or herbal supplements.\n\n【23】Aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium or blood thinners can increase the risk of bleeding. If you take one or more of these, a member of your health care team can tell you how and when to stop taking them before the procedure.\n\n【24】Before sclerotherapy, a health care provider might ask for an ultrasound test of the legs. This is likely if the veins are causing symptoms. Ultrasound is a painless procedure that uses sound waves to create pictures of structures inside the body.\n\n【25】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【26】Sclerotherapy is typically done in a health care provider's office. It generally takes an hour or less to complete.\n\n【27】### Before the procedure\n\n【28】Don't shave your legs or use lotion on them. Wear loose, comfortable clothing.\n\n【29】### During the procedure\n\n【30】You lie on your back with your legs slightly raised. A member of your health care team cleans the area to be treated. Then your care provider uses a small needle to slowly put solution into the vein.\n\n【31】The solution, usually a liquid, works by irritating the lining of the vein, causing it to swell shut and block the flow of blood.\n\n【32】Some people feel minor stinging or cramping when the needle goes into the vein. Tell your provider if it hurts a lot. Pain might result from the solution leaking from the vein into the tissue around it.\n\n【33】After removing the needle, your provider applies pressure to the area and massages it to keep blood out of the vein and to spread the solution. The provider might tape a pad onto the injection site to keep pressure on the area before moving on to the next vein.\n\n【34】The number of shots depends on the number of veins being treated.\n\n【35】### After the procedure\n\n【36】You can get up and walk around soon after the procedure. Walking and moving helps keep blood clots from forming.\n\n【37】Wearing compression stockings or bandages — usually for about two weeks — will keep pressure on the treated veins. Don't shave your leg or use lotion on it until the site heals.\n\n【38】Most people return to their regular activities on the same day, but you might want to have someone drive you home after the procedure. Your health care provider might tell you to avoid hard exercise for two weeks after the procedure.\n\n【39】Avoid having the treated areas in sun for two weeks, as well. Or use sunscreen with at least 30 SPF. Being in the sun can lead to dark spots on the skin, especially for those with dark skin.\n\n【40】Results\n-------\n\n【41】Results of sclerotherapy for small varicose veins or spider veins usually show in 3 to 6 weeks. Larger veins might take 3 to 4 months. However, you might need more than one treatment to get the results you want.\n\n【42】Veins that respond to treatment generally don't come back. But new veins can appear.\n\n【43】Your health care provider might ask you to return for a follow-up visit about a month after the procedure to see the results. You might need more sessions.

Participants were categorized as clinically complex if 75 years or older or with 2 or more activities of daily living limitations, end-stage renal disease, or 3 or more chronic conditions. Intensive treatment was defined as any glucose-lowering medications with HbA <sub>1c </sub> levels of 5.6% or less or 2 or more with HbA <sub>1c </sub> levels of 5.7% to 6.4%. First, we quantified the proportion of clinically complex and intensively treated individuals in the NHANES population. Then, we modeled the attributable hypoglycemia-related ED visits/hospitalizations over a 2-year period based on published data for event risk.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Almost half (48.8% \\[10,719,057 of 21,980,034\\]) of US adults with diabetes (representing 10.7 million US adults) had HbA <sub>1c </sub> levels less than 7.0%. Among them, 32.3% (3,466,713 of 10,719,057) were clinically complex, and 21.6% (2,309,556 of 10,719,057) were intensively treated, with no difference by clinical complexity. Over a 2-year period, we estimated 31,511 hospitalizations and 30,954 ED visits for hypoglycemia in this population; of these, 4774 (95% CI, 954-9714) hospitalizations and 4804 (95% CI, 862-9851) ED visits were attributable to intensive treatment.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Intensive glucose-lowering therapy, particularly among vulnerable clinically complex adults, is strongly discouraged because it may lead to hypoglycemia. However, intensive treatment was equally prevalent among US adults, irrespective of clinical complexity. Over a 2-year period, an estimated 9578 hospitalizations and ED visits for hypoglycemia could be attributed to intensive diabetes treatment, particularly among clinically complex patients. Patients at risk for hypoglycemia may benefit from treatment deintensification to reduce hypoglycemia risk and treatment burden.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ADL ( activities of daily living ), AGS ( American Geriatric Society ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), ED ( emergency department ), HbA1c ( glycated hemoglobin ), NHANES ( National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ), PSA ( probabilistic sensitivity analysis )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Do not save an open single-use vial or syringe. If the medicine in the vial or syringe has changed color, or if you see particles in it, do not use it.\n\n【34】### Dosing\n\n【35】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【36】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【37】*   For injection dosage form:\n    *   For anemia from chronic kidney failure:\n        *   Adults—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The starting dose is 0.04 milligram (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight injected into a vein or under the skin once a month.

Check with your doctor right away if you start having dizziness, fainting spells, severe tiredness, chest pain, trouble with breathing, sudden or severe headache, or problems with vision, speech, or walking.\n\n【50】Peginesatide sometimes causes convulsions (seizures), especially during the first few months of treatment. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about this.\n\n【51】Many people with kidney problems need to be on a special diet. Also, people with high blood pressure (which may be caused by kidney disease or by peginesatide treatment) may need to be on a special diet or to take medicine to keep their blood pressure under control. After their anemia has been corrected, some people feel so much better that they want to eat more than before. To keep your kidney disease or your high blood pressure from getting worse, it is very important that you follow your special diet and take your medicines regularly, even if you are feeling better.\n\n【52】In addition to peginesatide, your body needs iron and vitamins to make red blood cells.

Baseline characteristics, coagulation parameters, transfusion requirements, and procedural details were extracted. Univariate and multivariable propensity-matched analyses were used to assess the relationships between prophylactic plasma transfusion and the outcomes of interest, with a primary outcome assessed a priori of RBC transfusion occurring during the procedure or within the first 24 hours postprocedurally.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 18,204 study participants met inclusion criteria for this study, and 1803 (9.9%) had an INR of 1.5 or greater before their procedure. Of these 1803 patients, 196 patients (10.9%) received prophylactic plasma transfusion with a median time of 1.9 hours (interquartile range \\[IQR\\], 1.1-3.2 hours) between plasma transfusion initiation and procedure initiation. In multivariable propensity-matched analysis, plasma administration was associated with increased periprocedural RBC transfusions (odds ratio, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.38-3.50; _P_ <.001) and postprocedural intensive care unit admission rates (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.41-3.14; _P_ <.001) as compared with those who were not transfused preprocedurally. Similar relationships were seen at higher INR thresholds for plasma transfusion.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In patients undergoing interventional radiology procedures, preprocedural plasma transfusions given in the setting of elevated INR values were associated with increased periprocedural RBC transfusions. Additional research is needed to clarify this potential association between preprocedural plasma transfusion and periprocedural RBC transfusion.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ICU ( intensive care unit ), INR ( international normalized ratio ), IQR ( interquartile range ), OR ( odds ratio ), RBC ( red blood cell )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "4ca0c154-dc08-44c3-9648-6817736393e0", "title": "Bladder exstrophy", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Bladder exstrophy (EK-stroh-fee) is a rare birth defect in which the bladder develops outside the fetus. The exposed bladder can't store urine or function normally, resulting in urine leakage (incontinence).\n\n【2】Problems caused by bladder exstrophy vary in severity. They can include defects in the bladder, genitals and pelvic bones, as well as defects in the intestines and reproductive organs.\n\n【3】Bladder exstrophy may be spotted on a routine ultrasound during pregnancy. Sometimes, though, the defect isn't visible until the baby is born. Babies born with bladder exstrophy will need surgery to correct the defects.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Bladder exstrophy is the most common in the larger group of birth defects called the bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC). Children with BEEC have one of the following:\n\n【6】*   **Epispadias.** This is the least severe form of BEEC, in which the tube to expel urine (urethra) doesn't fully develop.\n*   **Bladder exstrophy.** This defect causes the bladder to form on the outside of the body. The bladder is also turned inside out. Usually, bladder exstrophy will involve organs of the urinary tract, as well as the digestive and reproductive systems. Defects of the abdominal wall, bladder, genitals, pelvic bones, final section of the large intestine (rectum) and opening at the end of the rectum (anus) can occur.\n\n【7】    Children with bladder exstrophy also have vesicoureteral reflux. This condition causes urine to flow the wrong way — from the bladder back up into the tubes that connect to the kidneys (ureters). Children with bladder exstrophy also have epispadias.\n\n【8】*   **Cloacal exstrophy.** Cloacal exstrophy (kloe-A-kul EK-stroh-fee) is the most serious form of BEEC. In this condition, the rectum, bladder and genitals don't fully separate as the fetus develops. These organs may not be correctly formed, and the pelvic bones are affected as well.\n\n【9】    The kidneys, backbone and spinal cord also may be affected. Most children with cloacal exstrophy have spinal abnormalities, including spina bifida. Children born with protruding abdominal organs probably also have cloacal exstrophy or bladder exstrophy.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】The cause of bladder exstrophy is unknown. Researchers think that a combination of genetic and environmental factors likely plays a role.\n\n【12】What is known is that as the fetus grows, a structure called the cloaca (klo-A-kuh) — where reproductive, urinary and digestive openings all come together — doesn't develop properly in babies who develop bladder exstrophy. Defects in the cloaca can vary a lot depending on the age of the fetus when the developmental error occurs.\n\n【13】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【14】Factors that increase the risk of bladder exstrophy include:\n\n【15】*   **Family history.** Firstborn children, children of a parent with bladder exstrophy or siblings of a child with bladder exstrophy have an increased chance of being born with the condition.\n*   **Race.** Bladder exstrophy is more common in whites than in other races.\n*   **Sex.** More boys than girls are born with bladder exstrophy.\n*   **Use of assisted reproduction.** Children born through assisted reproductive technology, such as IVF, have a higher risk of bladder exstrophy.\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】### Without surgery\n\n【18】Without treatment, children with bladder exstrophy won't be able to hold urine (urinary incontinence). They're also at risk of sexual dysfunction and have an increased risk of bladder cancer.\n\n【19】### After surgery\n\n【20】Surgery can reduce complications. The success of surgery depends on how severe the defect is. Many children who have surgical repair are able to hold urine. Young children with bladder exstrophy may walk with their legs turned somewhat outward due to the separation of their pelvic bones.\n\n【21】### Long-term complications\n\n【22】People born with bladder exstrophy can go on to have normal sexual function, including the ability to have children. However, pregnancy will be high risk for both mother and baby, and a planned cesarean birth may be needed.\n\n【23】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The prevalence rates of childhood health outcomes were determined using _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision_ codes. Socioeconomic status was measured using the HOUsing-based SocioEconomic Status index (HOUSES), derived from real property data. Adjusting for age and sex, logistic regression models were used to examine the relationships among HOUSES, race/ethnicity, and prevalence of childhood health outcomes considering an interaction between HOUSES and race/ethnicity. Odds ratios were calculated using the lowest SES quartile and non-Hispanic white participants as the reference groups.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 31,523 eligible children, 51% were male and 86% were of non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity. Overall, lower SES was associated with higher prevalence of bronchiolitis, urinary tract infection, asthma, mood disorder, and accidents/adverse childhood experiences (physical and sexual abuse) in a dose-response manner ( _P_ <.04). Prevalence rates of all childhood conditions considered except for epilepsy were significantly different across races/ethnicities ( _P_ <.002). Racial/ethnic disparities for asthma and mood disorder were greater with higher SES.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Significant health disparities are present in a predominantly affluent, non-Hispanic white, mixed rural-urban community. Socioeconomic status modifies disparities by race/ethnicity in clinically less overt conditions. Interpretation of future health disparity research should account for the nature of disease.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】HOUSES ( HOUsing-based SocioEconomic Status index ), ICD-9 ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ), IQR ( interquartile range ), OR ( odds ratio ), REP ( Rochester Epidemiology Project ), SES ( socioeconomic status ), UTI ( urinary tract infection )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Results were classified as normal motility, ineffective esophageal motility, or aperistalsis.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Twenty-three patients were studied, 13 with carcinoma and 10 with Barrett esophagus. Overall, 11 patients (48%) had normal motility, 6 (26%) had ineffective esophageal motility, and 6 (26%) had aperistalsis. Five patients with aperistalsis had carcinoma. Follow-up tracings after photodynamic therapy found that 6 patients (26%) had normal motility, 7 (30%) had ineffective esophageal motility, and 10 (43%) had aperistalsis.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Esophageal dysmotility is common in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma or Barrett esophagus. Photodynamic therapy may worsen esophageal motility in some patients. Dysphagia after photodynamic therapy therefore may be related to underlying esophageal dysmotility and may not always be caused by stricture or underlying carcinoma.\n\n【8】IEM ( ineffective esophageal motility ), LES ( lower esophageal sphincter ), PDT ( photodynamic therapy )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Phosphocol P-32\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Chromic phosphate P 32 is a radiopharmaceutical. Radiopharmaceuticals are agents used to diagnose certain medical problems or treat certain diseases.\n\n【6】Chromic phosphate P 32 is used to treat cancer or related problems. It is put by catheter into the pleura (sac that contains the lungs) or into the peritoneum (sac that contains the liver, stomach, and intestines) to treat the leaking of fluid inside these areas that is caused by cancer. It may also be given by injection to treat cancer in certain organs such as the ovaries and prostate.\n\n【7】Chromic phosphate P 32 is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor with specialized training in nuclear medicine.\n\n【8】Before Using\n------------\n\n【9】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【10】### Allergies\n\n【11】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of chromic phosphate P 32 in the elderly with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.\n\n【16】### Drug Interactions\n\n【17】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【18】### Other Interactions\n\n【19】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【20】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【21】### Dosing\n\n【22】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【23】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.

With the development and progression of heart failure, left ventricular (LV) myocardial remodeling occurs. The progression of LV remodeling is accompanied by alterations in the structure and function of the ECM that occur after injury resulting from neurohormonal activation, changes in LV loading conditions, and alterations in myocardial perfusion and metabolism and is secondary to a host of nonmyocyte signaling pathways that affect repair and remodeling of the myocardium as a whole. This article attempts to review some of these processes and their interactions and to provide a focus to the often overlooked contribution of the ECM to the development and progression of heart failure and thereby its potential role as a target for therapy for heart failure.\n\n【1】ACE ( angiotensin-converting enzyme ), ECM ( extracellular matrix ), ET ( endothelin ), LV ( left ventricular ), MMP ( matrix metalloproteinase ), RALES ( Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study ), TGF ( transforming growth factor ), TIMP ( tissue inhibitors of MMP ), TNF ( tumor necrosis factor )\n\n【2】**H** eart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and other developed countries. In recent years, a greater understanding of the cellular mechanisms of heart failure has led to new insight into its medical management. In heart failure, increased mechanical stress and the influence of circulating and myocardial neurohormones and cytokines result in alterations in the architecture of the myocardium, a collective process known as _myocardial remodeling_ . This process involves 2 primary responses at the cellular level: (1) hypertrophy, dysfunction, and death of cardiac myocytes and (2) increased deposition and alteration of the cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM), often described by the oversimplified term _myocardial fibrosis_ .\n\n【3】Until recently, the study of the cellular and molecular biology of heart failure centered almost exclusively on the first of these responses, myocyte dysfunction. The cardiac ECM was believed to function as a relatively inert, supportive scaffold for the myocytes and blood vessels of the heart. However, it has now become increasingly clear that the cardiac ECM is a dynamic, metabolically active entity that plays an independent and important role in the progression of heart failure. Advances in molecular biology have led to an increased understanding of critical signals responsible for myocardial remodeling and potential therapeutic targets involving the interruption of these signals. Therapy for heart failure tailored toward prevention of myocardial fibrosis and remodeling is likely to ameliorate the symptoms and complications of heart failure by preserving ventricular structural integrity, systolic and diastolic function of the heart, and the cardiac conduction system. The future of medical therapy for heart failure will need to address the often ignored role of the ECM in elucidating the respective roles of the multiple extramyocyte molecular signals responsible for detrimental myocardial remodeling and then pursue the study of favorable selective pharmacological blockers of these detrimental signaling pathways.\n\n【4】The term _fibrosis_ as commonly used in discussion of the development and progression of heart failure is a general and sometimes misleading term. It may suggest a passive random process that occurs in a nonspecific fashion as a result of any type of cardiac injury. This is not the case; the process of myocardial matrix remodeling (perhaps a better term than fibrosis) is an active process\n\n【5】无关删除-2:<u>*   Weber KT</u>\n\n【6】From inflammation to fibrosis: a stiff stretch of highway \\[editorial\\].\n\n【7】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Hypertension._ 2004; 43 : 716-719</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (90)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【9】that occurs in very different ways in different etiologies of heart failure. Post-myocardial infarction collagen degradation and accumulation are regulated differently in the infarct and noninfarct zones. In dilated cardiomyopathy, there are areas in which the normal ECM is replaced with a region of dysfunctional collagen matrix, whereas other areas maintain a normal matrix. In left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy due to hypertension, there can be a uniform increase in the normal collagen matrix. In some of these states of heart failure, the myocytes may retain fairly normal function.\n\n【10】NORMAL CARDIAC EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX AND THE FIBROBLAST\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The myocardium is composed of cardiac myocytes enveloped in a dense extracellular network of collagen, the main structural protein.

At a cellular and molecular level, the focus of therapy for heart failure must increasingly include the adverse changes in the ECM and the cardiac myocyte. During the past decades, the main advances in medical management of heart failure have involved the blockade of the neurohormonal effects of angiotensin II, catecholamines, and aldosterone. The molecular stimuli for adverse interstitial myocardial remodeling also needs further study. The prevention of myocardial ECM remodeling likely reduces morbidity and mortality in heart failure by several mechanisms. Among these are reduction in ventricular arrhythmias, preservation in systolic function, and preservation of diastolic function of the heart. The emergence of multiple, clinically proven medical therapies with independent, additive benefits seems to mandate a polypharmaceutical approach to the treatment of heart failure. However, as more therapies emerge, the uniform treatment of patients with multiple classes of medications is quickly becoming impractical and costly. Future clinical trials will need to focus on tailoring therapy for heart failure to reduce adverse myocardial remodeling in individual patients. It is in this context that a better understanding of the role and evaluation of the ECM, such as with biomarkers of cardiac collagen synthesis and other signaling processes, may eventually become an integral part of heart failure management in the individual patient. The “one-size-fits-all” approach to heart failure management must and will give way to a tailored approach for each patient based on specific patient and disease factors and also on the information provided by a combination of potential biomarkers of the myocardial nonmyocyte milieu of the ECM. These biomarkers should reflect specific adverse biochemical pathways responsible for the deleterious changes of chronic heart failure and reflect not only changes affecting the cardiomyocytes but also changes in the myocardial ECM. A closer look between the cardiac myocytes will help us better understand and manage heart failure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Demographic characteristics, patient diagnosis, and laboratory parameters were recorded.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】There were 177 COMS orders for 147 patients. The median patient age was 44.9 years (range, 0.9-88.0 years). Common reasons for ordering COMS included monitoring and diagnosis of C3 glomerulopathy and renal dysfunction and differentiation of aHUS from other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). Forty-four patients had COMS ordered for TMAs: 8 had aHUS and all had 1 or more abnormalities within the alternative pathway of complement. Although the sensitivity of this finding for the diagnosis of aHUS is 100%, the specificity is only 28%, with a positive likelihood ratio of 1.39. Patients with aHUS had lower CH50, C3, and CFB than did those with secondary non-aHUS TMA (all _P_ <.01). A combined CFB of 20.9 mg/dL or less and CH50 of 56% or less led to sensitivity of 75% with increased specificity of 88.9% and a diagnostic odds ratio of 24.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】A COMS abnormality should not be interpreted in isolation.

{"seq_id": "45f07cb7-0aad-4460-a031-b127e5183c6d", "title": "Wet macular degeneration", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Wet macular degeneration is a long-lasting eye disorder that causes blurred vision or a blind spot in the central vision. It's usually caused by blood vessels that leak fluid or blood into the macula (MAK-u-luh). The macula is the part of the retina that gives the eye clear vision in the direct line of sight.\n\n【2】Wet macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. The other type, dry macular degeneration, is more common and less severe. The wet type always begins as the dry type.\n\n【3】Early detection and treatment of wet macular degeneration may help reduce vision loss. In some instances, early treatment may recover vision.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Wet macular degeneration symptoms usually appear suddenly and worsen quickly. They may include:\n\n【6】*   Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent.\n*   Reduced central vision in one or both eyes.\n*   The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work.\n*   Difficulty adjusting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater.\n*   Increased blurriness of printed words.\n*   Difficulty recognizing faces.\n*   A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision.\n\n【7】Macular degeneration doesn't affect side vision, so it doesn't cause total blindness.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】See your eye doctor if:\n\n【10】*   You notice changes in your central vision.\n*   You lose the ability to see fine detail.\n\n【11】These changes may be the first indication of macular degeneration, particularly if you're older than age 60.\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】No one knows the exact cause of wet macular degeneration, but it develops in people who have dry macular degeneration. Of all people with age-related macular degeneration, about 20% have the wet form.\n\n【14】Wet macular degeneration can develop in different ways:\n\n【15】*   **Vision loss caused by irregular blood vessel growth.** Sometimes irregular new blood vessels grow from the choroid under and into the macula. This is known as choroidal neovascularization. The choroid is the layer of blood vessels between the retina and the outer, firm coat of the eye, called the sclera. These blood vessels may leak fluid or blood, affecting the retina's function.\n*   **Vision loss caused by fluid buildup in the back of the eye.** When fluid leaks from the choroid, it can collect between the thin cell layer called the retinal pigment epithelium and the retina or within the layers of the retina. This may cause irregularities in the macula layers, resulting in vision loss or distortion.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】Factors that may increase your risk of macular degeneration include:\n\n【18】*   **Age.** This disease is most common in people over 55.\n*   **Family history and genetics.** This disease has a genetic component. Researchers have identified several genes linked to the condition.\n*   **Race.** Macular degeneration is more common in white people.\n*   **Smoking.** Smoking cigarettes or being regularly exposed to tobacco smoke greatly increases your risk of macular degeneration.\n*   **Obesity.** Research indicates that being obese increases the chance that early or intermediate macular degeneration will progress to a more severe form of the disease.\n*   **Cardiovascular disease.** If you have diseases that affect your heart and blood vessels, you may be at higher risk of macular degeneration.\n\n【19】Complications\n-------------\n\n【20】People whose wet macular degeneration has progressed to central vision loss have a higher risk of depression and social isolation. With profound loss of vision, people may see visual hallucinations. This condition is known as Charles Bonnet syndrome.\n\n【21】Prevention\n----------\n\n【22】It's important to have routine eye exams to identify early signs of macular degeneration. The following measures may help reduce your risk of developing wet macular degeneration:\n\n【23】*   **Manage all other medical conditions.** For example, if you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, take your medicine and follow your health care provider's instructions for controlling the condition.\n*   **Don't smoke.** Smokers are more likely to develop macular degeneration than nonsmokers. Ask your provider for help stopping smoking.\n*   **Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly.** If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day.\n*   **Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.** These foods contain antioxidant vitamins that reduce your risk of developing macular degeneration.\n*   **Include fish in your diet.** Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, may reduce the risk of macular degeneration. Nuts such as walnuts also contain omega-3 fatty acids.\n\n【24】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Benzodiazepines belong to the group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) depressants, which are medicines that slow down the nervous system. Clidinium is an anticholinergic agent. It reduces stomach acid and decreases bowel spasms.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Capsule\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have serious unwanted effects (eg, severe drowsiness, confusion, clumsiness, or unsteadiness), which may require caution in patients receiving this medicine.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【44】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.

Other changes may be more unusual and extreme, such as confusion, worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts, and unusual excitement, nervousness, or irritability.\n\n【60】Do not suddenly stop taking this medicine without checking first with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely.

The first cohort, consisting of 1998 patients with AL seen at Mayo Clinic between January 1977 and August 2006, was used to examine the trends in overall survival (OS) from diagnosis during this 30-year period. The second cohort, consisting of 313 patients seen between September 2006 and August 2009, was used to validate a model for predicting early mortality.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】The 4-year OS from diagnosis improved during each decade of follow-up: 21%, 24%, and 33%, respectively, for the periods 1977-1986, 1987-1996, and 1997-2006 ( _P_ <.001). Within the last group (1997-2006), 4-year OS during 1997-1999, 2000-2002, and 2003-2006 was 28%, 30%, and 42%, respectively ( _P_ \\=.02). However, the 1-year mortality remained high during the 30-year period. A risk stratification score using cardiac troponin T, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide, and uric acid identified patients at risk of early mortality. The 1-year mortality with 0, 1, 2, or 3 risk factors was 19%, 37%, 61%, and 80%, respectively, in this training cohort of 459 patients. This was confirmed in a validation cohort of 313 patients.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Survival in AL has improved over time, with maximum improvement occurring in the past decade.

The CRP, Lp(a), and homocysteine levels were log transformed to reduce skewness. Multivariable regression analyses were used to assess whether a novel risk factor was associated with ABI after adjustment for conventional risk factors and whether ethnicity was associated with PAD (ABI, ≤0.95) after adjustment for conventional and novel risk factors.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of 2229 study participants, the ABI was determined in 1395 African American participants (mean ± SD age, 63±9 years; 71% women) and 834 white participants (mean ± SD age, 58±9 years; 62% women) who belonged to hypertensive sibships. The mean ABI was lower in African American than in white individuals (0.99±0.1 vs 1.13±0.1; _P_ <.001). In both ethnic groups, higher levels of CRP, fibrinogen, and homocysteine were each associated with a lower ABI after adjustment for conventional risk factors. In African American participants, the Lp(a) level was also significantly associated with the ABI. African American ethnicity was associated with the presence of PAD after adjustment for conventional risk factors (men: odds ratio \\[OR\\], 3.04; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.80-5.15; women: OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.85-4.29), but the risk was significantly attenuated after additional adjustment for novel risk factors (men: OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.21-3.70; women: OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.26-3.11).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Novel risk factors are associated with interindividual variation in ABI in African American and non-Hispanic white populations and partly account for the increased risk of PAD associated with African American ethnicity.\n\n【8】ABI ( ankle brachial index ), BMI ( body mass index ), BP ( blood pressure ), CHD ( coronary heart disease ), CI ( confidence interval ), CRP ( C-reactive protein ), DBP ( diastolic blood pressure ), GENOA ( Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy ), HDL-C ( high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), Lp(a) ( lipoprotein(a) ), OR ( odds ratio ), PAD ( peripheral arterial disease ), SBP ( systolic blood pressure )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

The bacterium is usually harmless in healthy adults. In newborns, however, it can cause a serious illness known as group B strep disease.\n\n【2】Group B strep can also cause dangerous infections in adults with certain chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes or liver disease. Older adults are at increased risk of illness due to group B strep, too.\n\n【3】If you're a healthy adult, there's nothing you need to do about group B strep. If you're pregnant, get a group B strep screening test during your third trimester. If you have group B strep, antibiotic treatment during labor can protect your baby.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】### Infants\n\n【6】Most babies born to women carrying group B strep are healthy. But the few who are infected by group B strep during labor can become critically ill.\n\n【7】In infants, illness caused by group B strep can be within six hours of birth (early onset) — or weeks or months after birth (late onset).\n\n【8】Signs and symptoms might include:\n\n【9】*   Fever\n*   Low body temperature\n*   Difficulty feeding\n*   Sluggishness, limpness or weak muscle tone\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Irritability\n*   Jitteriness\n*   Seizures\n*   Rash\n*   Jaundice\n\n【10】### Adults\n\n【11】Many adults carry group B strep in their bodies — usually in the bowel, vagina, rectum, bladder or throat — and have no signs or symptoms.\n\n【12】In some cases, however, group B strep can cause a urinary tract infection or other more-serious infections. Signs and symptoms of infections that may be caused by group B strep include the following.\n\n【13】Urinary tract infection\n\n【14】*   A strong, persistent urge to urinate\n*   A burning sensation or pain when urinating\n*   Passing frequent, small amounts of urine\n*   Urine that appears red, bright pink or cola colored — a sign of blood in the urine\n*   Pelvic pain\n\n【15】Blood infection (bacteremia)\n\n【16】*   Fever\n*   Chills\n*   Confusion or lack of alertness\n\n【17】Pneumonia\n\n【18】*   Fever\n*   Chills\n*   Cough\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Chest pain when you breathe or cough\n\n【19】Skin or soft-tissue infection\n\n【20】*   Swelling, warmth or redness in the area of the infection\n*   Pain in the area of the infection\n*   Lesions with pus or drainage\n\n【21】Bone or joint infection\n\n【22】*   Fever\n*   Chills\n*   Swelling, warmth or redness over the area of the infection\n*   Pain in the area of the infection\n*   Stiffness or inability to use a limb or joint\n\n【23】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【24】If you have signs or symptoms of group B strep infection — particularly if you're pregnant, you have a chronic medical condition or you're older than 65 — contact your doctor right away.\n\n【25】If you notice your infant has signs or symptoms of group B strep disease, contact your baby's doctor immediately.\n\n【26】Causes\n------\n\n【27】Many healthy people carry group B strep bacteria in their bodies. You might carry the bacteria in your body for a short time — it can come and go — or you might always have it. Group B strep bacteria aren't sexually transmitted, and they're not spread through food or water. How the bacteria are spread to anyone other than newborns isn't known.\n\n【28】Group B strep can spread to a baby during a vaginal delivery if the baby is exposed to — or swallows — fluids containing group B strep.\n\n【29】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【30】### Infants\n\n【31】An infant is at increased risk of developing group B strep disease if:\n\n【32】*   The mother carries group B strep in her body\n*   The baby is born prematurely (earlier than 37 weeks)\n*   The mother's water breaks 18 hours or more before delivery\n*   The mother has an infection of the placental tissues and amniotic fluid (chorioamnionitis)\n*   The mother has a urinary tract infection during the pregnancy\n*   The mother's temperature is greater than 100.4 F (38 C) during labor\n*   The mother previously delivered an infant with group B strep disease\n\n【33】### Adults\n\n【34】Adults age 65 and older are at increased risk of group B strep. You're also at increased risk of if you have a condition that impairs your immune system or other serious diseases, including the following:\n\n【35】*   Diabetes\n*   HIV infection\n*   Liver disease\n*   Heart disease\n*   Cancer or history of cancer\n\n【36】Complications\n-------------\n\n【37】Group B strep infection can lead to life-threatening disease in infants, including:\n\n【38】*   Pneumonia\n*   Inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis)\n*   Infection in the bloodstream (bacteremia)\n\n【39】If you're pregnant, group B strep can cause the following:\n\n【40】*   Urinary tract infection\n*   Infection of the placenta and amniotic fluid (chorioamnionitis)\n*   Infection of the membrane lining the uterus (endometritis)\n*   Bacteremia\n\n【41】If you're an older adult or you have a chronic health condition, group B strep bacteria can lead to any of the following conditions:\n\n【42】*   Skin infection\n*   Bacteremia\n*   Urinary tract infection\n*   Pneumonia\n*   Bone and joint infections\n*   Infection of the heart valves (endocarditis)\n*   Meningitis\n\n【43】Prevention\n----------\n\n【44】If you're pregnant, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends a group B strep screening during weeks 36 to 37 of pregnancy. Your doctor will take swab samples from your vagina and rectum and send them to a lab for testing.\n\n【45】A positive test indicates that you carry group B strep. It doesn't mean that you're ill or that your baby will be affected, but that you're at increased risk of passing the bacteria to your baby.\n\n【46】To prevent group B bacteria from spreading to your baby during labor or delivery, your doctor can give you an IV antibiotic — usually penicillin or a related drug — when labor begins.\n\n【47】If you're allergic to penicillin or related drugs, you might receive clindamycin or vancomycin as an alternative. Because the effectiveness of these alternatives is not well understood, your baby will be monitored for up to 48 hours.\n\n【48】Taking oral antibiotics ahead of time won't help because the bacteria can return before labor begins.\n\n【49】Antibiotic treatment during labor is also recommended if you:\n\n【50】*   Have a urinary tract infection\n*   Delivered a previous baby with group B strep disease\n*   Develop a fever during labor\n*   Haven't delivered your baby within 18 hours of your water breaking\n*   Go into labor before 37 weeks and haven't been tested for group B strep\n\n【51】### Vaccine in development\n\n【52】Although it's not available yet, researchers are working on a group B strep vaccine that could help prevent group B strep infections in the future.\n\n【53】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

He worked out and described in detail a new and fruitful systematic approach to synthetic chemistry. He has synthesized more than 100 substances, including ginkgolide B (a compound extracted from the ginkgo tree and used experimentally to treat asthma) and prostaglandins (hormonelike compounds used to induce labor and treat infertility).\n\n【2】William James Corey was born on July 12, 1928, in Methuen, an industrial town in northeastern Massachusetts, about 30 miles north of Boston. His father, Elias Corey, a businessman, died 18 months later, and his wife changed her son’s name from “William” to “Elias.” He attended the Saint Laurence O’Toole Elementary School in Lawrence (near Methuen) and graduated from Lawrence Public High School at age 16 years in 1945. He then entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, from which he received a BS degree in 1948 and a PhD degree in 1951.\n\n【3】After receiving his doctorate, Corey became a lecturer in chemistry at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, where he taught from 1951 to 1959, becoming an assistant professor in 1953 and a full professor in 1956. From 1955 to 1957, he was a Sloan Foundation Fellow and became a Guggenheim Fellow in 1957.\n\n【4】Corey left the University of Illinois in 1959 to become professor of chemistry at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1967, he was appointed the Sheldon Emory Professor and became a Guggenheim Fellow (1968-1969). While at Harvard University, he synthesized about 100 molecules that previously were found only in nature. From 1965 to 1968, he served as chairman of the chemistry department at Harvard University.\n\n【5】Corey has written more than 700 papers on chemical subjects. In his first papers, published in the late 1960s, he described a broad, methodical approach that he called “retrosynthetic analysis.” Before Corey’s method became standard practice, most organic chemists used an ad hoc approach to synthesis. To make complex natural molecules, they first identified a smaller, simpler molecular within its structure that could be made easily or that was already available. Second, they tried to manipulate this simple molecule to generate the more complex target molecule. This method involved considerable trial and error.\n\n【6】In Corey’s method, chemists start with the target molecule and work backward, carefully analyzing its structure and dissecting it piece by piece. By systematically breaking key chemical bonds that join the major components of the target molecule, they ultimately arrive at a set of simple precursors. These precursors can be reassembled into the target molecule in the least possible number of steps using the simplest possible reactions, thereby making the synthesis faster, cheaper, and more efficient. Corey described his method of retrosynthetic analysis in _The Logic of Chemical Synthesis_ , published in 1989.\n\n【7】Elias James Corey has received many awards and honors, including honorary degrees, in addition to the Nobel Prize. In 2001, the islands of Antigua and Barbuda issued a stamp in his honor (Scott No. 2518e).\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【10】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.01.024</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>© 2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

{"seq_id": "ca7d87c7-ab50-40be-a8ef-a6201adccbd4", "title": "Deep brain stimulation", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Deep brain stimulation (DBS) involves implanting electrodes within certain areas of the brain. These electrodes produce electrical impulses that regulate abnormal impulses. Or the electrical impulses can affect certain cells and chemicals within the brain.\n\n【2】The amount of stimulation in deep brain stimulation is controlled by a pacemaker-like device placed under the skin in your upper chest. A wire that travels under your skin connects this device to the electrodes in your brain.\n\n【3】Deep brain stimulation is commonly used to treat a number of conditions, such as:\n\n【4】*   Parkinson's disease\n*   Essential tremor\n*   Dystonia\n*   Epilepsy\n*   Obsessive-compulsive disorder\n\n【5】Deep brain stimulation is also being studied as a potential treatment for:\n\n【6】*   Tourette syndrome\n*   Huntington's disease and chorea\n*   Chronic pain\n*   Cluster headache\n\n【7】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【8】Deep brain stimulation is an established treatment for people with movement disorders, such as essential tremor, Parkinson's disease and dystonia, and psychiatric conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. It's also approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration to reduce seizures in difficult-to-treat epilepsy.\n\n【9】This treatment is reserved for people whose symptoms aren't controlled with medications.\n\n【10】Risks\n-----\n\n【11】Although deep brain stimulation is generally considered to be low risk, any type of surgery has the risk of complications. Also, the brain stimulation itself can cause side effects.\n\n【12】### Surgery risks\n\n【13】Deep brain stimulation involves creating small holes in the skull to implant the electrodes into the brain tissue as well as performing surgery to implant the device that contains the batteries under the skin in the chest. Complications of surgery may include:\n\n【14】*   Misplacement of leads\n*   Bleeding in the brain\n*   Stroke\n*   Infection\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Nausea\n*   Heart problems\n*   Seizure\n\n【15】### Possible side effects after surgery\n\n【16】Side effects associated with deep brain stimulation may include:\n\n【17】*   Seizure\n*   Infection\n*   Headache\n*   Confusion\n*   Difficulty concentrating\n*   Stroke\n*   Hardware complications, such as an eroded lead wire\n*   Temporary pain and swelling at the implantation site\n\n【18】A few weeks after the surgery, the device will be turned on and the process of finding the best settings for you begins. Some settings may cause side effects, but these often improve with further adjustments of your device.\n\n【19】Because there have been infrequent reports that the DBS therapy affects the movements needed for swimming, the Food and Drug Administration recommends consulting with your doctor and taking water safety precautions before swimming.\n\n【20】### Possible side effects of stimulation\n\n【21】*   Numbness or tingling sensations\n*   Muscle tightness of the face or arm\n*   Speech problems\n*   Balance problems\n*   Lightheadedness\n*   Vision problems, such as double vision\n*   Unwanted mood changes, such as anger and depression\n\n【22】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【23】### First, weigh the pros and cons\n\n【24】Deep brain stimulation is a serious and potentially risky procedure. Even if you might be eligible for deep brain stimulation, you and your doctors must carefully weigh the risks and potential benefits of the procedure.\n\n【25】### Next, prepare for surgery\n\n【26】Before surgery, you'll likely need medical tests to make sure that deep brain stimulation is a safe and appropriate option for you. You may also need brain-imaging studies, such as an MRI, before the surgery. These studies help to map the areas of your brain that will have the electrodes implanted.\n\n【27】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【28】### During the surgery\n\n【29】In general, here's how surgery for deep brain stimulation works:\n\n【30】*   **Brain surgery.** For the brain surgery portion, your care team fits you with a special head frame to keep your head still during the procedure (stereotactic head frame). Then, team members use neuroimaging (brain MRI or CT) to map your brain and identify the area in your brain where they'll place the electrodes.\n\n【31】    In most cases, the electrodes will be placed while you're awake and alert. This is to be sure the effects of stimulation can be tested fully. If you're awake for surgery, you'll be given a local anesthetic to numb your scalp before the procedure, but you won't need an anesthetic in your brain itself because the brain has no pain receptors. In some cases, surgery can be done under general anesthesia so that you'll be unconscious.\n\n【32】    Your surgeon implants a thin wire lead with a number of contacts (electrodes) at the tips into a specific area of your brain. Or one lead is implanted into each side of the brain (for a total of two leads). A wire runs under your skin to a pulse generator (neurostimulator) implanted near your collarbone.\n\n【33】    During surgery, both the neurologist and the surgeon carefully monitor your brain to help ensure correct electrode placement.\n\n【34】*   **Chest wall surgery.** During the second portion of the surgery, the surgeon implants the part of the device that contains the batteries (pulse generator) under the skin in your chest, near your collarbone.\n\n【35】    General anesthesia is used during this procedure. Wires from the brain electrodes are placed under your skin and guided down to the battery-operated pulse generator.\n\n【36】    The generator is programmed to send continuous electrical pulses to your brain. You control the generator, and you can turn it on or off using a special remote control.\n\n【37】### After the procedure\n\n【38】A few weeks after surgery, the pulse generator in your chest is activated in your doctor's office. The doctor can easily program your pulse generator from outside your body using a special remote control. The amount of stimulation is customized to your condition, and may take as long as four to six months to find the optimal setting.\n\n【39】Stimulation may be constant, 24 hours a day, or your doctor may advise you to turn your pulse generator off at night and back on in the morning, depending on your condition. You can turn stimulation on and off with a special remote control that you'll take home with you. In some cases, your doctor may program the pulse generator to let you make minor adjustments at home.\n\n【40】The battery life of your generator varies with usage and settings. When the battery needs to be replaced, your surgeon will replace the generator during an outpatient procedure.\n\n【41】Results\n-------\n\n【42】Deep brain stimulation won't cure your disease, but it may help lessen your symptoms. If deep brain stimulation works, your symptoms will improve significantly, but they usually don't go away completely. In some cases, medications may still be needed for certain conditions.\n\n【43】Deep brain stimulation isn't successful for everyone. There are a number of variables involved in the success of deep brain stimulation. It's important to talk with your doctor before surgery about what type of improvement you can expect for your condition.\n\n【44】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "39234805-a180-46c5-af9f-6f1b659a2e2a", "title": "Anaphylaxis", "text": "【0】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【1】Anaphylaxis symptoms usually occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen. Sometimes, however, anaphylaxis can occur a half-hour or longer after exposure. In rare cases, anaphylaxis may be delayed for hours. Signs and symptoms include:\n\n【2】*   Skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin\n*   Low blood pressure (hypotension)\n*   Constriction of the airways and a swollen tongue or throat, which can cause wheezing and trouble breathing\n*   A weak and rapid pulse\n*   Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea\n*   Dizziness or fainting\n\n【3】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【4】**Seek emergency medical help** if you, your child or someone else you're with has a severe allergic reaction. Don't wait to see if the symptoms go away.\n\n【5】If you have an attack and you carry an epinephrine autoinjector, administer it right away. Even if symptoms improve after the injection, you still need to go to an emergency room to make sure symptoms don't recur, even without more exposure to the allergen. This second reaction is called biphasic anaphylaxis.\n\n【6】**Make an appointment to see your provider** if you or your child has had a severe allergy attack or signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis in the past.\n\n【7】The diagnosis and long-term management of anaphylaxis are complicated, so you'll probably need to see a doctor who specializes in allergies and immunology.\n\n【8】Causes\n------\n\n【9】The immune system produces antibodies that defend against foreign substances. This is good when a foreign substance is harmful, such as certain bacteria or viruses. But some people's immune systems overreact to substances that don't normally cause an allergic reaction.\n\n【10】Allergy symptoms aren't usually life-threatening, but a severe allergic reaction can lead to anaphylaxis. Even if you or your child has had only a mild anaphylactic reaction in the past, there's a risk of more severe anaphylaxis after another exposure to the allergy-causing substance.\n\n【11】The most common anaphylaxis triggers in children are food allergies, such as to peanuts and tree nuts, fish, shellfish, wheat, soy, sesame and milk. Besides allergy to peanuts, nuts, fish, sesame and shellfish, anaphylaxis triggers in adults include:\n\n【12】*   Certain medications, including antibiotics, aspirin and other pain relievers available without a prescription, and the intravenous (IV) contrast used in some imaging tests\n*   Stings from bees, yellow jackets, wasps, hornets and fire ants\n*   Latex\n\n【13】Although not common, some people develop anaphylaxis from aerobic exercise, such as jogging, or even less intense physical activity, such as walking. Eating certain foods before exercise or exercising when the weather is hot, cold or humid also have been linked to anaphylaxis in some people. Talk with your health care provider about precautions to take when exercising.\n\n【14】If you don't know what triggers an allergy attack, certain tests can help identify the allergen. In some cases, the cause of anaphylaxis is not identified (idiopathic anaphylaxis).\n\n【15】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【16】There aren't many known risk factors for anaphylaxis, but some things that might increase the risk include:\n\n【17】*   **Previous anaphylaxis.** If you've had anaphylaxis once, your risk of having this serious reaction increases. Future reactions might be more severe than the first reaction.\n*   **Allergies or asthma.** People who have either condition are at increased risk of having anaphylaxis.\n*   **Certain other conditions.** These include heart disease and an irregular accumulation of a certain type of white blood cell (mastocytosis).\n\n【18】Complications\n-------------\n\n【19】An anaphylactic reaction can be life-threatening — it can stop your breathing or your heartbeat.\n\n【20】Prevention\n----------\n\n【21】The best way to prevent anaphylaxis is to stay away from substances that cause this severe reaction. Also:\n\n【22】*   **Wear a medical alert necklace or bracelet** to indicate you have an allergy to specific drugs or other substances.\n*   **Keep an emergency kit with prescribed medications available** at all times. Your provider can advise you on the contents. If you have an epinephrine autoinjector, check the expiration date and be sure to refill the prescription before it expires.\n*   **Be sure to alert all your providers** to medication reactions you've had.\n*   **If you're allergic to stinging insects, use caution around them.** Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants; don't walk barefoot on grass; don't wear bright colors; don't wear perfumes, colognes or scented lotions; and don't drink from open soda cans outdoors. Stay calm when near a stinging insect. Move away slowly and don't slap at the insect.\n*   **If you have food allergies, carefully read the labels** of all the foods you buy and eat. Manufacturing processes can change, so it's important to periodically recheck the labels of foods you commonly eat.\n\n【23】    When eating out, ask how each dish is prepared, and find out what ingredients it contains. Even small amounts of food you're allergic to can cause a serious reaction.\n\n【24】### Be prepared\n\n【25】Even if you're careful, at some point you'll likely be exposed to what you're allergic to. Fortunately, you can respond quickly and effectively to an allergy emergency by knowing the signs and symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction and having a plan to quickly treat those symptoms.\n\n【26】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

During a median follow-up of 6.5 years (interquartile range, 4.3 to 7.9 years), ischemic strokes, major bleeding, adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality were recorded. From 2007 to 2016, data on average temperature and PM <sub>10 </sub> were compared with clinical outcomes.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The study group included 1361 patients (663 \\[48.7%\\] male; median age, 76 years \\[interquartile range, 71 to 81 years\\]). High PM <sub>10 </sub> and low temperatures were associated with higher risk of major bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio \\[aHR\\], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.70 and aHR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.05, respectively) and mortality (aHR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.69 and aHR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.06, respectively); PM <sub>10 </sub> was also associated with ischemic stroke and temperature with cardiovascular events. The relative risk (RR) for cardiovascular events and mortality increased in months in the lower quartile of temperature (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.21 and RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.74, respectively). Comparing seasons, there were higher risks of cardiovascular events in spring, autumn, and winter than in summer, whereas the risk of mortality increased only in winter.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In patients with AF taking VKAs, high PM <sub>10 </sub> and low temperature were associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke and cardiovascular events, respectively. Both factors increased major bleeding and mortality risks, which were higher during colder months and seasons.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AF ( atrial fibrillation ), aHR ( adjusted hazard ratio ), CHA2DS2-VASc ( congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes, stroke, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, sex ), HAS-BLED ( hypertension, abnormal renal and/or liver function, stroke, bleeding, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs or alcohol ), HR ( hazard ratio ), IQR ( interquartile range ), IRR ( incidence rate ratio ), OAC ( oral anticoagulation ), PM ( particulate matter ), PM2.5 ( PM with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm ), PM10 ( PM with an aerodynamic diameter <10 μm ), RR ( relative risk ), sHR ( subhazard ratio ), VKA ( vitamin K antagonist )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "953c564a-b1ac-433e-ab15-18768501913c", "title": "Glaucoma", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve. The optic nerve sends visual information from your eye to your brain and is vital for good vision. Damage to the optic nerve is often related to high pressure in your eye. But glaucoma can happen even with normal eye pressure.\n\n【2】Glaucoma can occur at any age but is more common in older adults. It is one of the leading causes of blindness for people over the age of 60.\n\n【3】Many forms of glaucoma have no warning signs. The effect is so gradual that you may not notice a change in vision until the condition is in its later stages.\n\n【4】It's important to have regular eye exams that include measurements of your eye pressure. If glaucoma is recognized early, vision loss can be slowed or prevented. If you have glaucoma, you'll need treatment or monitoring for the rest of your life.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】The symptoms of glaucoma depend on the type and stage of your condition.\n\n【7】### Open-angle glaucoma\n\n【8】*   No symptoms in early stages\n*   Gradually, patchy blind spots in your side vision. Side vision also is known as peripheral vision\n*   In later stages, difficulty seeing things in your central vision\n\n【9】### Acute angle-closure glaucoma\n\n【10】*   Severe headache\n*   Severe eye pain\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Blurred vision\n*   Halos or colored rings around lights\n*   Eye redness\n\n【11】### Normal-tension glaucoma\n\n【12】*   No symptoms in early stages\n*   Gradually, blurred vision\n*   In later stages, loss of side vision\n\n【13】### Glaucoma in children\n\n【14】*   A dull or cloudy eye (infants)\n*   Increased blinking (infants)\n*   Tears without crying (infants)\n*   Blurred vision\n*   Nearsightedness that gets worse\n*   Headache\n\n【15】### Pigmentary glaucoma\n\n【16】*   Halos around lights\n*   Blurred vision with exercise\n*   Gradual loss of side vision\n\n【17】### When to see a doctor\n\n【18】If you experience symptoms that come on suddenly, you may have acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include severe headache and severe eye pain. You need treatment as soon as possible. Go to an emergency room or call an eye doctor's (ophthalmologist's) office immediately.\n\n【19】Causes\n------\n\n【20】Glaucoma develops when the optic nerve becomes damaged. As this nerve gradually deteriorates, blind spots develop in your vision. For reasons that doctors don't fully understand, this nerve damage is usually related to increased pressure in the eye.\n\n【21】Elevated eye pressure happens as the result of a buildup of fluid that flows throughout the inside of the eye. This fluid also is known as the aqueous humor. It usually drains through a tissue located at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. This tissue also is called the trabecular meshwork. The cornea is important to vision because it lets light into the eye. When the eye makes too much fluid or the drainage system doesn't work properly, eye pressure may increase.\n\n【22】### Open-angle glaucoma\n\n【23】This is the most common form of glaucoma. The drainage angle formed by the iris and cornea remains open. But other parts of the drainage system don't drain properly. This may lead to a slow, gradual increase in eye pressure.\n\n【24】### Angle-closure glaucoma\n\n【25】This form of glaucoma occurs when the iris bulges. The bulging iris partially or completely blocks the drainage angle. As a result, fluid can't circulate through the eye and pressure increases. Angle-closure glaucoma may occur suddenly or gradually.\n\n【26】### Normal-tension glaucoma\n\n【27】No one knows the exact reason why the optic nerve becomes damaged when eye pressure is normal. The optic nerve may be sensitive or experience less blood flow. This limited blood flow may be caused by the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries or other conditions that damage circulation. The buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries also is known as atherosclerosis.\n\n【28】### Glaucoma in children\n\n【29】A child may be born with glaucoma or develop it in the first few years of life. Blocked drainage, injury or an underlying medical condition may cause optic nerve damage.\n\n【30】### Pigmentary glaucoma\n\n【31】In pigmentary glaucoma, small pigment granules flake off from the iris and block or slow fluid drainage from the eye. Activities such as jogging sometimes stir up the pigment granules. That leads to a deposit of pigment granules on tissue located at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. The granule deposits cause an increase in pressure.\n\n【32】Glaucoma tends to run in families. In some people, scientists have identified genes related to high eye pressure and optic nerve damage.\n\n【33】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【34】Glaucoma can damage vision before you notice any symptoms. So be aware of these risk factors:\n\n【35】*   High internal eye pressure, also known as intraocular pressure\n*   Age over 55\n*   Black, Asian or Hispanic heritage\n*   Family history of glaucoma\n*   Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, migraines, high blood pressure and sickle cell anemia\n*   Corneas that are thin in the center\n*   Extreme nearsightedness or farsightedness\n*   Eye injury or certain types of eye surgery\n*   Taking corticosteroid medicines, especially eye drops, for a long time\n\n【36】Some people have narrow drainage angles, putting them at increased risk of angle-closure glaucoma.\n\n【37】Prevention\n----------\n\n【38】These steps may help detect and manage glaucoma in its early stages. That may help to prevent vision loss or slow its progress.\n\n【39】*   **Get regular eye examinations.** Regular comprehensive eye exams can help detect glaucoma in its early stages, before significant damage occurs. As a general rule, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends a comprehensive eye exam every 5 to 10 years if you're under 40 years old; every 2 to 4 years if you're 40 to 54 years old; every 1 to 3 years if you're 55 to 64 years old; and every 1 to 2 years if you're older than 65.\n\n【40】    If you're at risk of glaucoma, you'll need more frequent screening. Ask your health care provider to recommend the right screening schedule for you.\n\n【41】*   **Know your family's eye health history.** Glaucoma tends to run in families. If you're at increased risk, you may need more frequent screening.\n*   **Wear eye protection.** Serious eye injuries can lead to glaucoma. Wear eye protection when using power tools or playing sports.\n*   **Take prescribed eye drops regularly.** Glaucoma eye drops can significantly reduce the risk that high eye pressure will progress to glaucoma. Use eye drops as prescribed by your health care provider even if you have no symptoms.\n\n【42】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The causes are germs or other harmful things in the food or beverage.\n\n【2】Symptoms of food poisoning often include upset stomach, diarrhea and vomiting. Symptoms usually start within hours or several days of eating the food. Most people have mild illness and get better without treatment.\n\n【3】Sometimes food poisoning causes severe illness or complications.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Symptoms vary depending on what is causing the illness. They may begin within a few hours or a few weeks depending on the cause.\n\n【6】Common symptoms are:\n\n【7】*   Upset stomach.\n*   Vomiting.\n*   Diarrhea.\n*   Diarrhea with bloody stools.\n*   Stomach pain and cramps.\n*   Fever.\n*   Headache.\n\n【8】Less often food poisoning affects the nervous system and can cause severe disease. Symptoms may include:\n\n【9】*   Blurred or double vision.\n*   Headache.\n*   Loss of movement in limbs.\n*   Problems with swallowing.\n*   Tingling or numbness of skin.\n*   Weakness.\n*   Changes in sound of the voice.\n\n【10】### When to see a doctor\n\n【11】#### Infants and children\n\n【12】Vomiting and diarrhea can quickly cause low levels of body fluids, also called dehydration, in infants and children. This can cause serious illness in infants.\n\n【13】Call your child's health care provider if your child's symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea and any of the following:\n\n【14】*   Unusual changes in behavior or thinking.\n*   Excessive thirst.\n*   Little or no urination.\n*   Weakness.\n*   Dizziness.\n*   Diarrhea that lasts more than a day.\n*   Vomiting often.\n*   Stools that have blood or pus.\n*   Stools that are black or tarry.\n*   Severe pain in the stomach or rectum.\n*   Any fever in children under 2 years of age.\n*   Fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius) or higher in older children.\n*   History of other medical problems.\n\n【15】#### Adults\n\n【16】Adults should see a health care provider or get emergency care if the following occur:\n\n【17】*   Nervous system symptoms, such as blurry vision, muscle weakness and tingling of skin.\n*   Changes in thinking or behavior.\n*   Fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius).\n*   Vomiting often.\n*   Diarrhea that lasts more than three days.\n*   Symptoms of dehydration — excessive thirst, dry mouth, little or no urination, severe weakness, dizziness, or lightheadedness.\n\n【18】Causes\n------\n\n【19】Many germs or harmful things, called contaminants, can cause foodborne illnesses. Food or drink that carries a contaminant is called \"contaminated.\" Food can be contaminated with any of the following:\n\n【20】*   Bacteria.\n*   Viruses.\n*   Parasites that can live in the intestines.\n*   Poisons, also called toxins.\n*   Bacteria that carry or make toxins.\n*   Molds that make toxins.\n\n【21】### Understanding terms\n\n【22】The term \"food poisoning\" is commonly used to describe all foodborne illnesses. A health care provider might use these terms to be more specific:\n\n【23】*   \"Foodborne illnesses\" means all illnesses from any contaminated food or beverage.\n*   \"Food poisoning\" means illness specifically from a toxin in food. Food poisoning is a type of foodborne illness.\n\n【24】### How food becomes contaminated\n\n【25】Food can be contaminated at any point from the farm or fishery to the table. The problem can begin during growing, harvesting or catching, processing, storing, shipping, or preparing.\n\n【26】Food can be contaminated any place it's handled, including the home, because of:\n\n【27】*   **Poor handwashing.** Feces that remains on the hands after using the toilet can contaminate food. Other contaminants can be transferred from hands during food preparation or food serving.\n*   **Not disinfecting cooking or eating areas.** Unwashed knives, cutting boards or other kitchen tools can spread contaminants.\n*   **Improper storage.** Food left out for too long at room temperature can become contaminated. Food stored in the refrigerator for too long can spoil. Also, food stored in a refrigerator or freezer that is too warm can spoil.\n\n【28】### Common causes\n\n【29】The following table shows common causes of foodborne illnesses, the time from exposure to the beginning of symptoms and common sources of contamination.\n\n| Disease cause | Timing of symptoms | Common sources |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n| Bacillus cereus (bacterium) | 30 minutes to 15 hours. | Foods such as rice, leftovers, sauces, soups, meats and others that have sat out at room temperature too long. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Campylobacter (bacterium) | 2 to 5 days. | Raw or undercooked poultry, shellfish, unpasteurized milk, and contaminated water. |\n| Clostridium botulinum (bacterium) | 18 to 36 hours.

Also, some bacteria, such as E. coli, may be spread by exposure to animals carrying the disease.\n\n【34】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【35】Anyone can get food poisoning. Some people are more likely to get sick or have more-serious disease or complications. These people include:\n\n【36】*   Infants and children.\n*   Pregnant people.\n*   Older adults.\n*   People with weakened immune systems due to another disease or treatments.\n\n【37】Complications\n-------------\n\n【38】In most healthy adults, complications are uncommon. They can include the following.\n\n【39】### Dehydration\n\n【40】The most common complication is dehydration. This a severe loss of water and salts and minerals. Both vomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration.\n\n【41】Most healthy adults can drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration. Children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems or other illnesses may not be able to replace the fluids they've lost. They are more likely to become dehydrated.\n\n【42】People who become dehydrated may need to get fluids directly into the bloodstream at the hospital. Severe dehydration can cause organ damage, other severe disease and death if not treated.\n\n【43】### Complications of systemic disease\n\n【44】Some contaminants can cause more widespread disease in the body, also called systemic disease or infection. This is more common in people who are older, have weakened immune systems or other medical conditions. Systemic infections from foodborne bacteria may cause:\n\n【45】*   **Blood clots in the kidneys.** E. coli can result in blood clots that block the kidneys' filtering system. This condition, called hemolytic uremic syndrome, results in the sudden failure of the kidneys to filter waste from the blood. Less often, other bacteria or viruses may cause this condition.\n*   **Bacteria in the bloodstream.** Bacteria in the blood can cause disease in the blood itself or spread disease to other parts of the body.\n*   **Meningitis.** Meningitis is inflammation that may damage the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\n*   **Sepsis.** Sepsis is an overreaction of the immune system to systemic disease that damages the body's own tissues.\n\n【46】### Pregnancy complications\n\n【47】Illness from the listeria bacteria during pregnancy can result in:\n\n【48】*   Miscarriage or stillbirth.\n*   Sepsis in the newborn.\n*   Meningitis in the newborn.\n\n【49】### Rare complications\n\n【50】Rare complications include conditions that may develop after food poisoning, including:\n\n【51】*   **Arthritis.** Arthritis is swelling, tenderness or pain in joints.\n*   **Irritable bowel syndrome.** Irritable bowel syndrome in a lifelong condition of the intestines that causes pain, cramping and irregular bowel movements.\n*   **Guillain-Barre syndrome.** Guillain-Barre syndrome is an immune system attack on nerves that can result in tingling, numbness and loss of muscle control.\n*   **Breathing difficulties.** Rarely, botulism can damage nerves that control the muscles involved in breathing.\n\n【52】Prevention\n----------\n\n【53】To prevent food poisoning at home:\n\n【54】*   **Handwashing.** Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Do this after using the toilet, before eating, and before and after handling food.\n*   **Wash fruits and vegetables.** Rinse fruits and vegetables under running water before eating, peeling or preparing.\n*   **Wash kitchen utensils thoroughly.** Wash cutting boards, knives and other utensils with soapy water after contact with raw meats or unwashed fruits and vegetables.\n*   **Don't eat raw or undercooked meat or fish.** Use a meat thermometer to make sure meat is cooked enough. Cook whole meats and fish to at least 145 F (63 C) and let rest for at least three minutes. Cook ground meat to at least 160 F (71 C). Cook whole and ground poultry to at least 165 F (74 C).\n*   **Refrigerate or freeze leftovers.** Put leftovers in covered containers in the refrigerator right after your meal. Leftovers can be kept for 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator. If you don't think you'll eat them within four days, freeze them right away.\n*   **Cook leftovers safely.** You can safely thaw frozen food three ways. You can microwave it. You can move it to the refrigerator to thaw overnight. Or you can put the frozen food in a leakproof container and put it in cold water on the counter. Reheat leftovers until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius).\n*   **Throw it out when in doubt.** If you aren't sure if a food has been prepared, served or stored safely, discard it. Even if it looks and smells fine, it may not be safe to eat.\n*   **Throw out moldy food.** Throw out any baked foods with mold. Throw out moldy soft fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, berries or peaches. And throw away any nuts or nut products with mold. You can trim away mold from firm foods with low moisture, such as carrots, bell peppers and hard cheeses. Cut away at least 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) around the moldy part of the food.\n*   **Clean your refrigerator.** Clean the inside of the refrigerator every few months. Make a cleaning solution of 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of baking soda and 1 quart (0.9 liters) of water. Clean visible mold in the refrigerator or on the door seals. Use a solution of 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of bleach in 1 quart (0.9 liters) of water.\n\n【55】### Safety for at-risk people\n\n【56】Food poisoning is especially serious during pregnancies and for young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. These illnesses may be life-threatening. These individuals should avoid the following foods:\n\n【57】*   Raw or undercooked meat, poultry, fish, and shellfish.\n*   Raw or undercooked eggs or foods that may contain them, such as cookie dough and homemade ice cream.\n*   Raw sprouts, such as alfalfa, bean, clover and radish sprouts.\n*   Unpasteurized juices and ciders.\n*   Unpasteurized milk and milk products.\n*   Soft cheeses, such as feta, brie and Camembert; blue-veined cheese; and unpasteurized cheese.\n*   Refrigerated pates and meat spreads.\n*   Uncooked hot dogs, luncheon meats and deli meats.\n\n【58】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Left ventricular thrombus was identified echocardiographically in a modest 13.7% of the patients, and this group had a higher incidence of stroke and systemic embolism during the median follow-up period of just over 3 years. A minority of patients with LV aneurysm (16.4%) and its subgroup with identified LV thrombus (43.8%) received warfarin anticoagulation. An important, but nondefinitive, finding of the study was that warfarin anticoagulation did not change patient outcome, even when adjusted using propensity score hazard regression analysis. Limitations of the study include the low single-digit event rates in the LV thrombus group (such that a type 2 statistical error cannot be excluded), the overall low number of patients who received anticoagulation, and its nonrandomized nature.\n\n【6】In medicine, unintended errors in clinical guidelines can occur when well-intentioned, expert opinion is relied on in the absence of randomized controlled trials.

{"seq_id": "76f428df-ebb1-4885-acee-8d67d7afcada", "title": "Bone marrow transplant", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】A bone marrow transplant is a procedure that infuses healthy blood-forming stem cells into your body to replace bone marrow that's not producing enough healthy blood cells. A bone marrow transplant is also called a stem cell transplant.\n\n【2】You might need a bone marrow transplant if your bone marrow stops working and does not produce enough healthy blood cells.\n\n【3】Bone marrow transplants may use cells from your own body (autologous transplant) or from a donor (allogeneic transplant).\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】A bone marrow transplant may be used to:\n\n【6】*   Safely allow treatment with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation by replacing or rescuing the bone marrow damaged by the treatment\n*   Replace bone marrow that's not working properly with new stem cells\n*   Provide new stem cells, which can help kill cancer cells directly\n\n【7】Bone marrow transplants can benefit people with a variety of both cancerous and noncancerous diseases, including:\n\n【8】*   Acute leukemia\n*   Adrenoleukodystrophy\n*   Aplastic anemia\n*   Bone marrow failure syndromes\n*   Chronic leukemia\n*   Hemoglobinopathies\n*   Hodgkin's lymphoma\n*   Immune deficiencies\n*   Inborn errors of metabolism\n*   Multiple myeloma\n*   Myelodysplastic syndromes\n*   Neuroblastoma\n*   Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\n*   Plasma cell disorders\n*   POEMS syndrome\n*   Primary amyloidosis\n\n【9】Risks\n-----\n\n【10】A bone marrow transplant can pose numerous risks. Some people experience minimal problems with a bone marrow transplant, while others can have serious complications that require treatment or hospitalization. Sometimes complications are life-threatening.\n\n【11】Your risks depend on many factors, including the disease or condition that caused you to need a transplant, the type of transplant, your age and your overall health.\n\n【12】Possible complications from a bone marrow transplant include:\n\n【13】*   Graft-versus-host disease (a complication of allogeneic transplant only)\n*   Stem cell (graft) failure\n*   Organ damage\n*   Infections\n*   Cataracts\n*   Infertility\n*   New cancers\n*   Death\n\n【14】Your health care provider can explain your risk of complications from a bone marrow transplant. Together you can weigh the risks and benefits to decide whether a bone marrow transplant is right for you.\n\n【15】### Graft-versus-host disease: A potential risk when stem cells come from donors\n\n【16】If you receive a transplant that uses stem cells from a donor (allogeneic transplant), you may be at risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This condition occurs when the donor stem cells that make up your new immune system see your body's tissues and organs as something foreign and attack them.\n\n【17】GVHD may happen at any time after your transplant. Many people who have an allogeneic transplant get GVHD at some point. The risk of GVHD is greater if the stem cells come from an unrelated donor. But GVHD can happen to anyone who gets a bone marrow transplant from a donor.\n\n【18】There are two kinds of GVHD: acute and chronic. Acute GVHD usually happens during the first months after your transplant. It typically affects your skin, digestive tract or liver. Chronic GVHD typically develops later and can affect many organs.\n\n【19】Chronic GVHD signs and symptoms include:\n\n【20】*   Joint or muscle pain\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Persistent cough\n*   Vision changes, such as dry eyes\n*   Skin changes, including scarring under the skin or skin stiffness\n*   Rash\n*   Yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes\n*   Dry mouth\n*   Mouth sores\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n\n【21】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【22】### Pretransplant tests and procedures\n\n【23】A series of tests and procedures can assess your general health and the status of your condition. The tests and procedures also ensure that you're physically prepared for the transplant. The evaluation may take several days or more.\n\n【24】In addition, a long, thin tube (intravenous catheter) will be implanted into a large vein in your chest or neck. The catheter, often called a central line, usually remains in place for the duration of your treatment. Your transplant team will use the central line to infuse the transplanted stem cells, medications and blood products into your body.\n\n【25】### Collecting stem cells for autologous transplant\n\n【26】If a transplant using your own stem cells (autologous transplant) is planned, you'll undergo a procedure called apheresis (af-uh-REE-sis) to collect blood stem cells.\n\n【27】Before apheresis, you'll receive daily injections of growth factor to increase stem cell production and move stem cells into your circulating blood so that they can be collected.\n\n【28】During apheresis, blood is drawn from a vein and circulated through a machine. The machine separates your blood into different parts, including stem cells. These stem cells are collected and frozen for future use in the transplant. The remaining blood is returned to your body.\n\n【29】### Collecting stem cells for allogeneic transplant\n\n【30】If you're having a transplant using stem cells from a donor (allogeneic transplant), you'll need a donor. Once a donor is found, stem cells are gathered from that person for the transplant.\n\n【31】Stem cells can come from your donor's blood or bone marrow. Your transplant team decides which is better for you based on your situation.\n\n【32】Another type of allogeneic transplant uses stem cells from the blood of umbilical cords (cord blood transplant). Mothers can choose to donate umbilical cords after their babies' births. The blood from these cords is frozen and stored in a cord blood bank until needed for a bone marrow transplant.\n\n【33】### The conditioning process\n\n【34】After completing the pretransplant tests and procedures, you'll begin a process known as conditioning. During conditioning, you'll undergo chemotherapy and possibly radiation to:\n\n【35】*   Destroy cancer cells if you're being treated for cancer that may spread to other parts of the body\n*   Suppress your immune system\n*   Prepare your bone marrow for the new stem cells\n\n【36】The type of conditioning process you receive depends on several factors, including the disease being treated, your overall health and the type of transplant planned. You may have both chemotherapy and radiation or just one of these treatments as part of your conditioning treatment.\n\n【37】Side effects of the conditioning process can include:\n\n【38】*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Hair loss\n*   Mouth sores or ulcers\n*   Infection\n*   Bleeding\n*   Infertility or sterility\n*   Anemia\n*   Fatigue\n*   Cataracts\n*   Organ complications, such as heart, liver or lung failure\n\n【39】You may be able to take medications or other measures to reduce such side effects.\n\n【40】### Reduced-intensity conditioning\n\n【41】Based on your age and health history, you may receive lower doses or different types of chemotherapy or radiation for your conditioning treatment. This is called reduced-intensity conditioning.\n\n【42】Reduced-intensity conditioning kills some cancer cells and suppresses your immune system. Then, the donor's cells are infused into your body. Donor cells replace cells in your bone marrow over time. Immune factors in the donor cells may then fight your cancer cells.\n\n【43】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【44】### During your bone marrow transplant\n\n【45】Your bone marrow transplant occurs after you complete the conditioning process. On the day of your transplant, stem cells are infused into your body through your central line.\n\n【46】The transplant infusion is painless. You'll be awake during the procedure.\n\n【47】### After your bone marrow transplant\n\n【48】When the new stem cells enter your body, they travel through your blood to your bone marrow. In time, they multiply and begin to make new, healthy blood cells. This is called engraftment. It usually takes several weeks before the number of blood cells in your body starts to return to the standard range. In some people, it may take longer.\n\n【49】In the days and weeks after your bone marrow transplant, you'll have blood tests and other tests to monitor your condition. You may need medicine to manage complications, such as nausea and diarrhea.\n\n【50】After your bone marrow transplant, you'll remain under close medical care. If you're experiencing infections or other complications, you may need to stay in the hospital for several days or longer. Depending on the type of transplant and the risk of complications, you'll need to remain near the hospital for several weeks to months to allow close monitoring.\n\n【51】You may also need periodic transfusions of red blood cells and platelets until your bone marrow begins producing enough of those cells on its own.\n\n【52】You may be at greater risk of infections or other complications for months to years after your transplant. For the rest of your life, you'll meet regularly with your health care provider to check for late complications.\n\n【53】### Medications\n\n【54】If your bone marrow transplant is using stem cells from a donor (allogeneic transplant), you may take medications to help prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and reduce your immune system's reaction. These drugs are called immunosuppressive medications.\n\n【55】After your transplant, it takes time for your immune system to recover. During this time, you may be given medications to prevent infections.\n\n【56】### Diet and other lifestyle factors\n\n【57】After your bone marrow transplant, you may need to adjust your diet to stay healthy and to prevent excessive weight gain. Your nutrition specialist (dietitian) and other members of your transplant team will work with you to create a healthy-eating plan that meets your needs and complements your lifestyle. Your dietitian can also give you food suggestions to control side effects of chemotherapy and radiation, such as nausea.\n\n【58】Your dietitian can also give you food suggestions to control side effects of chemotherapy and radiation, such as nausea.\n\n【59】Some of your dietitian's recommendations may include:\n\n【60】*   Following food safety guidelines to prevent foodborne infections\n*   Eating a wide variety of healthy foods, including vegetables; fruits; whole grains; lean meats, poultry and fish; legumes; and healthy fats, such as olive oil\n*   Limiting salt intake\n*   Restricting alcohol\n*   Avoiding grapefruit and grapefruit juice due to their effect on a group of immunosuppressive medications\n\n【61】After your bone marrow transplant, regular physical activity helps you control your weight, strengthen your bones, increase your endurance, strengthen your muscles and keep your heart healthy. As you recover, you can slowly increase your physical activity.\n\n【62】Taking steps to prevent cancer is even more important after your transplant. Don't smoke. Wear sunscreen when you're outside, and be sure to get recommended cancer screenings.\n\n【63】Results\n-------\n\n【64】A bone marrow transplant can cure some diseases and put others into remission. Goals of a bone marrow transplant depend on your condition but usually include controlling or curing your disease, extending your life, and improving your quality of life.\n\n【65】Some people have few side effects and complications from a bone marrow transplant. Others may experience short- and long-term side effects and complications. It can be difficult to predict the severity of side effects and the success of the transplant.\n\n【66】It can be helpful to remember that there are many people who have transplants who also experienced some very difficult days during the transplant process. But, ultimately, they had successful transplants and have returned to typical activities with good quality of life.\n\n【67】Coping and Support\n------------------\n\n【68】Living with a bone marrow transplant or waiting for a bone marrow transplant can be difficult. It's typical to have fears and concerns.\n\n【69】Having support from your friends and family can be helpful. Also, you and your family may benefit from joining a support group of people who understand what you're going through and who can provide support.\n\n【70】Support groups offer a place for you and your family to share fears, concerns, difficulties and successes with people who have had similar experiences. You may meet people who have already had a transplant or who are waiting for a transplant.\n\n【71】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "1f69f3e8-cb50-40f5-bed5-d3831e93c311", "title": "Ringworm (body)", "text": "【0】Ringworm (body)\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】Ringworm of the body (tinea corporis) is a rash caused by a fungal infection. It's usually an itchy, circular rash with clearer skin in the middle. Ringworm gets its name because of its appearance. No worm is involved.\n\n【2】Ringworm of the body is related to athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris) and ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis). Ringworm often spreads by direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected person or animal.\n\n【3】Mild ringworm often responds to antifungal medications applied to the skin. For more-severe infections, you may need to take antifungal pills for several weeks.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of ringworm may include:\n\n【6】*   A scaly ring-shaped area, typically on the buttocks, trunk, arms and legs\n*   Itchiness\n*   A clear or scaly area inside the ring, perhaps with a scattering of bumps whose color ranges from red on white skin to reddish, purplish, brown or gray on black and brown skin\n*   Slightly raised, expanding rings\n*   A round, flat patch of itchy skin\n*   Overlapping rings\n\n【7】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【8】Talk to your doctor if you have a rash that doesn't begin to improve within two weeks of using an over-the-counter antifungal product. You may need prescription medication.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Ringworm is a contagious fungal infection caused by common mold-like parasites that live on the cells in the outer layer of your skin. It can be spread in the following ways:\n\n【11】*   **Human to human.** Ringworm often spreads by direct, skin-to-skin contact with an infected person.\n*   **Animal to human.** You can contract ringworm by touching an animal with ringworm. Ringworm can spread while petting or grooming dogs or cats. It's also fairly common in cows.\n*   **Object to human.** It's possible for ringworm to spread by contact with objects or surfaces that an infected person or animal has recently touched or rubbed against, such as clothing, towels, bedding and linens, combs, and brushes.\n*   **Soil to human.** In rare cases, ringworm can be spread to humans by contact with infected soil. Infection would most likely occur only from prolonged contact with highly infected soil.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】You're at higher risk of ringworm of the body if you:\n\n【14】*   Live in a warm climate\n*   Have close contact with an infected person or animal\n*   Share clothing, bedding or towels with someone who has a fungal infection\n*   Participate in sports that feature skin-to-skin contact, such as wrestling\n*   Wear tight or restrictive clothing\n*   Have a weak immune system\n\n【15】Complications\n-------------\n\n【16】A fungal infection rarely spreads below the surface of the skin to cause serious illness. But people with weak immune systems, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), may find it difficult to get rid of the infection.\n\n【17】Prevention\n----------\n\n【18】Ringworm is difficult to prevent. The fungus that causes it is common, and the condition is contagious even before symptoms appear. Take these steps to reduce your risk of ringworm:\n\n【19】*   **Educate yourself and others.** Be aware of the risk of ringworm from infected people or pets. Tell your children about ringworm, what to watch for and how to avoid infection.\n*   **Keep clean.** Wash your hands often. Keep shared areas clean, especially in schools, child care centers, gyms and locker rooms. If you participate in contact sports, shower right after practice or a match and keep your uniform and gear clean.\n*   **Stay cool and dry.** Don't wear thick clothing for long periods of time in warm, humid weather. Avoid excessive sweating.\n*   **Avoid infected animals.** The infection often looks like a patch of skin where fur is missing. If you have pets or other animals, ask your veterinarian to check them for ringworm.\n*   **Don't share personal items.** Don't let others use your clothing, towels, hairbrushes, sports gear or other personal items. And don't borrow such things.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

All the patients declined surgery or were poor surgical candidates. The TNs were benign on fine-needle aspiration, enlarging or causing compressive symptoms, and 3 cm or larger in largest diameter. We evaluated TN volume, compressive symptoms, cosmetic concerns, and thyroid function.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Median TN volume reduction induced by RFA was 44.6% (interquartile range \\[IQR\\], 42.1%-59.3%), from 24.2 mL (IQR, 17.7-42.5 mL) to 14.4 mL (IQR, 7.1-19.2 mL) ( _P_ <.001). Median follow-up was 8.6 months (IQR, 3.9-13.9 months). Maximum results were achieved by 6 months. Radiofrequency ablation did not affect thyroid function. In 1 patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism due to toxic adenoma, thyroid function normalized 4 months after ablation of the toxic nodule. Compressive symptoms resolved in 8 of 12 patients (67%) and improved in the other 4 (33%). Cosmetic concerns improved in all 8 patients. The procedure had no sustained complications.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In this population, RFA of benign large TNs performed similarly to the reports from Europe and Asia. It induces a substantial volume reduction of predominantly solid TNs, improves compressive symptoms and cosmetic concerns, and does not affect normal thyroid function. Radiofrequency ablation has an acceptable safety profile and should be considered as a low-risk alternative to conventional treatment of symptomatic benign TNs.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CFD ( color flow Doppler ), IQR ( interquartile range ), RFA ( radiofrequency ablation ), SYS ( symptom score ), TN ( thyroid nodule )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

To minimize surgical risks, the study participant was selected from patients with PD already scheduled for standard GPi DBS, so the only added risk was related to the passage of a second DBS electrode into the GPe. Inclusion criteria also included severe insomnia for at least 1 year refractory to a minimum of 3 hypnotic treatments.

The connectivity-based GPe target was adjusted 2 mm more caudal and 2 mm lateral in attempt to place the second most distal contact on target and also avoid the internal capsule (final target of x=19.3 mm; y=11 mm; z=2.53 mm with respect to the midpoint of a line connecting the anterior commissure and posterior commissure \\[AC-PC line\\]). The GPe lead was programmed in bipolar mode with the anode as the fourth contact from the bottom (k3) and the cathode as the second contact from the bottom (k1); pulse width = 70 μs, rate = 154 Hz, and current = 2.6 mA.\n\n【34】Sleep scale assessments (Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale \\[PDSS\\] and Insomnia Severity Index \\[ISI\\]) were done before and monthly after DBS implantation. Sleep architecture was compared by polysomnography (PSG) (read by independent board-certified sleep physicians blinded to stimulation settings and study design) conducted before and at 2 and 4 months post-DBS implantation. PSGs were recorded under 2 different conditions: GPi-ON/GPe-ON (2-month follow-up) and GPi-OFF/GPe-ON (4-month follow-up). No hypnotic medications were administered during any of the PSG studies. A third PSG with GPi-ON/GPe-OFF was not performed because of the patient’s wishes to forego any further inpatient sleep studies.\n\n【35】We identified an 82-year-old right-handed woman meeting study criteria. She was a former dance instructor who first developed resting tremor in the left thumb when she was 57 years old. A diagnosis of PD was made, and she was treated with ropinirole. Within 2 years, levodopa was added, and she functioned well for many years. By age 80, she had developed disabling resting and action tremor in the left hand and dyskinesia, spending >50% of her waking hours in an “off” or excessively dyskinetic state. This persisted despite carbidopa/levodopa being reduced to 25/100 mg 4 times daily and amantadine being employed (200 mg/d; she did not tolerate higher doses). She had modest postural instability, particularly in an “off” state and no significant cognitive dysfunction. On examination 3.5 hours after her last dose of levodopa (100 mg), she had dyskinesia that gave way to disabling left-sided tremor. Her preoperative Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score was 31. She was considered a candidate for DBS because of problematic motor fluctuations with alternating disabling tremor and dyskinesia. At the time of surgery, she was receiving 400 mg of l-dopa daily, ropinirole 2.5 mg 3 times a day, and amantadine 100 mg twice daily.\n\n【36】At the time of evaluation, she had longstanding (7 years) severe insomnia. She had no history of dream enactment behaviors. She was initially treated with cognitive behavioral therapy and later with multiple hypnotics (zolpidem, clonazepam, melatonin, and diphenhydramine) that were ineffective after chronic use and poorly tolerated owing to memory complaints. We explored neuromodulation with DBS as an innovative therapy for her severe insomnia. Her baseline PDSS score = 90, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) score = 10, and her ISI score = 26 (severe clinical insomnia).\n\n【37】After DBS stimulation for 1 week, her insomnia complaints were subjectively improved, as assessed by PDSS and ISI. As somnolence is a known association with levodopa use, the levodopa dose was held constant after surgery. Two months postoperatively, her PDSS had decreased from 90 to 20 and ISI from 26 to 10. The results of the preoperative and follow-up sleep parameters are displayed in the Table . Although the patient did not achieve REM sleep during the preoperative PSG, findings consistent with REM sleep without atonia were found on follow-up PSG evaluations. The preoperative and follow-up hypnograms are shown in Figure 2 .\n\n【38】Table Preoperative and Postoperative Sleep Parameters\n\n|  | Preoperative | GPi On/GPe On (2 months postoperative) | GPi Off/GPe On (4 months postoperative) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total recorded time (min) | 508.6 | 469.3 | 494.1 |\n| Apnea hypopnea index | 4.3 | 0.9 | 1.9 |\n| Total sleep time (min) | 147 | 339.5 | 380 |\n| Sleep efficiency (%) | 29.7 | 72.3 | 76.9 |\n| WASO (min) | 347 | 119.5 | 93.5 |\n| Sleep latency (min) | 3.5 | 7.3 | 14.5 |\n| REM latency (min) | 373 | 120 | 114.5 |\n| Stage N1 (%) | 10.5 | 1.3 | 1.4 |\n| Stage N2 (%) | 86.4 | 72.2 | 52.5 |\n| Stage N3 (%) | 1.4 | 5.7 | 15.1 |\n| REM (%) | 1.7 | 20.8 | 30.9 |\n| Stage N1 (min) | 15.5 | 4.5 | 5.5 |\n| Stage N2 (min) | 127 | 245 | 199.5 |\n| Stage N3 (min) | 2 | 19.5 | 57.5 |\n| REM (min) | 2.5 | 70.5 | 117.5 |\n| Arousal index | 34.3 | 13.4 | 9.9 |\n\n【40】DBS = deep brain stimulation; GPe = globus pallidus externus; GPi = globus pallidus internus; REM = rapid eye movement; WASO = Wake After Sleep Onset.\n\n【41】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【42】Figure 2 Polysomnogram results.

The patient had a severe upper extremity resting, postural, and action tremor that was not improved with intraoperative GPi macrostimulation but dramatically improved intraoperatively with GPe macrostimulation. These findings persisted at clinical follow-up for DBS programming.\n\n【45】We describe the first human application of GPe DBS to treat severe insomnia in PD. Our preliminary findings support the safety and feasibility of GPe DBS and suggest it may be a potential option to improve sleep quality in patients with PD who are anticipated to have DBS of other targets for the treatment of motor symptoms.\n\n【46】Updated models of basal ganglia circuitry have shown that the GPe projects to several nonmotor brain regions, including the reticular thalamic nucleus, potentially influencing thalamocortical pathways crucial for the sleep and wake states. In our case, GPe DBS appeared to have stimulated sleep mechanisms resulting in effective control of severe insomnia in a patient with PD.\n\n【47】An unanticipated effect of GPe DBS in our patient was a substantial reduction in PD-related tremor with GPe stimulation. The findings are plausible given the same pallidothalamic connections that potentially modulate sleep control, particularly known connections between the GPe and parafascicular nucleus. Stimulation of the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus has been shown to be effective in control of tremor, owing to its role in motor control, suggesting a possible mechanism of tremor control with GPe DBS. An alternative hypothesis is the abolition of abnormal synchronicity between Gpi and GPe neurons by GPe DBS.\n\n【48】In summary, we report the first application of GPe DBS treatment targeting insomnia symptoms in PD and have demonstrated evidence for improved symptoms of insomnia and improved sleep architecture on PSG. Further randomized double-blinded studies are needed to further validate the role of GPe DBS in the treatment of insomnia.\n\n【49】无关删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【50】无关删除-1:<u>Presented at Electronic Abstract “Towards the Use of Connectomics to Define New Therapeutic Targets for Deep Brain Stimulation: A First-in-Human Study of a Novel Treatment Target for Insomnia in Parkinson’s Disease.” American Society of Functional Neuroradiology 13th Annual Meeting, San Francisco, California.

Unfortunately, data on helpful medications are quite limited, particularly on the treatment of persistent headaches attributed to trauma. This retrospective medical record review used data collected from patients with a diagnosis of postconcussion syndrome in Mayo Clinic's Neurology and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation outpatient clinics to evaluate the response of postconcussive symptoms to amantadine. A _complete trial of amantadine_ was defined as 100 mg twice per day for 2 months. Thirty-three patients were prescribed amantadine for postconcussive syndrome after traumatic brain injury. One-third of patients discontinued the medication because of adverse effects. However, posttraumatic headaches were improved in 80% of patients who completed a full trial of amantadine. Surprisingly, patients had improvement in headaches even if the medication was prescribed years after the initial trauma. Little improvement was noted in other symptoms such as poor memory, dizziness, and personality changes. Although additional research is certainly needed, amantadine may be a reasonable medication to consider for the treatment of persistent headaches attributed to trauma, even if the initial injury is remote.\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Symptoms in long-term marijuana users included intractable vomiting that was unresponsive to antiemetics and associated with learned compulsive bathing behavior. Treatment was supportive care with intravenous fluids for 24 to 48 hours; symptoms resolved when patients stopped using cannabis. We report 2 cases of cannabinoid hyperemesis that, to our knowledge, are the first to be reported in the United States. Our goal is to increase awareness of this unusual adverse effect of marijuana use.\n\n【17】REPORT OF CASES\n---------------\n\n【18】### Case 1\n\n【19】An obese 25-year-old woman who was a long-term cannabinoid user presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that worsened for several days. During the previous 5 years, the patient had noted intermittent episodes of similar symptoms, each lasting about a week and often requiring hospitalization for dehydration. Her symptoms were refractory to all types of antiemetic medications and only responded to prolonged hot showers, some lasting 6 hours or more. Her medical history included bipolar disorder, reflux esophagitis, polycystic ovarian disease, and mild cerebral palsy with chronic mild left facial droop. She had no history of surgery or known drug allergies and reported that she took only lamotrigine. She had begun smoking marijuana 6 to 7 years earlier and used the substance almost daily. Her last marijuana use was 1 day before admission to the hospital. She denied alcohol, tobacco, or other illicit drug use.\n\n【20】On physical examination, the patient's vital signs included a temperature of 36.9°C, a pulse of 74 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, a blood pressure of 110/80 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 98% while breathing room air. She was in moderate distress and found to be writhing in bed. She had a mild left facial droop, her pupils were equal and reactive to light, and extraocular movements were intact. She had moist mucous membranes. There was no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. Results of a cardiovascular examination were normal, and her chest was clear. The abdomen was soft and diffusely tender with decreased bowel sounds and no rebound or guarding. No organomegaly was detected. Examination of her extremities revealed no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing. Although findings on neurologic examination were largely unremarkable, a detailed examination was not possible because of her inability to cooperate secondary to abdominal discomfort and requests to take a shower.\n\n【21】Laboratory studies showed mild leukocytosis; her white blood cell count of 14.0 × 10  /L (reference range, 3.5-10.5 × 10  /L) transiently increased to 17.0 × 10  /L later that day, only to fall to 9.8 × 10  /L on the next day without further intervention. Pregnancy test results were negative, and findings on a complete metabolic panel, including liver function and amylase, lipase, and thyroid-stimulating hormone tests, were normal. The patient's urine toxicology test was positive for cannabinoid. Past investigations of her symptoms included abdominal radiography, computed tomography (CT) of the head, CT of her abdomen and pelvis without contrast medium, cholescintigraphy (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan), 2 gastric emptying studies, modified barium swallow, abdominal ultrasonography, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Findings on all studies were normal, except for the initial gastric emptying study, which showed delayed gastric emptying that normalized after 3 days. On this admission, the patient again underwent CT of her abdomen and pelvis; findings were unremarkable.\n\n【22】The patient was admitted for supportive care because she could not tolerate food. Many antiemetic medications, including ondansetron, promethazine, metoclopramide, lorazepam, and esomeprazole, were given with minimal symptomatic relief. Morphine sulfate was given for abdominal pain. Erythromycin was ordered to help increase gastric motility, but its administration was unsuccessful because the patient refused to leave the hot shower in her room. Indeed, she spent much of her hospitalization in the shower, noting that this was the only thing that controlled her symptoms. She showered as much as 4 hours at a time and even left her room to use a neighbor's shower when her shower stall broke. Her symptoms resolved in 48 hours without any other intervention, and she was discharged from the hospital.\n\n【23】### Case 2\n\n【24】A 23-year-old man presented with 1 day of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain in the epigastric and right upper quadrant. His symptoms were worsened by food and improved with a prolonged hot shower. He noted having similar symptoms several times during the past 2 years; on these occasions, he would come to the emergency department only after exhausting all the hot water in his shower at home. He reported no fevers, chills, indigestion, travel history, or sick contacts. He had experienced chronic abdominal pain for 9 years and had been tested for human immunodeficiency virus and, more recently, for tuberculosis, with negative findings on both. He had no known drug allergies and was not taking any medications. He reported using marijuana 2 to 3 times a day for the past 9 years but denied alcohol or other illicit drug use.\n\n【25】On physical examination, the patient's vital signs included a temperature of 36.6°C, a pulse of 86 beats/min, a blood pressure of 140/100 mm Hg, and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. He was not in acute distress. His skin was warm and well perfused. His mucous membranes were moist, his pupils were equal and reactive to light, and his extraocular movements were intact. His neck was supple without thyromegaly. Findings on cardiovascular examination and examination of his extremities were unremarkable, and his chest was clear. His abdomen was soft, nondistended, and tender.\n\n【26】His laboratory values revealed mild leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 12.4 × 10  /L; 50% neutrophils). Test results on urinalysis, hepatitis serologies, and complete metabolic panel, including liver function, amylase, and lipase tests, were normal. Findings were also negative on a perinuclear-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody test and for tests for cytomegalovirus and human immunodeficiency virus. Previously completed imaging studies, including abdominal radiography, CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast medium, CT of the head without contrast medium, abdominal ultrasonography, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and colonoscopy, yielded normal results. Findings on repeated CT of his abdomen and pelvis with contrast medium at the time of this presentation were normal.\n\n【27】The patient noted feeling better soon after coming to the emergency department. He stated that he had come to the hospital because he was afraid his symptoms would not improve and because he had used all the hot water in his house by showering for 4 hours. He was treated symptomatically with ondansetron and phenergan for nausea, dilaudid for pain control, and normal saline for hydration. After a few hours, his symptoms resolved, and he was discharged from the hospital.\n\n【28】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【29】Cannabinoid hyperemesis, an often unrecognized adverse effect of marijuana use, is characterized by repeated vomiting without an obvious organic cause and learned compulsive bathing behavior. The symptoms resolve in 24 to 48 hours with conservative management and cessation of marijuana use. Both patients about whom we report here exhibited these outcomes.\n\n【30】The mechanism of cannabinoid hyperemesis is unknown. Marijuana, whether taken as a pill or smoked, has been used to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, glaucoma, anorexia, anxiety, and for purposes of muscle relaxation. Some known adverse reactions include altered sensorium, blurred vision, decreased coordination, dry mouth and eyes, hypotension or hypertension, sedation, somnolence, rash, urinary retention,\n\n【31】无关删除-2:<u>*   Spoerke D\n*   Abascal K</u>\n\n【32】Cannabis.

Given the prevalence of illicit marijuana use and the increased popularity of marijuana use for medicinal purposes, these paradoxical effects require further investigation. This case report aims to raise awareness of the potential adverse effects of marijuana use and the importance of obtaining a thorough patient history, which should include consideration of the potential for substance abuse. A thorough history is particularly important when a patient presents with intractable nausea and vomiting that are refractory to antiemetic medication but that are relieved by a hot shower. When confronted with these unusual symptoms, the physician should consider not only organic disease but also illicit marijuana use as a possible cause.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

It is important to recognize that diarrhea is a symptom or sign, not a disease, and can be caused by numerous conditions. Given the multitude of possible causes, the evaluation and treatment of the patient with diarrhea can be challenging. An understanding of the basic mechanisms of diarrhea can help facilitate diagnosis and management.\n\n【44】Pathophysiology\n---------------\n\n【45】The fundamental process causing all diarrheal diseases is incomplete absorption of water from intestinal luminal contents. Water itself is not actively transported across the intestinal mucosa but moves across secondary to osmotic forces generated by the transport of solutes, such as electrolytes and nutrients. Normally, absorption and secretion take place simultaneously, but absorption is quantitatively greater. Either a decrease in absorption or an increase in secretion leads to additional water within the lumen and diarrhea. Excess stool water then causes decreased stool consistency.\n\n【46】Thus, diarrhea is a condition of altered intestinal water and electrolyte transport. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of diarrhea include osmotic, secretory, inflammatory, and altered motility. Osmotic diarrhea involves an unabsorbed substance that draws water from the plasma into the intestinal lumen along osmotic gradients. Secretory diarrhea results from disordered electrolyte transport and, despite the term, is more commonly caused by decreased absorption rather than net secretion. Inflammatory diseases cause diarrhea with exudative, secretory, or osmotic components. Altered motility of the intestine or colon may alter fluid absorption by increasing or decreasing the exposure of luminal content to intestinal absorptive surface. However, from a pathophysiologic perspective, no single cause of diarrhea is truly unifactorial.\n\n【47】A Simplified 5-Step Approach\n----------------------------\n\n【48】The initial approach to the patient with diarrhea is to obtain a detailed history and perform a physical examination. An understanding of the epidemiological settings in which diarrhea occurs (eg, community acquired, hospital acquired, or travel related) will also help direct diagnosis and treatment. Often, after history and physical examination, the cause of diarrhea is not obvious. In this situation, a simple 5-step evaluation 删除4:<u>( Table 1 )</u> can facilitate the workup of the patient with diarrhea.\n\n【49】TABLE 1 Simplified 5-Step Approach to Diarrhea\n\n| 1\\.

Beware of Fecal Incontinence and Impaction\n\n【53】The first step in the clinical appraisal of the patient with diarrhea is to identify what the patient means by _diarrhea_ . Fecal incontinence is often reported as diarrhea because of embarrassment associated with this condition rather than because the patient has any real difficulty distinguishing diarrhea from incontinence.\n\n【54】无关删除-2:<u>*   Leigh R.J.\n*   Turnberg L.A.</u>\n\n【55】Faecal incontinence: the unvoiced symptom.\n\n【56】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Lancet._ 1982; 1 : 1349-1351</u></u>\n\n【57】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (231)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【58】This possibility should be addressed by direct questioning and assessment of anal squeeze on digital examination. Incontinence is defined as the involuntary release of rectal contents. Continence requires intact anorectal structure and neuromuscular function. Although many incontinent patients have loose stools, their predominant problem is anal sphincter dysfunction and not dysregulated intestinal fluid or electrolyte absorption. If fecal incontinence is frequent, especially if it occurs in the absence of rectal urgency or loose stools, the patient should be evaluated for incontinence and not diarrhea.\n\n【59】Another condition that is often misinterpreted as diarrhea is fecal impaction. Patients with chronic constipation may develop fecal impaction from the inability to expel a large fecal mass through the anus. Rectal distention causes relaxation of the internal anal sphincter, and there is induction of secretions proximal to the obstructing stool. An overflow diarrhea results from liquid stool passing around the impaction and may be reported as diarrhea. A careful rectal examination will allow identification and treatment of this condition.\n\n【60】无关删除-2:<u>*   Schiller L.R.</u>\n\n【61】Diarrhea and malabsorption in the elderly.\n\n【62】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Gastroenterol Clin N Am._ 2009; 38 : 481-502</u></u>\n\n【63】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (27)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【64】### Rule Out Medications as a Cause of Diarrhea (Drug-Induced Diarrhea)\n\n【65】The second simple step is to consider medications as a potential cause of the diarrhea. Medications serve an important role in maintaining health and well-being. However, many medications are associated with adverse effects, particularly diarrhea. Drug-induced diarrhea is common because nearly all medications may cause diarrhea.\n\n【66】无关删除-2:<u>*   Chassany O.\n*   Michaux A.\n*   Bergmann J.F.</u>\n\n【67】Drug-induced diarrhoea.\n\n【68】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Drug Saf._ 2000; 22 : 53-72</u></u>\n\n【69】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (155)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【70】The key to diagnosing drug-induced diarrhea is to establish the temporal relationship between starting use of the drug and onset of diarrhea. The medications that most frequently cause diarrhea include antacids and nutritional supplements that contain magnesium, antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n【71】The pathophysiology of drug-induced diarrhea is complex and varied.

Treatment involves withdrawal of the offending drug.\n\n【97】### Distinguish Acute From Chronic Diarrhea\n\n【98】If a drug-induced cause of diarrhea seems unlikely, then the third step that can help direct evaluation is the duration of the diarrhea. The duration of diarrhea may be an important clue to the cause. Diarrhea is acute if it lasts fewer than 2 weeks and chronic if it lasts more than 4 weeks. The approach to acute diarrhea is straightforward because it is most commonly caused by infection and is self-limited. Often, no evaluation or treatment is required. However, stool testing and other studies are often indicated in the presence of certain clinical or epidemiological features, including age older than 65 years, immune compromise, volume depletion, hematochezia or blood-tinged stool, fever, severe abdominal pain, recent antibiotic use, known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease, community infectious disease outbreaks, and employment as a food handler. In contrast to acute diarrhea, chronic diarrhea typically warrants a diagnostic evaluation, is less likely to resolve on its own, and presents a broad differential diagnosis.\n\n【99】### Categorize the Diarrhea as Inflammatory, Fatty, or Watery\n\n【100】If the patient has chronic diarrhea, then the fourth step is to categorize the diarrhea into inflammatory, fatty, or watery type on the basis of presentation and simple stool tests 删除4:<u>( Figure )</u>. Grouping patients with chronic diarrhea into one of these categories is most easily accomplished noninvasively at the front end of the evaluation by stool testing, a strategic initial step that will narrow the differential diagnosis and rationally direct the investigation.\n\n【101】FIGURE Categorization of diarrhea.

Inflammatory diarrhea is suspected with the demonstration of leukocytes or leukocyte proteins (eg, calprotectin or lactoferrin) on stool examination. Other laboratory studies that may indicate an inflammatory diarrhea include elevated C-reactive protein level or sedimentation rate and low serum albumin level. Inflammatory diarrhea fundamentally indicates disrupted and inflamed mucosa, such as that caused by idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis), ischemic colitis, and infectious processes, such as _C difficile_ , cytomegalovirus, tuberculosis, or _Entamoeba histolytica_ . Radiation colitis and neoplasia are uncommon causes of inflammatory diarrhea. When history or stool analysis suggests chronic inflammatory diarrhea, flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy should be the initial study to look for structural changes.\n\n【104】Fatty stools are suggested by a history of weight loss, greasy or bulky stools that are difficult to flush, and oil in the toilet bowl that requires a brush to remove.\n\n【105】无关删除-2:<u>*   Donowitz M.\n*   Kokke F.T.\n*   Saidi R.</u>\n\n【106】Evaluation of patients with chronic diarrhea.\n\n【107】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1995; 332 : 725-729</u></u>\n\n【108】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (96)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【109】A common misconception is that floating stools are indicative of steatorrhea.

Fat malabsorption results from inadequate mucosal transport, and fat maldigestion results from defective hydrolysis of triglycerides. Malabsorption is caused by mucosal diseases, most commonly celiac disease, whereas the maldigestion results from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (eg, chronic pancreatitis) or inadequate duodenal bile acid concentration (eg, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth \\[SIBO\\] or cirrhosis). A simple test to screen for excess fecal fat is a Sudan stain, which will detect most cases of clinically significant steatorrhea. However, the criterion standard for steatorrhea is a quantitative measurement on a timed stool collection while patients consume a 100-g fat diet, and steatorrhea is defined as more than 7 g of fat per 24 hours. When fatty diarrhea is identified, the initial goal is to distinguish malabsorption from maldigestion. The evaluation focuses on looking for a structural problem involving the small intestine or pancreas. Endoscopy with small bowel biopsies allows evaluation of the small intestinal mucosa for celiac disease. Small bowel aspiration can be performed to look for SIBO, which causes steatorrhea by deconjugation of bile acids with resultant low duodenal bile acid concentrations. In addition, hydrogen breath tests may be used to diagnose SIBO. The diagnosis of SIBO requires consideration of a predisposing factor, such as intestinal stasis, achlorhydria, pancreatic insufficiency, or immune deficiency. If small bowel disease is excluded, computed tomography or endoscopic ultrasonography may be useful to identify morphological changes of chronic pancreatitis. If no intestinal abnormalities are found and there is no evidence of chronic pancreatitis, abnormal pancreatic exocrine function should be considered. An empiric trial of pancreatic enzyme supplementation may be used to assess for the presence of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. If such a trial is conducted, high doses of enzymes should be prescribed, and some objective measurement, such as fecal fat excretion or weight gain, should be monitored to assess response.\n\n【115】无关删除-2:<u>*   Schiller L.R.\n*   Sellin J.H.</u>\n\n【116】Diarrhea.\n\n【117】无关删除-2:<u>in: Feldman M.

Osmotic diarrhea is due to the ingestion of poorly absorbed ions or sugars. Secretory diarrhea is due to disruption of epithelial electrolyte transport. Two ways to distinguish an osmotic from a secretory process is by response to fasting and calculating the fecal osmotic gap. An essential characteristic of osmotic diarrhea is that stool volume decreases with fasting, whereas secretory diarrhea typically continues unabated with fasting. Another way to clinically differentiate osmotic diarrhea from secretory diarrhea is by calculating the fecal osmotic gap. The fecal osmotic gap is calculated by adding the stool sodium and potassium concentration, multiplying by 2, and subtracting this amount from 290 mmol/L. Measured stool osmolality should not be used because it largely reflects bacterial metabolism in vitro, not intraluminal osmolality. A fecal osmotic gap greater than 50 mmol/L suggests an osmotic cause for diarrhea, whereas a gap less than 50 mmol/L supports a secretory origin.\n\n【120】If a diagnosis of osmotic diarrhea is made, the differential diagnosis is limited and the evaluation is relatively straightforward. Osmotic diarrhea is usually due to ingestion of poorly absorbed cations (eg, magnesium) or anions (eg, phosphate, or sulfate), which are often contained in laxatives and antacids, or to carbohydrate malabsorption from ingestion of poorly absorbed sugars or sugar alcohols (eg, sorbitol or xylitol). Lactose intolerance is by far the most common type of carbohydrate malabsorption, with prevalence rates up to 100% in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\n\n【121】无关删除-2:<u>*   Scrimshaw N.S.\n*   Murray E.B.</u>\n\n【122】The acceptability of milk and milk products in populations with a high prevalence of lactose intolerance.\n\n【123】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Clin Nutr._ 1988; 48 : 1079-1159</u></u>\n\n【124】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (328)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【125】Measuring a stool pH can help distinguish between osmotic diarrhea due to poorly absorbed ions and that due to poorly absorbed sugars.\n\n【126】无关删除-2:<u>*   Eherer A.J.\n*   Fordtran J.S.</u>\n\n【127】Fecal osmotic gap and pH in experimental diarrhea of various causes.\n\n【128】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Gastroenterology._ 1992; 103 : 545-551</u></u>\n\n【129】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (87)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【130】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hammer H.F.\n*   Fine K.D.\n*   Santa Ana C.A.\n\n【131】Carbohydrate malabsorption: its measurement and its contribution to diarrhea.\n\n【132】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Invest._ 1990; 86 : 1936-1944</u></u>\n\n【133】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (85)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【134】Carbohydrate malabsorption will result in a stool pH less than 6 because as carbohydrates reach the colon they are fermented by bacteria, releasing short-chain fatty acids and making the stool water acidic.\n\n【135】无关删除-2:<u>*   Scrimshaw N.S.\n*   Murray E.B.</u>\n\n【136】The acceptability of milk and milk products in populations with a high prevalence of lactose intolerance.\n\n【137】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Clin Nutr._ 1988; 48 : 1079-1159</u></u>\n\n【138】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (328)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【139】无关删除-2:<u>*   Eherer A.J.\n*   Fordtran J.S.</u>\n\n【140】Fecal osmotic gap and pH in experimental diarrhea of various causes.\n\n【141】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Gastroenterology._ 1992; 103 : 545-551</u></u>\n\n【142】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (87)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【143】Numerous disease processes can produce secretory diarrhea; the major causes are listed in Table 2 .

Therefore, noninfectious causes of secretory diarrhea should be sought. Of the many causes of secretory diarrhea, peptide-secreting endocrine tumors (eg, carcinoid or gastrinoma) deserve mention.

The most frequent cause of factitious diarrhea is surreptitious laxative ingestion. Physicians usually assume that patients are being truthful, but up to 15% of patients who undergo an evaluation for chronic diarrhea may be surreptitiously ingesting laxatives.\n\n【172】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bytzer P.\n*   Stokholm M.\n*   Andersen I.\n\n【173】Prevalence of surreptitious laxative abuse in patients with diarrhoea of uncertain origin: a cost benefit analysis of a screening procedure.\n\n【174】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Gut._ 1989; 30 : 1379-1384</u></u>\n\n【175】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (44)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【176】The key to diagnosing factitious diarrhea is suspecting it. A factitious origin should be considered for persons in whom diarrhea remains undiagnosed after thorough evaluation.\n\n【177】Individuals with factitious diarrhea are most commonly women of higher socioeconomic status and often employed in the medical field. There is frequently a history of multiple medical consultations or hospitalizations in an effort to establish the cause of diarrhea. Evaluation of the patient with suspected factitious diarrhea consists of measuring stool osmolality, performing endoscopy, and analyzing stool water or urine for laxatives.\n\n【178】Measurement of stool osmolality can be useful in detecting factitious diarrhea caused by the addition of water or dilute urine to the stool.\n\n【179】无关删除-2:<u>*   Thomas P.D.\n*   Forbes A.\n*   Green J.\n\n【180】Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhea, 2nd edition.\n\n【181】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Gut._ 2003; 52 : 1-15</u></u>\n\n【182】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【183】无关删除-2:<u>*   Topazian M.\n*   Binder H.J.</u>\n\n【184】Brief report: factitious diarrhea detected by measurement of stool osmolality.\n\n【185】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1994; 330 : 1418-1419</u></u>\n\n【186】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (31)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【187】无关删除-2:<u>*   Pollock R.C.\n*   Banks M.R.\n*   Fairclough P.D.\n*   Farthing M.J.</u>\n\n【188】Dilutional diarrhea: underdiagnosed and over-investigated.\n\n【189】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol._ 2000; 12 : 609-611</u></u>\n\n【190】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (6)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【191】Because stool osmolality can never be less than that of plasma, a low osmolality (<290 mOsm/kg) can only result by adding a hypotonic solution, such as water or urine, to stool.

Finally, if measurement of stool osmolality and colonoscopy do not provide potential clues to factitious diarrhea, then stool, urine, and serum can be tested for laxatives.\n\n【208】The following 3 cases illustrate the application of the simplified 5-step approach to the patient with diarrhea.\n\n【209】Applying the 5-Step Approach\n----------------------------\n\n【210】### Case 1\n\n【211】A 50-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with a 6-month history of diarrhea. He has up to 10 explosive watery stools a day with occasional fecal incontinence. There is no associated bleeding or pain. He has not lost weight. Complete blood cell count and chemistry analysis results are unremarkable for contributing conditions. Prior testing shows multiple negative stool study results for white blood cells, occult blood, and pathogens. He had a normal flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy result. A serologic test result for celiac disease with tissue transglutaminase antibodies was negative.\n\n【212】This patient with diabetes mellitus appears to have chronic diarrhea with fecal incontinence as a complication and not primary contributor to symptoms. When applying the simple 5-step approach to diarrhea further, the next step is to consider a drug-induced cause. Further history in this case revealed that the patient was prescribed metformin 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms. By far the most common cause of diarrhea in those with type 2 diabetes is therapy with metformin.\n\n【213】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lysy J.\n*   Israeli E.\n*   Goldin E.</u>\n\n【214】The prevalence of chronic diarrhea among diabetic patients.\n\n【215】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Gastroenterol._ 1999; 94 : 2165-2170</u></u>\n\n【216】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (57)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【217】This case illustrates the importance of taking a detailed medication history in the patient with chronic diarrhea. A medication history is particularly salient in the diabetic patient because medications such as metformin and acarbose commonly cause diarrhea. Features of metformin-induced diarrhea include watery stools that are often explosive and associated with fecal incontinence. The resolution of diarrhea after cessation of metformin therapy is indicative of this diagnosis. Other causes of chronic diarrhea to consider in diabetic patients include celiac disease, microscopic colitis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, “sugar-free” foods that may contain poorly absorbable sugar alcohols, and bile acid malabsorption.\n\n【218】### Case 2\n\n【219】A 25-year-old Asian woman presents with intermittent diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and excess flatus for the past 5 years. Several times per week she experiences mild cramping abdominal pain that is followed by explosive watery bowel movements with a large amount of flatus. She denies blood in stool, fever, weight loss, anorexia, or fecal incontinence. She has not traveled internationally or taken any antibiotics. She takes no medications and has not been able to associate her symptoms with dietary triggers. Physical examination reveals normal thyroid, no hepatomegaly, and no rashes. Laboratory studies reveal a normal complete blood cell count. Stool studies performed during an episode of diarrhea show a sodium level of 80 mmol/L, a potassium level of 30 mmol/L, and stool pH of 5.\n\n【220】This individual has intermittent diarrhea without fecal incontinence. She takes no medications, making a drug-induced cause unlikely. Symptoms have persisted for more than 4 weeks, making this chronic diarrhea and unlikely to be infectious in origin. The next step in the simplified 5-step approach would be to categorize the diarrhea as inflammatory, fatty, or watery. An inflammatory cause is unlikely given the absence of fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in stool. She has lost no weight and has no descriptors, such as oil droplets in toilet water or difficult to flush stools, which would raise suspicion for fatty stools. Correct categorization of the stools in this case would be watery diarrhea. The next step when confronted with a chronic, watery diarrhea is to determine whether it is an osmotic or secretory process by calculating the stool osmotic gap. In this case, the patient had a stool osmotic gap (290 − 2\\[80+30\\]) of greater than 50 mmol/L, suggesting an osmotic cause of diarrhea. The evaluation of osmotic diarrhea is relatively straightforward because there are only a few causes. The 2 major causes of osmotic diarrhea are ingestion of poorly absorbed ions, such as magnesium, or ingestion of poorly absorbed sugars. Assessing the pH of stool water helps to distinguish these 2 conditions. Carbohydrate malabsorption will result in a stool pH less than 6 because as carbohydrates reach the colon they are fermented by bacteria, releasing short-chain fatty acids and making the stool water acidic.\n\n【221】无关删除-2:<u>*   Scrimshaw N.S.\n*   Murray E.B.</u>\n\n【222】The acceptability of milk and milk products in populations with a high prevalence of lactose intolerance.\n\n【223】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Clin Nutr._ 1988; 48 : 1079-1159</u></u>\n\n【224】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (328)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【225】无关删除-2:<u>*   Eherer A.J.\n*   Fordtran J.S.</u>\n\n【226】Fecal osmotic gap and pH in experimental diarrhea of various causes.\n\n【227】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Gastroenterology._ 1992; 103 : 545-551</u></u>\n\n【228】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (87)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【229】Stool analysis in this case revealed a stool pH of 5, which is indicative of colonic fermentation of malabsorbed carbohydrates. Initially, the patient did not associate any of her symptoms with dietary triggers; however, on further questioning there was some correlation of symptoms with ingestion of milk products. Subsequently, her symptoms improved on a lactose-free diet. Intolerance to lactose-containing foods (primarily dairy products) is common, with a particularly high prevalence in Asians. Ingestion of the disaccharide lactose requires digestion by the disaccharidase lactase to its constituent components of glucose and galactose to permit absorption because monosaccharides are the only sugars absorbed across the small intestinal epithelium. Absence of disaccharidases as in lactase deficiency results in an osmotic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and excess flatulence.\n\n【230】### Case 3\n\n【231】An 80-year-old woman with hypertension presents with a 3-year history of nonbloody diarrhea. She reports 3 to 6 moderate-sized bowel movements per day without a nocturnal component. Her appetite is intact, and she has had no fever, weight loss, or blood in the stool. She has occasional fecal incontinence, but these episodes are less common now because she does not eat out and stays home to be close to the bathroom. She has tried eliminating milk products, gluten, and caffeine from her diet without improvement. Physical examination revealed a woman physically younger than her stated age, and rectal examination revealed adequate resting and squeeze anal sphincter tone without stool in the rectum. Laboratory studies revealed a normal complete blood cell count. Colonoscopy revealed pseudo–melanosis coli.\n\n【232】The simple 5-step approach to diarrhea should be applied to this 80-year-old woman: (1) determine whether the patient really has diarrhea; (2) rule out medications as a cause of diarrhea; (3) distinguish acute from chronic diarrhea; (4) categorize the diarrhea as inflammatory, fatty, or watery; and (5) consider factitious diarrhea.\n\n【233】The patient appears to have diarrhea that is complicated by mild fecal incontinence. A drug-induced cause is unlikely based on review of medications. The duration of the diarrhea is greater than 4 weeks, indicating it is chronic. The diarrhea is watery because there are no symptoms or signs of inflammatory diarrhea, and the absence of weight loss makes fatty diarrhea unlikely. Stool electrolytes reveal no fecal osmotic gap, indicating a secretory origin. On the basis of the differential diagnosis of secretory diarrhea and considering the patient's demographic features, a colonoscopy was performed to evaluate for microscopic colitis. The colonoscopy revealed pseudo–melanosis coli, suggestive of anthraquinone laxative use; however, she denied laxative ingestion. On further questioning, the patient admitted to drinking herbal tea on a daily basis. The tea contained sennosides, which are hydroxyanthracene glycosides derived from senna leaves. Her diarrhea resolved when she stopped drinking the herbal tea. This case illustrates 2 important points. First, a complete dietary history is crucial when evaluating the patient with chronic diarrhea. Second, when confronted with chronic, secretory diarrhea, it is helpful to review its differential diagnosis and pursue testing based on clinical suspicion.\n\n【234】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【235】Evaluation of the patient with diarrhea can often be complex and time-consuming. Hence, a methodical approach to the patient with diarrhea can facilitate diagnosis and management. One such simplified method is the 5-step approach as outlined and applied in the clinical cases described in this report. This approach helps to limit the differential diagnosis and direct testing. It is meant as a guide for the physician and is not a substitute for a thorough history. With this approach, a large percentage of patients with diarrhea can be evaluated and treated by a primary care physician. More complex scenarios should be referred to a gastroenterologist.\n\n【236】无关删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【237】无关删除-1:<u>The author thanks Dr David A.

We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of 10 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent ECT at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, between January 1, 1995, and June 30, 2006. Of the 10 patients, 6 (60%) were women. The median age was 79.5 years (range, 65-93 years). All patients had an aortic valve area of 1.0 cm  or less (median, 0.9 cm  ). The median aortic transvalvular pressure gradient was 43.5 mm Hg (range, 32-58 mm Hg). The 10 patients underwent a total of 144 ECT sessions (range, 1-37 sessions per patient). Despite this large number of sessions, only 2 patients experienced single episodes of blood pressure perceived to be low 1 minute after an electroshock; these episodes were successfully treated. Hypertensive systolic blood pressure (>180 mm Hg) and tachycardia (>100 beats/min) in response to ECT prompted treatment in 7 patients during 70 ECT sessions (49%). None of the patients died within 24 hours after dismissal from the postanesthesia care unit (95% confidence interval for death rate per person, 0%-26%). Hence, ECT was safe in 10 patients with severe aortic stenosis treated at our institution. Our findings may be informative to clinicians who manage the care of patients with severe aortic stenosis who are undergoing ECT.\n\n【1】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

In HCA + RBP patients, cardiopulmonary bypass was interrupted when systemic cooling achieved isoelectric electroencephalogram; once the distal arch had been opened, RBP was then initiated via the venous cannula (flow of 700 to 1000 mL/min, central venous pressure <15 to 20 mm Hg).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The stroke rate was significantly lower in the HCA + RBP group (3%, n=2) compared with the DHCA-only (12%, n=14) ( _P_ \\=.031), despite longer circulatory arrest times in HCA + RBP compared with the DHCA-only (31 \\[IQR, 25 to 40\\] minutes vs 22 \\[IQR, 17 to 30\\] minutes, respectively; _P_ <.001). Operative mortality for patients undergoing HCA + RBP was 6.7% (n=4), whereas for those undergoing DHCA-only it was 10.4% (n=12) ( _P_ \\=.410). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year age-adjusted survival rates for the DHCA group are 86%, 81%, and 75%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year age-adjusted survival rates for the HCA + RBP group are 88%, 88%, and 76%, respectively.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The addition of RBP to HCA in the treatment of distal open arch repair via a lateral thoracotomy is safe and provides excellent neurological protection.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】DHCA ( deep hypothermic circulatory arrest ), HCA ( hypothermic circulatory arrest ), RBP ( retrograde whole-body perfusion ), TAAA ( thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "b5ca0561-1628-4ac0-baf8-3915732696e5", "title": "Latex allergy", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Latex allergy is a reaction to certain proteins found in natural rubber latex, a product made from the rubber tree. If you have a latex allergy, your body mistakes latex for a harmful substance.\n\n【2】Latex allergy may cause itchy skin and hives or even anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition that can cause throat swelling and severe difficulty breathing. Your health care provider can determine if you have a latex allergy or if you're at risk of developing a latex allergy.\n\n【3】Understanding latex allergy and knowing common sources of latex can help you prevent allergic reactions.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】If you're allergic to latex, you're likely to have symptoms after touching latex rubber products, such as gloves or balloons. You also can have symptoms if you breathe in latex particles that are released into the air when someone removes latex gloves.\n\n【6】Latex allergy symptoms range from mild to severe. A reaction depends on how sensitive you are to latex and the amount of latex you touch or inhale. Your reaction can become worse with each additional latex exposure.\n\n【7】### Mild symptoms\n\n【8】Mild latex allergy symptoms include:\n\n【9】*   Itching\n*   Skin redness\n*   Hives or rash\n\n【10】### More-severe symptoms\n\n【11】These include:\n\n【12】*   Sneezing\n*   Runny nose\n*   Itchy, watery eyes\n*   Scratchy throat\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Wheezing\n*   Cough\n\n【13】### Life-threatening symptoms: Anaphylaxis\n\n【14】The most serious allergic reaction to latex is anaphylaxis, which can be deadly. An anaphylactic (an-uh-fuh-LAK-tik) reaction develops immediately after latex exposure in highly sensitive people. However, it rarely happens the first time you're exposed.\n\n【15】Symptoms of anaphylaxis include:\n\n【16】*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Hives or swelling\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Wheezing\n*   Drop in blood pressure\n*   Dizziness\n*   Loss of consciousness\n*   Confusion\n*   Rapid or weak pulse\n\n【17】### When to see a doctor\n\n【18】Seek emergency medical care if you are having or think you're having an anaphylactic reaction.\n\n【19】If you have less severe reactions after exposure to latex, talk to your health care provider. If possible, see your provider when you're reacting. This will help with diagnosis.\n\n【20】Causes\n------\n\n【21】In a latex allergy, your immune system identifies latex as a harmful substance and triggers certain antibodies to fight it off. The next time you're exposed to latex, these antibodies tell your immune system to release histamine and other chemicals into your bloodstream. This process produces a range of allergy symptoms. The more times you are exposed to latex, the more strongly your immune system is likely to respond. This is called sensitization.\n\n【22】Latex allergy can occur in these ways:\n\n【23】*   **Direct contact.** The most common cause of latex allergy involves touching latex-containing products, including latex gloves, condoms and balloons.\n*   **Inhalation.** Latex products, especially gloves, release latex particles. You can breathe in these particles when they become airborne. The amount of airborne latex from gloves differs greatly depending on the brand of glove used.\n\n【24】It's possible to have other skin reactions when using latex. They include:\n\n【25】*   **Allergic contact dermatitis.** This reaction results from the chemical additives used during manufacturing. The main symptom is a skin rash with formation of blisters 24 to 48 hours after exposure, similar to poison ivy.\n*   **Irritant contact dermatitis.** Not an allergy, this skin irritation is caused by wearing rubber gloves or exposure to the powder inside them. Symptoms include dry, itchy, irritated areas, usually on the hands.\n\n【26】Not all latex products are made from natural sources. Products containing synthetic materials, such as latex paint, are unlikely to cause a reaction.\n\n【27】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【28】Certain people are at greater risk of developing a latex allergy:\n\n【29】*   **People with spina bifida.** The risk of latex allergy is highest in people with spina bifida — a birth defect that affects the development of the spine. People with this disorder often are exposed to latex products through early and frequent health care. People with spina bifida should always avoid latex products.\n*   **People who undergo multiple surgeries or medical procedures.** Repeated exposure to latex gloves and medical products increases your risk of developing latex allergy.\n*   **Health care workers.** If you work in health care, you're at increased risk of developing a latex allergy.\n*   **Rubber industry workers.** Repeated exposure to latex may increase sensitivity.\n*   **People with a personal or family history of allergies.** You're at increased risk of latex allergy if you have other allergies — such as hay fever or a food allergy — or they're common in your family.\n\n【30】### Connection between food allergy and latex allergy\n\n【31】Certain fruits contain the same allergens found in latex. They include:\n\n【32】*   Avocado\n*   Banana\n*   Chestnut\n*   Kiwi\n*   Passion fruit\n\n【33】If you're allergic to latex, you have a greater chance of also being allergic to these foods.\n\n【34】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Most patients (85%) in our community have ADs in their medical records at the time of death. Thus, we typically know, early on, if organ donation is an option for a particular critically ill patient. Although our AD does not have a statement about willingness to be supported for the purpose of organ donation, we have never had an instance wherein a patient's AD created a conflict with referral and evaluation for organ donation. Our policy on donation after cardiac death started in 1999 and is the oldest in Wisconsin and perhaps in the United States. Within an hour of a patient's fulfilling one of the clinical triggers, the Donor Resource Team is called to assist in evaluation for organ donation. This occurs before the deceleration of care or removal of support and happens before the discussion of organ donation with the next of kin. For potential donors who are not already receiving life support, good care dictates discussing with the family the possibility of using life-support systems once one of the clinical triggers is met.\n\n【1】无关删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>_We thank Bernard J.

An aneurysm can burst. This is called a rupture. A ruptured aneurysm causes bleeding inside the body and often leads to death. Some aneurysms may not cause symptoms.

{"seq_id": "11148abb-d95b-4bfa-997a-6ba0ff585e0a", "title": "Tracheostomy", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Tracheostomy (tray-key-OS-tuh-me) is a hole that surgeons make through the front of the neck and into the windpipe (trachea). A tracheostomy tube is placed into the hole to keep it open for breathing. The term for the surgical procedure to create this opening is tracheotomy.\n\n【2】A tracheostomy provides an air passage to help you breathe when the usual route for breathing is somehow blocked or reduced. A tracheostomy is often needed when health problems require long-term use of a machine (ventilator) to help you breathe. In rare cases, an emergency tracheotomy is performed when the airway is suddenly blocked, such as after a traumatic injury to the face or neck.\n\n【3】When a tracheostomy is no longer needed, it's allowed to heal shut or is surgically closed. For some people, a tracheostomy is permanent.\n\n【4】Mayo Clinic's approach\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】Situations that may call for a tracheostomy include:\n\n【7】*   Medical conditions that make it necessary to use a breathing machine (ventilator) for an extended period, usually more than one or two weeks\n*   Medical conditions that block or narrow your airway, such as vocal cord paralysis or throat cancer\n*   Paralysis, neurological problems or other conditions that make it difficult to cough up secretions from your throat and require direct suctioning of the windpipe (trachea) to clear your airway\n*   Preparation for major head or neck surgery to assist breathing during recovery\n*   Severe trauma to the head or neck that obstructs breathing\n*   Other emergency situations when breathing is obstructed and emergency personnel can't put a breathing tube through your mouth and into your trachea\n\n【8】### Emergency care\n\n【9】Most tracheotomies are performed in a hospital setting. However, in the case of an emergency, it may be necessary to create a hole in a person's throat when outside of a hospital, such as at the scene of an accident.\n\n【10】Emergency tracheotomies are difficult to perform and have an increased risk of complications. A related and somewhat less risky procedure used in emergency care is a cricothyrotomy (kry-koe-thie-ROT-uh-me). This procedure creates a hole directly into the voice box (larynx) at a site immediately below the Adam's apple (thyroid cartilage).\n\n【11】Once a person is transferred to a hospital and stabilized, a cricothyrotomy is replaced by a tracheostomy if there's a need for long-term breathing assistance.\n\n【12】Risks\n-----\n\n【13】Tracheostomies are generally safe, but they do have risks. Some complications are particularly likely during or shortly after surgery. The risk of such problems greatly increases when the tracheotomy is performed as an emergency procedure.\n\n【14】Immediate complications include:\n\n【15】*   Bleeding\n*   Damage to the trachea, thyroid gland or nerves in the neck\n*   Misplacement or displacement of the tracheostomy tube\n*   Air trapped in tissue under the skin of the neck (subcutaneous emphysema), which can cause breathing problems and damage to the trachea or food pipe (esophagus)\n*   Buildup of air between the chest wall and lungs (pneumothorax), which causes pain, breathing problems or lung collapse\n*   A collection of blood (hematoma), which may form in the neck and compress the trachea, causing breathing problems\n\n【16】Long-term complications are more likely the longer a tracheostomy is in place. These problems include:\n\n【17】*   Obstruction of the tracheostomy tube\n*   Displacement of the tracheostomy tube from the trachea\n*   Damage, scarring or narrowing of the trachea\n*   Development of an abnormal passage between the trachea and the esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula), which can increase the risk of fluids or food entering the lungs\n*   Development of a passage between the trachea and the large artery that supplies blood to the right arm and right side of the head and neck (tracheoinnominate fistula), which can result in life-threatening bleeding\n*   Infection around the tracheostomy or infection in the trachea and bronchial tubes (tracheobronchitis) and lungs (pneumonia)\n\n【18】If you still need a tracheostomy after you've left the hospital, you'll need to keep regularly scheduled appointments for monitoring possible complications. You'll also receive instructions about when you should call your doctor about problems, such as:\n\n【19】*   Bleeding at the tracheostomy site or from the trachea\n*   Difficulty breathing through the tube\n*   Pain or a change in comfort level\n*   Redness or swelling around the tracheostomy\n*   A change in the position of your tracheostomy tube\n\n【20】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【21】How you prepare for a tracheostomy depends on the type of procedure you'll undergo. If you'll be receiving general anesthesia, your doctor may ask that you avoid eating and drinking for several hours before your procedure. You may also be asked to stop certain medications.\n\n【22】### Plan for your hospital stay\n\n【23】After the tracheostomy procedure, you'll likely stay in the hospital for several days as your body heals. If possible, plan ahead for your hospital stay by bringing:\n\n【24】*   Comfortable clothing, such as pajamas, a robe and slippers\n*   Personal care items, such as your toothbrush and shaving supplies\n*   Entertainment to help you pass the time, such as books, magazines or games\n*   A communication method, such as a pencil and a pad of paper, a smartphone, or a computer, as you'll be unable to talk at first\n\n【25】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【26】### During the procedure\n\n【27】A tracheotomy is most commonly performed in an operating room with general anesthesia, which makes you unaware of the surgical procedure. A local anesthetic to numb the neck and throat is used if the surgeon is worried about the airway being compromised from general anesthesia or if the procedure is being done in a hospital room rather than an operating room.\n\n【28】The type of procedure you undergo depends on why you need a tracheostomy and whether the procedure was planned. There are essentially two options:\n\n【29】*   **Surgical tracheotomy** can be performed in an operating room or in a hospital room. The surgeon usually makes a horizontal incision through the skin at the lower part of the front of your neck. The surrounding muscles are carefully pulled back and a small portion of the thyroid gland is cut, exposing the windpipe (trachea). At a specific spot on your windpipe near the base of your neck, the surgeon creates a tracheostomy hole.\n*   **Minimally invasive tracheotomy (percutaneous tracheotomy)** is typically performed in a hospital room. The doctor makes a small incision near the base of the front of the neck. A special lens is fed through the mouth so that the surgeon can view the inside of the throat. Using this view of the throat, the surgeon guides a needle into the windpipe to create the tracheostomy hole, then expands it to the appropriate size for the tube.\n\n【30】For both procedures, the surgeon inserts a tracheostomy tube into the hole. A neck strap attached to the face plate of the tube keeps it from slipping out of the hole, and temporary sutures can be used to secure the faceplate to the skin of your neck.\n\n【31】### After the procedure\n\n【32】You'll likely spend several days in the hospital as your body heals. During that time, you'll learn skills necessary for maintaining and coping with your tracheostomy:\n\n【33】*   **Caring for your tracheostomy tube.** A nurse will teach you how to clean and change your tracheostomy tube to help prevent infection and reduce the risk of complications. You'll continue to do this as long as you have a tracheostomy.\n*   **Speaking.** Generally, a tracheostomy prevents speaking because exhaled air goes out the tracheostomy opening rather than up through your voice box. But there are devices and techniques for redirecting airflow enough to produce speech. Depending on the type of tube, width of your trachea and condition of your voice box, you may be able to speak with the tube in place. If necessary, a speech therapist or a nurse trained in tracheostomy care can suggest options for communicating and help you learn to use your voice again.\n*   **Eating.** While you're healing, swallowing will be difficult. You'll receive nutrients through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein in your body, a feeding tube that passes through your mouth or nose, or a tube inserted directly into your stomach. When you're ready to eat again, you may need to work with a speech therapist, who can help you regain the muscle strength and coordination needed for swallowing.\n*   **Coping with dry air.** The air you breathe will be much drier because it no longer passes through your moist nose and throat before reaching your lungs. This can cause irritation, coughing and excess mucus coming out of the tracheostomy. Putting small amounts of saline directly into the tracheostomy tube, as directed, may help loosen secretions. Or a saline nebulizer treatment may help. A device called a heat and moisture exchanger captures moisture from the air you exhale and humidifies the air you inhale. A humidifier or vaporizer adds moisture to the air in a room.\n*   **Managing other effects.** Your health care team will show you ways to care for other common effects related to having a tracheostomy. For example, you may learn to use a suction machine to help you clear secretions from your throat or airway.\n\n【34】Results\n-------\n\n【35】In most cases, a tracheostomy is temporary, providing an alternative breathing route until other medical issues are resolved. If you need to remain connected to a ventilator indefinitely, the tracheostomy is often the best permanent solution.\n\n【36】Your health care team will help you determine when it's appropriate to remove the tracheostomy tube. The hole may close and heal on its own, or it can be closed surgically.\n\n【37】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Safety and efficacy have not been established .\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. Although there is no specific information comparing the use of phentolamine for erectile dysfunction in the elderly, it is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【24】*   Alfuzosin\n*   Asenapine\n*   Silodosin\n*   Tadalafil\n*   Tamsulosin\n*   Vardenafil\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【26】*   Acebutolol\n*   Alprenolol\n*   Atenolol\n*   Betaxolol\n*   Bevantolol\n*   Bisoprolol\n*   Bucindolol\n*   Carteolol\n*   Carvedilol\n*   Celiprolol\n*   Dilevalol\n*   Esmolol\n*   Labetalol\n*   Levobunolol\n*   Mepindolol\n*   Metipranolol\n*   Metoprolol\n*   Nadolol\n*   Nebivolol\n*   Oxprenolol\n*   Penbutolol\n*   Pindolol\n*   Propranolol\n*   Sotalol\n*   Talinolol\n*   Tertatolol\n*   Timolol\n\n【27】### Other Interactions\n\n【28】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【30】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【31】*   Bleeding problems—These conditions increase the risk of bleeding at the place of injection.\n\n【32】*   Priapism (history of) or\n*   Sickle cell disease—Patients with these conditions have an increased risk of priapism (erection lasting longer than 4 hours) while using phentolamine.\n\n【33】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【34】To give the injection:\n\n【35】*   Cleanse the injection site with alcohol. Using a sterile needle, inject the medicine slowly and directly into the base of the penis as instructed by your doctor. It should not be injected just under the skin. The injection is usually not painful, although you may feel some tingling in the tip of your penis. If the injection is very painful or you notice bruising or swelling at the place of injection, that means you are injecting the medicine under the skin. Stop, withdraw the needle, and reposition it properly before continuing with the injection.\n*   After you have completed the injection, put pressure on the place of injection to prevent bruising. Then massage your penis as instructed by your doctor. This helps the medicine spread to all parts of the penis, so that it will work better.\n\n【36】This medicine usually begins to work in about 10 minutes. You should attempt intercourse within 2 hours after injecting the medicine.\n\n【37】To reverse the effects of a soft-tissue anesthetic medicine, a dentist or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. This medicine is usually injected at the same spot where you have received the local dental anesthesia .\n\n【38】### Dosing\n\n【39】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【40】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【41】*   For injection dosage form:\n    *   For the treatment of impotence:\n        *   Adults— 0.5 to 1 milligram (mg) injected very slowly into the area of your penis as directed by your doctor. Allow one or two minutes to completely inject the dose. Do not inject more than one dose in a day. Also, do not use this medicine more than two days in a row or more than three times a week.\n\n【42】### Storage\n\n【43】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【44】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【45】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【46】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【47】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【48】Use the injection exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than ordered. If too much is used, the erection may become so strong that it lasts too long and does not reverse when it should. This condition is called priapism, and it can be very dangerous. If the effect is not reversed, the blood supply to the penis may be cut off and permanent damage may occur.\n\n【49】Contact your doctor immediately if the erection lasts for longer than 4 hours or if it becomes painful. This may be a sign of priapism and must be treated right away to prevent permanent damage.\n\n【50】If you notice bleeding at the site when you inject the medicine, put pressure on the spot until the bleeding stops. If it doesn't stop, check with your doctor.\n\n【51】It is important for you to examine your penis regularly. Check with your doctor if you find a lump where the medicine has been injected or if you notice that your penis is becoming curved. These may be signs that unwanted tissue is growing (called fibrosis), which should be seen by your doctor.\n\n【52】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【53】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【54】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【55】#### Rare\n\n【56】1.  Dizziness\n2.  erection continuing for more than 4 hours, or painful erection\n3.  lumps in the penis\n\n【57】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【58】#### Less common or rare\n\n【59】1.  Bruising or bleeding at place of injection\n2.  burning (mild) along penis\n3.  difficulty in ejaculating\n4.  swelling at place of injection\n\n【60】Phentolamine injected into the penis may cause tingling at the tip of the penis. This is no cause for concern.\n\n【61】无关删除-1:<u>Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients.

Hepatic resection during follow-up was entered as a time-dependent covariable in a multivariable analysis. In patients with serial echocardiograms more than 1 year apart without intervening cardiac surgery, a previously validated cardiac severity score was calculated. A score increase that exceeded 25% was considered relevant progression.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Hepatic resection was performed in 31 patients (12%) during follow-up. Five-year survival was significantly higher in these patients (86.5%; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 73.5%-100.0%) than in patients without hepatic resection (29.0%; 95% CI, 23.3%-36.1%; univariable hazard ratio for hepatic resection, 0.25; 95% CI 0.12-0.53; _P_ <.001). Hepatic resection remained strongly associated with improved prognosis in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.14-0.66; _P_ \\=.003). Among 77 patients (29%) with serial echocardiograms, 10 (13%) underwent hepatic resection during follow-up; resection was independently associated with decreased risk of cardiac progression (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.06-0.75; _P_ \\=.03).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Despite the limitations of this retrospective nonrandomized study, our data suggest that patients with carcinoid heart disease who undergo hepatic resection have decreased cardiac progression and improved prognosis. Eligible patients should be considered for hepatic surgery.\n\n【8】CI ( confidence interval ), HR ( hazard ratio ), 5-HIAA ( 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid ), IQR ( interquartile range ), NYHA ( New York Heart Association )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

William Carlos Williams managed to weave medical practice and writing into a seamless whole for decades, although this was often difficult – especially during the Second World War, when he was in his 60s and many younger physicians had been called away for military service. Biographer Linda Wagner-Martin wrote that Williams “worked harder at being a writer than he did at being a physician,” yet he famously delivered more than 2,000 babies, made innumerable house calls to the working-class triple-decker “Bayonne boxes” of Northern New Jersey, and served for 17 years as Chief Pediatrician for the Passaic General Hospital (now St. Mary’s Hospital) in Passaic, New Jersey.\n\n【2】Williams was born in Rutherford, New Jersey, in 1883. His middle name, “Carlos,” reflects the Puerto Rican origin of his mother; his father was English and grew up in the West Indies before moving to New Jersey. After attending schools in Rutherford, Geneva, and Paris, Williams graduated from Horace Mann (High) School in New York City in 1902, and, after taking a special examination, was admitted at age 19 to the University of Pennsylvania’s medical school without formal undergraduate work. At Penn, Williams met poet Ezra Pound, who greatly influenced his later work, as well as H.D. (Hilda Doolittle), a Bryn Mawr student whose father was a professor of astronomy (and who was briefly engaged to the much-older Pound, despite Williams’ affections for her). Pound promoted a Modernist aesthetic, fostered the career of young artists including Williams and H.D. and was the leading proponent of the Imagist movement in poetry, which stressed precise, clear, and spare economical language at the expense of meter, rhyme, and formal structure.\n\n【3】Williams' medical career was spent as a general practitioner with a focus on pediatrics and neonatology. His first internship was at the French Hospital in Manhattan, where the work was grueling; his second, a pediatrics internship at the New York Nursery and Child's Hospital between 1908 and 1909, came to an abrupt end when he refused hospital administrators’ request to sign hospital bills without providing services. He then went to Europe and studied for a year in Leipzig, visiting Pound in London and touring the European continent before returning home to set up a practice in his hometown of Rutherford. Williams married Florence “Flossie” Herman in 1912 (after Flossie’s older sister had refused a marriage proposal), with whom he had two sons.\n\n【4】Williams’ first book, _Poems_ , was published in 1909 and sold just four copies, but, encouraged by Pound and by an internal drive – “I think all writing is a disease; you can’t stop it” – he continued to write. “My first poem was a bolt from the blue … it broke a spell of disillusion and suicidal despondence… it filled me with soul satisfying joy.” His second book, _The Tempest_ , was promoted by Pound and was much more successful than _Poems_ ; this work resulted in wider recognition of Williams' talents and introductions to many New York-based artists.\n\n【5】In contrast to the highly erudite and formal style of his Modernist contemporary, T.S. Eliot, whose poem _The Waste Land_ was published in 1922 (much to Williams’ chagrin, as he felt Eliot’s work was not only a setback for Modernism, but also overshadowed his own efforts), Williams always wrote in ordinary language. “The job of the poet is to use language effectively, his own language, the only language which is to him authentic”, summed up his philosophy. He claimed, “I don't speak English, but the American idiom. I don't know how to write anything else, and I refuse to learn.” Marianne Moore, who shared Williams’ dislike of esoteric literary allusions in writing and the constraints of traditional poetic forms, described Williams’ poetic language as, “plain American which cats and dogs can read.”\n\n【6】Vivid imagery characterizes Williams’ best poems – he coined the phrase, “no ideas but in things” in the first book of his epic poem, _Paterson_ – whether that specific image is a red wheelbarrow, a brown sweater, or chilled plums in the icebox. Many of his poems, including _The Dead Baby_ and _On The Use Of Force_ , were inspired by experiences with patients, who prompted both his sympathy and his occasional irritation. In his autobiography, Williams claimed, “The poem springs from the half-spoken words of such patients as the physician sees from day to day… in that the secret lies.” Reports that Williams frequently wrote short poems on the back of prescription pads while sitting at the bedsides of laboring women are emblematic of the degree to which his clinical practice and writing life were intertwined.\n\n【7】The last 15 years of Williams’ life were difficult physically – a heart attack in 1948, followed by a series of strokes, left him increasingly disabled – yet he continued to influence American literary movements throughout the 1950s, particularly the Beat Writers. Allan Ginsberg, the most well-known of the Beat poets, had grown up in Paterson, New Jersey, and corresponded extensively with Williams; Williams included a few of Ginsberg’s letters in _Paterson_ , and wrote the introduction to Ginsberg’s _Howl_ . In 1950, Williams won the first US National Book Award for _Paterson_ .\n\n【8】Accusations of Communist sympathies during the McCarthy Red Scare era took a toll on Williams, and he was hospitalized for depression in 1953. Despite a paralyzing stroke in 1955, he taught himself to write again, and published his final collection in 1962 – his 20th book of poetry – _Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems,_ which won the Pulitzer Prize the following year. Critic Adam Kirsch summed up Williams’ life work: “Williams is the 20th-century poet who has done most to influence our very conception of what poetry should do, and how much it does not need to do.”\n\n【9】In 1963, Williams died in Rutherford, the same town in which he was born. In 2012, Williams was honored philatelically by the United States (Scott 4656) as part of a series of stamps depicting 20th century poets.\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【12】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2013.04.035</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>© 2014 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

{"seq_id": "abd48aee-92ca-47a3-ab06-7a346de7925a", "title": "Female infertility", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Infertility is defined as trying to get pregnant with frequent, unprotected sex for at least a year with no success.\n\n【2】Infertility results from female factors about one-third of the time and both female and male factors about one-third of the time. The cause is either unknown or a combination of male and female factors in the remaining cases.\n\n【3】Female infertility causes can be difficult to diagnose. There are many treatments, depending on the infertility cause. Many infertile couples will go on to conceive a child without treatment.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The main symptom of infertility is the inability to get pregnant. A menstrual cycle that's too long (35 days or more), too short (less than 21 days), irregular or absent can mean that you're not ovulating. There might be no other signs or symptoms.\n\n【6】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【7】When to seek help can depend on your age:\n\n【8】*   **Up to age 35,** most doctors recommend trying to get pregnant for at least a year before testing or treatment.\n*   **If you're between 35 and 40,** discuss your concerns with your doctor after six months of trying.\n*   **If you're older than 40,** your doctor might suggest testing or treatment right away.\n\n【9】Your doctor might also want to begin testing or treatment right away if you or your partner has known fertility problems, or if you have a history of irregular or painful periods, pelvic inflammatory disease, repeated miscarriages, cancer treatment, or endometriosis.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】For pregnancy to occur, every step of the human reproduction process has to happen correctly. The steps in this process are:\n\n【12】*   One of the two ovaries releases a mature egg.\n*   The egg is picked up by the fallopian tube.\n*   Sperm swim up the cervix, through the uterus and into the fallopian tube to reach the egg for fertilization.\n*   The fertilized egg travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus.\n*   The fertilized egg attaches (implants) to the inside of the uterus and grows.\n\n【13】In women, a number of factors can disrupt this process at any step. Female infertility is caused by one or more of the factors below.\n\n【14】### Ovulation disorders\n\n【15】Ovulating infrequently or not at all accounts for most cases of infertility. Problems with the regulation of reproductive hormones by the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland or problems in the ovary can cause ovulation disorders.\n\n【16】*   **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).** polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) causes a hormone imbalance, which affects ovulation. PCOS is associated with insulin resistance and obesity, abnormal hair growth on the face or body, and acne. It's the most common cause of female infertility.\n*   **Hypothalamic dysfunction.** Two hormones produced by the pituitary gland are responsible for stimulating ovulation each month — follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Excess physical or emotional stress, a very high or very low body weight, or a recent substantial weight gain or loss can disrupt production of these hormones and affect ovulation. Irregular or absent periods are the most common signs.\n*   **Primary ovarian insufficiency.** Also called premature ovarian failure, this is usually caused by an autoimmune response or by premature loss of eggs from your ovary, possibly as a result of genetics or chemotherapy. The ovary no longer produces eggs, and it lowers estrogen production in women under age 40.\n*   **Too much prolactin.** The pituitary gland can cause excess production of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia), which reduces estrogen production and can cause infertility. This can also be caused by medications you're taking for another condition.\n\n【17】### Damage to fallopian tubes (tubal infertility)\n\n【18】Damaged or blocked fallopian tubes keep sperm from getting to the egg or block the passage of the fertilized egg into the uterus. Causes of fallopian tube damage or blockage can include:\n\n【19】*   Pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes due to chlamydia, gonorrhea or other sexually transmitted infections\n*   Previous surgery in the abdomen or pelvis, including surgery for ectopic pregnancy, in which a fertilized egg implants and develops somewhere other than the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube\n\n【20】### Endometriosis\n\n【21】Endometriosis occurs when tissue that typically grows in the uterus implants and grows in other places. This extra tissue growth — and the surgical removal of it — can cause scarring, which can block fallopian tubes and keep an egg and sperm from uniting.\n\n【22】Endometriosis can also disrupt implantation of the fertilized egg. The condition also seems to affect fertility in less-direct ways, such as damage to the sperm or egg.\n\n【23】### Uterine or cervical causes\n\n【24】Several uterine or cervical causes can interfere with the egg implanting or increase the risk of miscarriage:\n\n【25】*   Benign polyps or tumors (fibroids or myomas) are common in the uterus. Some can block fallopian tubes or interfere with implantation, affecting fertility. However, many women who have fibroids or polyps do become pregnant.\n*   Problems with the uterus present from birth, such as an unusually shaped uterus, can cause problems becoming or remaining pregnant.\n*   Cervical stenosis, a narrowing of the cervix, can be caused by an inherited malformation or damage to the cervix.\n*   Sometimes the cervix can't produce the best type of mucus to allow the sperm to travel through the cervix into the uterus.\n\n【26】### Unexplained infertility\n\n【27】In some cases, the cause of infertility is never found. A combination of several minor factors in both partners could cause unexplained fertility problems. Although it's frustrating to get no specific answer, this problem can correct itself with time. But you shouldn't delay treatment for infertility.\n\n【28】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【29】Certain factors may put you at higher risk of infertility, including:\n\n【30】*   **Age.** The quality and quantity of a woman's eggs begin to decline with age. In the mid-30s, the rate of follicle loss speeds, resulting in fewer and poorer quality eggs. This makes conception more difficult, and increases the risk of miscarriage.\n*   **Smoking.** Besides damaging your cervix and fallopian tubes, smoking increases your risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. It's also thought to age your ovaries and deplete your eggs prematurely. Stop smoking before beginning fertility treatment.\n*   **Weight.** Being overweight or significantly underweight may affect ovulation. Getting to a healthy body mass index (BMI) might increase the frequency of ovulation and likelihood of pregnancy.\n*   **Sexual history.** Sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can damage the fallopian tubes. Having unprotected sex with multiple partners increases your risk of a sexually transmitted infection that may cause fertility problems later.\n*   **Alcohol.** Excess alcohol consumption can reduce fertility.\n\n【31】Prevention\n----------\n\n【32】For women thinking about getting pregnant soon or in the future, these tips might help:\n\n【33】*   **Maintain a healthy weight.** Overweight and underweight women are at increased risk of ovulation disorders. If you need to lose weight, exercise moderately. Strenuous, intense exercise of more than five hours a week has been associated with decreased ovulation.\n*   **Quit smoking.** Tobacco has multiple negative effects on fertility, as well as your general health and the health of a fetus. If you smoke and are considering pregnancy, quit now.\n*   **Avoid alcohol.** Heavy alcohol use may lead to decreased fertility. And any alcohol use can affect the health of a developing fetus. If you're planning to become pregnant, avoid alcohol, and don't drink alcohol while pregnant.\n*   **Reduce stress.** Some studies have shown that stress can cause couples to have poorer results with infertility treatment. Try to reduce stress in your life before trying to become pregnant.\n\n【34】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Clinical Pearls is designed with the 3 qualities of physician-learners in mind. First, we physicians enjoy learning from cases. Second, we like concise, practical points that we can use in our practice. Finally, we take pleasure in problem solving.\n\n【1】In the Clinical Pearls format, speakers present a number of short cases in their specialty to a general internal medicine audience. Each case is followed by a multiple-choice question answered live by attendees using an audience response system. The answer distribution is shown to attendees. The correct answer is then displayed and the speaker discusses teaching points, clarifying why one answer is most appropriate. Each case presentation ends with a Clinical Pearl, defined as a practical teaching point that is supported by the literature but generally not well known to most internists.\n\n【2】Clinical Pearls is currently one of the most popular sessions at the American College of Physicians meeting. As a service to its readers, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ has invited a selected number of these Clinical Pearl presentations to be published in our Concise Reviews for Clinicians section. “Clinical Pearls in General Internal Medicine” is one of them.\n\n【3】CASE 1\n------\n\n【4】A 69-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and hypertension has had 2 episodes of classic podagra per year for the past 3 years. In the past, he developed a rash and nausea after taking allopurinol. He has no history of nephrolithiasis and does not use alcohol. He has a mild peripheral neuropathy (idiopathic) and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.

Not infrequently, patients may be intolerant of allopurinol, have hyperuricemia that is suboptimally controlled by it, or simply may not wish to add another medication to their regimen. Conveniently, a couple of the medications used for hyperlipidemia and hypertension also lower levels of serum uric acid (by enhancing uric acid excretion).\n\n【40】Losartan has been shown to decrease serum levels of uric acid by approximately 10% to 15%, even in patients who are already taking fenofibrate.

However, the average time to passage in some studies is as long as 22 days, and thus it is reasonable to use “medical expulsive therapy” to expedite resolution. Both α-blockers and calcium channel blockers have been shown to inhibit the contraction of the smooth muscle responsible for ureteral spasms (while still allowing antegrade stone propagation). The agent that has been most studied in this setting is tamsulosin, generally in a dosage of 0.4 mg/d given for as long as 1 month.\n\n【76】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lojanapiwat B\n*   Kochakarn W\n*   Suparatchatpan N\n*   Lertwuttichaikul K</u>\n\n【77】Effectiveness of low-dose and standard-dose tamsulosin in the treatment of distal ureteric stones: a randomized controlled study.\n\n【78】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Int Med Res._ 2008; 36 : 529-536</u></u>\n\n【79】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (39)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【80】In a recent meta-analysis of 9 randomized trials of this agent vs placebo in patients referred to urology clinics for moderate-sized ureteral stones (5-7 mm in diameter), stones passed an average of 2 to 6 days earlier in the treatment group.

She describes it as a “sharp,” “burning” discomfort that is well localized and continuous. It may be slightly worse after eating and definitely seems to worsen after having a bowel movement. Her bowels are moving normally, and she has experienced no weight loss or fever. Her review of systems is otherwise unremarkable, and she was previously healthy apart from mild depression that is being effectively treated with fluoxetine. The patient is taking no other medications.

B. Carnett in 1926. He described the maneuver whereby the tender spot is located and then patients are asked to raise either their legs or torso (thus tensing the abdominal muscles). If the pain does not decrease (and especially if it increases) during the maneuver, then it is very unlikely to be from a visceral source and may reliably be localized to the abdominal wall muscles. False-positive Carnett maneuvers occur infrequently (<5% or so), almost always in the setting of acute appendicitis (due to irritation of the adjacent parietal peritoneum). Chronic abdominal wall pain is typically described by the patient as being constant in nature and may worsen slightly after eating (abdominal distention) or more commonly after a bowel movement (from straining of the abdominal muscles). Obesity and depression are common comorbid conditions, as are fibromyalgia and other painful conditions.\n\n【111】无关删除-2:<u>*   Srinivasan R\n*   Greenbaum DS</u>\n\n【112】Chronic abdominal wall pain: a frequently overlooked problem.\n\n【113】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Gastroenterol._ 2002; 97 : 824-830</u></u>\n\n【114】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【115】The Carnett maneuver is not only useful in diagnosis but is also helpful in educating and reassuring patients as to the true source of their pain. Local heat or ice treatments, sometimes accompanied by gentle stretching of the abdominal muscles, have been tried with variable success. With a conservative approach, about 50% of patients will improve over several months of follow-up. Trigger point injections provide relief in about two-thirds of patients. In all cases, the diagnosis helps to provide reassurance, while avoiding unnecessary expense, testing, and confusion.\n\n【116】无关删除-2:<u>*   Costanza CD\n*   Longstreth GF\n*   Liu AL</u>\n\n【117】Chronic abdominal wall pain: clinical features, health care costs, and long-term outcome.\n\n【118】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol._ 2004; 2 : 395-399</u></u>\n\n【119】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (91)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【120】In this case, the pain is too constant and prolonged to represent biliary colic, and the elevated ALT is compatible with fatty liver. The features are not compatible with gastroesophageal reflux, and upper endoscopy did not show any gastritis or ulceration, making it unlikely that a trial of a proton pump inhibitor would be of benefit. The patient does not have atrial fibrillation and is far too young to have (and does not have the pattern to suggest) symptomatic atherosclerosis (the most common conditions associated with mesenteric ischemia).\n\n【121】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【122】The Carnett maneuver can be very useful in both diagnosing chronic abdominal wall pain and reassuring patients who receive that diagnosis.\n\n【123】CASE 4\n------\n\n【124】A 79-year-old man was diagnosed as having prostate cancer 3 years ago after an area of induration was found on rectal examination. At that time, biopsy revealed Gleason 3+4 adenocarcinoma. He was treated with a course of external-beam radiation therapy that was well tolerated, and his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level decreased from a baseline level of 2.8 ng/mL (to convert to μg/L, multiply by 1) to a nadir of 0.3 ng/mL. He continued to feel well but had a biochemical recurrence of his cancer, and his PSA increased 9 months ago to 2.3 ng/mL. This prompted the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy with leuprolide and bicalutamide.\n\n【125】At presentation, the patient has mild hot flashes but otherwise feels well. He specifically denies any pain, dyspnea, neurologic symptoms, abdominal discomfort, melena, or hematochezia. Findings on examination are unremarkable. Findings on a screening colonoscopy performed 2 years previously were normal.\n\n【126】### Medications\n\n【127】*   Omeprazole, 20 mg once daily\n\n【128】*   Lisinopril, 10 mg once daily\n\n【129】*   Hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg once daily\n\n【130】*   Leuprolide, 22.5 mg intramuscularly every 3 months\n\n【131】*   Bicalutamide, 50 mg once daily\n\n【132】*   Alendronate, 70 mg once weekly\n\n【133】*   Vitamin D, 1000 IU once daily\n\n【134】*   Calcium, 600 mg twice daily\n\n【135】### Laboratory Results\n\n【136】*   Hemoglobin, 12.3 g/dL (vs 14.2 g/dL 1 year ago) (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10)\n\n【137】*   Mean corpuscular volume, 90 fL\n\n【138】*   White blood cell count and platelets, normal\n\n【139】*   Serum creatinine, 1.2 mg/dL\n\n【140】*   PSA, <0.10 ng/mL\n\n【141】### Question\n\n【142】Which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ next step in the evaluation of this patient's anemia?\n\n【143】*   a.\n\n【144】    Discontinue omeprazole\n\n【145】*   b.\n\n【146】    Perform bone scan\n\n【147】*   c.\n\n【148】    Repeat colonoscopy\n\n【149】*   d.\n\n【150】    Conduct serum ferritin assay\n\n【151】*   e.\n\n【152】    Recheck hemoglobin concentration in 3 to 6 months\n\n【153】### Discussion\n\n【154】The lower limit of the reference range for hemoglobin concentration in men is about 2 g/dL higher than in women, almost exclusively as a result of the influence of testosterone. Biochemically castrated men thus would be expected to have concentrations of serum hemoglobin within the normal female range.

Only about 14% of patients develop a hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dL or lower, with symptoms referable to anemia.\n\n【165】In this patient, iron deficiency is not suggested by the data, and the reasons for the decrease in hemoglobin concentration are well understood, making a ferritin assay or a second colonoscopy unnecessary. Although omeprazole may interfere with iron absorption in those who are receiving iron replacement therapy, it should not produce a de novo normocytic anemia. The patient's prostate cancer is biochemically in remission, and he has no bone symptoms.\n\n【166】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【167】Androgen deprivation therapy produces a predictable decrease in hemoglobin; in the absence of bleeding or other causes of anemia, this decrease does not require additional diagnostic testing and may simply be periodically monitored for stability.\n\n【168】CASE 5\n------\n\n【169】A 78-year-old man whose type 2 diabetes mellitus has been well controlled with metformin for the past 5 years presents with mild paresthesia and decreased sensation in his toes during the past year.

Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of tubular creatinine secretion and may also interfere with excretion of potassium.\n\n【258】Several studies have documented an increase of 15% to 30% in serum creatinine levels with the use of trimethoprim, which would be compatible with the effect seen in this patient.

The main outcome measures were adverse reactions to intravenously administered phytonadione, prothrombin– international normalized ratio time values, the incidence of bleeding and thrombosis after the procedure, and the time between the procedure and return to anticoagulation after resumption of warfarin treatment.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Two (1.9%) of the 105 patients studied had suspected adverse reactions to intravenous phytonadione (dyspnea and chest tightness during infusion in both). For the 82 patients who underwent a procedure, the median time from phytonadione to procedure onset was 27 hours (range, 0.7–147 hours), which was significantly less for patients receiving an initial phytonadione dose of more than 1 mg ( _P_ \\=.009). None had thromboembolism after surgery, although 2 (2.4%) of the 82 patients had procedure-associated major bleeding. For the 60 patients resuming warfarin therapy after a procedure, the median time to return to therapeutic anticoagulation was 4.1 days (range, 0.8–31.7 days) and was unaffected by the phytonadione dosage.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Intravenous phytonadione appears to be safe and is effective for semiurgent correction of long-term oral anticoagulation therapy before surgery. In small doses, it does not prolong the patient's time to return to therapeutic anticoagulation.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】INR ( international normalized ratio ), IV ( intravenous ), PT ( prothrombin time )\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Responders from the SB phase (patients with improvements on the International Restless Legs Scale \\[IRLS\\] and investigator-rated Clinical Global Impression–Improvement scale at week 24 and stable while taking a gabapentin enacarbil dose of 1200 mg for at least 1 month before randomization) were randomized to gabapentin enacarbil, 1200 mg, or placebo once daily at 5 pm with food. The primary end point was the proportion of patients experiencing relapse (worse scores on the IRLS and investigator-rated Clinical Global Impression of Change scale on 2 consecutive visits at least 1 week apart or withdrawal because of lack of efficacy) during the DB phase.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】A total of 221 of 327 patients completed the SB phase, 194 (96 in the gabapentin enacarbil group and 98 in the placebo group) were randomized to DB treatment, and 168 (84 in the gabapentin enacarbil group and 84 in the placebo group) completed the DB phase. A significantly smaller proportion of patients treated with gabapentin enacarbil (9/96 \\[9%\\]) experienced relapse compared with the placebo-treated patients (22/97 \\[23%\\]) (odds ratio, 0.353; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.8; _P_ \\=.02).

We do not know if depressed students are more apathetic and less likely to fill out surveys on QOL and depression or if, on the other hand, they are more likely to complete such surveys because the survey content is more relevant to their circumstances. As pointed out by Drs Khoo and Tan, there may be other factors as well that impede minority students from filling out survey forms. As we pointed out in the discussion, minority students may feel that their anonymity is threatened because there are few minority students like them. Specifically, survey forms that seek information on age, sex, and ethnic groups may be perceived as being unduly revealing. Further research is needed to explore these issues and other possible barriers to participating in survey research.\n\n【1】Although not reported, the survey did ask students if they were currently being treated for depression or anxiety. There was no difference by minority group in response to this question (6% minority vs 11% nonminority; _P_ \\=.17). We agree that this question is sensitive and vulnerable to reporting bias.\n\n【2】The survey instrument did include questions about the use of illicit substances (marijuana, methylenedioxymethamphetamine \\[XTC, ecstasy\\], amphetamines, and other substances). As expected, the prevalence of students using such illicit substances was exceedingly low, and thus we did not analyze the data by minority status.\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【5】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/82.2.252</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>© 2007 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. People who have malaria usually feel very sick with a high fever and shaking chills.\n\n【2】While the disease is uncommon in temperate climates, malaria is still common in tropical and subtropical countries. Each year nearly 290 million people are infected with malaria, and more than 400,000 people die of the disease.\n\n【3】To reduce malaria infections, world health programs distribute preventive drugs and insecticide-treated bed nets to protect people from mosquito bites. The World Health Organization has recommended a malaria vaccine for use in children who live in countries with high numbers of malaria cases.\n\n【4】Protective clothing, bed nets and insecticides can protect you while traveling. You also can take preventive medicine before, during and after a trip to a high-risk area. Many malaria parasites have developed resistance to common drugs used to treat the disease.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms of malaria may include:\n\n【7】*   Fever\n*   Chills\n*   General feeling of discomfort\n*   Headache\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Muscle or joint pain\n*   Fatigue\n*   Rapid breathing\n*   Rapid heart rate\n*   Cough\n\n【8】Some people who have malaria experience cycles of malaria \"attacks.\" An attack usually starts with shivering and chills, followed by a high fever, followed by sweating and a return to normal temperature.\n\n【9】Malaria signs and symptoms typically begin within a few weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito. However, some types of malaria parasites can lie dormant in your body for up to a year.\n\n【10】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【11】Talk to your doctor if you experience a fever while living in or after traveling to a high-risk malaria region. If you have severe symptoms, seek emergency medical attention.\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】Malaria is caused by a single-celled parasite of the genus plasmodium. The parasite is transmitted to humans most commonly through mosquito bites.\n\n【14】### Mosquito transmission cycle\n\n【15】*   **Uninfected mosquito.** A mosquito becomes infected by feeding on a person who has malaria.\n*   **Transmission of parasite.** If this mosquito bites you in the future, it can transmit malaria parasites to you.\n*   **In the liver.** Once the parasites enter your body, they travel to your liver — where some types can lie dormant for as long as a year.\n*   **Into the bloodstream.** When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect your red blood cells. This is when people typically develop malaria symptoms.\n*   **On to the next person.** If an uninfected mosquito bites you at this point in the cycle, it will become infected with your malaria parasites and can spread them to the other people it bites.\n\n【16】### Other modes of transmission\n\n【17】Because the parasites that cause malaria affect red blood cells, people can also catch malaria from exposure to infected blood, including:\n\n【18】*   From mother to unborn child\n*   Through blood transfusions\n*   By sharing needles used to inject drugs\n\n【19】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【20】The greatest risk factor for developing malaria is to live in or to visit areas where the disease is common. These include the tropical and subtropical regions of:\n\n【21】*   Sub-Saharan Africa\n*   South and Southeast Asia\n*   Pacific Islands\n*   Central America and northern South America\n\n【22】The degree of risk depends on local malaria control, seasonal changes in malaria rates and the precautions you take to prevent mosquito bites.\n\n【23】### Risks of more-severe disease\n\n【24】People at increased risk of serious disease include:\n\n【25】*   Young children and infants\n*   Older adults\n*   Travelers coming from areas with no malaria\n*   Pregnant women and their unborn children\n\n【26】In many countries with high malaria rates, the problem is worsened by lack of access to preventive measures, medical care and information.\n\n【27】### Immunity can wane\n\n【28】Residents of a malaria region may be exposed to the disease enough to acquire a partial immunity, which can lessen the severity of malaria symptoms. However, this partial immunity can disappear if you move to a place where you're no longer frequently exposed to the parasite.\n\n【29】Complications\n-------------\n\n【30】Malaria can be fatal, particularly when caused by the plasmodium species common in Africa. The World Health Organization estimates that about 94% of all malaria deaths occur in Africa — most commonly in children under the age of 5.\n\n【31】Malaria deaths are usually related to one or more serious complications, including:\n\n【32】*   **Cerebral malaria.** If parasite-filled blood cells block small blood vessels to your brain (cerebral malaria), swelling of your brain or brain damage may occur. Cerebral malaria may cause seizures and coma.\n*   **Breathing problems.** Accumulated fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema) can make it difficult to breathe.\n*   **Organ failure.** Malaria can damage the kidneys or liver or cause the spleen to rupture. Any of these conditions can be life-threatening.\n*   **Anemia.** Malaria may result in not having enough red blood cells for an adequate supply of oxygen to your body's tissues (anemia).\n*   **Low blood sugar.** Severe forms of malaria can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), as can quinine — a common medication used to combat malaria. Very low blood sugar can result in coma or death.\n\n【33】### Malaria may recur\n\n【34】Some varieties of the malaria parasite, which typically cause milder forms of the disease, can persist for years and cause relapses.\n\n【35】Prevention\n----------\n\n【36】If you live in or are traveling to an area where malaria is common, take steps to avoid mosquito bites. Mosquitoes are most active between dusk and dawn. To protect yourself from mosquito bites, you should:\n\n【37】*   **Cover your skin.** Wear pants and long-sleeved shirts. Tuck in your shirt, and tuck pant legs into socks.\n*   **Apply insect repellent to skin.** Use an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone. Do not use a spray directly on your face. Do not use products with oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or p-Menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) on children under age 3.\n*   **Apply repellent to clothing.** Sprays containing permethrin are safe to apply to clothing.\n*   **Sleep under a net.** Bed nets, particularly those treated with insecticides, such as permethrin, help prevent mosquito bites while you are sleeping.\n\n【38】### Preventive medicine\n\n【39】If you'll be traveling to a location where malaria is common, talk to your doctor a few months ahead of time about whether you should take drugs before, during and after your trip to help protect you from malaria parasites.\n\n【40】In general, the drugs taken to prevent malaria are the same drugs used to treat the disease. What drug you take depends on where and how long you are traveling and your own health.\n\n【41】### Vaccine\n\n【42】The World Health Organization has recommended a malaria vaccine for use in children who live in countries with high numbers of malaria cases.\n\n【43】Researchers are continuing to develop and study malaria vaccines to prevent infection.\n\n【44】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "125b5aca-d8e3-41f5-9e08-81094abca8a8", "title": "Intestinal ischemia", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Intestinal ischemia (is-KEE-me-uh) describes a variety of conditions that occur when blood flow to your intestines decreases. Ischemia can be due to a fully or partially blocked blood vessel, usually an artery, or low blood pressure leading to an overall reduced blood flow. Intestinal ischemia can affect your small intestine, your large intestine (colon) or both.\n\n【2】The decreased blood flow doesn't provide enough oxygen for the cells in your digestive system. Intestinal ischemia is a serious condition that can cause pain and make it difficult for your intestines to work properly. In severe cases, loss of blood flow to the intestines can damage intestinal tissue and possibly lead to death.\n\n【3】Treatments are available for intestinal ischemia. To improve the chances of recovery, it's crucial to recognize the early symptoms and get medical help right away.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of intestinal ischemia can develop suddenly (acute) or gradually (chronic). Signs and symptoms may be different from one person to the next, but there are some generally recognized patterns that suggest intestinal ischemia.\n\n【6】### Symptoms of sudden (acute) intestinal ischemia\n\n【7】Signs and symptoms of acute intestinal ischemia typically include:\n\n【8】*   Sudden belly (abdominal) pain that may be mild, moderate or severe\n*   An urgent need to have a bowel movement\n*   Frequent, forceful bowel movements\n*   Abdominal tenderness or bloating (distention)\n*   Blood in your stool\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Mental confusion in older adults\n\n【9】### Symptoms of gradually developing (chronic) intestinal ischemia\n\n【10】Signs and symptoms of chronic intestinal ischemia can include:\n\n【11】*   Abdominal cramps or fullness, usually within 30 minutes after eating, and lasting 1 to 3 hours\n*   Abdominal pain that gets gradually worse over weeks or months\n*   Fear of eating because of pain that happens after eating\n*   Unintended weight loss\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Bloating\n\n【12】### When to see a doctor\n\n【13】Seek immediate medical care if you have sudden, severe abdominal pain. Pain that makes you so uncomfortable that you can't sit still or find a comfortable position is a medical emergency.\n\n【14】If you have other signs or symptoms that worry you, make an appointment with your health care provider.\n\n【15】Causes\n------\n\n【16】Intestinal ischemia occurs when the blood flow through the major blood vessels that supply blood to (arteries) and from (veins) your intestines slows or stops. The condition has many possible causes. These can include:\n\n【17】*   Blockage in an artery caused by a blood clot\n*   Narrowing of an artery due to buildup of fatty deposits, such as cholesterol (atherosclerosis)\n*   Low blood pressure leading to an overall reduced blood flow\n*   Blockage in a vein, less commonly\n\n【18】Intestinal ischemia is often divided into categories. Colon ischemia (ischemic colitis) affects the large intestine. Types of ischemia that affect the small intestine include acute mesenteric ischemia, chronic mesenteric ischemia and ischemia due to mesenteric venous thrombosis.\n\n【19】### Colon ischemia (ischemic colitis)\n\n【20】This type of intestinal ischemia, which is the most common, occurs when blood flow to part of the colon is slowed or blocked. The cause of reduced blood flow to the colon isn't always clear, but a number of conditions can put you at risk of colon ischemia:\n\n【21】*   Dangerously low blood pressure (hypotension) related to dehydration, heart failure, major surgery, trauma or shock\n*   A blood clot or severe atherosclerosis in an artery supplying the colon\n*   Twisting of the bowel (volvulus) or trapping of intestinal contents within a hernia\n*   Excessive bowel enlargement from bowel blockage caused by scar tissue or a tumor\n*   Other medical disorders that affect your blood, such as inflammation of your blood vessels (vasculitis), lupus or sickle cell anemia\n*   Medications that narrow (constrict) blood vessels, such as some used to treat heart disease and migraine\n*   Hormonal medications, such as birth control pills\n*   Cocaine or methamphetamine use\n*   Vigorous exercise, such as long-distance running\n\n【22】### Acute mesenteric ischemia\n\n【23】Mesenteric ischemia occurs when narrowed or blocked arteries restrict blood flow to your small intestine. Decreased blood flow can permanently damage the small intestine.\n\n【24】Acute mesenteric ischemia is the result of a sudden loss of blood flow to the small intestine. It may be due to:\n\n【25】*   **A blood clot (embolus) that comes loose from your heart** and travels through your bloodstream to block an artery. It usually blocks the superior mesenteric artery, which supplies oxygen-rich blood to your intestines. This is the most common cause of acute mesenteric artery ischemia. This type can be brought on by congestive heart failure, an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) or a heart attack.\n*   **A blockage that develops within one of the main intestinal arteries** and slows or stops blood flow. This often is a result of atherosclerosis. This type of sudden ischemia tends to occur in people with chronic intestinal ischemia.\n*   **Impaired blood flow resulting from low blood pressure** due to shock, heart failure, certain medications or chronic kidney failure. This is more common in people who have other serious illnesses and who have some degree of atherosclerosis. This type of acute mesenteric ischemia is often referred to as nonocclusive ischemia, which means that it's not due to a blockage in the artery.\n\n【26】### Chronic mesenteric ischemia\n\n【27】Chronic mesenteric ischemia results from the buildup of fatty deposits on an artery wall (atherosclerosis). The disease process is generally gradual. It's also known as intestinal angina because it results in decreased blood flow to the intestines after eating. You may not require treatment until at least two of the three major arteries supplying your intestines become severely narrowed or completely blocked.\n\n【28】A possibly dangerous complication of chronic mesenteric ischemia is developing a blood clot within a narrowed artery. This can cause blood flow to be suddenly blocked, resulting in acute mesenteric ischemia.\n\n【29】### Ischemia due to mesenteric venous thrombosis\n\n【30】This ischemia occurs when blood can't leave your small intestines. A blood clot can develop in a vein draining blood from your intestines. Veins carry blood that has had the oxygen removed back to the heart. When the vein is blocked, blood backs up in the intestines, causing swelling and bleeding. This may result from:\n\n【31】*   Acute or chronic irritation and swelling (inflammation) of your pancreas (pancreatitis)\n*   Infection inside your belly (abdominal infection)\n*   Cancers of the digestive system\n*   Bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or diverticulitis\n*   Disorders that make your blood more prone to clotting (hypercoagulation disorders), such as an inherited clotting disorder\n*   Medications such as estrogen that can increase clotting risk\n*   Abdominal injuries\n\n【32】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【33】Factors that may increase your risk of intestinal ischemia include:\n\n【34】*   **Buildup of fatty deposits in your arteries (atherosclerosis).** If you've had other conditions caused by atherosclerosis you have an increased risk of intestinal ischemia. These conditions include decreased blood flow to your heart (coronary artery disease), legs (peripheral vascular disease) or the arteries supplying your brain (carotid artery disease).\n*   **Age.** People older than 50 are more likely to develop intestinal ischemia.\n*   **Smoking.** Cigarettes and other forms of smoked tobacco increase your risk of intestinal ischemia.\n*   **Heart and blood vessel problems.** Your risk of intestinal ischemia is increased if you have congestive heart failure or an irregular heartbeat such as atrial fibrillation. Blood vessel diseases that result in irritation and inflammation of veins and arteries (vasculitis) may also increase risk.\n*   **Medications.** Certain medications may increase your risk of intestinal ischemia. Examples include birth control pills and medications that cause your blood vessels to expand or contract, such as some allergy medications and migraine medications.\n*   **Blood-clotting problems.** Diseases and conditions that increase your risk of blood clots may increase your risk of intestinal ischemia. Examples include sickle cell anemia and the Factor V Leiden mutation.\n*   **Other health conditions.** For example, having high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol can increase the risk of intestinal ischemia.\n*   **Recreational drug use.** Cocaine and methamphetamine use have been linked to intestinal ischemia.\n\n【35】Complications\n-------------\n\n【36】Complications of intestinal ischemia can include:\n\n【37】*   **Death of intestinal tissue.** If blood flow to your intestine is completely and suddenly blocked, intestinal tissue can die (gangrene).\n*   **A hole through the wall of the intestines** **(perforation).** A perforation can develop, which can cause the contents of the intestine to leak into the abdominal cavity. This may cause a serious infection (peritonitis).\n*   **Scarring or narrowing of your intestine.** Sometimes the intestines can recover from ischemia, but as part of the healing process the body forms scar tissue that narrows or blocks the intestines. This occurs most often in the colon. Rarely this happens in the small intestines.\n\n【38】Other health conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), can worsen the severity of intestinal ischemia. Emphysema, a type of COPD, and other smoking-related lung diseases increase this risk.\n\n【39】In some cases, intestinal ischemia can result in death.\n\n【40】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "a45872c2-fccb-4565-827b-a74e1bf9bdc9", "title": "Crohn's disease", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It causes swelling of the tissues (inflammation) in your digestive tract, which can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition.\n\n【2】Inflammation caused by Crohn's disease can involve different areas of the digestive tract in different people, most commonly the small intestine. This inflammation often spreads into the deeper layers of the bowel.\n\n【3】Crohn's disease can be both painful and debilitating, and sometimes may lead to life-threatening complications.\n\n【4】There's no known cure for Crohn's disease, but therapies can greatly reduce its signs and symptoms and even bring about long-term remission and healing of inflammation. With treatment, many people with Crohn's disease are able to function well.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】In Crohn's disease, any part of your small or large intestine can be involved. It may involve multiple segments, or it may be continuous. In some people, the disease is only in the colon, which is part of the large intestine.\n\n【7】Signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease can range from mild to severe. They usually develop gradually, but sometimes will come on suddenly, without warning. You may also have periods of time when you have no signs or symptoms (remission).\n\n【8】When the disease is active, symptoms typically include:\n\n【9】*   Diarrhea\n*   Fever\n*   Fatigue\n*   Abdominal pain and cramping\n*   Blood in your stool\n*   Mouth sores\n*   Reduced appetite and weight loss\n*   Pain or drainage near or around the anus due to inflammation from a tunnel into the skin (fistula)\n\n【10】### Other signs and symptoms\n\n【11】People with severe Crohn's disease may also experience symptoms outside of the intestinal tract, including:\n\n【12】*   Inflammation of skin, eyes and joints\n*   Inflammation of the liver or bile ducts\n*   Kidney stones\n*   Iron deficiency (anemia)\n*   Delayed growth or sexual development, in children\n\n【13】### When to see a doctor\n\n【14】See your doctor if you have persistent changes in your bowel habits or if you have any of the signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease, such as:\n\n【15】*   Abdominal pain\n*   Blood in your stool\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Diarrhea lasting more than two weeks\n*   Unexplained weight loss\n*   Fever in addition to any of the above symptoms\n\n【16】Causes\n------\n\n【17】The exact cause of Crohn's disease remains unknown. Previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now doctors know that these factors may aggravate, but don't cause, Crohn's disease. Several factors likely play a role in its development.\n\n【18】*   **Immune system.** It's possible that a virus or bacterium may trigger Crohn's disease; however, scientists have yet to identify such a trigger. When your immune system tries to fight off an invading microorganism or environmental triggers, an atypical immune response causes the immune system to attack the cells in the digestive tract, too.\n*   **Heredity.** Crohn's disease is more common in people who have family members with the disease, so genes may play a role in making people more likely to have it. However, most people with Crohn's disease do not have a family history of the disease.\n\n【19】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【20】Risk factors for Crohn's disease may include:\n\n【21】*   **Age.** Crohn's disease can occur at any age, but you're likely to develop the condition when you're young. Most people who develop Crohn's disease are diagnosed before they're around 30 years old.\n*   **Ethnicity.** Although Crohn's disease can affect any ethnic group, whites have the highest risk, especially people of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent. However, the incidence of Crohn's disease is increasing among Black people who live in North America and the United Kingdom. Crohn's disease is also being increasingly seen in the Middle Eastern population and among migrants to the United States.\n*   **Family history.** You're at higher risk if you have a first-degree relative, such as a parent, sibling or child, with the disease. As many as 1 in 5 people with Crohn's disease has a family member with the disease.\n*   **Cigarette smoking.** Cigarette smoking is the most important controllable risk factor for developing Crohn's disease. Smoking also leads to more-severe disease and a greater risk of having surgery. If you smoke, it's important to stop.\n*   **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.** These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve), diclofenac sodium and others. While they do not cause Crohn's disease, they can lead to inflammation of the bowel that makes Crohn's disease worse.\n\n【22】Complications\n-------------\n\n【23】Crohn's disease may lead to one or more of the following complications:\n\n【24】*   **Bowel obstruction.** Crohn's disease can affect the entire thickness of the intestinal wall. Over time, parts of the bowel can scar and narrow, which may block the flow of digestive contents, often known as a stricture. You may require surgery to widen the stricture or sometimes to remove the diseased portion of your bowel.\n*   **Ulcers.** Chronic inflammation can lead to open sores (ulcers) anywhere in your digestive tract, including your mouth and anus, and in the genital area (perineum).\n*   **Fistulas.** Sometimes ulcers can extend completely through the intestinal wall, creating a fistula — an abnormal connection between different body parts. Fistulas can develop between your intestine and your skin, or between your intestine and another organ. Fistulas near or around the anal area (perianal) are the most common kind.\n\n【25】    When fistulas develop inside the abdomen, it may lead to infections and abscesses, which are collections of pus. These can be life-threatening if not treated. Fistulas may form between loops of bowel, in the bladder or vagina, or through the skin, causing continuous drainage of bowel contents to your skin.\n\n【26】*   **Anal fissure.** This is a small tear in the tissue that lines the anus or in the skin around the anus where infections can occur. It's often associated with painful bowel movements and may lead to a perianal fistula.\n*   **Malnutrition.** Diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping may make it difficult for you to eat or for your intestine to absorb enough nutrients to keep you nourished. It's also common to develop anemia due to low iron or vitamin B-12 caused by the disease.\n*   **Colon cancer.** Having Crohn's disease that affects your colon increases your risk of colon cancer. General colon cancer screening guidelines for people without Crohn's disease call for a colonoscopy at least every 10 years beginning at age 45. In people with Crohn's disease affecting a large part of the colon, a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer is recommended about 8 years after disease onset and generally is performed every 1 to 2 years afterward. Ask your doctor whether you need to have this test done sooner and more frequently.\n*   **Skin disorders.** Many people with Crohn's disease may also develop a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa. This skin disorder involves deep nodules, tunnels and abscesses in the armpits, groin, under the breasts, and in the perianal or genital area.\n*   **Other health problems.** Crohn's disease can also cause problems in other parts of the body. Among these problems are low iron (anemia), osteoporosis, arthritis, and gallbladder or liver disease.\n*   **Medication risks.** Certain Crohn's disease drugs that act by blocking functions of the immune system are associated with a small risk of developing cancers such as lymphoma and skin cancers. They also increase the risk of infections.\n\n【27】    Corticosteroids can be associated with a risk of osteoporosis, bone fractures, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes and high blood pressure, among other conditions. Work with your doctor to determine risks and benefits of medications.\n\n【28】*   **Blood clots.** Crohn's disease increases the risk of blood clots in veins and arteries.\n\n【29】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Sumner (1887-1955) and Wendell M. Stanley (1904-1971), for successfully purifying and crystallizing certain enzymes, thus allowing the chemical nature of these substances to be determined. Stanley crystallized and studied the tobacco mosaic virus, Sumner isolated and crystallized a protein he considered to be urease, and Northrop isolated and identified several enzymes.\n\n【2】Northrop was born on July 5, 1891, in Yonkers, NY. His father was a zoology instructor at Columbia University in New York City, and his mother was a botanist. Just before Northrop was born, his father was killed in a laboratory explosion, and his mother had to resume her position as a botany teacher at HunterCollege in New York City. Northrop attended elementary and secondary schools in New York and graduated from high school in 1908. After graduation, he entered Columbia University and received a BA degree in 1912, an MA degree in 1913, and a PhD degree with a major in chemistry in 1915.\n\n【3】After receiving his doctorate, Northrop was awarded a 1-year traveling fellowship that allowed him to work at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (New York City). Subsequently, he was appointed an assistant at the institute, and in 1917, he became an associate to the faculty.\n\n【4】During World War I (1914-1918), Northrop served as a captain in the US Chemical Warfare Service and conducted research on fermentation processes suitable for the industrial production of acetone and ethyl alcohol. After the war, he returned to the Rockefeller Institute and resumed his investigations on protein. This work led to the study of enzymes.\n\n【5】In 1920, enzymes were relatively mysterious substances, although they had been discovered in 1902 by German chemist Eduard Buchner (1860-1912), who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1907. Northrop's research on enzymes led to the crystallization of pepsin in 1930. In the course of this work, he established that pepsin is a protein, thus resolving the dispute about whether enzymes were proteins. Using the same chemical methods, he also helped to isolate and prepare in crystalline form the inactive precursor of pepsin pepsinogen (which is converted to the active enzyme through a reaction with hydrochloric acid in the stomach), the pancreatic digestive enzymes trypsin (1932) and chy-motrypsin (1935), and their inactive precursors trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. In 1938, he isolated the bacterial virus (bacteriophage) and proved that the virus was anucle-oprotein.\n\n【6】From 1916 to his retirement in 1961, Northrop was associated with the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City. During World War II (1939-1945), he served as a consultant and official investigator for the National Defense Research Committee. His wartime work led to the development of methods for the automatic detection of chemical weapons. From 1949 to 1958, he also served as a visiting professor of bacteriology and biophysics at the University of California at Berkeley and was resident biophysicist at the Donner Laboratory there from 1958 to 1959. Among his many scientific literary efforts was his 1939 book _Crystalline Enzymes._\n\n【7】On May 27, 1987, at the age of 95 years, Northrop died in Wickenburg, Ariz (about 45 miles northwest of Phoenix). He was honored on a stamp issued by Gabon in 1995.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【10】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/75.3.254</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>© 2000 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Authors who support these journals expect that their manuscripts will be reviewed promptly and professionally, and, if accepted for publication, processed and published as quickly as is feasible. It is likely that these same readers and authors seldom reflect on the dozens of support personnel and multimillion dollar budgets required to make these processes work. Nevertheless, running the business of a major journal is as critical as selecting the manuscripts to publish if those journals are to survive and thrive. At individual journals, the methods for generating revenues and balancing budgets are almost as diverse as the journals' content. At _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , we have operated on a model first introduced in 1926 by the Mayo brothers (Drs William J. and Charles H.), in which the journal generates most of its revenue independently of readers, and readers within the targeted demographic receive complimentary copies of the journal. This model has served us well, and from 1999-2006 the journal experienced financial prosperity unlike anytime in its 83-year history. However, the prosperity that the _Proceedings_ and other journals have experienced in recent years has been threatened by a 2006-present recession (or perhaps more correctly, depression) in the advertising markets on which we depend. To compensate for these shortfalls, without interrupting critical journal programs and services, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is, for the first time in its history, asking you, our core readers, to assist us by considering the voluntary purchase of an electronic or electronic plus print subscription of the journal.\n\n【2】In the following paragraphs, I share with you the good news of how the _Proceedings_ is working to refine the quality and distribution of its content. I then review some critical elements of our business model and why your support is so vital for the present and—more importantly—future of the journal.\n\n【3】Current Status of Journal Content\n---------------------------------\n\n【4】For the past decade, the journal has engaged in a quality-improvement process termed “The Evolution of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ .”\n\n【5】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier WL</u>\n\n【6】The evolution of Mayo Clinic Proceedings \\[editorial\\].\n\n【7】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2000; 75 : 8-9</u></u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (12)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【9】The goal has been to improve manuscript processing, diversity of authorship, and quality of journal content. We are pleased to report progress in all these areas. For example (using 1998 as our baseline year), at the end of 2008, we note the following:\n\n【10】*   1.\n\n【11】    A simple average of the time from manuscript receipt to the first decision to authors has decreased from 11 weeks in 1998 to 3 weeks in 2008 (a reduction of 73%).\n\n【12】*   2.\n\n【13】    Overall acceptance rate was 60% in 1998 and approximately 25% in 2008 (a relative 58% reduction). This was made possible by a dramatic increase in the number of manuscripts submitted to the journal during a period in which the number of published pages declined by approximately 20%. The latter was accomplished, without affecting the journal's mission, by supplanting longer, lesser-quality manuscripts, with shorter, higher-quality manuscripts. As such, readers' reading time could be used more efficiently.\n\n【14】*   3.\n\n【15】    In its first half-century of activity, journal content was authored almost exclusively by Mayo Clinic physicians and scientists. By 1998, although authors not affiliated with Mayo Clinic were submitting materials to the journal, few of these authors were being published in the most prestigious sections of the journal (ie, original articles and full-length reviews). Today, we see a dramatically different pattern. Currently, some 70% of all submissions originate with authors not affiliated with Mayo Clinic. These authors represent many of the world's leading academic institutions, and the acceptance rates of their manuscripts have parity with manuscripts from Mayo Clinic authors. As such, the journal is living up to the letter and spirit of its motto, “A Peer-Reviewed Medical Journal Sponsored by Mayo Clinic and Authored by Physicians Worldwide.”\n\n【16】*   4.\n\n【17】    Journal quality has steadily improved, as documented by the following metrics:\n\n【18】    *   a.\n\n【19】        Impact factor (a metric of how frequently articles published in the _Proceedings_ are subsequently cited in indexed publications; indirectly, a metric of the quality of journal content) has improved each of the past 8 years, from a baseline of 2.0 to the current value of 4.36 (ISI Webof Knowledge, Thompson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA). The Editorial Board projects that the impact factor will increase for the ninth consecutive year when the new values are released in the summer of 2009. At that time, the journal expects to approximate its intermediate goal of an impact factor of 5.0 before advancing beyond.\n\n【20】    *   b.\n\n【21】        In recent years, overall readership of the journal (quantified by PERQ/HCI, Princeton, NJ) has consistently ranked among the world's elite general/internal medical journals. In 2006, the journal desired to increase its circulation among hematology/oncology and cardiology readers and this initiative led to changes in the journal's Editorial Board and journal content. Publication of collections of hematology/oncology and cardiology symposium articles 删除4:<u>(see subsequent discussion)</u> are just one aspect of this initiative, as was redistribution of the journal's 130,000 print circulation in November 2007 to reach more than 8600 hematologists and oncologists. Much to the Editorial Board's delight, with the release of the June 2008 readership ratings, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ was reported to have a relative 58% annual increase in hematology/oncology total readers (PERQ/HCI). This occurred in a hematology/oncology readership market long believed to have reached its maturity and in which upward readership changes for indexed journals are rare. We hope to see similar improvements in cardiology readership in 2009.\n\n【22】    *   c.\n\n【23】        Aside from a print circulation of 130,000, the journal has an impressive Web presence. In 1999, the _Proceedings_ ' Web site was visited 10,000 times _per year_ . By the end of 2008, the Web site was being visited 10,000 to 14,000 times _per day._\n\n【24】Evolving Programs and Initiatives\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】无关删除-2:<u>*   1.\n\n【26】    In August 2006, the _Proceedings_ completed its “Symposium on Oncology Practice: Hematological Malignancies” and published a bound volume of the serialized chapters in a book entitled _Neoplastic Hematology: Diagnosis and Treatment_ ( Figure, left ).

HighWire develops and hosts the definitive online content from many of the world's most influential journals. This _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ \\-HighWire relationship will provide readers ready access to both the _Proceedings_ ' content and that of 1200 other HighWire-hosted sites, as well as improved search and alerting techniques, pop-up abstract previews, popular lists of the most-viewed and most-cited articles, ability to share journal content through an “e-mail a friend” feature, ability to download figures and tables directly into PowerPoint presentations, seamless interjournal reference linking, and a variety of other features aimed at enriching readers' experiences. To encourage readers to explore our new HighWire Press offerings, access to the February and March 2009 content on our Web site will be provided free of charge to all visitors.\n\n【59】*   4.\n\n【60】    At the end of January 2009, visitors to our Web site can sign up to receive via e-mail our monthly electronic table of contents (e-TOC \\[e-mail alerts\\]). We encourage all to use this valuable feature.\n\n【61】*   5.\n\n【62】    In 2009 and beyond, authors will no longer need to request permission for noncommercial use of their own material, eg, in conference presentations, course materials, and reuse in another journal (provided appropriate credit is given to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ ).\n    </u>\n\n【63】The Contemporary Financial Environment and Its Effect of the _Proceedings_ ' Well-being\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【64】All these aforementioned programs and other services provided by _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ and other large-circulation journals require considerable cash flow and numerous revenue streams if they are to maintain services. The largest and greatest numbers of these revenue streams typically relate to the pharmaceutical and device industries. Those industries purchase print and electronic advertisements, licensing agreements for journal content, reprints, etc, which downstream help make the journal more affordable to authors and readers.\n\n【65】Journal revenues from the pharmaceutical industry are intimately tied to the introduction of new chemical entities (ie, new drugs), largely because advertising for new proprietary drugs greatly exceeds advertising for older or generic drugs. The US pharmaceutical industry has had a steady decline in the introduction of new drugs in recent years. Not surprisingly, advertising revenues from these companies has followed suit. For example, during the 2-year interval 2006 to 2008, journal advertising pages available in the internal medicine market declined approximately 35%, and in the multispecialty medical market, approximately 40% (PERQ/HCI). _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ samples from both these markets.\n\n【66】Although _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ has maintained or increased its share of the available “advertising pie” in recent years (as a result of improved journal content and impressive readership data), the size of the overall “pie” has declined sufficiently that _Proceedings_ ' revenues have suffered. This process began before the global recession of 2008 and has become worse since.\n\n【67】Our Approach to Dealing with Financial Challenges Circa 2009\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【68】Since beginning the “The Evolution of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ ” initiative,\n\n【69】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier WL</u>\n\n【70】The evolution of Mayo Clinic Proceedings \\[editorial\\].\n\n【71】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2000; 75 : 8-9</u></u>\n\n【72】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (12)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【73】the journal has increased its revenue streams from single-digit line items to numerous line items. This has added diversity to our business model, and we have simultaneously restructured our expenses in large measure through modernization of our operation. Despite these progressive changes, we are still left with the fact that many of our revenue streams are related to sources that have been declining in the past several years. In recent months, several journals in our market category have ceased publishing. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ does not plan to join their ranks. In the short-term, we have benefited from gracious fiscal underwriting from Mayo Clinic, our sponsor. However, the journal and its sponsor both recognize that the journal's financial independence is healthy for editorial integrity. As such, aside from continuing the journal's search for new revenue streams and cost reduction, we are now asking for your support.\n\n【74】Your Role in Our Financial Well-being: Voluntary Purchase of Subscriptions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【75】After considerable discussion among the Editorial Board, our publisher (Dowden Health Media), and the journal's sponsor (Mayo Clinic), the journal will activate a program of “voluntary paid subscriptions” for readers who wish to support the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ ' mission. This program is patterned after that used by some colleges' and universities' alumni magazines. Specifically, you will be asked to consider voluntarily purchasing a subscription to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings._\n\n【76】In February, those of you who are interested in purchasing a voluntary subscription can visit the journal's HighWire-hosted site and, by clicking on the subscribe button, purchase either an online-only or print plus online subscription. On the subscription form, there will be a box that can be checked to indicate that you wish to cancel your complimentary subscription and become a paid subscriber. The term of this subscription will be 1 year, at which time you can choose to again contribute to the voluntary subscription program or alternatively return to our complimentary subscription program (provided you are in the targeted audience).\n\n【77】With this plan, 2 important features must be highlighted:\n\n【78】无关删除-2:<u>*   1.\n\n【79】    _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ has, since January 2008, offered continuing medical education (CME) credit for those who read the monthly “Concise Review for Clinicians” and then complete a test based on the content of the article.\n\n【80】    *   Lanier WL\n\n【81】    _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ 2008: Content refinement, continuing medical education credit, web site improvements, and more \\[editorial\\].\n\n【82】删除3:<u>    _Mayo Clin Proc._ 2008; 83 : 13-16</u>\n\n【83】    *   Abstract\n    *   Full Text\n    *   Full Text PDF\n    *   Scopus (3)\n    *   Google Scholar\n\n【84】    On achieving the requisite score, readers can be awarded 1 hour of CME credit for every article read. The Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education guidelines prevent the journal from giving free CME credit to those who receive a complimentary subscription. Instead, CME credit is awarded free of charge only for those with a paid subscription; others must pay on a fee-for-service basis for every hour of CME credit obtained.\n\n【85】    *   Lanier WL\n\n【86】    _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ 2008: Content refinement, continuing medical education credit, web site improvements, and more \\[editorial\\].\n\n【87】删除3:<u>    _Mayo Clin Proc._ 2008; 83 : 13-16</u>\n\n【88】    *   Abstract\n    *   Full Text\n    *   Full Text PDF\n    *   Scopus (3)\n    *   Google Scholar\n\n【89】    Readers who engage in the purchase of a voluntary subscription will be able to obtain unlimited free CME credit on completion of the requisite tests, for the duration of their voluntary paid subscription.\n\n【90】*   2.\n\n【91】    In accordance with _Mayo Clinic Proceedings'_ Business Plan of 2004, funds can flow in only 1 direction between the journal's sponsor, Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN), and the journal's business operations (whose office is in Montvale, NJ). Specifically, the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings'_ Business Plan dictates that all revenues generated by the journal are to be used exclusively to maintain and enhance the journal. As such, readers who have been asked to support the journal through the voluntary purchase of a subscription should recognize that monies acquired through this program will remain with the journal and will not be transferred in any manner to Mayo Clinic proper or its Department of Development.\n    </u>\n\n【92】Summary\n-------\n\n【93】During the past decade, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ has undergone a transformation aimed at ensuring its place among the world's leading indexed biomedical journals. This effort has met with considerable success, particularly in improving the quality of journal content, enhancing the diversity of authors, and using state-of-the-art methods for processing manuscripts and disseminating journal content to readers. This activity represents the efforts of many dedicated individuals, and the journal has done its best to operate in a fiscal environment of disciplined cost containment and creative revenue generation while ensuring journal integrity and content quality. Despite these efforts, the financial exigencies of the marketplace, circa 2009, demand that we use historic methods to ensure the journal's survival and prosperity. As such, we ask you, the readers of this journal, to not only provide us your moral support (as we have asked before) but also to help us with revenue generation. Your willingness to contribute to the fine-tuning of journal operations and journal revenue are greatly appreciated by all of us who love and support the _Proceedings_ .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

It is also used with other medicines to treat partial seizures. Clorazepate is a benzodiazepine. Benzodiazepines belong to the group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) depressants, which are medicines that slow down the nervous system.\n\n【6】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Tablet\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【11】### Allergies\n\n【12】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【13】### Pediatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of clorazepate in children younger than 9 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【15】### Geriatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of clorazepate in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, severe drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, clumsiness, or unsteadiness) and kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving clorazepate.\n\n【17】### Breastfeeding\n\n【18】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【21】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

{"seq_id": "71053dbb-af94-4a77-b7a7-09b8641067fa", "title": "Kaare Nygaard: Surgeon, Scientist, Sculptor", "text": "【0】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【1】In a 1970 design contest, the United Nations (UN) selected a lithograph of a sculpture entitled _Hiroshima_ for a new pair of commemorative stamps, issued to highlight refugee initiatives and garner international support. The UN released these commemoratives (Scott #216-217) in March 1971.\n\n【2】The statue, _Hiroshima,_ was created in 1965 by Norwegian-born sculptor Kaare Kristian Nygaard, a Mayo Clinic-trained surgeon and researcher. In _Hiroshima,_ Dr Nygaard represented the refugee experience by depicting 2 figures carrying their belongings and moving forward together. Dr Nygaard initially did not title the piece; he stated that it could have represented displaced people from any tragic event, including the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. However, because the piece was cast around the 20  anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, it became known as _Hiroshima_ .\n\n【3】Kaare Nygaard was born on November 24, 1903, in Lillehammer, Norway, to Emilie and Johannes Nygaard. His father owned a grocery, and his mother was a midwife. Nygaard’s father died before his 3  birthday; his mother later remarried and had 7 additional children, 3 of whom died at an early age. Throughout his childhood, Nygaard maintained a close relationship with his grandfather, a blacksmith, which prompted a life-long interest in tools and metalworking. Nygaard also had a strong interest in music and was a flutist for the Lillehammer Boys' Band. He briefly contemplated becoming a professional musician, but ultimately chose a career in medicine.\n\n【4】Nygaard attended the University of Oslo and graduated _cum laude_ with a medical degree in 1929. He briefly practiced general medicine in Norway before immigrating to the United States in 1930 to train as a surgeon. Dr Nygaard worked for a short period as a surgical assistant at the Gundersen Clinic in La Crosse, Wisconsin, before completing his training at Mayo Clinic. He served as a fellow in surgery and then assistant to the staff at Mayo Clinic from 1931 to 1940, then moved to Scarsdale, New York, and continued his surgical practice at White Plains Hospital in White Plains, New York, until his retirement in 1980.\n\n【5】In Dr Nygaard’s 4 decades of clinical practice, he cared for tens of thousands of patients, including more than 4000 sick and injured Norwegian sailors in a special ward he established in White Plains Hospital during World War II. This humanitarian effort earned him the honor of Knight’s Cross of the Order of St. Olav, First Class, bestowed by King Haakon VII of Norway.\n\n【6】In 1933, he married Ella Frey, a physical therapist whom he had met as a student in Norway in 1927. They had no children and she died in 1976. In January 1989, Dr Nygaard married Gail Delgado, a registered nurse.\n\n【7】Along with Dr Nygaard’s clinical practice, he was an active researcher with a strong interest in blood coagulation disorders. He published nearly 50 scientific articles on this subject and contributed to the invention of the first machine to use photoelectric principles to analyze blood clotting.\n\n【8】As a surgical fellow, Dr Nygaard and his colleague Dr George Elgie Brown (1885-1935), a Mayo Clinic consultant in medicine with a special interest in vascular diseases, coined the term “essential thrombophilia” in a 1937 case series in which they described 5 patients with sudden occlusion of large arteries that coexisted with venous thromboembolism. Historically, this constellation of findings was referred to as Nygaard-Brown syndrome.\n\n【9】Dr Nygaard devoted the same energy to his artistic work as he did to his surgical practice. At age 15, he produced his first sculpture, a bust of his grandfather. In more than 40 years he created approximately 100 sculptures. He also taught as an artist-in-residence and associate professor at the State University of New York at Purchase.\n\n【10】Dr Nygaard’s works can be found today in private collections around the world. A substantial number were donated to St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, after his death. In 2000, the Ella and Kaare Nygaard Foundation also contributed to a $1 million gift to support art education at St. Olaf.\n\n【11】Dr Nygaard continued to maintain a relationship with Mayo Clinic throughout his life, and donated his statues _Cancer_ and _The Surgeon_ to the Clinic, as well as an Alexander Calder mobile. After his death from prostate cancer on April 22, 1989, and burial in his native Lillehammer, his widow continued this philanthropic support of Mayo Clinic and established a travel award in his memory for young surgeons.\n\n【12】Dr Nygaard’s philosophy toward balancing his artwork and medical practice was simple: “First the physician, then the artist.” Still, one may ask: By the end of Dr Nygaard’s life, did medicine remain a priority above art, or did the work of the surgeon and the sculptor become intertwined?\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Footnotes</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>**Potential Competing Interests:** The authors report no competing interests.</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【17】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.11.014</u></u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-1:<u>© 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research</u>\n\n【20】无关删除-1:<u>### ScienceDirect</u>\n\n【21】无关删除-1:<u>Access this article on ScienceDirect</u>\n\n【22】无关删除-1:<u>Kaare Nygaard: Surgeon, Scientist, Sculptor</u>\n\n【23】无关删除-1:<u>*   </u>\n\n【24】无关删除-1:<u>Hide Caption Download See figure in article</u>\n\n【25】无关删除-1:<u>Toggle Thumbstrip</u>\n\n【26】无关删除-1:<u>*   Figure\n    </u>\n\n【27】无关删除-2:<u>无关删除-1:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download .PPT</u></u>\n\n【28】无关删除-1:<u>Figures\n-------</u>\n\n【29】无关删除-1:<u>*   </u>\n\n【30】无关删除-1:<u>Related Articles\n----------------</u>\n\n【31】无关删除-1:<u>Hide Caption Download See figure in Article</u>\n\n【32】无关删除-1:<u>Toggle Thumbstrip</u>\n\n【33】无关删除-2:<u>无关删除-1:<u>*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download .PPT</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【11】### Allergies\n\n【12】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【21】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【25】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【26】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【27】*   Hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there)—Condition may become worse.\n\n【28】*   High fever and confusion or\n*   Muscle injury, aches, cramps—You should not take tolcapone.\n\n【29】*   Kidney problems, severe—Elimination of tolcapone may be decreased, which increases the risk of unwanted effects.\n\n【30】*   Liver problems or\n*   Liver tests higher than normal—This medicine can increase chances of serious liver problems.

If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【37】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【38】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   For Parkinson's disease:\n        *   Adults—100 milligrams (mg) three times a day, taken in addition to levodopa and carbidopa.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【39】### Missed Dose\n\n【40】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【41】### Storage\n\n【42】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light.

Bactrim\n2.  Bactrim DS\n3.  Septra\n4.  Septra DS\n5.  SMZ-TMP Pediatric\n6.  Sulfatrim\n7.  Sulfatrim Pediatric\n\n【4】### Canadian Brand Name\n\n【5】1.  Apo-Sulfatrim\n2.  Novo-Trimel\n3.  Nu-Cotrimox\n4.  Septa Pediatric\n5.  Septra Pediatric Suspension\n\n【6】### Descriptions\n\n【7】Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim combination is used to treat infections including urinary tract infections, middle ear infections (otitis media), bronchitis, traveler's diarrhea, and shigellosis (bacillary dysentery). This medicine is also used to prevent or treat Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a very serious kind of pneumonia. This type of pneumonia occurs more commonly in patients whose immune systems are not working normally, including cancer patients, transplant patients, and patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\n【8】Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim combination is an antibiotic. It works by eliminating the bacteria that cause many kinds of infections. This medicine will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Tablet\n*   Suspension\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim combination in children 2 months of age and older. Because of the toxicity of the combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, use in infants younger than 2 months of age is not recommended.\n\n【18】### Geriatric\n\n【19】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have a folate deficiency, age-related kidney or liver problems, and may be more likely to experience unwanted side effects (eg, severe skin rash, increased potassium in the body, or problems with blood clotting or the immune system). There may be an adjustment in the dose for elderly patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim combination.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【32】Using this medicine with any of the following is usually not recommended, but may be unavoidable in some cases. If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use this medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【33】*   Ethanol\n\n【34】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【35】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【36】*   Alcohol abuse, history of or\n*   Folate (vitamin B9) deficiency or\n*   HIV or AIDS or\n*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease or\n*   Malabsorption syndrome (difficulty of absorbing food in the body) or\n*   Malnutrition state (nutrition disorder) or\n*   Slow acetylator—Use with caution.

Inclusion criteria included randomized or nonrandomized studies with a minimum CR dose of 4 or higher and presence of a control/comparison group. Citations were considered for inclusion, and data were extracted in included studies independently by 2 investigators. Studies were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression where warranted (covariates included study quality, country, publication year, and diagnosis).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 4630 unique citations, 33 trials were included comparing CR to usual care (ie, no dose). In meta-regression, greater dose was significantly related to lower all-cause mortality (high: −0.77; SE, 0.22; _P_ <.001; medium: −0.80; SE, 0.21; _P_ <.001) when compared with low dose. With regard to morbidity, meta-analysis revealed that dose was significantly associated with fewer percutaneous coronary interventions (high: relative risk, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50-0.84; medium/low: relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.74-1.48; between subgroup difference _P_ \\=.03). This reduction was also significant in meta-regression (high vs medium/low: −0.73; SE, 0.20; _P_ <.001). Publication bias was not evident. No dose-response association was found for cardiovascular mortality, all-cause hospitalization, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or myocardial infarction.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】A minimum of 36 CR sessions may be needed to reduce percutaneous coronary interventions. Future studies should examine the effect of actual dose of CR, and trials are needed comparing different doses.\n\n【9】### PROSPERO Registration\n\n【10】CRD42016036029 .\n\n【11】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【12】CABG ( coronary artery bypass graft ), CCR ( comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation ), CR ( cardiac rehabilitation ), CV ( cardiovascular ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), HF ( heart failure ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), PCI ( percutaneous coronary intervention )\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【20】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

It sits just under your rib cage on the right side of your abdomen. The liver is essential for digesting food and ridding your body of toxic substances.\n\n【2】Liver disease can be inherited (genetic). Liver problems can also be caused by a variety of factors that damage the liver, such as viruses, alcohol use and obesity.\n\n【3】Over time, conditions that damage the liver can lead to scarring (cirrhosis), which can lead to liver failure, a life-threatening condition. But early treatment may give the liver time to heal.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Liver disease doesn't always cause noticeable signs and symptoms. If signs and symptoms of liver disease do occur, they may include:\n\n【6】*   Skin and eyes that appear yellowish (jaundice)\n*   Abdominal pain and swelling\n*   Swelling in the legs and ankles\n*   Itchy skin\n*   Dark urine color\n*   Pale stool color\n*   Chronic fatigue\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Tendency to bruise easily\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you. Seek immediate medical attention if you have abdominal pain that is so severe that you can't stay still.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Liver disease has many causes.\n\n【11】### Infection\n\n【12】Parasites and viruses can infect the liver, causing inflammation that reduces liver function. The viruses that cause liver damage can be spread through blood or semen, contaminated food or water, or close contact with a person who is infected. The most common types of liver infection are hepatitis viruses, including:\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hepatitis A\n*   Hepatitis B\n*   Hepatitis C</u>\n\n【14】### Immune system abnormality\n\n【15】Diseases in which your immune system attacks certain parts of your body (autoimmune) can affect your liver. Examples of autoimmune liver diseases include:\n\n【16】*   Autoimmune hepatitis\n*   Primary biliary cholangitis\n*   Primary sclerosing cholangitis\n\n【17】### Genetics\n\n【18】An abnormal gene inherited from one or both of your parents can cause various substances to build up in your liver, resulting in liver damage. Genetic liver diseases include:\n\n【19】*   Hemochromatosis\n*   Wilson's disease\n*   Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency\n\n【20】### Cancer and other growths\n\n【21】Examples include:\n\n【22】*   Liver cancer\n*   Bile duct cancer\n*   Liver adenoma\n\n【23】### Other\n\n【24】Additional, common causes of liver disease include:\n\n【25】*   Chronic alcohol abuse\n*   Fat accumulation in the liver (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease)\n*   Certain prescription or over-the-counter medications\n*   Certain herbal compounds\n\n【26】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【27】Factors that may increase your risk of liver disease include:\n\n【28】*   Heavy alcohol use\n*   Obesity\n*   Type 2 diabetes\n*   Tattoos or body piercings\n*   Injecting drugs using shared needles\n*   Blood transfusion before 1992\n*   Exposure to other people's blood and body fluids\n*   Unprotected sex\n*   Exposure to certain chemicals or toxins\n*   Family history of liver disease\n\n【29】Complications\n-------------\n\n【30】Complications of liver disease vary, depending on the cause of your liver problems. Untreated liver disease may progress to liver failure, a life-threatening condition.\n\n【31】Prevention\n----------\n\n【32】To prevent liver disease:\n\n【33】*   **Drink alcohol in moderation.** For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. Heavy or high-risk drinking is defined as more than eight drinks a week for women and more than 15 drinks a week for men.\n*   **Avoid risky behavior.** Use a condom during sex. If you choose to have tattoos or body piercings, be picky about cleanliness and safety when selecting a shop. Seek help if you use illicit intravenous drugs, and don't share needles to inject drugs.\n*   **Get vaccinated.** If you're at increased risk of contracting hepatitis or if you've already been infected with any form of the hepatitis virus, talk to your doctor about getting the hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines.\n*   **Use medications wisely.** Take prescription and nonprescription drugs only when needed and only in recommended doses. Don't mix medications and alcohol. Talk to your doctor before mixing herbal supplements or prescription or nonprescription drugs.\n*   **Avoid contact with other people's blood and body fluids.** Hepatitis viruses can be spread by accidental needle sticks or improper cleanup of blood or body fluids.\n*   **Keep your food safe.** Wash your hands thoroughly before eating or preparing foods. If traveling in a developing country, use bottled water to drink, wash your hands and brush your teeth.\n*   **Take care with aerosol sprays.** Make sure to use these products in a well-ventilated area, and wear a mask when spraying insecticides, fungicides, paint and other toxic chemicals. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n*   **Protect your skin.** When using insecticides and other toxic chemicals, wear gloves, long sleeves, a hat and a mask so that chemicals aren't absorbed through your skin.\n*   **Maintain a healthy weight.** Obesity can cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\n【34】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Vira-A\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Vidarabine ophthalmic preparations are used to treat virus infections of the eye.\n\n【6】Vidarabine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【7】Before Using\n------------\n\n【8】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【9】### Allergies\n\n【10】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【11】### Pediatric\n\n【12】Although there is no specific information comparing use of vidarabine in children with use in other age groups, it is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.\n\n【13】### Geriatric\n\n【14】Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of vidarabine in the elderly with use in other age groups.\n\n【15】### Drug Interactions\n\n【16】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【17】### Other Interactions\n\n【18】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【19】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【20】To use:\n\n【21】*   First, wash your hands. Then pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to form a pouch. Squeeze a thin strip of ointment into the pouch. A 1.25-cm (approximately ½-inch) strip of ointment is usually enough unless otherwise directed by your doctor. Gently close the eyes and keep them closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to come into contact with the infection.\n*   To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). After using vidarabine eye ointment, wipe the tip of the ointment tube with a clean tissue and keep the tube tightly closed.\n\n【22】Do not use this medicine more often or for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may cause problems in the eyes. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.\n\n【23】To help clear up your infection completely, keep using this medicine for the full time of treatment, even if your symptoms have disappeared. Do not miss any doses.\n\n【24】### Dosing\n\n【25】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【26】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【27】*   For ophthalmic ointment dosage forms:\n    *   For virus eye infection:\n        *   Adults and children—Use in each eye every three hours (five times a day). After healing has occurred, the dose may be reduced to two times a day for seven days more.\n\n【28】### Missed Dose\n\n【29】If you miss a dose of this medicine, apply it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule.\n\n【30】### Storage\n\n【31】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【32】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【33】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【34】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【35】After application, eye ointments usually cause your vision to blur for a few minutes.\n\n【36】It is very important that you keep your appointments with your doctor. If your symptoms become worse, check with your doctor sooner.\n\n【37】This medicine may cause your eyes to become more sensitive to light than they are normally. Wearing sunglasses and avoiding too much exposure to bright light may help lessen the discomfort.\n\n【38】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【39】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【40】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【41】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients.

Standard statistical analysis techniques were used to pool and compare data across genotypes with respect to frequency of mutations, age at diagnosis, and degree of hypertrophy (left ventricular wall thickness).\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】The French study population harbored the highest frequency of mutations (61%), followed by the Mayo Clinic (38%), Harvard Medical School (36%), and Swedish (30%) study populations. For every study population, mutations in myosin binding protein C ( _MYBPC3_ ) were the most common cause of HCM. Patients with a family history of HCM had mutations more frequently than those without. This pooled analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in left ventricular wall thickness or in mean age at diagnosis across all genotypes.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】Differentiation of sarcomeric genotypes, such as _MYBPC3_ \\-HCM and _MYH7_ \\-HCM, is not possible on the basis of currently reported phenotypic data. A myriad of genetic and/or environmental modifiers in addition to the primary disease-causing genetic substrate must play an important role in determining a patient's particular phenotype.\n\n【8】ACTC ( actin ), HCM ( hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ), LVWT ( left ventricular wall thickness ), MYBPC3 ( myosin binding protein C ), MYH7 ( myosin heavy chain ), MYL2 ( regulatory myosin light chain ), MYL3 ( essential myosin light chain ), TNNI3 ( troponin I ), TNNT2 ( troponin T ), TPM1 ( a tropomyosin )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Operations were performed with normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and a beating heart, absent a patent foramen ovale. For completeness, embolectomy was performed via separate incisions in the left and right pulmonary arteries (PAs) in 15 patients.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of the 18 patients identified, the mean age was 60 years, and 13 patients (72%) were men. Thirteen patients (72%) had been hospitalized recently or had systemic disease. The preoperative diagnosis was established by echocardiography or computed tomography (or both). The median (range) follow-up time for all surviving patients was 16 months (2-74 months). Indications for APE included cardiogenic shock (n=12; 67%) and severe right ventricular dysfunction as shown by echocardiography (n=5; 28%). Seven patients (39%) had an embolus in transit. Seven patients (39%) experienced cardiopulmonary arrest before APE. Four early deaths (22%) occurred; all 4 of these patients had preoperative cardiopulmonary arrest, and 2 had APE via the main PA only, without branch PA incisions. Two late deaths (11%) occurred. Right ventricular function improved in all survivors.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】The results of emergent APE are encouraging, particularly among patients without cardiopulmonary arrest.

DDAVP\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Desmopressin is used to treat central cranial diabetes insipidus. This is a condition that causes the body to lose too much fluid and become dehydrated. It is also used to control bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis), and the frequent urination and increased thirst caused by certain types of brain injury or brain surgery.\n\n【6】Desmopressin is similar to a hormone that is produced in the body. It acts on the kidneys to reduce the flow of urine.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Tablet\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of desmopressin in children. However, safety and efficacy have not been established for diabetes insipidus in children younger than 4 years of age, and for bedwetting in children younger than 6 years of age.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of desmopressin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving desmopressin.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

For each patient, 3 age- and sex-matched non-AAV comparators were randomly selected from the same population and assigned an index date corresponding to the AAV incidence date. Medical records of cases and comparators were reviewed for CVD events, which included cardiac events (coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and VTE, which included deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Baseline total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and current smoking rate were lower in AAV than in comparators ( _P_ \\=.03, _P_ \\=.01, and _P_ \\=.04, respectively), whereas other CVD risk factors and Framingham risk score were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The CVD events developed in 13 patients and 17 comparators, corresponding to a more than 3-fold increased risk (hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 3.15; 95% CI, 1.51-6.57). By subtypes, risks were increased for cardiac events (HR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.42-6.15) and CVA (HR, 8.16; 95% CI, 2.45-27.15), but not for PVD. The HR for VTE was 3.26 (95% CI, 0.84-12.60), significantly increased for DVT (HR, 6.25; 95% CI, 1.16-33.60), but not for PE (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.23-7.54).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Despite a similar prevalence of CVD risk factors at baseline, the risk of CVD is more than 3-fold higher and for CVA 8-fold higher in patients with incident AAV than in matched comparator subjects.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACR ( American College of Rheumatology ), AF ( atrial fibrillation ), ANCA ( antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ), AAV ( ANCA-associated vasculitis ), BVAS-WG ( Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener Granulomatosis ), CAD ( coronary artery disease ), CVA ( cerebrovascular accident ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), DVT ( deep vein thrombosis ), EGPA ( eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis ), GPA ( granulomatosis with polyangiitis ), HF ( heart failure ), HR ( hazard ratio ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), MPA ( microscopic polyangiitis ), MPO ( myeloperoxidase ), PR3 ( proteinase 3 ), PE ( pulmonary embolism ), PVD ( peripheral vascular disease ), REP ( Rochester Epidemiology Project ), VTE ( venous thromboembolism )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Mean ± SD age was 74.0±6.6 years; mean ± SD erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 35.9±21.1 mm/h at presentation. Onset of illness was sudden in 9 patients and insidious in 5. All patients were initially treated with prednisone (15-20 mg/d). Although the response in all was excellent, 9 patients received disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, either because of ongoing disease activity or in an effort to decrease the use of corticosteroids. Hydroxychloroquine was used alone in 7 patients. At the mean ± SD time of last follow-up (31.4±23.1 months), 5 patients continued to receive therapy. Complications of treatment included worsening of preexisting hypertension in 3 patients, gastritis in 2, and exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus in 1. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurred in 6 patients. Duration of therapy ranged from 5 to 120 months (mean, 29 months). Three patients developed malignancies, ie, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, and prostate carcinoma.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Our population of patients with RS3PE is similar to those documented in previous reports: elderly, predominantly male, and responsive to corticosteroids. However, our series is clinically differentiated by a greater use of adjunctive disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (primarily hydroxychloroquine). Confirming previous reports, we also observed a possible association between RS3PE and malignancy.\n\n【8】ANA ( antinuclear antibody ), DMARD ( disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ), ESR ( erythrocyte sedimentation rate ), GC ( glucocorticoid ), PMR ( polymyalgia rheumatica ), RS3PE ( remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Some signs and symptoms of an opioid emergency are breathing problems (which can range from slow or shallow breathing to no breathing), extreme sleepiness, slow heartbeat, or not being able to respond, a very small (pinpoint) pupil in a person who is difficult to awaken.\n\n【6】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Solution\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【11】### Allergies\n\n【12】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【13】### Pediatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of naloxone injection in children.\n\n【15】### Geriatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of naloxone injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving naloxone injection.\n\n【17】### Breastfeeding\n\n【18】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【21】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【22】*   Morphine\n*   Morphine Sulfate Liposome\n*   Naldemedine\n*   Naloxegol\n*   Oxycodone\n*   Oxymorphone\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【24】*   Clonidine\n*   Yohimbine\n\n【25】### Other Interactions\n\n【26】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【27】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【28】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【29】*   Heart or blood vessel disease or\n*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【30】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【31】A home health caregiver or a family member will give you or your child this medicine. It is given as a shot under your skin or into a muscle.\n\n【32】This medicine should be given immediately upon when a suspected or known overdose of an opioid has occurred. This will help prevent serious breathing problems and severe sleepiness that can lead to death.\n\n【33】This medicine comes with patient instructions and a training device. Let your home health caregiver or family member read and follow the directions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【34】To use:\n\n【35】*   Evzio® is available in 2 dosage strengths: 0.4 milligram (mg)/0.4 milliliter (mL) autoinjector or 2 mg/0.4 mL autoinjector. Zimhi™ is available in 5 mg/0.5 mL prefilled syringe.\n*   It contains printed instructions on the device label. Evzio® also contains a speaker that provides electronic instructions which guides the user through each step of the injection.\n*   Inject the medicine into the outer thighs, through clothing, if needed. If you are giving this medicine to a child younger than 1 year of age, you should pinch the thigh muscle while giving the medicine.\n*   Do not use the medicine if it is cloudy, discolored, or has large particles in it.\n*   This medicine can only be used one time. Do not remove the safety guard until you are ready to use it.\n*   After giving the first dose to the patient, get emergency medical help right away.\n*   Closely watch the patient for signs and symptoms of opioid emergency may return after several minutes.\n*   Give a new naloxone injection every 2 to 3 minutes if symptoms returned and monitor the patient until emergency medical assistance becomes available.\n\n【36】### Dosing\n\n【37】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【38】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【39】*   For opioid overdose:\n    *   For injection dosage form (Evzio® autoinjector):\n        *   Adults and children—0.4 or 2 milligrams (mg) injected under the skin or into a muscle.\n    *   For injection dosage form (Zimhi™ prefilled syringe):\n        *   Adults and children—5 milligrams (mg) injected under the skin or into a muscle.\n\n【40】### Storage\n\n【41】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【42】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【43】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【44】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【45】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【46】The effects of the opioid medicine may last longer than the effects of the naloxone. This means the breathing problems and sleepiness could come back. Always call for emergency help after the first dose of naloxone.\n\n【47】Severe opioid withdrawal symptoms may happen suddenly after receiving this medicine. These include body aches, a fever, sweating, runny nose, sneezing, goose bumps, yawning, weakness, shivering or trembling, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, stomach cramps, fast heartbeat, and increased blood pressure.\n\n【48】Some types of opioid medicines (eg, buprenorphine, pentazocine) may require larger or repeat doses of naloxone to reverse the opioid effects.\n\n【49】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【50】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【51】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【52】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【53】#### Incidence not known\n\n【54】1.  Agitation\n2.  body aches\n3.  chest pain\n4.  coughing that sometimes produces a pink frothy sputum\n5.  crying more than the usual (in babies)\n6.  diarrhea\n7.  difficult or trouble breathing\n8.  excessive crying\n9.  fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat or pulse\n10.  fever\n11.  goosebumps\n12.  increased or excessive unconscious or jerking movements\n13.  irregular, fast or slow, or shallow breathing\n14.  irritability\n15.  nausea or vomiting\n16.  nervousness\n17.  pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin\n18.  restlessness\n19.  runny nose\n20.  seizures\n21.  shivering\n22.  sneezing\n23.  sweating\n24.  swelling in the legs and ankles\n25.  trembling\n26.  weakness\n27.  yawning\n\n【55】无关删除-1:<u>Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients.

A 47-year-old white man with a 15–pack-year smoking history visited his primary care physician for progressive shortness of breath. A chest radiograph showed diffuse pulmonary opacification. A high-resolution chest computed tomographic scan showed the crazy-paving pattern of diffuse interstitial and ground-glass opacification throughout the lung fields 删除4:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.

Clinical presentation is usually the insidious onset of dyspnea and cough in a middle-aged male smoker. However, one-third of patients are asymptomatic. Physical examination findings are usually unremarkable; expectoration of white gelatinous material may occur. Laboratory abnormalities include polycythemia and increased lactate dehydrogenase levels. Typical findings on high-resolution chest computed tomographic scans are the crazy-paving pattern, and bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy staining positive for PAS is diagnostic. The autoimmune form of PAP accounts for 90% of cases and is characterized by the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies that are believed to contribute to macrophage dysfunction and impaired surfactant processing.\n\n【6】Whole lung lavage is a widely accepted form of treatment 删除4:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. The median duration of clinical benefit from lavage is approximately 15 months. Administration of subcutaneous or inhalational granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for PAP remains experimental, but shows promise.

{"seq_id": "907badac-9468-4f26-8cd3-d1180f6d5125", "title": "Clinical Pearls in Infectious Diseases", "text": "【0】At the 2001 annual conference of the American College of Physicians, a new teaching format to aid physician learning, Clinical Pearls, was introduced. Clinical Pearls is designed with the 3 qualities of physician-learners in mind. First, we physicians enjoy learning from cases. Second, we like concise, practical points that we can use in our practice. Finally, we take pleasure in problem solving.\n\n【1】In the Clinical Pearls format, speakers present a number of short cases in their specialty to a general internal medicine audience. Each case is followed by a multiple-choice question answered live by attendees using an audience response system. The answer distribution is shown to attendees. The correct answer is then displayed and the speaker discusses teaching points, clarifying why one answer is most appropriate. Each case presentation ends with a Clinical Pearl, defined as a practical teaching point that is supported by the literature but generally not well known to most internists.\n\n【2】Clinical Pearls is currently one of the most popular sessions at the American College of Physicians meeting. As a service to its readers, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ has invited a select number of these Clinical Pearls presentations to be published in our Concise Reviews for Clinicians section. “Clinical Pearls in Infectious Diseases” is one of them.\n\n【3】CASE 1\n------\n\n【4】A 45-year-old male physician colleague is concerned about Lyme disease and asks for your advice about management of a tick bite. Specifically, he pulled a small tick from his posterior thigh after a 1-day hiking trip to a state park in Maryland. The tick was discarded and is unavailable for identification.\n\n【5】### Question\n\n【6】Which _one_ of the following management approaches would be _most appropriate_ ?\n\n【7】*   a.\n\n【8】    Prescribe doxycycline, 200 mg once\n\n【9】*   b.\n\n【10】    Prescribe doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for 14 days\n\n【11】*   c.\n\n【12】    Order baseline Lyme serology and, if findings are negative, repeat in 4 to 6 weeks; treat if findings are positive at that time\n\n【13】*   d.\n\n【14】    Order serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for _Borrelia burgdorferi_ ; treat if findings are positive\n\n【15】*   e.\n\n【16】    Discuss tick precautions; no further interventions indicated\n\n【17】### Discussion\n\n【18】Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne illness in the United States, and most cases are reported from only 9 states. Even in Lyme-endemic areas, only 1% to 3% of patients who have a tick bite develop clinical Lyme disease. Prevention of Lyme disease includes the use of _N, N_ \\-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET)–based repellent and daily tick checks in addition to careful removal of attached ticks. Prophylactic treatment with 200 mg of doxycycline may be considered\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>*   Nadelman RB\n*   Nowakowski J\n*   Fish D\n*   Tick Bite Study Group\n\n【20】Prophylaxis with single-dose doxycycline for the prevention of Lyme disease after an Ixodes tick bite.\n\n【21】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 2001; 345 : 79-84</u></u>\n\n【22】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (400)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【23】无关删除-2:<u>*   Wormser GP\n*   Dattwyler RJ\n*   Shapiro ED\n\n【24】The clinical assessment, treatment and prevention of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis and babesiosis: clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\n【25】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin Infect Dis._ 2006; 43 (Guidelines re-reviewed by special panel and upheld, 4/12/10, idsociety.org/lymedisease) : 1089-1134</u></u>\n\n【26】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1609)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【27】when a deer tick is engorged and attached for 36 hours or longer in a heavily endemic area. In this clinical vignette, the tick was neither engorged nor attached for 36 hours or longer, and therefore antimicrobial prophylaxis is unnecessary. Although single-dose prophylaxis is 87% effective, a third of the patients who take the large dose of doxycycline develop gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects. A 14-day treatment would be inappropriate in patients who do not have clinical Lyme disease. Lyme serology should not be ordered in asymptomatic patients because a false-positive result could result in unnecessary treatment. The serum Lyme PCR is not routinely performed and would not help establish a diagnosis of Lyme disease. In contrast, the Lyme PCR from synovial fluid can be helpful in the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis.\n\n【28】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【29】A single dose of doxycycline may be considered under unusual circumstances, specifically when a deer tick is engorged and attached for 36 hours or longer in a region of the country that is heavily endemic for Lyme disease. However, this treatment frequently causes serious GI adverse effects.\n\n【30】CASE 2\n------\n\n【31】A 42-year-old woman from Cape Cod, MA, presents with unilateral facial palsy and a stiff neck. She recalls no tick bite or rash. Physical examination shows moderate palsy on the right side of the face. Relevant laboratory results include an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) positive for Lyme disease and 6 positive IgG bands on a Western blot. She improves after receiving doxycycline treatment for 3 weeks. However, 6 months later, she presents with ongoing fatigue, arthralgias, headache, and myalgias. Follow-up Lyme serology demonstrates a positive ELISA as well as 5 positive IgG bands and 1 positive IgM band on Western blot.\n\n【32】### Question\n\n【33】Which _one_ of the following would be the _next best_ step in the treatment of this patient?\n\n【34】*   a.\n\n【35】    Lumbar puncture\n\n【36】*   b.\n\n【37】    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head with gadolinium\n\n【38】*   c.\n\n【39】    A second course of doxycycline\n\n【40】*   d.\n\n【41】    Initiation of treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone\n\n【42】*   e.\n\n【43】    Symptomatic treatment only\n\n【44】### Discussion\n\n【45】It is important to note that follow-up Lyme serology is not indicated after antimicrobial treatment.

Findings on the _Clostridium difficile_ toxin test are positive, and treatment with metronidazole is initiated. The diarrhea improves during the next couple of days. On physical examination, the abdomen is mildly tender with very active bowel sounds. The patient is appropriately placed in isolation, and you wear double gloves during the examination and toss them into the designated receptacle.\n\n【59】### Question\n\n【60】Which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ protocol for ensuring hand hygiene after leaving the patient's room?\n\n【61】*   a.\n\n【62】    No further action is necessary because double gloves were used\n\n【63】*   b.\n\n【64】    Sanitize hands with alcohol gel\n\n【65】*   c.\n\n【66】    Sanitize hands with soap and water\n\n【67】*   d.\n\n【68】    Sanitize hands with chlorhexidine\n\n【69】*   e.\n\n【70】    Sanitize hands with 10% povidone-iodine\n\n【71】### Discussion\n\n【72】_C difficile_ has become a major nosocomial infection with considerable potential for transmission within the hospital setting.

The vast majority of human cases in the past decade have been associated with bats, even in the absence of an obvious bite history. Bat bites are frequently inapparent because the teeth are tiny and the bite may be painless and quickly forgotten. Consequently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommend postexposure rabies prophylaxis when a bat is seen in the room of a sleeping adult, child, or an intoxicated or mentally disabled individual.\n\n【95】无关删除-2:<u>*   Manning SE\n*   Rupprecht CE\n*   Fishbein D\n*   Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices\n*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n【96】Human rabies prevention—United States, 2008: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\n【97】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_MMWR Recomm Rep._ 2008; 57 : 1-28</u></u>\n\n【98】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【99】However, if the intact bat can be retrieved and tested by the Health Department—which is feasible in only a minority of cases—prophylaxis can be delayed until test results are known.

Seven months previously, the patient developed diarrhea during a trip to Mexico and treated herself with ciprofloxacin, which provided temporary improvement. A few weeks later, she noted lower abdominal cramping and loose stools, particularly in the morning after breakfast. The abdominal discomfort was partially relieved with defecation. Three months before her office visit, she was evaluated with blood tests, stool cultures, multiple stool examinations for ova and parasites, and testing for _C difficile_ toxin, all of which yielded unremarkable results. Findings were also unremarkable on computed tomography of the abdomen, colonoscopy, a small bowel barium study, flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies, and assays for serologic markers of celiac disease.\n\n【136】### Question\n\n【137】Which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ next step in the management of this patient's condition?\n\n【138】*   a.\n\n【139】    Begin an empiric trial of metronidazole\n\n【140】*   b.\n\n【141】    Perform colonoscopy with random biopsies\n\n【142】*   c.\n\n【143】    Conduct a GI transit study\n\n【144】*   d.\n\n【145】    Perform upper endoscopy with small bowel biopsies\n\n【146】*   e.\n\n【147】    Increase fiber; offer reassurance\n\n【148】### Discussion\n\n【149】This is a case of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. The differential diagnosis of persistent or recurrent diarrhea and abdominal discomfort after an infectious gastroenteritis includes parasitic infection, _C difficile_ diarrhea if there is a history of antibiotic exposure, and several noninfectious causes (eg, celiac disease, lactose intolerance). Given the negative findings on multiple studies, including stool tests for ova and parasites, metronidazole therapy is not indicated. Colonoscopy with biopsies is the study of choice to rule out microscopic colitis. However, microscopic colitis typically occurs in older women and so is an unlikely diagnosis in this patient. A GI transit study would be of little value. Upper endoscopy with small bowel biopsies would have a low yield, given the negative serologic tests for celiac disease.

Cases in travelers from this region have been imported to Europe (France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), Africa (Tunisia, Egypt, and Algeria), Asia (Malaysia and the Philippines), and the United States. In June, Lebanon and Iran reported cases related to travel to Saudi Arabia. As of June 9, 2014, 699 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have officially been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), including 209 deaths. An additional 113 cases were reported by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health on June 3; these cases have not yet been verified by the WHO.\n\n【30】删除3:<u>World Health Organization.

Standard precautions are basic infection control practices intended to be applied to the care of all patients in all health care settings, regardless of the suspected or confirmed presence of an infectious agent. These practices are designed to both protect HCP and prevent the spread of infections among patients. They include (1) hand hygiene before and after patient contact, (2) use of appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves and gowns, masks, eye protection) when contact with body fluids is anticipated, (3) adequate cleaning, disinfection, or sterilization of patient care equipment before use on another patient, and (4) respiratory etiquette (placing a mask on patients with a cough, encouraging patients to cover their cough and to perform hand hygiene).\n\n【158】In addition to standard precautions, all patients presenting with fever and chest radiographic findings of pneumonia should be screened for (1) travel to the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries within the previous 2 weeks, (2) close contact with a symptomatic traveler to the Middle East, and (3) close contact with a confirmed or probable case of MERS. Patients with a febrile respiratory illness who meet one or more of these screening criteria should be placed in airborne and contact precautions, pending further evaluation. Airborne precautions require that the patient is placed in a single room that is at negative pressure to the surroundings and has a minimum of 6 air changes per hour. Health care personnel entering the room must wear a fit-tested respirator or a powered air-purifying respirator. Contact precautions require that health care workers wear gowns and gloves for room entry.

Amphetamine use more than doubled from 2006 to 2016. In 2018, among illicit substance users in the past year (53.2 million), more than 5 million 12 years or older had misused prescription stimulants. The most commonly reported motivations for misuse were to help with alertness and concentration, in approximately 60% of respondents. Most persons who misused prescription stimulants received the medication from a friend or relative, who got it through a health care provider. It is important to reexamine the pattern of prescription stimulant use after the loosening of _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (Fifth Edition) criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis. Caveats to the this report could be the understudied specific populations (such as medical students), the exclusion of the military and institutionalized populations from the study, and the variations among individual states in stimulant prescribing patterns.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and acronyms:\n\n【3】ADHD ( attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ), ARCOS ( Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System ), DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) ), NSDUH ( National Survey on Drug Use and Health )\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "7f3fcb45-4cb7-421f-8283-66d3215a4026", "title": "Diabetic ketoacidosis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes.\n\n【2】The condition develops when the body can't produce enough insulin. Insulin plays a key role in helping sugar — a major source of energy for muscles and other tissues — enter cells in the body.\n\n【3】Without enough insulin, the body begins to break down fat as fuel. This causes a buildup of acids in the bloodstream called ketones. If it's left untreated, the buildup can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n【4】If you have diabetes or you're at risk of diabetes, learn the warning signs of diabetic ketoacidosis and when to seek emergency care.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Diabetic ketoacidosis symptoms often come on quickly, sometimes within 24 hours. For some, these symptoms may be the first sign of having diabetes. Symptoms might include:\n\n【7】*   Being very thirsty\n*   Urinating often\n*   Feeling a need to throw up and throwing up\n*   Having stomach pain\n*   Being weak or tired\n*   Being short of breath\n*   Having fruity-scented breath\n*   Being confused\n\n【8】More-certain signs of diabetic ketoacidosis — which can show up in home blood and urine test kits — include:\n\n【9】*   High blood sugar level\n*   High ketone levels in urine\n\n【10】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【11】If you feel ill or stressed or you've had a recent illness or injury, check your blood sugar level often. You might also try a urine ketone test kit you can get at a drugstore.\n\n【12】Contact your health care provider right away if:\n\n【13】*   You're throwing up and can't keep down food or liquid\n*   Your blood sugar level is higher than your target range and doesn't respond to home treatment\n*   Your urine ketone level is moderate or high\n\n【14】Seek emergency care if:\n\n【15】*   Your blood sugar level is higher than 300 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 16.7 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) for more than one test.\n*   You have ketones in your urine and can't reach your health care provider for advice.\n*   You have many symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. These include excessive thirst, frequent urination, nausea and vomiting, stomach pain, weakness or fatigue, shortness of breath, fruity-scented breath, and confusion.\n\n【16】Remember, untreated diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to death.\n\n【17】Causes\n------\n\n【18】Sugar is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Insulin helps sugar enter the cells in the body.\n\n【19】Without enough insulin, the body can't use sugar to make the energy it needs. This causes the release of hormones that break down fat for the body to use as fuel. This also produces acids known as ketones. Ketones build up in the blood and eventually spill over into the urine.\n\n【20】Diabetic ketoacidosis usually happens after:\n\n【21】*   **An illness.** An infection or other illness can cause the body to make higher levels of certain hormones, such as adrenaline or cortisol. These hormones work against the effects of insulin and sometimes cause diabetic ketoacidosis. Pneumonia and urinary tract infections are common illnesses that can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis.\n*   **A problem with insulin therapy.** Missed insulin treatments can leave too little insulin in the body. Not enough insulin therapy or an insulin pump that doesn't work right also can leave too little insulin in the body. Any of these problems can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n【22】Other things that can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis include:\n\n【23】*   Physical or emotional trauma\n*   Heart attack or stroke\n*   Pancreatitis\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Alcohol or drug misuse, particularly cocaine\n*   Certain medicines, such as corticosteroids and some diuretics\n\n【24】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【25】The risk of diabetic ketoacidosis is highest if you:\n\n【26】*   Have type 1 diabetes\n*   Often miss insulin doses\n\n【27】Sometimes, diabetic ketoacidosis can occur with type 2 diabetes. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis may be the first sign of having diabetes.\n\n【28】Complications\n-------------\n\n【29】Diabetic ketoacidosis is treated with fluids, electrolytes — such as sodium, potassium and chloride — and insulin. Perhaps surprisingly, the most common complications of diabetic ketoacidosis are related to this lifesaving treatment.\n\n【30】### Possible complications of the treatments\n\n【31】Treatment complications include:\n\n【32】*   **Low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia.** Insulin allows sugar to enter cells. This causes the blood sugar level to drop. If the blood sugar level drops too quickly, the drop can lead to low blood sugar.\n*   **Low potassium, also known as hypokalemia.** The fluids and insulin used to treat diabetic ketoacidosis can cause the potassium level to drop too low. A low potassium level can affect the heart, muscles and nerves. To avoid this, potassium and other minerals are usually given with fluid replacement as part of the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.\n*   **Swelling in the brain, also known as cerebral edema.** Adjusting the blood sugar level too quickly can cause the brain to swell. This appears to be more common in children, especially those with newly diagnosed diabetes.\n\n【33】Untreated, diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to loss of consciousness and, eventually, death.\n\n【34】Prevention\n----------\n\n【35】There are many ways to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis and other diabetes complications.\n\n【36】*   **Manage your diabetes.** Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine. Take diabetes medicines or insulin as directed.\n*   **Monitor your blood sugar level.** You might need to check and record your blood sugar level at least 3 to 4 times a day, or more often if you're ill or stressed. Careful monitoring is the only way to make sure that your blood sugar level stays within your target range.\n*   **Adjust your insulin dosage as needed.** Talk to your health care provider or diabetes educator about how to make your insulin dosage work for you. Consider factors such as your blood sugar level, what you eat, how active you are, and whether you're ill. If your blood sugar level begins to rise, follow your diabetes treatment plan to return your blood sugar level to your target range.\n*   **Check your ketone level.** When you're ill or stressed, test your urine for excess ketones with a urine ketones test kit. You can buy test kits at a drugstore. If your ketone level is moderate or high, contact your health care provider right away or seek emergency care. If you have low levels of ketones, you may need to take more insulin.\n*   **Be prepared to act quickly.** If you think you have diabetic ketoacidosis because your blood sugar is high and you have too many ketones in your urine, seek emergency care.\n\n【37】Diabetes complications are scary. But don't let fear keep you from taking good care of yourself. Follow your diabetes treatment plan carefully. Ask your diabetes treatment team for help when you need it.\n\n【38】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The electronic medical record was reviewed to assess for subsequent clinical management and survival.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Potentially pathologic IFs (PPIFs) were present in 285 patients (67.2%). The mean ± SD number of PPIFs per patient was 1.1±1.0 (range, 0-4). Factors associated with higher numbers of PPIFs were reduced ejection fraction ( _P_ \\=.02) and history of smoking ( _P_ \\=.06). Potentially pathologic incidental findings prompted clinical work-up in 39 patients (9.2%) and delayed or canceled treatment plans for aortic stenosis in 7 patients (1.7%). The number needed to image to diagnose a new malignancy or medical condition was 19. The number of PPIFs was predictive of poor overall survival before (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.31-1.88) and after (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.19-1.76) adjustment for baseline clinical variables ( _P_ <.001 for both).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】This investigation found that PPIFs are common in elderly patients undergoing TAVR-CTA scans and, once discovered, commonly generate further clinical evaluation. Higher numbers of PPIFs may be predictive of poorer survival, but further study is required to guide the appropriateness of pursuing diagnostic evaluations for asymptomatic PPIFs in this elderly population.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AS ( aortic stenosis ), ECG ( electrocardiogram ), HR ( hazard ratio ), IF ( incidental findings ), PPIF ( potentially pathologic incidental finding ), SAVR ( surgical aortic valve replacement ), TAVR ( transcatheter aortic valve replacement ), TAVR-CTA ( electrocardiographically gated aortoiliac computed tomographic angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Among his many important contributions was the isolation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). He demonstrated its involvement in numerous metabolic processes.\n\n【2】Sutherland was born on November 19, 1915, in Burlingame, a small town in eastern Kansas. His father had been a farmer in New Mexico and Oklahoma, but when the family moved to Kansas, he became a dry-goods merchant. Sutherland graduated from Washburn College in Topeka, Kan, in 1937 and received an MD degree from Washington University Medical School in St Louis, Mo, in 1942. After graduating from medical school, he served in the US Army until 1945, first as a battalion surgeon in the field and then as a staff physician in a military hospital in Germany. After being discharged from the army in 1945, Sutherland returned to St Louis to work in the laboratory of American biochemist and 1947 Nobel Prize laureate Carl F. Cori (1896–1984), who directed Sutherland to a research career. Sutherland became a professor at Washington University, and during his 8 years there he concentrated on 2 projects: the investigation of phosphorylase (an enzyme for initiating the breakdown of glycogen in the liver and in muscles) and the determination of how the hormones epinephrine and glucagon cause the liver to release glucose.\n\n【3】Sutherland remained in St Louis until 1953, when he was appointed professor and director of the department of medicine and the department of pharmacology at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio (now Case Western Reserve University), where he discovered cAMP in 1956. He analyzed phosphorylase and found that 2 other enzymes are also present in liver extract: one that converts active phosphorylase to its inactive form, releasing inorganic phosphate, and another that reactivates the inactive form, incorporating inorganic phosphate into the molecule. This phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction is one of the basic biochemical energy-releasing processes of organisms.\n\n【4】In 1963, Sutherland became professor of physiology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn, where he continued his research on cAMP. From 1973 until his death in 1974, he was on the faculty of the University of Miami Medical School (Fla).\n\n【5】After 1971, Sutherland turned his attention to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (3',5' -GMP) like which, like cAMP, is widely distributed in tissues. In addition, he investigated how the hormone adrenaline regulates carbohydrate metabolism by the role of cAMP intermediates in hormonal activities and the involvement of cAMP in the transmission of genetic information and in abnormal cell growth.\n\n【6】On May 9, 1974, at the age of 58 years, Sutherland had a massive esophageal hemorrhage and died in Miami, Fla. He was honored on a stamp issued by Guyana in 1995.\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【9】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/75.6.552</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>© 2000 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The CDI cases were identified by PCR in the inpatient and outpatient settings. The CDI IRs per 10,000 inpatient-days are estimated by year, surveillance category, age, sex, race/ethnicity, and Charlson comorbidity index. Recurrence rates are presented by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Death and colectomy in the 30 days after CDI diagnosis, white blood cell count, and serum creatinine level are assessed.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Among 268,655 patients, 4286 (1.6%) had CDI. Among these patients, 671 (15.7%) had recurrent infections. The IR was highest among community-onset, health care facility–associated infections (11.1 per 10,000 inpatient-days). The CDI IRs differed by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Overall, 528 patients (12.3%) died within 30 days of a positive CDI test result. The CDI IRs increased 34% with implementation of PCR testing.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Increasingly, PCR is being used because of its higher diagnostic sensitivity. Reassessing the epidemic using PCR updates our understanding of CDI risk. Our capacity to identify patients presenting in the outpatient setting after discharge provides a more accurate picture of health care–associated CDI rates, particularly because the community appears to assume an increasing role in CDI onset and possibly transmission. The CDI burden differs by race, comorbidity, sex, and previous health care use. The detected increase in CDI incidence after transitioning to PCR diagnosis was modest compared with previous studies.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CDI ( Clostridium difficile infection ), ED ( emergency department ), EIA ( enzyme immunoassay ), HCF ( health care facility ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), ICD-9-CM ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ), IR ( incidence rate ), KPSC ( Kaiser Permanente Southern California ), PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ), WBC ( white blood cell )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "c65622cb-1345-427f-9d33-1078699dc3e6", "title": "Diskectomy", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Diskectomy is surgery to remove the damaged part of a disk in the spine that has its soft center pushing out through the tough outer lining. A herniated disk can irritate or press on nearby nerves.\n\n【2】Diskectomy works best for treating pain that travels down the arms or legs from a compressed nerve. The procedure is less helpful for treating pain that's felt only in the back or neck. Most people who have back pain or neck pain find relief with other treatments, such as weight loss, arthritis medication or physical therapy.\n\n【3】A health care provider might suggest diskectomy if other, nonsurgical treatments have not worked or if symptoms worsen. There are several ways to perform a diskectomy. Many surgeons prefer minimally invasive diskectomy, which uses small incisions and a microscope or tiny video camera for viewing the procedure.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】A diskectomy is done to relieve the pressure a herniated disk (also called a slipped, ruptured or bulging disk or disk prolapse) places on a spinal nerve. A herniated disk occurs when some of the softer material inside the disk pushes out through a crack in the outer lining of the disk.\n\n【6】A health care provider might recommend diskectomy if:\n\n【7】*   Nerve weakness causes trouble standing or walking\n*   Conservative treatment, such as physical therapy or steroid injections, fails to improve symptoms after 6 to 12 weeks\n*   Pain travels into the buttocks, legs, arms or chest and becomes too much to manage\n\n【8】Risks\n-----\n\n【9】Diskectomy is considered safe. But as with any surgery, diskectomy carries a risk of complications. Potential complications include:\n\n【10】*   Bleeding\n*   Infection\n*   Leaking spinal fluid\n*   Injury to blood vessels or nerves in and around the spine\n\n【11】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【12】You'll likely need to avoid eating and drinking for a certain amount of time before surgery. If you take blood-thinning medications, you may need to adjust how much you take before surgery. Your health care provider will give you specific instructions.\n\n【13】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【14】### During diskectomy\n\n【15】Surgeons usually perform diskectomy using general anesthesia, so you're not awake during the procedure. Ideally, just the piece of disk that's compressing the nerve is removed. However, small amounts of spinal bone and ligament might need to be removed to get to the herniated disk.\n\n【16】If the whole disk must be taken out, your surgeon may need to fill the space with a piece of bone — taken from a deceased donor or from your own pelvis — or a synthetic bone substitute. The adjoining vertebrae are then fused together with metal instrumentation.\n\n【17】### After diskectomy\n\n【18】After surgery, you're moved to a recovery room where the health care team watches for complications from the surgery and anesthesia. You might be able to go home the day of surgery. But a short hospital stay might be needed — particularly for those who have serious medical conditions.\n\n【19】Depending on the amount of lifting, walking and sitting your job involves, you may be able to return to work in 2 to 6 weeks. If you have a job that includes heavy lifting or operating heavy machinery, you might have to wait 6 to 8 weeks before returning to work.\n\n【20】Results\n-------\n\n【21】Diskectomy reduces herniated disk symptoms in most people who have clear signs of a compressed nerve, such as pain that travels down the legs. However, relief from a diskectomy might not last a lifetime because it doesn't cure the cause of the disk becoming injured or herniated in the first place.\n\n【22】To help prevent re-injury of the spine, it might help to attain and keep a healthy weight, eat a healthy diet, do low-impact exercises and limit activities that involve repeated bending, twisting or lifting.\n\n【23】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Physical activity and RE were assessed by self-report at the baseline medical examination. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to determine the independent associations of PA and RE with all-cause mortality in participants who had a history of cancer.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Physical activity in cancer survivors was not associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. In contrast, RE was associated with a 33% lower risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI, 0.45-0.99) after adjusting for potential confounders, including PA.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Individuals who participated in RE during cancer survival had a lower risk for all-cause mortality. The present findings provide preliminary evidence for benefits of RE during cancer survival. Future randomized controlled trials examining RE and its effect on lean body mass, muscular strength, and all-cause mortality in cancer survivors are warranted.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BMI ( body mass index ), HR ( hazard ratio ), MET ( metabolic equivalent of task ), PA ( physical activity ), RE ( resistance exercise )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Dr Brower suggests that the diet results in a low insulin state that prompts increased catabolism of excess dietary fat. Although fasting insulin levels declined in our patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and polycystic ovary syndrome, fasting glucose levels improved or remained stable, implying an improvement in insulin sensitivity. The lipoprotein changes seem consistent with such an improvement.\n\n【6】无关删除-2:<u>*   Grundy SM</u>\n\n【7】Hypertriglyceridemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome.\n\n【8】删除3:<u>_Am J Cardiol._ 1998; 81 : 18B-25B</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (459)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【10】Improved insulin sensitivity would be expected to increase lipogenesis and decrease fat catabolism.\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   Miles JM\n*   Gerich JE</u>\n\n【12】Glucose and ketone body kinetics in diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n【13】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin Endocrinol Metab._ 1983; 12 : 303-319</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (43)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【15】Increased fuel excretion and utilization could be mechanisms of a “metabolic advantage” of a particular diet, and our study cannot exclude such mechanisms.
