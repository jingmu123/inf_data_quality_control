Iodotope\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Sodium iodide I 131 is used to treat hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) and certain kinds of thyroid cancer. This medicine is taken up mainly by the thyroid gland. In the treatment of overactive thyroid gland, the radiation from the radioactive iodine damages the thyroid gland to bring its activity back down to normal. Larger doses of radioiodide are usually used after thyroid cancer surgery to destroy any remaining diseased thyroid tissue or to destroy thyroid cancer that has spread to other tissues.\n\n【6】When very small doses are given, a measure of the radioactivity taken up by the gland helps your doctor decide whether your thyroid gland is working properly or to locate tumors caused by certain types of thyroid cancers.\n\n【7】This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor with specialized training in nuclear medicine or radiation oncology.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Kit\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of sodium iodide I 131 capsules or solution in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of sodium iodide I 131 capsules or solution in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving sodium iodide I 131 capsules or solution.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using this medicine.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【22】### Other Interactions\n\n【23】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.

May make these conditions worse.\n\n【29】*   Kidney disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【30】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【31】Before receiving this medicine, make sure you understand all the risks and benefits. It is important for you to work closely with your doctor during your treatment.\n\n【32】A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital or clinic. It is given by mouth.\n\n【33】Your doctor may have special instructions for you to get ready for your treatment. If you have not received such instructions or you do not understand them, check with your doctor ahead of time.\n\n【34】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【35】Your doctor will check your progress closely while you are receiving this medicine. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【36】Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you are a woman who can bear children, your doctor may give you a pregnancy test before you start receiving this medicine to make sure you are not pregnant. You must use two forms of birth control together for at least 6 months after using this medicine. Use birth control pills together with another form of birth control, such as a condom, diaphragm, or contraceptive foam or jelly. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【37】If you are receiving sodium iodide I 131 for an overactive thyroid or cancer of the thyroid, your doctor may tell you to follow some or all of these guidelines for 48 to 96 hours after receiving the medicine, to help reduce the chance of contaminating other persons:\n\n【38】*   Do not kiss anyone, or handle or use another person's eating or drinking utensils, toothbrush, or bathroom glass.\n*   Do not have sex.\n*   Do not sit close to others, especially pregnant women, and do not hold children in your lap for long periods of time.\n*   Sleep alone.\n*   Wash the tub and sink after each use (including after brushing teeth).\n*   Wash your hands after using or cleaning the toilet.\n*   Use a separate towel and washcloth.\n*   Wash your clothes, bed linens, and eating utensils separately.\n*   Sodium iodide I 131 is passed in the urine. To prevent contamination of your home, flush the toilet twice after you urinate.\n\n【39】If you were treated with sodium iodide I 131 for an overactive thyroid, your doctor may want to check the level of thyroid hormone in your blood every 2 to 3 months during the first year, and once a year thereafter. This is to make sure that your thyroid has not become underactive.\n\n【40】This medicine may cause allergic reactions. Check with your doctor right away if you have a rash, hives, itching, fast heartbeat, shortness of breath, or swelling of the eyes, face, lips after receiving the medicine.\n\n【41】This medicine may increase your risk for cancer or thyroid problems.

During the double-blind suppressive therapy, patients were provided with the study drug (500-mg valacyclovir caplets or matching placebo) and instructed to take 2 caplets once daily without regard to meals for 60 days. Daily genital and anal or rectal swabs were self-collected during the 60-day study period for evaluation of HSV-2 viral shedding as determined by quantitative type-specific polymerase chain reaction assay.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】One hundred fifty-two patients were randomized into this study, 43 to placebo and 109 to 1 g/d of valacyclovir. A total of 134 completed the study (40 placebo \\[93%\\], 94 valacyclovir \\[86%\\]), and 18 prematurely withdrew (3 placebo \\[7%\\], 15 valacyclovir \\[14%\\]). Valacyclovir significantly reduced the percentage of days with total (clinical and subclinical) HSV-2 shedding throughout 60 days compared with placebo. In the intent-to-treat population, a 71% reduction in total shedding ( _P_ <.001), a 58% reduction in subclinical shedding ( _P_ <.001), and a 64% reduction in clinical shedding ( _P_ \\=.01) were observed. Valacyclovir was not associated with any significant toxic effects compared with placebo.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】This study demonstrated that 1 g/d of valacyclovir administered for 60 days was generally well tolerated and was an effective suppressive therapy that significantly reduced total (clinical and subclinical) HSV-2 shedding compared with placebo in immunocompetent patients diagnosed as having recurrent HSV-2 genital herpes.\n\n【8】AE ( adverse event ), GH ( genital herpes ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), HSV-2 ( herpes simplex virus 2 ), ITT ( intent-to-treat ), PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ), PP ( per protocol )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "b891e6c6-670f-4ccc-84c3-85c4bb61ef1a", "title": "Sun allergy", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Sun allergy is a broad term. It describes several conditions that cause an itchy rash to form on the skin after being in sunlight or other sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Polymorphous light eruption is the most common form of sun allergy.\n\n【2】Some people have a hereditary type of sun allergy. Others develop symptoms only when triggered by another factor — such as taking medication or touching certain plants. Other types of sun-related reactions occur for reasons that are unclear.\n\n【3】Mild sun allergy may clear up without treatment. Severe rashes may be treated with steroid creams or pills. If you have severe sun allergy, you may need to take preventive steps. For example, wear clothing that shields you from the sun.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】How skin with sun allergy looks varies widely depending on the color of your skin and what's causing the symptoms. Signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【6】*   Itchiness (pruritus)\n*   Stinging\n*   Tiny bumps that may merge into raised patches\n*   A flushing of the exposed area\n*   Blisters or hives\n\n【7】Symptoms usually occur only on skin that has been exposed to the sun or other source of UV light. Symptoms show up within minutes to hours after sun exposure.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】See a health care provider if you have unusual, bothersome skin reactions after being in the sun. For severe or persistent symptoms, you may need to see someone who specializes in diagnosing and treating skin disorders (dermatologist).\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Causes of sun allergy include immune system reactions to sunlight, certain medications and chemicals that make the skin more sensitive to the sun. It isn't clear why some people have a sun allergy and others don't. Inherited traits may play a role.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】Risk factors for having an allergic reaction to sunlight include:\n\n【14】*   **Contact with certain substances.** Some sun allergy symptoms are triggered when your skin is exposed to a substance and then to sunlight. Common substances responsible for this type of reaction include fragrances, disinfectants and chemicals used in some sunscreens.\n*   **Taking certain medications.** A number of medications can make the skin sunburn more quickly — including tetracycline antibiotics, sulfa-based drugs and pain relievers, such as ketoprofen.\n*   **Having another skin condition.** Having dermatitis increases your risk of having a sun allergy.\n*   **Having a blood relative with a sun allergy.** You're more likely to have a sun allergy if you have a sibling or parent with a sun allergy.\n\n【15】Prevention\n----------\n\n【16】If you have a sun allergy or an increased sensitivity to the sun, you can help prevent a reaction by taking these steps:\n\n【17】*   **Avoid sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.** The sun's rays are strongest during these hours. Try to schedule outdoor activities for other times. If you can't do that, limit the time you're in the sun. Seek shade when possible.\n*   **Avoid sudden exposure to lots of sunlight.** Many people have sun allergy symptoms seasonally. Symptoms occur when daylight hours get longer and people are exposed to more sunlight. At these times, gradually increase the amount of time you spend outdoors so that your skin has time to adapt to increased sunlight.\n*   **Wear sunglasses and protective clothing.** Long-sleeved shirts and wide-brimmed hats can help protect your skin from sun exposure. Avoid fabrics that are thin or have a loose weave — UV rays can pass through them.\n*   **Apply sunscreen.** Use a water-resistant, broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or perspiring.\n\n【18】    If you're using a product that contains physical blockers (titanium dioxide, zinc oxide), apply it over any other products you're wearing — except insect repellent. Insect repellent goes on last. Physical blockers provide the most effective protection for sensitive skin.\n\n【19】    The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all sunscreen to retain its original strength for at least three years. Check sunscreen labels for directions on storing and expiration dates. Throw away sunscreen if it's expired or more than 3 years old.\n\n【20】*   **Avoid known triggers.** If you know that a certain substance causes your skin reaction, such as a medication or contact with wild parsnip or limes, avoid that trigger.\n*   **Apply UV\\-blocking window film.** Put a UV\\-blocking film on the windows of your home and car.\n\n【21】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The digital care solution collected vital sign measurements and symptom assessments by questionnaires several times per day using standardized care pathways. Alerts were generated by the technology using the care pathways and were reviewed by a team of registered nurses, who also had access to a COVID-19 care team of advanced practice providers and physicians for escalation of care, as needed.\n\n【11】The authors evaluated outcomes of those enrolled in the RMP who did and did not engage with the program, defined by submission of at least 1 set of vital signs through the provided digital solution. Of 5796 patients evaluated, 80% of patients engaged with the RPM program technology. Whereas sex, race, ethnicity, and primary language were similar between cohorts, nonengaged patients were generally older, had more comorbidities, and were diagnosed with COVID-19 while they were inpatients. Patients engaged in the RPM program had significantly lower rates of hospitalization, hospitalization of 7 or more days, and intensive care unit admission compared with nonengaged patients. In addition, engaged patients had significantly shorter hospital length of stay and lower overall 30-day costs of care as well as lower all-cause 30-day mortality rates. Although rates of at least 1 emergency department visit were similar between groups, engaged patients were more likely to have 2 or more visits compared with those who were nonengaged, perhaps indicating that these patients had clinical worsening that required seeking and receiving additional care.\n\n【12】The study has as strengths its use of a large, well-matched cohort and its real-world nature, which did include minority, elderly, and rural populations. Limitations of this report include its retrospective nature and its lack of a true comparable control group managed without RPM and associated risk of participation bias, given the inability to perform intention-to-treat analysis. How a particular patient may lack engagement in an RPM program may reflect a lack of engagement with health care more generally or other factors that were not evaluated.\n\n【13】Overall, the experience and outcomes with COVID-19 and RPM share similarities to the reported experience of others with a range of RPM programs as well as some distinctions.

{"seq_id": "be5e0e2a-d00c-423e-969f-133e3bd0eb93", "title": "Nitroglycerin (Oral Route, Sublingual Route)", "text": "【0】Nitroglycerin (Oral Route, Sublingual Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Gonitro\n2.  Nitrocot\n3.  Nitrolingual\n4.  NitroMist\n5.  Nitroquick\n6.  Nitrostat\n7.  Nitrotab\n8.  Nitro-Time\n\n【4】### Canadian Brand Name\n\n【5】1.  Gen-Nitro\n2.  Nitrolingual Pumpspray\n\n【6】### Descriptions\n\n【7】Nitroglycerin is used to prevent angina (chest pain) caused by coronary artery disease. This medicine is also used to relieve an angina attack that is already occurring.\n\n【8】Nitroglycerin belongs to the group of medicines called nitrates. It works by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its work load. When used regularly on a long-term basis, or just before exercise or a stressful event, this helps prevent angina attacks from occurring.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Spray\n*   Tablet\n*   Capsule, Extended Release\n*   Packet\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of nitroglycerin in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【18】### Geriatric\n\n【19】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of nitroglycerin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving nitroglycerin.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【25】*   Avanafil\n*   Riociguat\n*   Sildenafil\n*   Tadalafil\n*   Vardenafil\n\n【26】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【27】*   Alteplase, Recombinant\n\n【28】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【29】*   Acetylcysteine\n*   Apomorphine\n*   Aspirin\n*   Dihydroergotamine\n*   Pancuronium\n\n【30】### Other Interactions\n\n【31】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【32】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【33】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【34】*   Anemia, severe or\n*   Brain tumor or\n*   Circulatory failure or shock or\n*   Heart attack, acute (already occurring) or\n*   Head injury, severe with increased pressure in the head—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【35】*   Congestive heart failure or\n*   Heart attack, recent or\n*   Heart disease (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis) or\n*   Hypotension (low blood pressure) or\n*   Hypovolemia (low amount of blood)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【36】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【37】Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.\n\n【38】This medicine comes with a patient information insert. Read and follow the instructions in the insert carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【39】Nitroglycerin is available as two types of products that are used for different reasons. The extended-release capsules are used every day on a specific schedule to prevent angina attacks. The oral spray, sublingual powder, and sublingual tablets work quickly to stop an angina attack that has already started or they can be used to prevent angina if you plan to exercise or expect a stressful event.\n\n【40】When you begin to feel an attack of angina starting (chest pains, tightness or squeezing in the chest), sit down. Then place a sublingual powder or tablet in your mouth or under your tongue. If you use the oral spray, you should spray it on or under the tongue. You may become dizzy, lightheaded, or faint soon after using a tablet or spray, so it is safer to sit rather than stand while the medicine is working. If you become dizzy or faint while sitting, take several deep breaths and bend forward with your head between your knees. Remain calm and you should feel better in a few minutes.\n\n【41】If you are taking the nitroglycerin sublingual powder: Empty the contents of a packet under your tongue. Close your mouth and breathe normally. Allow powder to dissolve without swallowing. Do not rinse or spit for 5 minutes after taking this medicine. Do not take more than 3 packets in 15 minutes. If you still have pain after you take a total of 3 packets, this is an emergency. Call 911. Do not drive yourself to the hospital.\n\n【42】Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets should not be chewed, crushed, or swallowed. They work much faster when absorbed through the lining of the mouth. Place the tablet under the tongue or between the cheek and gum, and let it dissolve. Do not eat, drink, smoke, or use chewing tobacco while a tablet is dissolving.\n\n【43】Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets usually give relief in 1 to 5 minutes. However, if the pain is not relieved, you may use a second tablet 5 minutes after you take the first tablet. If the pain continues for another 5 minutes, a third tablet may be used. If you still have chest pain after a total of 3 tablets, contact your doctor or go to a hospital emergency room right away. Do not drive yourself and call 911, if necessary.\n\n【44】You may administer 1 or 2 sprays of Nitroglycerin oral spray at the onset of chest pain. If the pain continues after 5 minutes, a third spray may be used. You must wait 5 minutes after the first 1 or 2 sprays before using a third spray. If you still have chest pain after a total of 3 sprays, contact your doctor or go to a hospital emergency room right away. Do not drive yourself and call 911 if necessary. Do not use more than 3 sprays in a 15-minute period.\n\n【45】Swallow the extended-release capsule whole. Do not split, crush, or chew it.\n\n【46】You should take the extended-release capsule first thing in the morning and follow the same schedule each day. This medicine works best if you have a \"drug-free\" period of time every day when you do not take it. Your doctor will schedule your doses during the day to allow for a drug-free time. Follow the schedule of dosing carefully so the medicine will work properly.\n\n【47】To use the oral spray:\n\n【48】*   Remove the plastic cap.\n*   Do not shake the container.\n*   If this is a new bottle or container, prime the pump before use by releasing a test spray. This must be done 5 or 10 times into the air away from your face and other people.\n*   If this is an old bottle and you have not used it for more than 6 weeks, you must prime it again with 1 or 2 test sprays. If it is not been used within 3 months, prime it up to 5 sprays.\n*   Hold the container upright with your forefinger on top of the grooved button. Open your mouth and bring the container as close to it as possible.\n*   Press the button firmly with the forefinger to release the spray 1 or 2 times onto or under the tongue. Do not inhale or breathe in the spray.\n*   Release the button and close your mouth, but do not swallow right away. Do not spit out the spray or rinse your mouth for at least 5 to 10 minutes.\n*   If you need a third spray, you must wait 5 minutes after the second spray. Use exactly the same steps you used for the first spray. No more than 3 sprays should be given within 15 minutes.\n*   Replace the cover after using the medicine.\n*   Always place the spray bottle in an upright position if not in use. Also, check the fluid level of Nitromist® container regularly. If the fluid reaches the top or middle of the hole on the side of container, this is an indicator that you must get a refill.\n*   Do not use the spray near heat, an open flame, or while smoking.\n\n【49】### Dosing\n\n【50】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine.

As per institutional review board approval and following a protocol designed at the Mayo Clinic Maternal & Fetal Center, fetal intervention was offered between 19 0/7 and 25 6/7 weeks of gestation. Prenatal improvement of hindbrain herniation was the declared restorative end point. Obstetrical and perinatal outcomes were also assessed.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Diagnosis of MMC was confirmed upon referral between 20 and 21 weeks’ gestation by using fetal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. In all cases reported here, the spinal defect was lumbosacral with evidence of hindbrain herniation. Open in utero MMC repair was performed between 24 and 25 weeks’ gestation with no notable perioperative complications. Postprocedure fetal magnetic resonance imaging performed 6 weeks after in utero repair documented improvement of hindbrain herniation. Deliveries were at 37 weeks by cesarean section without complications. Most recent postnatal follow-ups were unremarkable at both 11 months (baby 1) and 3 months of age (baby 2), with mild ventriculomegaly. Antenatal and postnatal follow-up of baby 3 at 1 month of age was also unremarkable.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Our study highlights the prenatal restoration of hindbrain herniation following in utero MMC repair in all cases presented here as an example of a prenatal regenerative therapy program in our institution.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CDH ( congenital diaphragmatic hernia ), IV ( intravenous ), L ( lumbar ), MMC ( myelomeningocele ), MOMS ( Management of Myelomeningocele Study ), MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ), S ( sacral )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "7caa8171-0a5c-4579-8429-eeeac0ae56a2", "title": "Leukoplakia", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】With leukoplakia (loo-koh-PLAY-key-uh), thickened, white patches form on your gums, the insides of your cheeks, the bottom of your mouth and, sometimes, your tongue. These patches can't be scraped off.\n\n【2】Doctors don't know what causes leukoplakia but consider chronic irritation from tobacco — whether smoked, dipped or chewed — to be the main culprit in its development.\n\n【3】Most leukoplakia patches are noncancerous (benign), though some show early signs of cancer. Cancers on the bottom of the mouth can occur next to areas of leukoplakia. And white areas mixed in with red areas (speckled leukoplakia) may indicate the potential for cancer. So it's best to see your dentist or primary care professional if you have unusual, persistent changes in your mouth.\n\n【4】A type of leukoplakia called hairy leukoplakia, sometimes called oral hairy leukoplakia, primarily affects people whose immune systems have been weakened by disease, especially HIV/AIDS.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Leukoplakia usually occurs on your gums, the insides of your cheeks, the bottom of your mouth — beneath the tongue — and, sometimes, your tongue. It isn't usually painful and may go unnoticed for a while.\n\n【7】Leukoplakia may appear:\n\n【8】*   White or grayish in patches that can't be wiped away\n*   Irregular or flat-textured\n*   Thickened or hardened in areas\n*   Along with raised, red lesions (speckled leukoplakia or erythroplakia), which are more likely to show precancerous changes\n\n【9】#### Hairy leukoplakia\n\n【10】Hairy leukoplakia causes fuzzy, white patches that resemble folds or ridges, usually on the sides of your tongue. It's often mistaken for oral thrush, an infection marked by creamy white patches that can be wiped away, which is also common in people with a weakened immune system.\n\n【11】#### When to see a doctor\n\n【12】Even though leukoplakia doesn't usually cause discomfort, sometimes it can indicate a more serious condition.\n\n【13】See your dentist or primary care professional if you have any of the following:\n\n【14】*   White plaques or sores in your mouth that don't heal on their own within two weeks\n*   Lumps or white, red or dark patches in your mouth\n*   Persistent changes in the tissues of your mouth\n*   Ear pain when swallowing\n*   Progressive reduction in the ability to open your jaw\n\n【15】Causes\n------\n\n【16】Although the cause of leukoplakia is unknown, chronic irritation, such as from tobacco use, including smoking and chewing, appears to be responsible for most cases. Often, regular users of smokeless tobacco products eventually develop leukoplakia where they hold the tobacco against their cheeks.\n\n【17】Other causes may include chronic irritation from:\n\n【18】*   Jagged, broken or sharp teeth rubbing on tongue surfaces\n*   Broken or ill-fitting dentures\n*   Long-term alcohol use\n\n【19】Your dentist can talk with you about what may be causing leukoplakia in your case.\n\n【20】#### Hairy leukoplakia\n\n【21】Hairy leukoplakia results from infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Once you've been infected with EBV, the virus remains in your body for life. Normally, the virus is dormant, but if your immune system is weakened, especially from HIV/AIDS, the virus can become reactivated, leading to conditions such as hairy leukoplakia.\n\n【22】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【23】Tobacco use, particularly smokeless tobacco, puts you at high risk of leukoplakia and oral cancer. Long-term alcohol use increases your risk, and drinking alcohol combined with smoking increases your risk even more.\n\n【24】#### Hairy leukoplakia\n\n【25】People with HIV/AIDS are especially likely to develop hairy leukoplakia. Although the use of antiretroviral drugs has reduced the number of cases, hairy leukoplakia still affects a number of HIV-positive people, and it may be one of the first signs of HIV infection.\n\n【26】Complications\n-------------\n\n【27】Leukoplakia usually doesn't cause permanent damage to tissues in your mouth. However, leukoplakia increases your risk of oral cancer. Oral cancers often form near leukoplakia patches, and the patches themselves may show cancerous changes. Even after leukoplakia patches are removed, the risk of oral cancer remains.\n\n【28】#### Hairy leukoplakia\n\n【29】Hairy leukoplakia isn't likely to lead to cancer. But it may indicate HIV/AIDS.\n\n【30】Prevention\n----------\n\n【31】You may be able to prevent leukoplakia if you avoid all tobacco products or alcohol use. Talk to your doctor about methods to help you quit. If you continue to smoke or chew tobacco or drink alcohol, have frequent dental checkups. Oral cancers are usually painless until fairly advanced, so quitting tobacco and alcohol is a better prevention strategy.\n\n【32】#### Hairy leukoplakia\n\n【33】If you have a weakened immune system, you may not be able to prevent hairy leukoplakia, but identifying it early can help you receive appropriate treatment.\n\n【34】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The populations at risk for head and neck cancers are those who have a long-standing history of smoking and alcohol use. More recently, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer in younger populations has been increasing and is associated with exposure to the human papillomavirus. This subset of patients appears to have a better overall prognosis and to respond better to treatment. This review is limited to head and neck cancers of squamous cell histology, which constitute more than 90% of head and neck cancers. Because treatment of head and neck cancers is complex and involves multiple modalities, a multidisciplinary approach is needed. This review focuses on the goal of organ preservation and postoperative treatment of high-risk patients with the concurrent use of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This review also highlights recent advances in treatment using molecularly targeted therapies, specifically the role of inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor in locally advanced and recurrent/metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of nelarabine injection in children 1 year of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 1 year of age.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of nelarabine injection have not been performed in the geriatric population, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney or nervous system problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving nelarabine injection.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【24】*   Measles Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Mumps Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Rotavirus Vaccine, Live\n*   Rubella Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Varicella Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Zoster Vaccine, Live\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【26】*   Adenovirus Vaccine\n*   Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin Vaccine, Live\n*   Cholera Vaccine, Live\n*   Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine, Live\n*   Influenza Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Pentostatin\n*   Poliovirus Vaccine, Live\n*   Smallpox Vaccine\n*   Typhoid Vaccine, Live\n*   Yellow Fever Vaccine\n\n【27】### Other Interactions\n\n【28】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【30】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【31】*   Blood problems (eg, anemia, neutropenia) or\n*   Hyperuricemia (high uric acid in the blood) or\n*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease or\n*   Nervous system problems—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【32】*   Infection—May decrease your body's ability to fight infections.\n\n【33】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【34】A doctor or other trained health professional will give you or your child this medicine in a hospital or cancer treatment center. This medicine is given through a needle placed into one of your veins.\n\n【35】This medicine usually comes with patient information or directions. Read them carefully and make sure you understand them before receiving this medicine. If you have any questions, ask your doctor.\n\n【36】While you are using this medicine, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids so that you will pass more urine. This will help prevent kidney problems and keep your kidneys working well.\n\n【37】Nelarabine sometimes causes nausea and vomiting. However, it is very important that you continue to receive the medicine, even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your doctor for ways to lessen these effects if they bother you.\n\n【38】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【39】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【40】Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control during treatment to keep from getting pregnant. Men should use an effective form of birth control (eg, condoms) during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose to prevent pregnancy in a sexual partner. If a pregnancy occurs while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【41】Do not use this medicine together with pentostatin (Nipent®). Using these medicines together may increase your chance for more serious side effects.\n\n【42】Nelarabine can cause serious nervous system problems. This may be more likely in patients who have had cancer treatment or radiation treatment to the head or back in the past. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have a headache, dizziness, numbness and tingling in the hands, fingers, feet, or toes, extreme sleepiness, seizures, clumsiness or unsteadiness while walking, or weakness in the arms, hands, legs, or feet.\n\n【43】While you are being treated with nelarabine, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Nelarabine may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you or your child might get the infection the vaccination is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have taken oral polio vaccine within the last several months. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.\n\n【44】Nelarabine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【45】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【46】This medicine may cause a serious reaction called tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Call your doctor right away if you or your child have a change in how much or how often you urinate, rapid weight gain, muscle or joint pain, swelling of the feet or lower legs, or feel tired.\n\n【47】This medicine may cause some people to become dizzy, lightheaded, drowsy, or less alert than they are normally. If any of these side effects occur, do not drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or are not alert while you are using nelarabine.\n\n【48】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【49】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【50】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【51】#### More common\n\n【52】1.  Abdominal or stomach pain or cramps\n2.  anxiety\n3.  black, tarry stools\n4.  bleeding gums\n5.  blood in the urine or stools\n6.  bloody nose\n7.  blurred vision\n8.  burning, crawling, itching, numbness, prickling, \"pins and needles\", or tingling feelings\n9.  change in walking and balance\n10.  chest pain\n11.  chills\n12.  clumsiness or unsteadiness\n13.  cold sweats\n14.  coma\n15.  convulsions\n16.  cool, pale skin\n17.  cough or hoarseness\n18.  decreased or uncontrolled urination\n19.  difficulty with breathing\n20.  discouragement\n21.  dizziness, faintness, or lightheadedness when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting position\n22.  drowsiness\n23.  dry mouth\n24.  fast or irregular heartbeat\n25.  feeling sad or empty\n26.  feeling unusually cold\n27.  fever\n28.  flushed, dry skin\n29.  fruit-like breath odor\n30.  headache\n31.  incoordination\n32.  increased hunger\n33.  increased thirst\n34.  increased urination\n35.  irritability\n36.  loss of appetite\n37.  loss of interest or pleasure\n38.  lower back, side, or stomach pain\n39.  mood or mental changes\n40.  muscle cramps in the hands, arms, feet, legs, or face\n41.  muscle pain\n42.  muscle spasms (tetany) or twitching\n43.  muscle weakness\n44.  nausea or vomiting\n45.  nervousness\n46.  nightmares\n47.  numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness in the hands, feet, fingertips, or mouth\n48.  pain or tenderness around the eyes and cheekbones\n49.  painful or difficult urination\n50.  pale skin\n51.  paralysis or severe weakness of the legs\n52.  pinpoint red spots on the skin\n53.  rapid breathing\n54.  seizures\n55.  shakiness and unsteady walk\n56.  shivering\n57.  sleepiness or unusual drowsiness\n58.  slurred speech\n59.  small red or purple spots on the skin\n60.  sneezing\n61.  sore throat\n62.  sores, ulcers, or white spots on the lips or in the mouth\n63.  stuffy or runny nose\n64.  sunken eyes\n65.  sweating\n66.  swelling of the hands, ankles, feet, or lower legs\n67.  swollen glands\n68.  tightness in the chest\n69.  trouble concentrating\n70.  trouble sleeping\n71.  troubled breathing with exertion\n72.  uncontrolled bowel movements\n73.  unexplained weight loss\n74.  unsteadiness, trembling, or other problems with muscle control or coordination\n75.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n76.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n77.  wrinkled skin\n78.  yellow eyes or skin\n\n【53】#### Less common\n\n【54】1.

Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition affecting males, and it often isn't diagnosed until adulthood.\n\n【2】Klinefelter syndrome may adversely affect testicular growth, resulting in smaller than normal testicles, which can lead to lower production of testosterone. The syndrome may also cause reduced muscle mass, reduced body and facial hair, and enlarged breast tissue. The effects of Klinefelter syndrome vary, and not everyone has the same signs and symptoms.\n\n【3】Most men with Klinefelter syndrome produce little or no sperm, but assisted reproductive procedures may make it possible for some men with Klinefelter syndrome to father children.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome vary widely among males with the disorder. Many boys with Klinefelter syndrome show few or only mild signs. The condition may go undiagnosed until adulthood or it may never be diagnosed. For others, the condition has a noticeable effect on growth or appearance.\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome also vary by age.\n\n【7】### Babies\n\n【8】Signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【9】*   Weak muscles\n*   Slow motor development — taking longer than average to sit up, crawl and walk\n*   Delay in speaking\n*   Problems at birth, such as testicles that haven't descended into the scrotum\n\n【10】### Boys and teenagers\n\n【11】Signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【12】*   Taller than average stature\n*   Longer legs, shorter torso and broader hips compared with other boys\n*   Absent, delayed or incomplete puberty\n*   After puberty, less muscle and less facial and body hair compared with other teens\n*   Small, firm testicles\n*   Small penis\n*   Enlarged breast tissue (gynecomastia)\n*   Weak bones\n*   Low energy levels\n*   Tendency to be shy and sensitive\n*   Difficulty expressing thoughts and feelings or socializing\n*   Problems with reading, writing, spelling or math\n\n【13】### Men\n\n【14】Signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【15】*   Low sperm count or no sperm\n*   Small testicles and penis\n*   Low sex drive\n*   Taller than average height\n*   Weak bones\n*   Decreased facial and body hair\n*   Less muscular compared with other men\n*   Enlarged breast tissue\n*   Increased belly fat\n\n【16】### When to see a doctor\n\n【17】See a doctor if you or your son has:\n\n【18】*   **Slow development during infancy or boyhood.** Delays in growth and development can be the first sign of a number of conditions that need treatment — including Klinefelter syndrome. Though some variation in physical and mental development is normal, it's best to check with a doctor if you have any concerns.\n*   **Male infertility.** Many men with Klinefelter syndrome aren't diagnosed with infertility until they realize they're unable to father a child.\n\n【19】Causes\n------\n\n【20】Klinefelter syndrome occurs as a result of a random error that causes a male to be born with an extra sex chromosome. It isn't an inherited condition.\n\n【21】Humans have 46 chromosomes, including two sex chromosomes that determine a person's sex. Females have two X sex chromosomes (XX). Males have an X and a Y sex chromosome (XY).\n\n【22】Klinefelter syndrome can be caused by:\n\n【23】*   One extra copy of the X chromosome in each cell (XXY), the most common cause\n*   An extra X chromosome in some of the cells (mosaic Klinefelter syndrome), with fewer symptoms\n*   More than one extra copy of the X chromosome, which is rare and results in a severe form\n\n【24】Extra copies of genes on the X chromosome can interfere with male sexual development and fertility.\n\n【25】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【26】Klinefelter syndrome stems from a random genetic event. The risk of Klinefelter syndrome isn't increased by anything a parent does or doesn't do. For older mothers, the risk is higher but only slightly.\n\n【27】Complications\n-------------\n\n【28】Klinefelter syndrome may increase the risk of:\n\n【29】*   Anxiety and depression\n*   Social, emotional and behavioral problems, such as low self-esteem, emotional immaturity and impulsiveness\n*   Infertility and problems with sexual function\n*   Weak bones (osteoporosis)\n*   Heart and blood vessel disease\n*   Breast cancer and certain other cancers\n*   Lung disease\n*   Metabolic syndrome, which includes type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), and high cholesterol and triglycerides (hyperlipidemia)\n*   Autoimmune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Tooth and oral problems that make dental cavities more likely\n*   Autism spectrum disorder\n\n【30】A number of complications caused by Klinefelter syndrome are related to low testosterone (hypogonadism). Testosterone replacement therapy reduces the risk of certain health problems, especially when therapy is started at the beginning of puberty.\n\n【31】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "2a12dd61-108a-46bb-8cb0-8a1a209294ce", "title": "Addison's disease", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Addison's disease, also called adrenal insufficiency, is an uncommon illness that occurs when the body doesn't make enough of certain hormones. In Addison's disease, the adrenal glands make too little cortisol and, often, too little of another hormone, aldosterone.\n\n【2】Addison's disease can affect anyone and can be life-threatening. Treatment involves taking hormones to replace those that are missing.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Addison's disease symptoms usually happen slowly, often over months. The disease can move so slowly that people who have it may ignore the symptoms at first. Then a stress, such as illness or injury, makes symptoms worse.\n\n【5】Symptoms may include:\n\n【6】*   Extreme fatigue\n*   Weight loss and loss of appetite\n*   Areas of darkened skin\n*   Low blood pressure, even fainting\n*   Salt craving\n*   Low blood sugar, also called hypoglycemia\n*   Nausea, diarrhea or vomiting\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Muscle and joint pain\n*   Irritability\n*   Depression\n*   Body hair loss or sexual issues in some people\n\n【7】### Acute adrenal failure, known as addisonian crisis\n\n【8】Sometimes the symptoms of Addison's disease appear suddenly. Acute adrenal failure can lead to life-threatening shock. Seek emergency treatment for the following:\n\n【9】*   Severe weakness\n*   Confusion\n*   Pain in the lower back or legs\n*   Severe abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, leading to dehydration\n*   Reduced consciousness or delirium\n*   Low blood pressure\n\n【10】### When to see a doctor\n\n【11】See a health care provider if you have common symptoms of Addison's disease, such as:\n\n【12】*   Darkened areas of skin\n*   Extreme loss of body water, also known as dehydration\n*   Severe fatigue\n*   Weight loss that doesn't happen on purpose\n*   Nausea, vomiting or belly pain\n*   Lightheadedness or fainting\n*   Salt cravings\n*   Muscle or joint pains\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】Addison's disease is caused by damage to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands sit just above the kidneys. As part of the endocrine system, they make hormones that affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Damage to these glands results in too little of the hormone cortisol and, often, the hormone aldosterone.\n\n【15】The adrenal glands are made up of two sections. The interior, called the medulla, makes adrenaline-like hormones. The outer layer, called the cortex, makes a group of hormones called corticosteroids. Corticosteroids include:\n\n【16】*   **Glucocorticoids.** These hormones, including cortisol, affect the body's ability to turn food into energy. They also play a role in the immune system's inflammatory response and help the body respond to stress.\n*   **Mineralocorticoids.** These hormones, including aldosterone, balance the body's sodium and potassium to keep blood pressure in a healthy range.\n*   **Androgens.** In all people, the adrenal glands make small amounts of these sex hormones. They cause male sexual development. And they affect muscle mass, sex drive, known as libido, and a sense of well-being in all people.\n\n【17】### Primary adrenal insufficiency\n\n【18】Sometimes, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, known as the cortex, is damaged. Then it can't make enough hormones, a condition called primary adrenal insufficiency. This is usually the result of an autoimmune disease, in which the body attacks itself. People with Addison's disease are more likely than are other people to have another autoimmune disease as well.\n\n【19】Other causes of adrenal gland failure may include:\n\n【20】*   Tuberculosis\n*   Other infections of the adrenal glands\n*   Spread of cancer to the adrenal glands\n*   Bleeding into the adrenal glands\n\n【21】### Secondary adrenal insufficiency\n\n【22】The pituitary gland makes a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH in turn causes the adrenal cortex to make its hormones. Having pituitary tumors that aren't cancer, inflammation and pituitary surgery can cause the pituitary gland to make too little ACTH.\n\n【23】Too little ACTH can cause the adrenal glands to make too little glucocorticoids and androgens. This is called secondary adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【24】Most symptoms of secondary adrenal insufficiency are similar to those of primary adrenal insufficiency. However, people with secondary adrenal insufficiency don't have darkened skin and are less likely to have severe dehydration or low blood pressure. They're more likely to have low blood sugar.\n\n【25】A temporary cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when people who take corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to treat conditions such as asthma or arthritis, stop taking the medicine suddenly rather than tapering off.\n\n【26】Complications\n-------------\n\n【27】*   **Addisonian crisis.** If you have untreated Addison's disease, you may develop an addisonian crisis as a result of stress on the body, such as injury, infection or illness. Typically, the adrenal glands make two or three times the usual amount of cortisol in response to physical stress. With adrenal insufficiency, not being able to increase the amount of cortisol made as a result of stress can lead to an addisonian crisis.\n\n【28】    An addisonian crisis is a life-threatening situation that results in low blood pressure, low blood levels of sugar and high blood levels of potassium. It requires immediate medical care.\n\n【29】*   **Other autoimmune diseases.** People with Addison's disease often have related autoimmune diseases.\n\n【30】Prevention\n----------\n\n【31】Addison's disease can't be prevented, but there are ways to avoid an addisonian crisis:\n\n【32】*   Talk to your health care provider if you always feel tired or weak or are losing weight without trying. Ask about an adrenal shortage.\n*   If you have been diagnosed with Addison's disease, ask your provider what to do when you're sick. You may need to learn how to increase your dose of corticosteroids.\n*   If you become very sick, especially if you are vomiting and you can't take your medicine, go to an emergency room.\n\n【33】Some people with Addison's disease worry about serious side effects from hydrocortisone or prednisone. However, people with Addison's disease aren't as likely to get the side effects of high-dose glucocorticoids. That's because the dose prescribed replaces the amount that's missing.\n\n【34】If you take cortisone, be sure to follow up with your provider regularly to make sure your dose is not too high.\n\n【35】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Although several commercial products are available that synthesize large amounts of medical information into easily digestible reviews, these services frequently rely on overviews conducted by experts and may not be current. Furthermore, clinicians may have specific clinical questions that are better answered with a single article or systematic review rather than a broad topical review.\n\n【8】PubMed, a resource developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Library of Medicine (NLM), provides free access to MEDLINE (MEDLARS Online) and other databases to any person who has Internet access.\n\n【9】*   National Library of Medicine\n\n【10】PubMed overview.\n\n【11】删除3:<u>Available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query/static/overview.html</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【13】删除3:<u>MEDLINE is the NLM database of all published biomedical literature relevant to clinical practice.

PubMed also provides resources such as an Overview, online Help, and frequently asked questions (FAQ) on the blue sidebar on the left-hand side of each screen.\n\n【27】删除3:<u>Figure 1 Entrez at http://www.pubmed.gov .</u>\n\n【28】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【29】_Type “helicobacter pylori” in the Query box and select the Go button._\n\n【30】Citations are displayed from the newest to the oldest in a default Summary format. PubMed will search back to 1966 unless a date limit is specified. The drop-down menu Display allows the user the option of viewing the retrieved citations in a variety of formats. The number of citations are shown on the gray bar, and the first 20 are shown by default. More citations can be displayed by selecting the desired number with the drop-down menu on the left. The number of pages of citations is also displayed on the gray bar, and specific pages can be reviewed by selecting the blue numbers on the right. Users can save the references and display them as a text file. This text file can be imported easily into commercially available reference manager software.\n\n【31】### Boolean Operators\n\n【32】PubMed searches can be refined by using multiple search terms connected by Boolean operators: AND, OR, and NOT. Boolean operators must be entered in upper case. The operator AND selects the references that contain both search terms, OR selects the references that contain either search term, and NOT selects the references that contain the first term but not the second term. NOT should be used carefully, if at all. NOT is an absolute, and it can have unintended effects. For example, the query “heart attack NOT smoke” might eliminate articles in which the subjects are smoking, and it would also eliminate articles dealing with secondhand smoke, nonsmoking, or smoking cessation. PubMed processes all Boolean operators in a left-to-right sequence unless closed off by parenthesis, eg, helicobacter pylori AND (non-ulcer dyspepsia OR gastritis).\n\n【33】_Enter “helicobacter pylori_ AND _non-ulcer dyspepsia” in the Query box and select Go._\n\n【34】### Limits\n\n【35】PubMed allows users to refine searches further by imposing Limits, including publication type, age and sex of research subjects, date of publication, language, human or animal, or journal subsets.\n\n【36】_Select the following limits from the drop-down menus: randomized-controlled trial; middle aged, 45-64; English; human; and male. Select Go. Look for an article that answers your clinical question._\n\n【37】A check mark will be displayed in front of Limits to signify that limits are imposed for the results of this search. The specific Limits are displayed beneath the Features bar. Placing Limits on the search decreases the number of citations that need to be reviewed to answer your clinical question. Clicking on a citation title “hyperlinks” (ie, different-colored text that links to other Web pages) to the abstract. The user can connect to the full-text article online by selecting the journal icon displayed at the top of the abstract display. In some instances, the article is available or will be after a certain period. In most cases, however, access to the full text is limited to those individuals and institutions subscribing to the electronic version of the publication. For individuals without access to a medical or hospital library, articles can be ordered through the NLM through Loansome Doc (explored in more detail through the Order Documents or the NLM Gateway hyperlink on the blue sidebar on the left-hand side of the screen).\n\n【38】### CASE 2\n\n【39】A 47-year-old woman with cachexia and a history of chronic alcoholism presents with a 3-day episode of epigastric pain, anorexia, and nausea. Findings on a diagnostic evaluation are normal except for elevated pancreatic enzymes and an albumin level of 1.5 g/dL. After 24 hours, she feels hungry, but a general surgeon recommends continued bowel rest. You are concerned about her nutritional status and wish to start feedings. You ask yourself, “In patients with acute pancreatitis, does enteral versus parenteral nutrition decrease the length of hospitalization?”\n\n【40】### Search Filters\n\n【41】PubMed allows users to search for articles using Clinical Queries and Systematic Reviews search filters. These can be accessed through the Clinical Queries hyperlink on the sidebar on the left-hand side of the screen 删除4:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Clinical Queries are validated search strategies to locate articles on therapy, diagnosis, etiology, or prognosis.\n\n【42】无关删除-2:<u>*   Haynes RB\n*   Wilczynski N\n*   McKibbon KA\n*   Walker CJ\n*   Sinclair JC</u>\n\n【43】Developing optimal search strategies for detecting clinically sound studies in MEDLINE.\n\n【44】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Am Med Inform Assoc._ 1994; 1 : 447-458</u></u>\n\n【45】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (569)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【46】These “filters” or “hedges” are designed to allow clinicians to search by maximizing either the specificity or the sensitivity of the search. The Systematic Reviews search filter will locate articles identified as systematic reviews, meta-analyses, reviews of clinical trials, clinical reviews, guidelines, evidence-based medicine, and consensus development conferences. Either filter can be used by selecting the button in front of it. Search terms need to be entered in the Query box on the bottom of the Clinical Queries page. Searches can be further refined by imposing Limits on the retrieved citations.\n\n【47】Figure 2 Clinical Queries search filters.\n\n【48】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【49】_On the Clinical Queries search filter page, select Clinical Queries,_ ” _therapy,_ “ _and_ ” _sensitivity_ .” _Type_ ” _acute pancreatitis AND enteral nutrition AND hospital” in the Query box and select Go. Look for an article that answers your clinical question._\n\n【50】For this search we entered an additional term for outcome (ie, hospital) instead of 2 terms as we have done before. Entering more search terms may assist in increasing the search relevance.\n\n【51】### CASE 3\n\n【52】An 82-year-old man with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding from arteriovenous (av) malformations presents again with hematochezia, anemia, and orthostatism. He was previously found not to be a surgical candidate, and you wonder about additional therapeutic options when your colleague mentions estrogen therapy. You are unaware of the evidence and ask yourself, “In patients with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to av malformations, does hormonal therapy result in fewer episodes of bleeding and fewer transfusions than treatment with placebo?”\n\n【53】_Type in “av malformations AND estrogens” and select Go. As you look through the retrieved references, you will note that the articles do not answer your clinical question._\n\n【54】### Using MeSH Terms to Construct Searches\n\n【55】The language of medicine is rich. Concepts can be described by using a wide range of synonyms. Case 3 illustrates the pitfalls of depending on familiar key words alone. MeSH ( _M_ edical Subject _H_ eading) is NLM's hierarchical vocabulary that is used for indexing articles in PubMed, with more specific terms organized underneath more general terms. MeSH contains more than 19,000 terms and is updated annually to adapt to changes in medicine and medical terminology. Subject analysts examine each journal article indexed in PubMed and assign the most specific MeSH terms applicable, usually 10 to 12. This provides a reliable way to retrieve citations that use different terminology for the same concept because it indexes articles based on content rather than on the words of the authors.\n\n【56】Two additional features of PubMed capitalize on the MeSH vocabulary and increase the search yield, providing distinct advantages over other commonly used search engines. One of these features of PubMed is “automatic term mapping.” For each phrase that users enter into the query line, PubMed attempts to translate the terms by matching them against term libraries in a consistent manner. PubMed first checks them against a library of MeSH terms, then journal names, then commonly used phrases, and finally against author names. If PubMed finds the term in one of these libraries, it conducts the search by using this phrase in the appropriate search field (ie, author name field, MeSH term field, etc) and also searches for it as a text word in all search fields.\n\n【57】The other feature of PubMed that increases search yield is “automatic term explosion.” Journal articles are entered into PubMed with both MeSH headings (eg, estrogens) and Subheadings. For example, for an article on the use of estrogen as a therapeutic intervention, the subheading “therapeutic use” would be used to characterize a publication more completely. MeSH Subheadings are further grouped into families of subheadings 删除4:<u>(to see MeSH Subheading categories, hyperlink to Help through the blue sidebar and see MeSH Subheadings and Families of MeSH Subheading Explosions)</u>. When PubMed searches for a term, it automatically “explodes” or includes the more specific terms (eg, “estrone” and “estriol” for the term “estrogen”) and all the MeSH Subheadings in the family of subheadings. This effectively increases the search yield. Any time during a search, users can see how PubMed has executed the search by selecting Details in the features menu.\n\n【58】_Hyperlink through the MeSH Browser on the blue sidebar on the left-hand side of the screen. Type in “av malformation” in the Query box, select Go. Select “arteriovenous malformation” from the list of provided terms and select Browse this term._\n\n【59】PubMed was not able to translate your term but instead generated a list of other possible terms to use in the search. Additionally, PubMed defined the term “arteriovenous malformation” and displayed where it appears in the MeSH hierarchy.\n\n【60】_Hyperlink to “vascular diseases” to explore the MeSH terms included under this MeSH heading._\n\n【61】Notice that 2 terms could be used to obtain evidence to answer your clinical question: “arteriovenous malformation” and “angiodysplasia.”\n\n【62】_Hyperlink to “angiodysplasia.” Select Add._\n\n【63】PubMed begins to construct the search in the window 删除4:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>.\n\n【64】Figure 3 Constructing search strategies with MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) terms.\n\n【65】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【66】_Hyperlink to “vascular diseases” and hyperlink to “arteriovenous malformations.” Add this term but change the Boolean operator to OR. Type “estrogens” in the top Query box and select Go. Select the Boolean operator AND, select Add. Press PubMed Search to execute the search._\n\n【67】If you are interested in a higher level of evidence (ie, randomized-controlled clinical trial), you can set Limits to clinical trial. At the right of the screen is a link entitled Related Articles. This PubMed feature searches for similar citations by using a complex algorithm that scans titles, abstracts, and MeSH terms.\n\n【68】ADDITIONAL FEATURES\n-------------------\n\n【69】PubMed provides all users with the option to register for the Cubby, which is free of charge. This feature allow users to store and update searches. First-time users must register and select a unique password for access. This resource might be used to conduct systematic reviews because it allows users to update searches quickly, which can be kept in the Cubby indefinitely.\n\n【70】ADVANCED FEATURES\n-----------------\n\n【71】PubMed provides many other advanced features that will assist interested clinicians in finding the evidence necessary to make informed clinical decisions. We encourage users who become more comfortable with basic features to challenge themselves to use the Help, Overview, and Tutorials that are available through the blue sidebar on the left- hand side of the screen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

At the beginning of the study, all medications that were used daily, including prescription and nonprescription NSAIDs, were ascertained by trained interviewers. Men who developed a histologically proved diagnosis of prostate cancer during a median of 66 months (maximum, 6 years) of follow-up were identified from a complete review of the community medical record.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Twenty-three (4%) of 569 NSAID users and 68 (9%) of 793 nonusers developed prostate cancer during follow-up ( _P_ \\=.001). The relative odds of prostate cancer were 0.45 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.28-0.73) in NSAID users compared with nonusers. This inverse asso-ciation with NSAID use increased with increasing age at study onset. Thus, the relative odds of prostate cancer among NSAID users were 0.9 (95% CI, 0.4-2.2) in men aged 50 to 59 years, 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8) in men aged 60 to 69 years, and 0.2 (95% CI, 0.1-0.5) in men aged 70 to 79 years compared with similarly aged men who did not use NSAIDs.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】The study findings suggest that daily use of NSAIDs may be associated with a lower incidence of prostate cancer in men aged 60 years or older. The stronger effect among older men suggests that NSAIDs may prevent the progression of prostate cancer from latent to clinical disease.\n\n【8】BPH ( benign prostatic hyperplasia ), CI ( confidence interval ), COX-2 ( cyclooxygenase 2 ), DRE ( digital rectal examination ), NSAID ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ), OR ( odds ratio ), PSA ( prostate-specific antigen )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【33】*   Alcohol use, active or history of or\n*   Liver disease (including hepatitis) or\n*   Obesity (overweight) or\n*   Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), history of or\n*   Peripheral neuropathy (nerve disorder), history of—Use with caution. May cause side effects to become worse.\n\n【34】*   Kidney disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【35】*   Portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the portal vein of the liver)—Use with caution. May make this condition worse.\n\n【36】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【37】Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop taking this medicine without checking first with your doctor.\n\n【38】This medicine comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【39】Keep taking didanosine for the full time of treatment, even if you begin to feel better. Only take medicine that your doctor has prescribed specifically for you. Do not share your medicine with other people.\n\n【40】This medicine works best when there is a constant amount in the blood. To help keep the amount constant, do not miss any doses. If you need help in planning the best times to take your medicine, check with your doctor.\n\n【41】Didanosine should be taken on an empty stomach since food may keep it from working properly. Didanosine oral liquid should be taken at least 30 minutes before or 2 hours after you eat.\n\n【42】Swallow the delayed-release capsule whole. Do not break, crush, chew, or open it.\n\n【43】Shake the oral liquid before use. Measure each dose with a specially marked measuring spoon or measuring cup. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.\n\n【44】### Dosing\n\n【45】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【46】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【47】*   For HIV infection:\n    *   For oral dosage form (delayed-release capsules):\n        *   Adults and children who can swallow capsules—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor.\n            *   For patients weighing 60 kilograms (kg) or more—400 milligrams (mg) once a day.\n            *   For patients weighing 25 kg to less than 60 kg—250 mg once a day.\n            *   For patients weighing 20 kg to less than 25 kg—200 mg once a day.\n        *   Children weighing less than 20 kg—The oral capsules are not given to small children.\n    *   For oral dosage form (solution):\n        *   Adults weighing 60 kilograms (kg) or more—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The usual dose is 200 milligrams (mg) 2 times a day or 400 mg once a day.\n        *   Adults weighing less than 60 kg—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The usual dose is 125 mg 2 times a day or 250 mg once a day.\n        *   Children older than 8 months of age—Dose is based on body size and must be determined by your doctor. The usual dose is 120 milligrams per square meter (mg/m(2)) 2 times a day.\n        *   Infants 2 weeks to 8 months old—Dose is based on body size and must be determined by your doctor. The usual dose is 100 mg/m(2) 2 times a day.\n        *   Infants younger than 2 weeks old—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【48】### Missed Dose\n\n【49】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【50】### Storage\n\n【51】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【52】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【53】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【54】Store the delayed-release capsules in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【55】Store the oral liquid in the refrigerator. Throw away any unused medicine after 30 days.\n\n【56】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【57】It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【58】Do not use didanosine if you or your child are also using allopurinol (Zyloprim®), ribavirin (Copegus®, Rebetol®), or stavudine (Zerit®). Using these medicines together may cause serious side effects.\n\n【59】This medicine may cause a life-threatening condition called pancreatitis. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have more than one of these symptoms: bloating, chills, constipation, darkened urine, a fast heartbeat, fever, indigestion, loss of appetite, nausea, pains in the stomach, side, or abdomen, possibly radiating to the back, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin.\n\n【60】Two rare but serious reactions to this medicine are lactic acidosis (too much acid in the blood) and liver toxicity, which includes an enlarged liver. These are more common if you are female, very overweight (obese), or have been taking anti-HIV medicines for a long time. Call your doctor right away if you or your child have more than one of these symptoms: abdominal or stomach discomfort or cramping, dark urine, decreased appetite, diarrhea, a general feeling of discomfort, light-colored stools, muscle cramping or pain, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin.\n\n【61】Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have abdominal or stomach pain, black, tarry stools, bleeding gums, blood in the urine or stools, pinpoint red spots on the skin, or unusual bleeding or bruising. These may be symptoms of a condition called non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.\n\n【62】Tell your doctor right away if you or your child start having numbness, tingling, or burning pain in your hands, arms, legs, or feet. These may be symptoms of a condition called peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【63】Your immune system may get stronger when you start taking HIV medicines. Sometimes the immune system will start to fight infections that were hidden in your body, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis, or may result in a flare-up of a hidden autoimmune disorder such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, or Guillain-Barré syndrome. Tell your doctor right away if you notice any changes in your health.\n\n【64】This medicine may cause you or your child to lose fat from your legs, arms, or face. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns.\n\n【65】Check with your doctor right away if you or your child start to see unusual colors or have blurred vision. Your doctor may want you to have your eyes checked regularly by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist).\n\n【66】Do not drink alcohol while you are using this medicine.\n\n【67】This medicine will not keep you from giving HIV to your partner during sex. Make sure you understand this and practice safe sex, even if your partner also has HIV, by using a latex condom or other barrier method. This medicine will also not keep you from giving HIV to other people if they are exposed to your blood. Do not re-use or share needles with anyone.\n\n【68】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【69】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【70】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【71】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【72】#### Less common\n\n【73】1.

{"seq_id": "6f2a94cd-76b0-41af-b03d-872cb0f9b6ee", "title": "Interstitial lung disease", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Interstitial (in-tur-STISH-ul) lung disease describes a large group of disorders, most of which cause progressive scarring of lung tissue. The scarring associated with interstitial lung disease eventually affects your ability to breathe and get enough oxygen into your bloodstream.\n\n【2】Interstitial lung disease can be caused by long-term exposure to hazardous materials, such as asbestos. Some types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, also can cause interstitial lung disease. In some cases, however, the causes remain unknown.\n\n【3】Once lung scarring occurs, it's generally irreversible. Medications may slow the damage of interstitial lung disease, but many people never regain full use of their lungs. Lung transplant is an option for some people who have interstitial lung disease.\n\n【4】Interstitial lung disease care at Mayo Clinic\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】The primary signs and symptoms of interstitial lung disease are:\n\n【7】*   Shortness of breath at rest or aggravated by exertion\n*   Dry cough\n\n【8】#### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】By the time symptoms appear, irreversible lung damage has often already occurred. Nevertheless, it's important to see your doctor at the first sign of breathing problems. Many conditions other than interstitial lung disease can affect your lungs, and getting an early and accurate diagnosis is important for proper treatment.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Interstitial lung disease seems to occur when an injury to your lungs triggers an abnormal healing response. Ordinarily, your body generates just the right amount of tissue to repair damage. But in interstitial lung disease, the repair process goes awry and the tissue around the air sacs (alveoli) becomes scarred and thickened. This makes it more difficult for oxygen to pass into your bloodstream.\n\n【12】Interstitial lung disease can be triggered by many different things — including airborne toxins in the workplace, drugs and some types of medical treatments. In most cases, the causes are unknown.\n\n【13】#### Occupational and environmental factors\n\n【14】Long-term exposure to a number of toxins and pollutants can damage your lungs. These may include:\n\n【15】*   Silica dust\n*   Asbestos fibers\n*   Grain dust\n*   Bird and animal droppings\n*   Radiation treatments\n*   Indoor hot tubs\n\n【16】Some people who receive radiation therapy for lung or breast cancer show signs of lung damage months or sometimes years after the initial treatment.\n\n【17】#### Medications\n\n【18】Many drugs can damage your lungs, especially:\n\n【19】*   **Chemotherapy drugs.** Drugs designed to kill cancer cells, such as methotrexate (Otrexup, Trexall, others) and cyclophosphamide, can also damage lung tissue.\n*   **Heart medications.** Some drugs used to treat irregular heartbeats, such as amiodarone (Nexterone, Pacerone) or propranolol (Inderal, Innopran), may harm lung tissue.\n*   **Some antibiotics.** Nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Macrodantin, others) and ethambutol (Myambutol) can cause lung damage.\n*   **Anti-inflammatory drugs.** Certain anti-inflammatory drugs, such as rituximab (Rituxan) or sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), can cause lung damage.\n\n【20】#### Medical conditions\n\n【21】Lung damage can also result from autoimmune diseases such as:\n\n【22】*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Scleroderma\n*   Dermatomyositis and polymyositis\n*   Mixed connective tissue disease\n*   Sjogren's syndrome\n*   Sarcoidosis\n\n【23】The list of substances and conditions that can lead to interstitial lung disease is long. Even so, in some cases, the causes are never found. Disorders without a known cause are grouped together under the label of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, the most common and deadly of which is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【24】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【25】Factors that may make you more susceptible to interstitial lung disease include:\n\n【26】*   **Age.** Interstitial lung disease is much more likely to affect adults, although infants and children sometimes develop the disorder.\n*   **Exposure to occupational and environmental toxins.** If you work in mining, farming or construction or for any reason are exposed to pollutants known to damage your lungs, your risk of interstitial lung disease is increased.\n*   **Gastroesophageal reflux disease.** If you have uncontrolled acid reflux or indigestion, you may be at increased risk of interstitial lung disease.\n*   **Smoking.** Some forms of interstitial lung disease are more likely to occur in people with a history of smoking, and active smoking may make the condition worse, especially if there is associated emphysema.\n*   **Radiation and chemotherapy.** Having radiation treatments to your chest or using some chemotherapy drugs makes it more likely that you'll develop lung disease.\n\n【27】Complications\n-------------\n\n【28】Interstitial lung disease can lead to a series of life-threatening complications, including:\n\n【29】*   **High blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension).** Unlike systemic high blood pressure, this condition affects only the arteries in your lungs. It begins when scar tissue or low oxygen levels restrict the smallest blood vessels, limiting blood flow in your lungs. This in turn raises pressure within the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is a serious illness that becomes progressively worse.\n*   **Right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale).** This serious condition occurs when your heart's lower right chamber (right ventricle) — which is less muscular than the left — has to pump harder than usual to move blood through obstructed pulmonary arteries. Eventually the right ventricle fails from the extra strain. This is often a consequence of pulmonary hypertension.\n*   **Respiratory failure.** In the end stage of chronic interstitial lung disease, respiratory failure occurs when severely low blood oxygen levels along with rising pressures in the pulmonary arteries and the right ventricle cause heart failure.\n\n【30】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

We found that lubiprostone treatment significantly improved the severity of constipation, stool consistency, abdominal pain, degree of straining, and abdominal bloating at 1 week ( _P_ ≤.03) and 1 month ( _P_ ≤.004), except for abdominal pain at 1 month, which was similar to that when treated with placebo ( _P_ \\=.21). At 3 months, except for abdominal bloating ( _P_ \\=.03), there was no difference between lubiprostone and placebo groups in all other outcomes ( _P_ ≥.05).

{"seq_id": "18d85dab-6423-49da-a6bf-8ce687c7880a", "title": "Reflections From Past Editors", "text": "【0】Edwin D. Bayrd, MD, Editor-in-Chief 1964–1970\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【1】In the late teens and early 1920s, weekly Wednesday evening meetings for Mayo Clinic staff to hear about interesting cases, results of new studies, and new procedures were organized by Dr Herbert Z. Giffin. The expectation that the meetings would have instructional value for the staff and fellows was immediately validated by “W. J.'s” (ie, Dr William J. Mayo's) meticulous attendance.\n\n【2】Information from this forum was summarized in an institutionally sponsored publication, _The Clinic Bulletin_ , with Volume 1, No.1, appearing on August 1, 1919. This issue reported on the events of the meeting on Wednesday, July 30, held in the “lobby of the Clinic building.” The meetings continued to be held there until the completion of the 1929 building and the provision of Plummer Hall.\n\n【3】Seven years after introduction of _The Clinic Bulletin_ , in the spring of 1926, these reports first appeared in expanded form, bearing the caption _Bulletin of the Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Foundation_ . It carried the interesting report of a young man who had fevers as a result of fatigue. It is this latter Mayo Clinic publication to which the current _Proceedings_ traces its 75th year of service.\n\n【4】The format of the new publication, for almost 5 years, was that of a 2-column, 4-page newsletter. This was changed in 1931 to a 6-× 9-inch single-column format, its size when the lupus erythematosus symposium and the discovery of the LE cell were published in September 1969.\n\n【5】Until mid-1942, the publication continued to be weekly. Because of the demands of World War II on the staff, it was reduced to a biweekly publication.\n\n【6】By 1958, the circulation of the _Proceedings_ exceeded 31,000. By the mid-1960s, circulation was 41,000, and by 1970, approximately 48,500. At that time, a survey of readers revealed that 28% were internists, 13% general surgeons, 9% general practitioners, and the rest were pathologists, radiologists, pediatricians, cardiologists, dermatologists, obstetrician/gynecologists, orthopedists, neurologists, and residents.\n\n【7】Clearly, the _Proceedings_ was a valuable contribution to graduate education and not purely an intramural publication at that time.\n\n【8】However, the pressure of growth and increasing expense necessitated offering the opportunity for ethical commercial firms to advertise in the pages of the _Proceedings_ and accordingly to relinquish the book-size format to the magazine size, as used by advertisers, in January 1971. Thus, the _Proceedings_ of that day appeared poised to enjoy an affordable future with promise, as we now witness as it enters its 75th year of publication.\n\n【9】Alvin B. Hayles, MD, Editor-in-Chief 1971–1976\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【10】During his career, Dr Alvin B. Hayles published more than 125 articles on pediatric endocrinology and growth hormone. During his editorship, the _Proceedings_ first began to accept advertising, the format was enlarged, and monthly circulation reached 65,000. He died March 7, 1988, in Destin, Fla.\n\n【11】John L. Juergens, MD, Editor-in-Chief 1977–1981\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【12】I am impressed that the _Proceedings'_ 75th anniversary almost coincides with the anniversary of my own birth, and I reflect on the fact that the journal has steadily improved qualitatively over the years while I have not. During my tenure as Editor-in-Chief, we made some changes for the better. For example, we changed the design of the journal to its present format and changed the color of the cover from a sickly yellowish tan (ecru?) to bright orange. The font was improved, and letters to the editor, some laudatory, some highly critical, became a regular feature. We sought to improve the quality of published articles by asking reviewers from outside the institution to critique submitted papers, a practice that I am happy to see has continued and expanded.\n\n【13】The Board of Editors in 1964: Drs Arthur M. Olsen, Donald W. Mulder, Edwin D. Bayrd (Editor-in-Chief), Ms Eleonore Clappier (Managing Editor), Drs Carl M. Gambill, E. Starr Judd, Charles A. Owen, Jr, and Patrick J. Kelly.\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【15】One of my colleagues in internal medicine once took me to task for using the editorial “we.” He informed me that only royalty, Siamese twins, and hermaphrodites were entitled to use that pleural pronoun. I was none of these so I stopped its use. Another colleague, perhaps fearing that I was becoming too high-handed as Editor-in-Chief, called my attention to Mark Twain's caustic opinion of editors, which I have never forgotten. Twain wrote, Yours was not, in the beginning, a criminal nature but circumstances changed it. At the age of nine you stole sugar. At the age of fifteen you stole money. At twenty you stole horses. At twenty-five you committed arson. At thirty, hardened in crime, you became an editor.\n\n【16】With friends and colleagues who point out such things, editors tend to remain humble, but I urge them not to become too humble. They should continue to call 'em em as they see 'em! The _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ has a wonderful future.\n\n【17】Robert G. Siekert, MD, Editor-in-Chief 1982–1986\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】When I became Editor-in-Chief of the _Proceedings_ in January 1982, I soon realized firsthand that, as an in-house journal, the _Proceedings_ was viewed by both Mayo and non- Mayo authors in a different way (often less flattering) than journals published by medical and scientific organizations or by publishing houses. The Editorial Board and I worked hard to attract more of the excellent material that was being published elsewhere by our staff, particularly those in full-time investigative endeavors. Attracting good articles was a continual challenge. The review process was greatly expanded to use extramural experts almost exclusively. For example, we had 73 extramural reviewers in 1983 and 174 in 1985. Excellence in the content and structure of each article was a constant goal. Authors were expected to respond to all suggestions made by reviewers, and diligent editorial work was required to be certain that this was done. The rejection rate increased somewhat, and rejection of manuscripts authored by colleagues, particularly after revision, was not a happy occurrence. Similarly, we solicited editorials from non-Mayo authors, often to accompany an important article.\n\n【19】During my tenure at the journal, our advertising representatives, Monte Brown and Joseph Rosalia (the firm of Brown and Rosalia), provided a steady flow of advertising revenue. Even though our editorial content increased, to avoid an excessive number of advertising pages, we set a quota on the number of advertising pages in proportion to the monthly editorial pages.\n\n【20】A major administrative change was made during my tenure at the _Proceedings_ , namely, the separation of the _Proceedings_ from the Section of Publications (now known as the Section of Scientific Publications). In addition to my responsibilities as Editor-in-Chief I had been asked to serve as head of the Section of Publications after the retirement of Dr Werner Heidel in 1982. Although historically all editors in the Section of Publications participated in editing material for the _Proceedings_ , overview of all activities caused me to suggest a reorganization and separation from Publications of a group dedicated specifically to management and production of the journal. This was accomplished in the spring of 1983, and the Section of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ became an independent entity in the Division of Education (now known as the Department of Education Services). Nancy D. Nelson became Executive Editor and was joined by 4 other individuals. The group was physically relocated to offices adjoining one another in order to facilitate communications and flow of work. With this new arrangement, the work was efficiently processed, time-sensitive material was handled expeditiously, and a consistent editorial style was achieved. With the increase in extramural reviewers, a sixth member was added to the group. I had a wonderful time working with the warm and diligent _Proceedings_ personnel, who worked well together and shared the goal of making the journal competitive.\n\n【21】Further professional support was implemented in 1984 with the appointment of an Associate Editor, Dr Robert E. Van Scoy, and a Book Review Editor, Dr Carl F. Anderson. They provided needed backup to the Editor-in-Chief and a better process for obtaining timely reviews of appropriate books, respectively.\n\n【22】I take this opportunity to wish the Editor and his colleagues success in their efforts “to promote a standard of excellence” in the _Proceedings_ . I worked very hard to do that and to accomplish that result by obtaining an increased amount of the good research material produced at Mayo. In retrospect, I should have taken, on a regular basis, my message directly to each and every research chair rather than present it at an occasional department meeting or via members of the Editorial Board, even though the latter may have been researchers themselves.\n\n【23】P. J. Palumbo, MD, Editor-in-Chief 1987–1993\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【24】The history of the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is a 75-year odyssey of scientific publication. The _Proceedings_ originally appeared essentially as a medical travelogue of Drs William J. and Charles H. Mayo and the early staff of the Mayo Clinic to expand the medical knowledge base for the clinic in its role as a health care delivery system. Within a year, this travelogue evolved into the _Proceedings of the Staff Meetings of the Mayo Clinic_ when it represented information presented at evening staff meetings. When the scientific staff meetings gave way to specialty and subspecialty meetings at the Mayo Clinic, the _Proceedings_ published original articles submitted by Mayo Clinic staff. Subsequently, the journal's name was changed to its current title, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ .\n\n【25】The major transition of the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ to the journal we know today occurred with the apppointment of an Editor-in-Chief and Editorial Board in 1964 with the naming of Dr Edwin D. Bayrd as Editor of the journal. The succeeding Editors strengthened the peer-review process, began the introduction of editorials, and, after much discussion and trepidation, began to accept advertising to underwrite the cost of the journal. One of the administrative struggles of the Editorial Board during my tenure was to avoid interspersing the advertising in the middle of scientific articles. Such interspersion posed a distraction for the reader. A compromise was achieved that appears to have lasted. The decline in advertising was also a concern because it tested Mayo Foundation's commitment to the journal. This commitment was firmly reaffirmed in subsequent years as attested to by the continued publication of the journal.\n\n【26】Although advertising was a giant step for the _Proceedings_ , there were also small steps. The peer-review process was expanded. Reviewers were recognized annually in the December issue of the journal. Outside editorials were increased. And, finally, another giant step was taken in 1992: the acceptance of articles from non-Mayo authors. Dr William L. Lanier recently commented in his initial editorial in the millennium issue of the journal that this change went essentially unnoticed. That may be, but it was a major transformation for the journal with long, difficult, and tortuous (but not tortured) discussions by the Editorial Board about where we were taking the journal. Obviously, the Editorial Board's concern was not shared or recognized by the outside readership. With the opening of the journal to non-Mayo authors, discussions ensued about whether the name of the journal should be changed to reflect its general medicine scope. The journal no longer represented a proceedings of staff meetings or publication of articles exclusively by Mayo authors. But “proceedings” can be interpreted liberally, and the Editorial Board decided to do so. The Editorial Board, therefore, during my tenure declined to consider a name change for the journal but accepted its general medicine category and the contributions of outside authors as part of the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ and its mission. Subsequent editors added their own imprint.\n\n【27】Changes were also occurring in the business aspects of the journal. The budget and business activities of the journal were handled through the Education Committee of Mayo Foundation. With the journal's large circulation and advertising responsibilities, the budget became more complex and required the expertise of Mayo Medical Ventures. In 1991, Mayo Medical Ventures acquired the business aspects of the journal, including the advertising and circulation.\n\n【28】The odyssey of the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is a memorable one that parallels the growth and stature of the Mayo Foundation in science, education, and health care delivery. My years as Editor of the _Proceedings_ are cherished ones. It was an honor and privilege to hold that editorship and to contribute with the Editorial Board in furthering the progress of this prestigious medical journal in the scientific community. We are all enriched by the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ .\n\n【29】Udaya B. S. Prakash, MD, Editor-in-Chief 1994–1998\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】“I would like to congratulate you and your colleagues on a most remarkable ability to find and publish articles that are particularly germane to clinical practice.” Thus began a letter addressed to me from a non-Mayo physician-reader of the _Proceedings_ . The letter complained that other mainstream medical journals failed to address adequately pertinent day-to-day “real” medicine and were “not totally, clearly focused on the clinician.” It ended with the following sentence: “Please accept my congratulations on having an uncanny ability to focus on topics that are pertinent, germane, and productive articles that are clinically useful.”\n\n【31】The simple phrase “clinically useful,” stated by the author of the letter, eminently defines the role played by the _Proceedings_ in the continuing medical education of clinicians around the world for the past 75 years. The major aim of a clinical medical journal is to make clinically useful information available to the practicing clinician so that knowledge is applied to provide better medical care to the patient. I believe the _Proceedings_ has effectively met and sustained this goal through the years. This claim is substantiated by the numerous letters I received from non-Mayo readers during my tenure as the Editor of the _Proceedings_ . Almost all letters expressed the views akin to those previously paraphrased. The readers' loyalty to the _Proceedings_ was very encouraging to the Editorial Board. The letters were from internists, general practitioners, medical and surgical specialists, and medical students. I have taken the liberty of editing some of the letters, for the sake of brevity, and have inserted the relevant statements.\n\n【32】“I began receiving the _Proceedings_ when I was a medical student. Over the years, I have enjoyed the articles and reviews contained in the journal. The _Proceedings_ has always been one of the more readable journals.”\n\n【33】“Of all the medical journals I receive, _Proceedings_ is the most comprehensive, the most readable, and most informative. If there was a rating of one to ten, it is a ten plus. It is the best that I receive.”\n\n【34】“I have been reading the _Proceedings_ since my third year in medical school. During these nearly two decades, I have come to appreciate my monthly contact with Mayo Clinic and have on numerous occasions used the _Proceedings_ as not only reference material, but also as a directory for some of the true experts in the field of medicine.”\n\n【35】“The Mayos \\[Drs William J. and Charles H.\\] lectured to us when I was a senior at the University of Michigan Medical School in 1937, and soon after, I began receiving the _Proceedings_ religiously and to date, gratis. These I have kept intact. I am now a general practitioner, as always, and 85 years of age.”\n\n【36】“This is a long overdue fan letter. I am a long-time recipient of the _Proceedings_ . My physician father put me on to the _Proceedings_ , and I have received it for about 50 years. It has always been a must scan, usually read journal. I vividly remember the first publication on the use of cortisone and arthritis, which must have appeared in about 1948. I am only one of thousands of physicians who are deeply indebted to the Mayo Foundation for this publication.”\n\n【37】“I have been a subscriber to the _Proceedings_ for approximately sixty years: In my judgment, it rates with the finest medical journals in the world.”\n\n【38】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【39】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【40】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/75.4.340</u></u>\n\n【41】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【42】无关删除-1:<u>© 2000 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

{"seq_id": "2734add7-557c-45d2-8d2d-499c8c782a0b", "title": "Alfuzosin (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Alfuzosin (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Uroxatral\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Alfuzosin is used to treat the signs and symptoms of benign enlargement of the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH). Benign enlargement of the prostate is a problem that can occur in men as they get older. The prostate gland is located below the bladder. As the prostate gland enlarges, certain muscles in the gland may become tight and get in the way of the tube that drains urine from the bladder. This can cause problems with urinating, such as a need to urinate often, a weak stream when urinating, or a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely.\n\n【6】Alfuzosin helps relax the muscles in the prostate and the opening of the bladder. This may help increase the flow of urine or decrease the symptoms. However, alfuzosin will not shrink the prostate. The prostate may continue to get larger. This may cause the symptoms to become worse over time. Therefore, even though alfuzosin may lessen the problems caused by enlarged prostate now, surgery may still be needed in the future.\n\n【7】This medicine is usually given only to men. It is not normally given to women or children.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet, Extended Release\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Alfuzosin is not indicated for use in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of alfuzosin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults and are likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution in patients receiving alfuzosin.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【31】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【32】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【33】*   Angina (chest pain) or\n*   Heart rhythm problems (eg, congenital or acquired QT prolongation), or history of or\n*   Postural hypotension (low blood pressure)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【34】*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) or\n*   Liver disease, moderate or severe—Should not be used in patients with this condition.\n\n【35】*   Kidney disease, severe or\n*   Liver disease, mild—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【36】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【37】Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.\n\n【38】This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【39】Take this medicine with food and with the same meal every day.\n\n【40】Swallow the extended-release tablet whole. Do not break, crush, or chew it.\n\n【41】### Dosing\n\n【42】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【43】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【44】*   For oral dosage form (extended release tablets):\n    *   For benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH):\n        *   Adults—10 milligrams (mg) once a day.\n        *   Children—Use is not recommended.\n\n【45】### Missed Dose\n\n【46】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【47】### Storage\n\n【48】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【49】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【50】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【51】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【52】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【53】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【54】Do not use this medicine if you are taking ketoconazole (Nizoral®), itraconazole (Sporanox®), or ritonavir (Norvir®).\n\n【55】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur after you use this medicine, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. If you feel dizzy, lie down so you do not faint. Then sit for a few moments before standing to prevent the dizziness from returning.\n\n【56】This medicine may cause some people to become dizzy or less alert than they are normally. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\n【57】Tell your eye doctor (ophthalmologist) that you have used or are using this medicine before cataract surgery or any other eye procedure. This medicine may cause a serious eye problem called Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS).\n\n【58】Call your doctor right away if you experience a prolonged erection. This is an extremely rare side effect, but if it goes untreated, can result in permanent erectile dysfunction (impotence).\n\n【59】Check with your doctor right away if you have arm, back or jaw pain, chest pain or discomfort, chest tightness or heaviness, fast or irregular heartbeat, nausea, or sweating.\n\n【60】Benign prostatic hyperplasia can have the same symptoms as prostate cancer. They may also often occur together. Your doctor may test for the presence of the cancer before you start using this medicine.\n\n【61】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【62】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【63】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.

Zocor\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Simvastatin is used together with a proper diet to treat high cholesterol and triglyceride (fat) levels in the blood. This medicine may help prevent medical problems (eg, heart or blood vessel problems, heart attacks, or strokes) caused by clogged blood vessels. Simvastatin may also be used to prevent certain types of heart problems in patients with risk factors for heart problems.\n\n【6】Simvastatin belongs to the group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins. It works to reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood by blocking an enzyme that is needed to make cholesterol. 1\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Tablet\n*   Suspension\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

{"seq_id": "b17f756a-feeb-46ff-9f23-3c0b7b8bef87", "title": "Hydrocodone And Homatropine (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Hydrocodone And Homatropine (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Hycodan\n2.  Hydromet\n3.  Tussigon\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Hydrocodone and homatropine combination is used to relieve cough in adults and children 6 years of age and older. Hydrocodone is a narcotic antitussive (cough suppressant). It acts directly on the cough center in the brain to relieve cough.\n\n【6】When hydrocodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing cough and nasal congestion should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their cough. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Syrup\n*   Solution\n*   Tablet\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Use of hydrocodone and homatropine combination is not indicated in the pediatric population.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of hydrocodone and homatropine combination have not been performed in the geriatric population, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving hydrocodone and homatropine combination.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【23】*   Nalmefene\n*   Naltrexone\n*   Potassium Citrate\n*   Safinamide\n*   Samidorphan\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it. If your cough does not improve or if it gets worse within 5 days, call your doctor.\n\n【54】Do not use this medicine if you are using or have used an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) such as Eldepryl®, Marplan®, Nardil®, or Parnate® within the past 14 days.\n\n【55】This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that can make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of these medicines while you are using this medicine.\n\n【56】If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once. Symptoms of an overdose include: extreme dizziness or weakness, trouble breathing, slow heartbeat or breathing, seizures, and cold, clammy skin. In case of an overdose, call your doctor right away.\n\n【57】This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.\n\n【58】This medicine may make you dizzy or drowsy. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\n【59】Using narcotics for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.\n\n【60】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve the dizziness or lightheadedness.\n\n【61】Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects, including neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using this medicine.\n\n【62】This medicine may cause adrenal insufficiency. Check with your doctor right away if you have darkening of the skin, diarrhea, dizziness, fainting, loss of appetite, mental depression, nausea, skin rash, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting.\n\n【63】If you are especially sensitive to the effects of this medicine, do not suddenly stop using it without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, such as abdominal or stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, nausea, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble sleeping.\n\n【64】Using too much of this medicine may cause infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children.\n\n【65】Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. This medicine may affect the results of certain medical tests.\n\n【66】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【67】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【68】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【69】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【70】#### More common\n\n【71】1.

We agree that diagnostic studies of tobacco use would augment the evaluation of TAO and could prove particularly helpful in cases such as the one we presented, in which tobacco use was initially denied. In our case, angiography was required for the diagnosis of TAO; when the patient was presented with the angiographic findings while his mother was absent, he admitted to ongoing tobacco use. Urinary tobacco alkaloids might well be of benefit for assessing smoking cessation at subsequent follow-up visits for this patient. Given the strong linkage between tobacco use and TAO, we continue to advocate smoking cessation. Hurt and Hays provide excellent examples of data that further support this approach.\n\n【1】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【3】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/83.10.1188</u></u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>© 2008 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Patients were excluded if they had trigeminal neuralgia without neuropathy or if their diagnostic work-up had been completed elsewhere. Data were analyzed to determine which diagnostic studies were most useful in identifying treatable etiologies.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In total, 439 patients were included. The mean ± SD age was 56.3±13.6 years and 285 (64.9%) were female. Among the 180 cases in which an etiology was identified (41.0%), neoplasms were causative in 76 (42.2%), while specific connective tissue diseases were implicated in 71 (39.4%). Bilateral TNP (n=83) was associated with the presence of underlying connective tissue disease ( _P_ <.01). Identification of etiology was made by magnetic resonance imaging in 88 cases (48.8%), by abnormal connective tissue disease cascades combined with rheumatology consultation in 42 (23.3%), by a previously known connective tissue disorder in 30 (16.7%), and by abnormal connective tissue disease cascades alone in 8 (4.4%). Among the 439 study patients, electromyography was performed in 211 (48.1%) and lumbar puncture in 139 (31.7%), but their diagnostic utility was low.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Underlying causes of nontraumatic, noniatrogenic TNP can be identified in approximately 40% of cases. Bilateral TNP is strongly associated with underlying connective tissue disease. Careful history taking, dedicated magnetic resonance imaging, and connective tissue panels have the greatest diagnostic utility. Electromyography and cerebrospinal fluid analysis are unlikely to elucidate treatable etiologies of TNP.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CCP ( cyclic citrullinated peptide ), CSF ( cerebrospinal fluid ), dsDNA ( double-stranded DNA ), EMG ( electromyography ), ENA ( extractable nuclear antigen ), MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ), PET ( positron emission tomography ), RF ( rheumatoid factor ), TNP ( trigeminal neuropathy )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "5eb193b2-76d3-44c9-8e53-4e11636dd203", "title": "Ventricular tachycardia", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Ventricular tachycardia is a heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia) caused by irregular electrical signals in the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). This condition may also be called V-tach or VT.\n\n【2】A healthy heart typically beats about 60 to 100 times a minute at rest. In ventricular tachycardia, the heart beats faster, usually 100 or more beats a minute.\n\n【3】Sometimes the rapid heartbeat prevents the heart chambers from properly filling with blood. As a result, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body. If this happens, you may feel short of breath or lightheaded, or you may lose consciousness.\n\n【4】Ventricular tachycardia episodes may be brief and last only a couple of seconds without causing harm. But episodes lasting more than a few seconds (sustained V-tach) can be life-threatening. Sometimes ventricular tachycardia can cause the heart to stop (sudden cardiac arrest).\n\n【5】Treatment for ventricular tachycardia may include medication, a shock to the heart (cardioversion), catheter procedures or surgery to slow the fast heart rate and reset the heart rhythm.\n\n【6】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【7】When the heart beats too fast, it may not pump enough blood to the rest of the body. So the organs and tissues may not get enough oxygen. Signs and symptoms that occur during an episode of ventricular tachycardia are due to a lack of oxygen and may include:\n\n【8】*   Chest pain (angina)\n*   Dizziness\n*   Pounding heartbeat (palpitations)\n*   Lightheadedness\n*   Shortness of breath\n\n【9】Ventricular tachycardia may go away on its own within 30 seconds (nonsustained V-tach) or last more than 30 seconds (sustained V-tach or VT). Brief episodes may not cause any symptoms. But sustained VT can cause serious problems, including:\n\n【10】*   Fainting\n*   Loss of consciousness\n*   Cardiac arrest (sudden death)\n\n【11】### When to see a doctor\n\n【12】Many different things can cause ventricular tachycardia. It's important to get a prompt, accurate diagnosis and appropriate care. See your health care provider if you or your child has any problems with the heartbeat. In some cases, urgent or emergency care is needed.\n\n【13】Call 911 or your local emergency number if anyone has these symptoms:\n\n【14】*   Chest pain that lasts more than a few minutes\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Fainting\n\n【15】Causes\n------\n\n【16】Ventricular tachycardia is caused by faulty heart signaling that triggers a fast heart rate in the lower heart chambers (ventricles). The fast heart rate doesn't allow the ventricles to fill and squeeze (contract) to pump enough blood to the body.\n\n【17】Many things can cause or contribute to problems with heart signaling and lead to ventricular tachycardia. These include:\n\n【18】*   Prior heart attack or other heart condition that caused scarring of heart tissue (structural heart disease)\n*   Poor blood flow to the heart muscle due to coronary artery disease\n*   Congenital heart diseases, including long QT syndrome\n*   Imbalance of substances in the blood called electrolytes — such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium\n*   Medication side effects\n*   Use of stimulants such as cocaine or methamphetamine\n\n【19】Sometimes, the exact cause of ventricular tachycardia can't be determined (idiopathic ventricular tachycardia).\n\n【20】### How does the heart beat?\n\n【21】To better understand the cause of ventricular tachycardia, it may be helpful to know how the heart typically works.\n\n【22】The heart is made of four chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).\n\n【23】The heart's rhythm is controlled by a natural pacemaker (the sinus node) in the right upper chamber (atrium). The sinus node sends electrical signals that typically start each heartbeat. These electrical signals move across the atria, causing the heart muscles to squeeze (contract) and pump blood into the ventricles.\n\n【24】Next, the signals arrive at a cluster of cells called the AV node, where they slow down. This slight delay allows the ventricles to fill with blood. When the electrical signals reach the ventricles, the chambers contract and pump blood to the lungs or to the rest of the body.\n\n【25】In a typical heart, this heart signaling process usually goes smoothly, resulting in a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute.\n\n【26】In ventricular tachycardia, faulty electrical signaling in the heart's lower chambers causes the heart rate to increase to 100 or more beats a minute.\n\n【27】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【28】Any condition that puts a strain on the heart or damages heart tissue can increase the risk of ventricular tachycardia. Lifestyle changes or proper medical treatment for the following conditions and events may lower the risk:\n\n【29】*   Heart disease\n*   Medication side effects\n*   Severe electrolyte imbalances\n*   Use of stimulant drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine\n\n【30】A family history of tachycardia or other heart rhythm disorders makes a person more likely to develop ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【31】Complications\n-------------\n\n【32】Complications of ventricular tachycardia depend on:\n\n【33】*   How fast the heart is beating\n*   How long the rapid heart rate lasts\n*   Whether there are other heart conditions\n\n【34】Possible complications of ventricular tachycardia include:\n\n【35】*   Frequent fainting spells or unconsciousness\n*   Heart failure\n*   Sudden death caused by cardiac arrest\n\n【36】### Ventricular fibrillation\n\n【37】A dangerous condition related to ventricular tachycardia is ventricular fibrillation (V-fib). In V-fib, the lower heart chambers contract in a very rapid and uncoordinated manner.\n\n【38】This irregular rhythm happens most often in people with heart disease or a prior heart attack. It may also occur in those with electrolyte imbalances (such as high or low potassium levels).\n\n【39】Ventricular fibrillation may cause sudden cardiac arrest and lead to death if not treated immediately.\n\n【40】Prevention\n----------\n\n【41】The best ways to prevent tachycardia are to maintain a healthy heart and prevent heart disease. If you already have heart disease, monitor it and follow your treatment plan. Be sure you understand your treatment plan, and take all medications as prescribed.\n\n【42】Take the following steps to keep the heart healthy:\n\n【43】*   **Eat a balanced, nutritious diet.** A diet low in saturated and trans fats and rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains helps keep the heart healthy.\n*   **Exercise and maintain a healthy weight.** Being overweight increases the risk of developing heart disease. As a general goal, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise every day.\n*   **Control blood pressure and cholesterol levels.** Make lifestyle changes and take medications as prescribed to manage high blood pressure (hypertension) or high cholesterol.\n*   **Control stress.** Avoid unnecessary stress and learn strategies to manage and reduce stress.\n*   **Don't use illegal drugs.** Don't use stimulants, such as cocaine. If you need help stopping drug use or misuse, talk to your health care provider about an appropriate program for you.\n*   **Go to scheduled health checkups.** Have regular physical exams and report any new signs or symptoms to your health care provider.\n*   **Limit alcohol.** If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. Some people may need to avoid alcohol entirely. Ask your health care provider how much alcohol, if any, is safe for you.\n*   **Limit caffeine.** If you drink caffeinated beverages, do so in moderation (no more than 1 to 2 beverages daily).\n*   **Stop smoking.** If you smoke and can't quit on your own, talk to your health care provider about strategies or programs to help you break a smoking habit.\n*   **Use over-the-counter medications with caution.** Some cold and cough medications contain stimulants that may increase the heart rate. Always tell your health care provider about the medications you take, including those bought without a prescription.\n\n【44】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

This is known as a stem cell transplant, bone marrow transplant or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.\n\n【2】Stem cells used in transplants come from three sources. These sources are the spongy tissue at the center of some bones (bone marrow), the bloodstream (peripheral blood) and umbilical cord blood from newborns. The source that's used depends on the purpose of the transplant.\n\n【3】In the past, surgery to draw bone marrow stem cells from bone marrow was the only way to collect stem cells. Today, however, it's more common to collect stem cells from blood through a vein (peripheral blood stem cell donation).\n\n【4】Umbilical cords produce only a small amount of blood, which might not be enough for an adult. This type of transplant is generally used for children and small adults.\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】Bone marrow transplants are lifesaving treatments for people with diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, other cancers or sickle cell anemia. Donated blood stem cells are needed for these transplants.\n\n【7】You might consider donating blood or bone marrow because someone in your family needs a stem cell transplant and health care providers think you might be a match for that person. Or perhaps you want to help someone else — maybe even someone you don't know — who's waiting for a stem cell transplant.\n\n【8】Pregnant women might consider storing the stem cells that remain in the umbilical cord and placenta after birth for their children's or someone else's future use, if needed.\n\n【9】Risks\n-----\n\n【10】### Bone marrow donation\n\n【11】Bone marrow stem cells are collected from a section of the pelvic bone under general anesthesia. The most serious risk associated with donating bone marrow involves the use and effects of anesthesia during surgery.\n\n【12】The surgery might cause tiredness, weakness, and mild back or hip pain. Pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) might help. You'll likely be able to get back to your routine within a couple of days. But it may take a couple of weeks before you feel fully recovered.\n\n【13】### Peripheral blood stem cell donation\n\n【14】The risks of this type of stem cell donation are minimal. The injection that increases the number of stem cells in the blood can cause side effects, such as bone pain, muscle aches, headache, fatigue, nausea and vomiting.\n\n【15】Other possible side effects include being lightheaded or having chills, numbness or tingling around the mouth, and cramping in the hands. Side effects usually disappear within a couple of days after the injections stop.\n\n【16】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【17】If you want to donate stem cells, talk to your health care provider or contact the National Marrow Donor Program. This is a federally funded nonprofit organization that keeps a database of people willing to donate.\n\n【18】If you decide to donate, you'll learn about the process and possible risks of donating. If you want to continue with the process, a blood or tissue sample can be used to help match you to someone who needs a stem cell transplant. You'll also be asked to sign a consent form, but you can change your mind at any time.\n\n【19】Next comes testing for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. HLAs are proteins found in most cells in your body. This test helps match donors and recipients. A close match increases the chances that the transplant will be a success.\n\n【20】Donors who are matched with someone who needs a blood stem cell transplant are then tested to make sure they don't have genetic or infectious diseases. The testing helps ensure that the donation will be safe for the donor and recipient.\n\n【21】Cells from younger donors have the best chance of success when transplanted. Health care providers prefer donors to be ages 18 to 35. Age 40 is the upper limit for joining the National Marrow Donor Program.\n\n【22】The costs related to collecting stem cells for donation are charged to people needing transplants or their health insurance companies.\n\n【23】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【24】### Bone marrow donation\n\n【25】Collecting stem cells from bone marrow is a type of surgery done in the operating room. Anesthesia is used for the procedure to keep donors from feeling pain. Needles are inserted through the skin and into the back of the pelvic bone to draw the marrow out of the bone. This process usually takes 1 to 2 hours.\n\n【26】After bone marrow collection, donors go to the recovery room, where they are monitored. Occasionally, donors stay overnight.\n\n【27】### Peripheral blood stem cell donation\n\n【28】For donation of blood stem cells, donors receive injections of medication that are given under the skin (subcutaneously). The medication increases the number of blood stem cells in the bloodstream. The medication is usually started several days before donation.\n\n【29】During the donation, blood is usually taken through a tube (catheter) in a vein in an arm. The blood goes through a machine that takes out the stem cells. The blood is then returned to the donor.\n\n【30】This process is called apheresis. It is an outpatient procedure that typically takes up to 4 to 6 hours to complete. Some donors require multiple apheresis sessions, depending on how many blood stem cells are needed.\n\n【31】### After the procedure\n\n【32】Recovery times vary depending on the individual and type of donation. But most donors can return to their usual activities within days to weeks after donation.\n\n【33】Results\n-------\n\n【34】Becoming a donor is a serious commitment. It's difficult to predict the outcome for someone who receives the donation, but it's possible your donation can help save a life.\n\n【35】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Mortality was determined from Mayo Clinic records and the Minnesota Death Index. Multivariate linear regression was used to compare heart rate responses in patients with vs without diabetes. Cox regression was used to determine the effect of abnormal heart rate recovery and abnormal chronotropic index on survival.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 21,396 patients (65.4% men) with a mean ± SD age of 51±11 years, including 1200 patients with diabetes (5.4%), were included. Patients with diabetes had a higher resting heart rate (81±14 vs 77±13 beats/min), lower peak heart rate (154±20 vs 165±19 beats/min), heart rate reserve (73±19 vs 88±19 beats/min), chronotropic index (0.86±0.22 vs 0.99±0.20), and heart rate recovery (15±8 vs 19±9 beats/min) vs patients without diabetes. There were 1362 deaths (6.4%) during a mean ± SD follow-up of 11.9±4.9 years. Adjusting for age, sex, and heart rate–lowering drug use, a chronotropic index less than 0.8 contributed significantly to risk in patients with diabetes (hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 2.21; 95% CI, 1.62-3.00; _P_ <.001) and patients without diabetes (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.71-2.20; _P_ <.001), as did abnormal heart rate recovery (patients with diabetes: HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.60-5.05; _P_ <.001; patients without diabetes: HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.55-1.97).\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】Patients with diabetes exhibit abnormal heart rate responses to exercise, which are independently predictive of reduced long-term survival in patients with diabetes as in patients without diabetes.\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "b094e303-3bf1-4c96-990b-0ba28d70e18b", "title": "Methyldopa (Oral Route, Intravenous Route)", "text": "【0】Methyldopa (Oral Route, Intravenous Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Aldomet\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Methyldopa belongs to the general class of medicines called antihypertensives. It is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).\n\n【6】High blood pressure adds to the work load of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.\n\n【7】Methyldopa works by controlling impulses along certain nerve pathways. As a result, it relaxes blood vessels so that blood passes through them more easily. This helps to lower blood pressure.\n\n【8】Methyldopa is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet\n*   Solution\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Although there is no specific information comparing use of methyldopa in children with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Dizziness or lightheadedness and drowsiness may be more likely to occur in the elderly, who are more sensitive to the effects of methyldopa.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【24】*   Brofaromine\n*   Clorgyline\n*   Furazolidone\n*   Iproniazid\n*   Isocarboxazid\n*   Lazabemide\n*   Linezolid\n*   Moclobemide\n*   Nialamide\n*   Pargyline\n*   Phenelzine\n*   Procarbazine\n*   Rasagiline\n*   Selegiline\n*   Toloxatone\n*   Tranylcypromine\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【26】*   Entacapone\n*   Iobenguane I 131\n*   Pseudoephedrine\n\n【27】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【28】*   Alprenolol\n*   Bisoprolol\n*   Ferric Ammonium Citrate\n*   Haloperidol\n*   Iron\n*   Phenylpropanolamine\n*   Sotalol\n*   Timolol\n\n【29】### Other Interactions\n\n【30】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【31】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【32】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【33】*   Angina (chest pain) or\n*   Parkinson's disease—Methyldopa may make these conditions worse\n\n【34】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Effects of methyldopa may be increased because of slower removal from the body\n\n【35】*   Mental depression (history of)—Methyldopa can cause mental depression\n\n【36】*   Pheochromocytoma—Methyldopa may interfere with tests for the condition; in addition, there have been reports of increased blood pressure\n\n【37】*   If you have taken methyldopa in the past and developed liver problems\n\n【38】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【39】In addition to the use of the medicine your doctor has prescribed, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and care in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium. Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet.\n\n【40】Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal. It is very important that you take your medicine exactly as directed and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well.\n\n【41】Remember that methyldopa will not cure your high blood pressure but it does help control it. Therefore, you must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life . If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, stroke, or kidney disease.\n\n【42】To help you remember to take your medicine, try to get into the habit of taking it at the same time each day.\n\n【43】### Dosing\n\n【44】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【45】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【46】*   For oral dosage form (suspension or tablets):\n    *   For high blood pressure:\n        *   Adults—250 milligrams (mg) to 2 grams a day. This is divided into two to four doses.\n        *   Children—Dose is based on body weight or size and must be determined by your doctor. The usual dose is 10 mg per kilogram (kg) (4.5 mg per pound) of body weight a day. This is divided into two to four doses. Your doctor may increase the dose as needed.\n*   For injection dosage form:\n    *   For high blood pressure:\n        *   Adults—250 to 500 mg mixed in 100 milliliters (mL) of solution (5% dextrose) and slowly injected into a vein every six hours as needed.\n        *   Children—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The usual dose is 20 to 40 mg per kg (9.1 to 18.2 mg per pound) of body weight. This is mixed in a solution (5% dextrose) and slowly injected into a vein every six hours as needed.\n\n【47】### Missed Dose\n\n【48】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【49】### Storage\n\n【50】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【51】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【52】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【53】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【54】It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly.\n\n【55】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes over-the-counter (nonprescription) medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems, since they may tend to increase your blood pressure.\n\n【56】If you have a fever and there seems to be no reason for it, check with your doctor. This is especially important during the first few weeks you take methyldopa, since fever may be a sign of a serious reaction to this medicine.\n\n【57】Before having any kind of surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment, make sure the medical doctor or dentist in charge knows that you are taking this medicine.\n\n【58】Methyldopa may cause some people to become drowsy or less alert than they are normally. This is more likely to happen when you begin to take it or when you increase the amount of medicine you are taking. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert.\n\n【59】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help, but if the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【60】Methyldopa may cause dryness of the mouth. For temporary relief, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your medical doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.\n\n【61】Tell the doctor in charge that you are taking this medicine before you have any medical tests. The results of some tests may be affected by this medicine.\n\n【62】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【63】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【64】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【65】#### Less common\n\n【66】1.  Fever, shortly after starting to take this medicine\n\n【67】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【68】#### More common\n\n【69】1.  Swelling of feet or lower legs\n\n【70】#### Less common\n\n【71】1.  Mental depression or anxiety\n2.  nightmares or unusually vivid dreams\n\n【72】#### Rare\n\n【73】1.  Dark or amber urine\n2.  diarrhea or stomach cramps (severe or continuing)\n3.  fever, chills, troubled breathing, and fast heartbeat\n4.  general feeling of discomfort or illness or weakness\n5.  joint pain\n6.  pale stools\n7.  skin rash or itching\n8.  stomach pain (severe) with nausea and vomiting\n9.  tiredness or weakness after having taken this medicine for several weeks (continuing)\n10.  yellow eyes or skin\n\n【74】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【75】#### More common\n\n【76】1.  Drowsiness\n2.  dryness of mouth\n3.  headache\n\n【77】#### Less common\n\n【78】1.

{"seq_id": "dbd96b72-6704-4238-b31a-ad33acf5a2f5", "title": "Butorphanol (Nasal Route)", "text": "【0】Butorphanol (Nasal Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Stadol NS\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Butorphanol nasal spray is used to relieve pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. It belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). Butorphanol acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.\n\n【6】When butorphanol is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Spray\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of butorphanol nasal spray in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of butorphanol nasal spray in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults, and are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, heart, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving butorphanol nasal spray.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【28】Using this medicine with any of the following is usually not recommended, but may be unavoidable in some cases. If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use this medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】*   Ethanol\n\n【30】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【31】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【32】*   Adrenal problems or\n*   Alcohol abuse, history of or\n*   Brain tumor, history of or\n*   Breathing problems (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \\[COPD\\], cor pulmonale, hypoxia) or\n*   Drug dependence, especially narcotic abuse or dependence, or history of or\n*   Head injuries, history of or\n*   Heart attack, history of or\n*   Heart or blood vessel problems or\n*   Increased pressure in the head or\n*   Seizures, history of or\n*   Weakened physical condition—Use with caution. May increase risk for more serious side effects.\n\n【33】*   Gallbladder disease or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) or\n*   Hypotension (low blood pressure) or\n*   Pancreatitis (inflammation or swelling of the pancreas), acute—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【34】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【35】*   Lung or breathing problems, severe (eg, bronchial asthma, respiratory depression) or\n*   Stomach or bowel blockage (including paralytic ileus), known or suspected—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【36】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【37】Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. This is especially important for elderly patients, who may be more sensitive to the effects of pain medicines. If too much of this medicine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence) or cause an overdose.\n\n【38】It is very important that you understand the rules of the Opioid Analgesic REMS program to prevent addiction, abuse, and misuse of butorphanol. This medicine should also come with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Read it again each time you refill your prescription in case there is new information. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【39】This medicine is for use only in the nose. Do not get any of it into your eyes or on your skin. If it does get on these areas, rinse it off right away.\n\n【40】To use the nasal spray:\n\n【41】*   Blow your nose gently to clear the nostrils.\n*   Take the cap off of the bottle and remove the clip from the neck of the pump.\n*   If you are using the medicine for the first time, you will need to prime the spray pump.\n*   To do this, hold the spray bottle with your thumb on the bottom of the bottle and your index and middle fingers on the 2 flaps on the side of the pump.\n*   Push down with your index and middle fingers. Keep pumping until you see a fine spray from the bottle.\n*   Put the tip of the spray pump into your nostril.\n*   Close the other nostril with your finger and lean your head slightly forward.\n*   Sniff gently and push down on the 2 flaps to spray the medicine into your nose. Keep your mouth closed as you are breathing in.\n*   Take the spray pump out of your nostril and tilt your head back. Sniff a few more times.\n\n【42】After using the nasal spray, wipe the tip of the bottle with a clean tissue and put the cap back on.\n\n【43】### Dosing\n\n【44】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【45】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【46】*   For nasal dosage form (spray):\n    *   For pain:\n        *   Adults—1 milligram (mg) or 1 spray in one nostril. A second spray may be taken 60 to 90 minutes after the first dose if needed. This may be repeated every 3 to 4 hours as needed.\n        *   Children—Use is not recommended.\n\n【47】### Missed Dose\n\n【48】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【49】### Storage\n\n【50】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【51】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【52】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【53】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【54】After you stop using the nasal spray, unscrew the cap, rinse the bottle, and place the parts in a waste container.\n\n【55】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【56】It is very important that your doctor check your progress while you are using this medicine, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of treatment. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to use it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【57】Symptoms of an overdose include: extreme dizziness or weakness, slow heartbeat or breathing, seizures, trouble breathing, and cold, clammy skin. Call your doctor right away if you notice these symptoms.\n\n【58】This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. CNS depressants are medicines that slow down the nervous system, which may cause drowsiness or make you less alert. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or narcotics, barbiturates or seizure medicine, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics. This effect may last for a few days after you stop using this medicine. Check with your doctor before taking any of the other medicines listed above while you are using this medicine.\n\n【59】This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.\n\n【60】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. These symptoms are more likely to occur when you begin using this medicine, or when the dose is increased. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve dizziness or lightheadedness.\n\n【61】This medicine may make you dizzy, drowsy, or lightheaded. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\n【62】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.\n\n【63】Using narcotics for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.\n\n【64】Do not change your dose or suddenly stop using this medicine without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, such as abdominal or stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, nausea, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble with sleeping.\n\n【65】Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect the serotonin levels in your body.\n\n【66】Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects, including neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using this medicine.\n\n【67】Using too much of this medicine may cause infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children.\n\n【68】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【69】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【70】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【71】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【72】#### Less common\n\n【73】1.

{"seq_id": "56390226-ed11-4bc0-9854-e690efe87137", "title": "Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is an uncommon condition in which abnormal cells form in the milk glands (lobules) in the breast. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) isn't cancer. But being diagnosed with LCIS indicates that you have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n【2】LCIS usually doesn't show up on mammograms. The condition is most often discovered as a result of a breast biopsy done for another reason, such as a suspicious breast lump or an abnormal mammogram.\n\n【3】Women with LCIS have an increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer in either breast. If you're diagnosed with LCIS, your doctor may recommend increased breast cancer screening and may ask you to consider medical treatments to reduce your risk of developing invasive breast cancer.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】LCIS doesn't cause signs or symptoms. Rather, your doctor might discover incidentally that you have LCIS — for instance, after a biopsy to assess a breast lump or an abnormal area found on a mammogram.\n\n【6】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【7】Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice a change in your breasts, such as a lump, an area of puckered or otherwise unusual skin, a thickened region under the skin, or nipple discharge.\n\n【8】Ask your doctor when you should consider breast cancer screening and how often it should be repeated. Most groups recommend considering routine breast cancer screening beginning in your 40s. Talk with your doctor about what's right for you.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】It's not clear what causes LCIS. LCIS begins when cells in a milk-producing gland (lobule) of a breast develop genetic mutations that cause the cells to appear abnormal. The abnormal cells remain in the lobule and don't extend into, or invade, nearby breast tissue.\n\n【11】If LCIS is detected in a breast biopsy, it doesn't mean that you have cancer. But having LCIS increases your risk of breast cancer and makes it more likely that you may develop invasive breast cancer.\n\n【12】The risk of breast cancer in women diagnosed with LCIS is thought to be approximately 20 percent. Put another way, for every 100 women diagnosed with LCIS, 20 will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 80 won't be diagnosed with breast cancer. The risk of developing breast cancer for women in general is thought to be 12 percent. Put another way, for every 100 women in the general population, 12 will be diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n【13】Your individual risk of breast cancer is based on many factors. Talk to your doctor to better understand your personal risk of breast cancer.\n\n【14】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "8ee6bd6b-864f-4a76-883a-8d38896d674e", "title": "Low Allergenic Potential With Fondaparinux: Results of a Prospective Investigation", "text": "【0】Low Allergenic Potential With Fondaparinux: Results of a Prospective Investigation\n### OBJECTIVE\n\n【1】To determine the incidence and causes of skin reactions to the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux.\n\n【2】### PATIENTS AND METHODS\n\n【3】Patients who received prophylactic/therapeutic subcutaneous fondaparinux treatment for more than 7 days were prospectively examined for cutaneous adverse effects between September 1, 2008, and April 30, 2009. When indicated, other procedures, such as skin biopsy, allergy testing, and clinical/laboratory assessment for thrombosis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, were performed.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Overall, 231 patients were enrolled. No patient developed typical delayed type IV hypersensitivity (DTH) erythematous skin lesions. However, one female patient experienced abdominal pruritus at sites of injection. Histology revealed a mild lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, confirming a DTH reaction. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, as another possible underlying pathomechanism for cutaneous lesions, was ruled out clinically and serologically. Hence, the overall incidence of fondaparinux-induced allergic skin lesions was 0.4% (95% confidence interval, 0.01%-2.4%). No cross-allergies were observed in patients with DTH reaction to heparins.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Fondaparinux has a low allergenic potential. The incidence of allergic cutaneous DTH reactions is almost 20 times lower compared to that with commonly used heparins. These results, together with the known low prevalence of secondary thrombotic events or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia during fondaparinux therapy, suggest that in selected patients fondaparinux might substantially improve patient care, therapeutic safety, and cost-effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy.\n\n【8】Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00510432\n\n【9】BMI ( body mass index ), DTH ( delayed type IV hypersensitivity ), DVT ( deep venous thrombosis ), HIT ( heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ), LMWH ( low-molecular-weight heparin ), PE ( pulmonary embolism ), UFH ( unfractionated heparin )\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "1f3a5431-ac1b-4ccb-a684-cd7ba8721b80", "title": "Bilirubin test", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】A bilirubin test measures the levels of bilirubin in your blood. Bilirubin (bil-ih-ROO-bin) is a yellowish pigment that is made during the breakdown of red blood cells. Bilirubin passes through the liver and is eventually excreted out of the body.\n\n【2】Higher than usual levels of bilirubin may indicate different types of liver or bile duct problems. Sometimes, higher bilirubin levels may be caused by an increased rate of destruction of red blood cells.\n\n【3】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【4】Bilirubin testing is usually one of a group of tests to check the health of your liver. Bilirubin testing may be done to:\n\n【5】*   Investigate jaundice — a yellowing of the skin and eyes caused by high levels of bilirubin. This test is commonly used to measure bilirubin levels in newborns with infant jaundice.\n*   Determine whether there might be blockage in your bile ducts, in either the liver or the gallbladder.\n*   Help detect liver disease, particularly hepatitis, or monitor its progression.\n*   Help evaluate anemia caused by the destruction of red blood cells.\n*   Help follow how a treatment is working.\n*   Help evaluate a suspected drug toxicity.\n\n【6】Some common tests that might be done at the same time as bilirubin testing include:\n\n【7】*   **Liver function tests.** Blood tests that measure certain enzymes or proteins in your blood.\n*   **Albumin and total protein.** Levels of albumin — a protein made by the liver — and total protein show how well your liver is making certain proteins. These proteins are necessary for your body to fight infections and perform other functions.\n*   **Complete blood count.** This test measures several components and features of your blood.\n*   **Prothrombin time.** This test measures the clotting time of plasma.\n\n【8】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【9】Bilirubin testing is done using a blood sample. Usually, the blood is drawn through a small needle inserted into a vein in the bend of your arm. A small tube is attached to the needle to collect the blood.\n\n【10】You may feel a quick pain as the needle is inserted into your arm. You also may experience some short-term discomfort at the site after the needle is removed. Blood for bilirubin testing in newborns is usually collected using a sharp lancet to break the skin of the heel. This is known as a heel stick. There may be slight bruising at the puncture site afterward.\n\n【11】Your blood will be sent to a laboratory for analysis. You can usually return to normal activities immediately.\n\n【12】Results\n-------\n\n【13】Bilirubin test results are expressed as direct, indirect or total bilirubin. Total bilirubin is a combination of direct and indirect bilirubin. Typically, you'll get results for direct and total bilirubin.\n\n【14】Typical results for a total bilirubin test are 1.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) for adults and usually 1 mg/dL for those under 18. Typical results for direct bilirubin are generally 0.3 mg/dL.\n\n【15】These results may vary slightly from laboratory to laboratory. Results may be slightly different for women and children. Results also may be affected by certain foods, medicines or demanding exercise. For this reason, be sure to tell your health care provider about your activity levels, as well as any foods or medicines you've taken.\n\n【16】Lower than usual bilirubin levels are usually not a concern. Higher levels of direct bilirubin in your blood may indicate your liver isn't clearing bilirubin properly. This may indicate liver damage or disease. Higher levels of indirect bilirubin may be a sign of other problems.\n\n【17】One common, and harmless, cause of elevated bilirubin is Gilbert's syndrome, a deficiency in an enzyme that helps break down bilirubin. Your health care provider may order more tests to investigate your condition. Bilirubin test results also may be used to monitor certain conditions, such as jaundice.\n\n【18】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "c6d5e93f-bac1-4d5b-bd2d-bc211c741b90", "title": "Olmesartan (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Olmesartan (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Benicar\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Olmesartan is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.\n\n【6】Olmesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. As a result, olmesartan relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Tablet\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of olmesartan in children. However, this medicine has not been shown to be effective in children younger than 6 years of age. Use of olmesartan is not recommended in children younger than 1 year of age.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of olmesartan in the elderly.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【23】*   Aliskiren\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【25】*   Lithium\n*   Trimethoprim\n\n【26】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【27】*   Colesevelam\n\n【28】### Other Interactions\n\n【29】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【30】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【31】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【32】*   Congestive heart failure, severe—Use may lead to kidney problems.\n\n【33】*   Dehydration or\n*   Diabetes or\n*   Electrolyte imbalance (eg, high or low potassium or sodium in the blood) or\n*   Kidney disease—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【34】*   Diabetes patients who are also using aliskiren (Tekturna®) or\n*   Patients with kidney problems who are taking aliskiren (Tekturna®)—Should not be used in these patients.\n\n【35】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【36】In addition to taking this medicine, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and a change in the foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium (salt). Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet.\n\n【37】Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal. It is very important that you take your medicine exactly as directed and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well.\n\n【38】Remember that this medicine will not cure your high blood pressure, but it does help control it. You must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. You might have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life. If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, stroke, or kidney disease.\n\n【39】This medicine may be taken with or without food.\n\n【40】If your child cannot swallow the tablets, your doctor may give him/her an oral liquid that is to be prepared by a pharmacist.\n\n【41】To use the oral liquid:\n\n【42】*   Shake the oral liquid well before each use.\n*   Measure the medicine with a marked measuring spoon, oral syringe, or medicine cup. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.\n*   Store the oral liquid in the refrigerator for up to 4 weeks. Throw away any unused medicine after 4 weeks.\n\n【43】If you are also using colesevelam (Welchol®), take it at least 4 hours after taking Benicar®.\n\n【44】### Dosing\n\n【45】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【46】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【47】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   For high blood pressure:\n        *   Adults—At first, 20 milligrams (mg) once a day. Your doctor may increase your dose as needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 40 mg once a day.\n        *   Children 6 to 16 years of age weighing 35 kilograms (kg) or more—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The dose is usually 20 to 40 mg once a day. If the child cannot swallow the tablets, an oral suspension is recommended.\n        *   Children 6 to 16 years of age weighing at least 20 kg and less than 35 kg—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The dose is usually 10 to 20 mg once a day. If the child cannot swallow the tablets, an oral suspension is recommended.\n        *   Children 1 to 5 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n        *   Children younger than 1 year of age—Use is not recommended.\n\n【48】### Missed Dose\n\n【49】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule.

{"seq_id": "6376a3ea-4636-42d2-a46a-0b34634638df", "title": "LASIK eye surgery", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】LASIK eye surgery is the best known and most commonly performed laser refractive surgery to correct vision problems. Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) can be an alternative to glasses or contact lenses.\n\n【2】During LASIK surgery, a special type of cutting laser is used to change the shape of the cornea. The cornea is the dome-shaped clear tissue at the front of the eye.\n\n【3】In eyes with typical vision, the cornea bends — or refracts — light precisely onto the retina at the back of the eye. But with nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism, the light is bent incorrectly. This incorrect refraction causes blurred vision.\n\n【4】Glasses or contact lenses can correct vision, but reshaping the cornea also provides the refraction needed to correct vision.\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】LASIK surgery may be an option for the correction of these vision problems:\n\n【7】*   **Nearsightedness, also called myopia.** In nearsightedness, your eyeball is slightly longer than typical or the cornea curves too sharply. This causes light rays to focus in front of the retina, which makes distant vision blurry. Objects that are close can be seen fairly clearly. But objects in the distance will be blurry.\n*   **Farsightedness, also called hyperopia.** In farsightedness, you have a shorter than average eyeball or a cornea that is too flat. This causes light to focus behind the retina instead of on it. This makes near vision, and sometimes distant vision, blurry.\n*   **Astigmatism.** In astigmatism, the cornea curves or flattens unevenly. This affects focus of near and distant vision.\n\n【8】If you're considering LASIK surgery, you probably already wear glasses or contact lenses. Your eye doctor will talk with you about whether LASIK surgery or another similar refractive procedure is an option that will work for you.\n\n【9】Risks\n-----\n\n【10】Complications that result in a loss of vision are very rare. But certain side effects of LASIK eye surgery are common. These include dry eyes and temporary visual problems such as glare. These symptoms usually clear up after a few weeks or months. Few people consider them to be a long-term problem.\n\n【11】Risks of LASIK surgery include:\n\n【12】*   **Dry eyes.** LASIK surgery causes a temporary decrease in tear production. For the first six months or so after your surgery, your eyes may feel unusually dry as they heal. Dry eyes can reduce the quality of your vision.\n\n【13】    Your eye doctor might recommend eye drops for dry eyes. If you experience severe dry eyes, your eye doctor may recommend additional management, including tear drain plugs or medicated eye drops.\n\n【14】*   **Glare, halos and double vision.** You may have a hard time seeing at night after surgery. This usually lasts a few days to a few weeks. You might notice increased light sensitivity, glare, halos around bright lights or double vision.\n\n【15】    Even when a good visual result is measured under standard testing conditions, your vision in dim light (such as at dusk or in fog) may be reduced to a greater degree after the surgery than before the surgery.\n\n【16】*   **Undercorrections.** If the laser removes too little tissue from your eye, you won't get the clearer vision results you were hoping for. Undercorrections are more common for people who are nearsighted. You may need another LASIK procedure within a year to remove more tissue.\n*   **Overcorrections.** It's also possible that the laser will remove too much tissue from your eye. Overcorrections may be more difficult to fix than undercorrections.\n*   **Astigmatism.** Astigmatism can be caused by uneven tissue removal. It may require another surgery, glasses or contact lenses.\n*   **Flap problems.** Folding back or removing the flap from the front of your eye during surgery can cause complications, including infection and excess tears. The outermost corneal tissue layer may grow abnormally underneath the flap during the healing process.\n*   **Corneal ectasia.** Corneal ectasia, a condition in which the cornea is too thin and weak, is one of the more-serious complications. The abnormal cornea tissue is unable to maintain its shape, which can lead to cornea bulging and worsening vision.\n*   **Regression.** Regression is when your vision slowly changes back toward your original prescription. This is a less common complication.\n*   **Vision loss or changes.** Rarely, surgical complications can result in loss of vision. Some people also may not see as sharply or clearly as previously.\n\n【17】### Conditions that increase risks\n\n【18】Certain health conditions can increase the risks associated with LASIK surgery or make the outcome less predictable.\n\n【19】Doctors may not recommend laser refractive surgery for you if you have certain conditions, including:\n\n【20】*   Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis.\n*   A weakened immune system caused by immunosuppressive medications or HIV.\n*   Constantly dry eyes.\n*   Recent changes in vision due to medicines, hormonal changes, pregnancy, breastfeeding or age.\n*   Inflammation of the cornea, lid disorders, eye injuries or eye diseases, such as uveitis, herpes simplex affecting the eye area, glaucoma or cataracts.\n*   Disorders of the cornea, including keratoconus or corneal ectasia.\n\n【21】LASIK surgery is usually not recommended if you:\n\n【22】*   Have an eye disease that causes the cornea to thin and bulge, such as keratoconus.\n*   Have a family history of keratoconus or other corneal ectasia.\n*   Have good overall vision.\n*   Have severe nearsightedness.\n*   Have very large pupils or thin corneas.\n*   Have age-related eye changes that cause vision to be less clear.\n*   Participate in contact sports that may be associated with blows to the face.\n\n【23】If you're considering LASIK surgery, talk to your doctor about your questions and concerns. Your doctor will discuss whether you're a candidate for the procedure or other similar procedures.\n\n【24】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【25】Steps you can take to prepare for surgery include:\n\n【26】*   **Know what surgery may cost you.** LASIK surgery is usually considered elective surgery, so most insurance companies won't cover the cost of the surgery. Be prepared to pay out-of-pocket for your expenses.\n*   **Arrange for a ride home.** You'll need to have someone drive you to and from your place of surgery. Immediately after surgery, you might still feel the effects of medicine given to you before surgery, and your vision may be blurry.\n*   **Skip the eye makeup.** Don't use eye makeup, cream, perfumes or lotions on the day before and the day of your surgery. Your doctor may also tell you to clean your eyelashes daily or more often in the days leading up to surgery. This helps remove debris and lessens your risk of infection.\n\n【27】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【28】### Before the procedure\n\n【29】Long-term results from LASIK tend to be best in people who are carefully checked before surgery to see if they are good candidates for the procedure.\n\n【30】If you wear contact lenses, you'll need to stop wearing them and wear only your glasses for at least a few weeks before your evaluation and surgery. This is because contact lenses can change the shape of your cornea. Your eye doctor will provide specific guidelines depending on the type of contacts you wear and how long you've been a contact lens wearer.\n\n【31】During the evaluation, your eye doctor will ask about your medical and surgical history and give you a complete eye examination to check your vision and decide whether you can undergo the procedure safely.\n\n【32】Your eye doctor will look for signs of:\n\n【33】*   Eye infection.\n*   Inflammation.\n*   Dry eyes.\n*   Large pupils.\n*   High eye pressure.\n\n【34】Your eye doctor will also measure your cornea, noting the shape, contour, thickness and any irregularities. Your eye doctor will check which areas of your cornea need reshaping and determine the exact amount of tissue to remove from your cornea.\n\n【35】Doctors generally use wavefront-guided technology to check your eye in detail before LASIK surgery. In this test, a scanner creates a highly detailed chart, similar to a topographic map, of your eye. The more detailed the measurements, the more accurate your eye doctor can be in removing corneal tissue.\n\n【36】Before surgery, your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits of LASIK surgery, what to expect before and after surgery, and any questions you may have.\n\n【37】### During the procedure\n\n【38】LASIK surgery is usually completed in 30 minutes or less. During the procedure, you lie on your back in a reclining chair. You may be given medicine to help you relax. After numbing drops are placed in your eye, your doctor uses an instrument to hold your eyelids open.\n\n【39】A suction ring is placed on your eye just before cutting the corneal flap. This may cause a feeling of pressure, and your vision may dim a little.\n\n【40】Your eye surgeon uses a small blade or cutting laser to cut a small hinged flap away from the front of your eye. Folding back the flap allows your doctor to reach the part of your cornea to be reshaped.\n\n【41】Using a programmed laser, your eye surgeon reshapes parts of your cornea. With each pulse of the laser beam, a tiny amount of corneal tissue is removed. After reshaping the cornea, the surgeon lays the flap back into place. The flap usually heals without stitches.\n\n【42】During the surgery, you'll be asked to focus on a point of light. Staring at this light helps you keep your eye fixed while the laser reshapes your cornea. You may notice a distinct odor as the laser removes your corneal tissue. Some people describe smelling an odor similar to that of burning hair.\n\n【43】If you need LASIK surgery in both eyes, doctors will generally do the procedure on the same day.\n\n【44】### After the procedure\n\n【45】Immediately after surgery, your eye might itch, feel gritty, burn and be watery. You'll probably have blurred vision. You generally will experience little pain, and you'll usually recover your vision quickly.\n\n【46】You might be given pain medicine or eye drops to keep you comfortable for several hours after the procedure. Your eye doctor might also ask you to wear a shield over your eye at night until your eye heals.\n\n【47】You'll be able to see after surgery, but your vision won't be clear right away. While vision after LASIK is generally good within a few days, it can be up to 2 to 3 months after your surgery before your eye heals completely and your vision stabilizes. Your chances for improved vision are based, in part, on how good your vision was before surgery.\n\n【48】You'll have a follow-up appointment with your eye doctor 1 to 2 days after surgery. This is to see how your eye is healing and check for any complications. Plan for other follow-up appointments during the first six months after surgery as your doctor recommends.\n\n【49】It might be a few weeks before you can start to use cosmetics around your eyes again. You also might have to wait several weeks before resuming strenuous contact sports, swimming or using hot tubs.\n\n【50】Follow your doctor's recommendations about how soon you can resume your usual activities.\n\n【51】Results\n-------\n\n【52】LASIK often offers improved vision without the hassle of glasses or contact lenses. In general, you have a very good chance of achieving 20/40 vision or better after refractive surgery.\n\n【53】More than 8 out of 10 people who've undergone LASIK refractive surgery no longer need to use their glasses or contact lenses for most of their activities.\n\n【54】Your results depend on your specific refractive error and other factors. People with a low grade of nearsightedness tend to have the most success with refractive surgery. People with a high degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness along with astigmatism have less predictable results.\n\n【55】In some cases, the surgery might result in undercorrection. If this happens, you might need another surgery to achieve the proper correction.\n\n【56】Rarely, some people's eyes slowly return to the level of vision they had before surgery. This might happen due to certain conditions, such as problems with wound healing, hormonal imbalances or pregnancy. Sometimes this change in vision is due to another eye problem, such as a cataract. Talk with your doctor about any vision changes.\n\n【57】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects. You may also need to have your eyes tested on a regular basis.\n\n【57】This medicine may add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are using quetiapine.\n\n【58】For some patients, this medicine can increase thoughts of suicide. Tell your doctor right away if you start to feel more depressed and have thoughts about hurting yourself. Report any unusual thoughts or behaviors that trouble you, especially if they are new or are getting worse quickly. Make sure the doctor knows if you have trouble sleeping, get upset easily, have a big increase in energy, or start to act reckless. Also tell the doctor if you have sudden or strong feelings, such as feeling nervous, angry, restless, violent, or scared. Let the doctor know if you or anyone in your family has bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness) or has tried to commit suicide.\n\n【59】Quetiapine may cause drowsiness, trouble with thinking, trouble with controlling body movements, or trouble with your vision (especially during the first week of use), which may lead to falls, fractures, or other injuries. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\n【60】This medicine may increase the amount of sugar in your blood. Check with your doctor right away if you have increased thirst or urination. If you have diabetes, the results of your urine or blood sugar tests may change. Check your blood sugar closely and talk with your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【61】Check with your doctor right away if you have convulsions (seizures), difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, high fever, high or low blood pressure, increased sweating, loss of bladder control, severe muscle stiffness, unusually pale skin, or tiredness. These could be symptoms of a serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\n\n【62】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. If the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【63】Quetiapine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【64】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【65】This medicine may cause tardive dyskinesia (a movement disorder). Check with your doctor right away if you have lip smacking or puckering, puffing of the cheeks, rapid or worm-like movements of the tongue, uncontrolled chewing movements, or uncontrolled movements of the arms and legs.\n\n【66】Quetiapine may increase your cholesterol and fats in the blood. If this condition occurs, your doctor may give you medicine to lower the cholesterol and fats in the blood.\n\n【67】This medicine may increase your weight. Your doctor may need to check your weight on a regular basis while you are using this medicine.\n\n【68】You will need to have your blood pressure measured before starting this medicine and while you are using it. If you notice any changes to your recommended blood pressure, call your doctor right away. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.\n\n【69】This medicine can cause changes in your heart rhythm, such as a condition called QT prolongation. It may change the way your heart beats and cause fainting or serious side effects. Contact your doctor right away if you have symptoms of heart rhythm problems, such as a fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat.\n\n【70】Quetiapine may make it more difficult for your body to cool down. It might reduce how much you sweat. Your body could get too hot if you do not sweat enough. If your body gets too hot, you might feel dizzy, weak, tired, or confused. You might vomit or have an upset stomach. Do not get too hot while you are exercising. Avoid places that are very hot. Call your doctor if you are too hot and can not cool down.\n\n【71】Do not suddenly stop taking this medicine without checking first with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This will decrease the chance of having withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, insomnia, dizziness, irritability, or headache.\n\n【72】Before you have any medical tests, tell the medical doctor in charge that you are taking this medicine.

Patients were followed for a mean of 1.0±1.2 years (range, 0-9.3 years). We included 87,902 propensity score–matched patients (43,951 patients per cohort) initiating generic or brand L-T4. Variables included in matching were age, sex, race/ethnicity, residence region, selected comorbidities, and Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score. Patients with previous use of any thyroid preparation, amiodarone, or lithium were excluded. Primary outcomes were the event rates for hospitalizations for incident atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or stroke.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In the generic L-T4 cohort, 35,242 (80.2%) were women and 7327 (16.7%) were 65 years of age or older; in the brand L-T4 cohort, 34,633 (78.8%) were women and 8092 (18.4%) were 65 years of age or older. We found no differences in event rates (events per 1000 person-years) for 4 outcomes comparing generic and brand L-T4 therapy: (1) atrial fibrillation (1.82 vs 2.19; hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 1.22; 95% CI, 0.90-1.65; _P_ \\=.19); (2) myocardial infarction (2.12 vs 1.83; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.64-1.17; _P_ \\=.35); (3) congestive heart failure (2.27 vs 2.00; HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.66-1.18; _P_ \\=.41); and (4) stroke (3.10 vs 2.38; HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59-1.00; _P_ \\=.05). Stratification by age group revealed no differences.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In patients with newly treated hypothyroidism, cardiovascular event rates were similar for generic and brand L-T4.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】HR ( hazard ratio ), ICD-9 ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ), L-T3 ( liothyronine ), L-T4 ( levothyroxine ), TSH ( thyrotropin )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

We then mailed a structured questionnaire to the survey respondents and achieved a response rate of 732 individuals. Percentages of individuals and predictors of those who meet recommendations for intake of fruits and vegetables and for dietary fats were determined by using χ  tests of general association and multivariate logistic regression.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Only 16% of the population of Olmsted County reported meeting standard dietary recommendations for consuming both 5 or more servings of fruits and/or vegetables per day and no more than 30% of calories from fat. Fifty-one percent of the population was meeting neither recommendation. Women were more likely than men to report meeting both goals (22% vs 8%, _P_ <.001), but still more women were meeting neither goal than were meeting both goals (40% vs 22%, _P_ <.001). Multivariate logistic regression revealed the following factors to predict adherence to both goals: female sex, lower body mass index, nonsmoker, history of high cholesterol, and daily physical activity.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】Few individuals in Olmsted County are meeting national recommendations for intake of fruits, vegetables, and dietary fat. More effective interventions are needed to improve dietary habits in all subgroups of this community.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "5baac864-bc0d-46b5-94df-b8fbebef486d", "title": "Dapagliflozin (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Dapagliflozin (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Farxiga\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Dapagliflozin is used together with proper diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. It works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. Dapagliflozin does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.\n\n【6】Dapagliflozin is also used to lower the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular (heart or blood vessel) disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. This medicine is also used to lower the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization, and urgent heart failure visit in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (the heart is weak and cannot pump enough blood to the rest of the body).\n\n【7】Dapagliflozin is also used to lower the risk of worsening of kidney disease, end stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of dapagliflozin in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dapagliflozin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, low blood pressure), which may require caution in patients receiving dapagliflozin.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【54】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur with this medicine. This is more common if you have kidney disease, low blood pressure, or if you are taking a diuretic (water pill). Taking plenty of fluids each day may help. Drink plenty of water during exercise or in hot weather. Check with your doctor if you have severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that does not stop. This may cause you to lose too much water.\n\n【55】Ketoacidosis (high ketones and acid in the blood) may occur while you are using this medicine. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Your doctor may give you insulin, fluid, and carbohydrate replacement to treat this condition. Tell your doctor right away if you have nausea, vomiting, trouble breathing, increased thirst or urination, or stomach pain.\n\n【56】Tell your doctor if you have bloody urine, decrease in how much or how often you urinate, painful or difficult urination, lower back or side pain, fever, chills, rapid weight gain, or swelling of the face, finger, or lower legs. These may be symptoms of a serious kidney problem.\n\n【57】This medicine may increase risk of having urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis or urosepsis. Check with your doctor right away if you have bladder pain, bloody or cloudy urine, difficult, burning, or painful urination, or lower back or side pain.\n\n【58】This medicine may cause vaginal yeast infections in women and yeast infections of the penis in men. This is more common in patients who have a history of genital yeast infections or in men who are not circumcised. Women may have a vaginal discharge, itching, or odor. Men may have redness, itching, swelling, or pain around the penis, or a discharge with a strong odor from the penis. Check with your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms.\n\n【59】This medicine may cause a rare but serious bacterial infection, called necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier's gangrene, which can cause damage to the tissue under the skin in the area between and around the anus and genitals (perineum). Fournier's gangrene may lead to hospitalization, multiple surgeries, or death. Check with your doctor right away if you have fever, unusual tiredness or weakness, or pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling of the area between and around your anus and genitals.\n\n【60】This medicine may cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This is more common when this medicine is taken together with other diabetes medicines (eg, insulin, glipizide, or glyburide). The symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they cause you to pass out. People feel different symptoms with low blood sugar. It is important that you learn which symptoms you usually have so you can treat it quickly. Some symptoms of low blood sugar include: behavior changes that are similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, cool, pale skin, difficulty with thinking, drowsiness, excessive hunger, fast heartbeat, headaches that continue, nausea, shakiness, slurred speech, or unusual tiredness or weakness. Talk to your doctor about how to treat low blood sugar.\n\n【61】Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your diabetes medicine, overeat or do not follow your diet plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual. Some symptoms of high blood sugar include: blurred vision, drowsiness, dry mouth, flushed and dry skin, a fruit-like breath odor, increased frequency and amount of urination, ketones in the urine, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, rapid and deep breathing, tiredness, or unusual thirst. If symptoms of high blood sugar occur, check your blood sugar level and call your doctor for instructions.\n\n【62】Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. This medicine may affect the results of certain medical tests (eg, urine glucose tests may not be accurate). Also, you may need to stop taking this medicine at least 3 days before you have a surgery.\n\n【63】Make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking dapagliflozin, your doctor may switch you to another medicine to control your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar if you plan to become pregnant or while you are pregnant.\n\n【64】Do not use this medicine if you are also using or have recently received medicine that weakens your immune system to treat kidney disease.\n\n【65】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【66】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【67】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【68】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【69】#### More common\n\n【70】1.

It is important to make the distinction between both synchronous and asynchronous telehealth activities; the former occurring in real time.\n\n【92】In response to the pandemic and national emergency declaration, the federal government has eased restrictions on what were once significant administrative, regulatory, and legislative barriers to telehealth deployment: state licensure, hospital privileging and credentialing, range of providers, types of services and originating sites, government and commercial health insurance reimbursement, parity with regular in-person visits, and allowable digital technologies. This has opened a time-sensitive opportunity for novel, digital approaches to acute emergency and intensive patient care that should reduce health care risk by mitigating exposure and save highly valuable PPE. Further, the accelerated adoption of existing digital tools by health consumers, payers, and providers, coupled with analytics, will help drive future health care strategic planning.\n\n【93】Mayo Clinic contracts with InTouch Health for both software and hardware solutions for synchronous acute care telehealth programs. However, there are a myriad of hardware and software solutions that exist that could be set up in a relatively short time frame in health care organizations that currently do not use telehealth (ie, Zoom, San Jose, CA).\n\n【94】The future of telehealth and health care will be debated following this crisis. We predict a profound change to current state health care operations. Our purpose is to outline current Mayo Clinic strategies harnessing telehealth solutions for COVID-19 emergency preparedness and acute emergency care.\n\n【95】Emergency Medicine Telehealth (Synchronous /Asynchronous)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【96】The Mayo Clinic Emergency Medicine Telehealth (TeleEM) program is an ongoing network serving rural emergency departments across our large Midwest practice, using both synchronous video and telephonic tools for complex or critically ill patients. However, given the current crisis, the Department of Emergency Medicine has expanded this role internally by adopting telehealth to support its own academic campus.\n\n【97】What makes Mayo Clinic unique is our large integrated multispecialty practice and our multidisciplinary approach to patient care. Telehealth can amplify that work via the InTouch Health software platform via a feature called “multi-presence” allowing for multiple participants to engage a patient simultaneously 删除4:<u>( Figure )</u>. After a primary synchronous video connection is established, other teams can join the video session as “guests” allowing for the multidisciplinary team approach to complex, high-acuity critical care. Currently, the TeleEM team can bring in cardiology, critical care, neurologic critical care, pediatric intensive care, TeleStroke, TeleNeonatology, TeleObstetrics, as well as EM TelePharmacy.\n\n【98】Figure Telehealth can amplify that work via the InTouch Health software platform via a feature called “multi-presence,” allowing for multiple participants to engage a patient simultaneously.\n\n【99】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【100】Primary benefits to using telehealth internally and mission aims are to conserve PPE and reduce the HCW exposure when safely possible. Telehealth opens the door to new models of acute emergency care. Multiple workflows were identified as amendable to augmentation with telehealth technology.\n\n【101】First, a variation in the provider-in-triage model: hemodynamically stable patients arriving to the emergency department (ED) suspect for COVID-19 without respiratory distress and mild symptoms do not require a full ED exam room. It is unlikely they require hospitalization but may require COVID-19 testing and may be seen by a TeleEM physician via video. Following an appropriate synchronous video exam during nurse triage and testing if necessary, patients may be discharged from an intake or triage area. This will keep open critical ED rooms for the more acutely ill patients arriving.\n\n【102】A significant risk to the health care team comes from our desire to check on patients; in our ED, we deployed Microsoft Surface Pro devices to reside in our patient care rooms. Attending physicians and other members of the provider care team, nursing, and consulting services, as well as ancillary teams such as registration and social work are able to have access into each room remotely and see patients virtually. Consider how often HCWs re-enter rooms to re-examine or communicate with patients; without a telehealth mechanism, this approach would consume massive and unsustainable amounts of PPE. Starting mid-March through May, we observed 3508 uses with a median time of 1.5 minutes. We suspect the majority of uses are for patient reassessments for pain or therapeutics. However, it can be argued that this is 3508 PPE saved or potentially 3508 less HCW exposures for patients with COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n【103】For more high-risk situations, devices were deployed to our resuscitation and negative airflow rooms to facilitate lean teams and observe for PPE breaches. These are rooms where high-risk procedures (such as intubation) and aerosol generating activities (such as nebulizers) occur. Through these devices, we are able to locate our recording nurse outside the care room and facilitate more clear communication between the team in the room and the supply runners to ensure expeditious care of these oftentimes critically ill patients.\n\n【104】In addition, the Mayo Clinic Center for Connected Care is liberally deploying Microsoft Surface Pro devices across the rural Mayo Clinic Health System EDs, allowing for any quarantined, well ED physicians to see low acuity patients and off load clinical surge.\n\n【105】Deployment of telehealth internally on the academic campus ED creates new conceptual use that will drive the conversation on future care delivery. The future of telehealth and health care will be debated following this crisis. We predict a profound change to the current state of health care operations.\n\n【106】Prehospital Emergency Care and Emergency Medical Services\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【107】Emergency medical services (EMS) are also at the forefront of this pandemic. Urgent efforts are underway to modify guidelines and protocols for EMS teams to care for COVID-19 known or suspected patients while simultaneously protecting teams and conserving PPE resources. Mayo Clinic Ambulance has been developing and testing a community paramedic program in partnership with the TeleEM program and recently completed a feasibility study on field telehealth. The feasibility and early clinical results were promising. Now, building on that work our EMS system spanning Minnesota and Western Wisconsin is well positioned to be the community pandemic response supported by the TeleEM team.\n\n【108】Mayo Clinic Ambulance is actively deploying telehealth solutions to all of the ambulance teams across the network. Using a Toughbook (Panasonic, Inc.) and the InTouch Health software, teams will be able to audio-video link to on-duty TeleEM or EMS physicians in out-of-hospital locales for guidance and triage.\n\n【109】Paramedic crews will face unique challenges in the coming weeks and months. Non-pandemic, normal operations are typically transporting patients for evaluation in an ED. However, during a pandemic with surge, with limited PPE and resources in short supply, EMS teams will conceivably need to make challenging decisions during field resuscitations and whether patients should be transported for care. TeleEM and EMS physicians can support decision making using synchronous advice to frontline paramedic teams delivering care.\n\n【110】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【111】Whether in symptomatic patients’ homes for remote monitoring, ambulances in the field for transport, tents outside health care facilities for screening and testing, EDs for diagnosis and treatment, or in the hands of all acute care providers for consultation, telehealth tools are being deployed across the continuum of EMS and emergency medicine to help limit disease spread, reduce HCW exposure, and conserve valuable PPE.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Two weeks before the onset of these symptoms, the patient had undergone a dental procedure with placement of a temporary crown. He subsequently experienced pain and gingival swelling, and a 5-day course of clindamycin was prescribed. One week after antibiotic completion, he had acute onset of diarrhea, fevers, and back pain. The back pain began in the thoracic area and spread to the lower back and hips. He described it as a constant, severe sharp pain exacerbated by movement and affecting ambulation. He reported no radicular element, paresthesia, or bladder or bowel disturbance. His primary care physician diagnosed _Clostridium difficile_ colitis following positive results on stool polymerase chain reaction testing, and oral metronidazole was prescribed. Although his diarrhea began to improve, he continued to feel unwell with ongoing fever, chills, and worsening back pain and presented to the ED for further evaluation.\n\n【1】In the ED, the patient appeared clinically well. Vital signs were temperature, 36.8°C; heart rate, 96 beats/min; blood pressure, 153/85 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 16 breaths/min; and oxygen saturation, 95% while breathing room air. Physical examination revealed no rashes, petechiae, or palpable lymphadenopathy. His lungs were clear on auscultation, and heart sounds were normal with no murmurs. Abdominal examination detected no abnormalities, including tenderness or organomegaly. Neurologic examination revealed normal tone, power, reflexes, coordination, and sensation. Anal tone was normal. Gait was remarkable for subjective discomfort with mobilization but otherwise normal. There was mild paraspinal tenderness but no overlying skin changes and no flank tenderness.

In severe complicated cases, patients may present with sepsis, shock, or renal failure. However, the absence of pyuria would suggest an alternative diagnosis in this case. Mechanical musculoskeletal pain is unlikely given the presence of fevers and chills and the absence of documented trauma. The primary manifestation of vertebral osteomyelitis is back pain, and because vertebral osteomyelitis is an uncommon cause of a common complaint, physicians must always consider it in their differential diagnosis. Fever is an inconsistent finding, and focal spinal tenderness on palpation is a useful clinical sign although not highly specific. Most patients with vertebral osteomyelitis will have a mildly elevated leukocyte count, rarely exceeding 15 × 10  /L, and an elevated CRP level. In this case, vertebral osteomyelitis was the most likely diagnosis. The most common feature of _C difficile_ colitis is watery diarrhea, which was improving in our patient. Other signs include abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and fever. Back pain is not a typical presenting symptom of _C difficile_ infection. Renal cell carcinoma can present with an array of symptoms, but unfortunately, many patients are asymptomatic until the disease is advanced. The most common presenting findings are hematuria, flank pain, an abdominal mass, and weight loss, the absence of which makes this a less likely diagnosis.\n\n【16】In the ED, the patient received one dose each of intravenous (IV) vancomycin and ceftriaxone before peripheral blood was obtained for cultures. Given concern for vertebral osteomyelitis, the patient underwent further imaging.\n\n【17】*   2.\n\n【18】    **Given this patient's presentation, which _one_ of the following is the _best_ spinal imaging technique?**\n\n【19】    *   a.\n\n【20】        Plain film radiography\n\n【21】    *   b.\n\n【22】        Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT)\n\n【23】    *   c.\n\n【24】        Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\n【25】    *   d.\n\n【26】        Radionucleotide scanning\n\n【27】    *   e.\n\n【28】        Ultrasonography\n\n【29】Findings on plain radiography are often normal when obtained in the early stages of an infection.

The patient was admitted with a working diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis, and supportive care with analgesia was instituted. Because the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable, IV antibiotics were promptly discontinued until further work-up was completed. As expected, after administration of antibiotic therapy, the patient's peripheral blood cultures were sterile. Blood cultures are positive in only 50% of cases of osteomyelitis and, when possible, should be obtained before antibiotic administration. Empirical antibiotic therapy is not recommended if the patient is clinically stable without first obtaining a microbiological diagnosis.\n\n【50】*   3.\n\n【51】    **At this point, which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ next step in establishing the diagnosis?**\n\n【52】    *   a.\n\n【53】        Positron emission tomography (PET)–CT\n\n【54】    *   b.\n\n【55】        Open surgical bone biopsy for Gram stain, bacterial culture, and pathologic examination\n\n【56】    *   c.\n\n【57】        “Watch and wait” approach for 48 hours while antibiotic therapy is withheld\n\n【58】    *   d.\n\n【59】        CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy for Gram stain, culture, and pathologic examination\n\n【60】    *   e.\n\n【61】        Indium 111–labeled WBC scintigraphy\n\n【62】Positron emission tomography combined with CT, although primarily used in neoplastic conditions, provides both functional and anatomic information in the setting of infectious and inflammatory disease.

Additionally, \\[  F\\]-fluorodeoxyglucose–PET-CT is more costly, is less widely available, and offers limited additional diagnostic value.\n\n【68】Open surgical bone biopsy is considered the criterion standard for obtaining an accurate microbiological diagnosis; however, this procedure is invasive and associated with considerable risk. A watch-and-wait approach would likely not offer any further diagnostic yield in this setting. The primary concern with adopting such an approach is that the patient may experience clinical deterioration in the setting of a partially treated bacteremia without having gained any further useful diagnostic information.\n\n【69】For our patient, the most appropriate next step would be a CT-guided percutaneous bone biopsy with specimens sent for Gram stain, culture, and pathologic examination. In addition, in the case of an immunocompromised host or a patient with risk factors for tuberculosis, fungal and mycobacterial cultures should routinely be performed. Some clinicians would recommend discontinuing empirical antibiotics at this juncture before bone biopsy if the patient is clinically stable, whereas others would continue to treat if antibiotics had already been commenced. Image-guided biopsy techniques are preferred over open surgical techniques because of lower morbidity, avoidance of general anesthesia, reduced cost, shorter procedure time, and availability in the outpatient setting.\n\n【70】Indium 111–labeled leukocyte scintigraphy is an imaging modality that may be used for the diagnostic evaluation of occult infections.

Group B and group G β-hemolytic streptococci remain important but less common causative pathogens, mainly associated with osteomyelitis in diabetic patients. The most important infecting organism in pyogenic spinal osteomyelitis is _S aureus_ , accounting for more than 50% of cases in most series from developed countries. As the proportion of methicillin-resistant _S aureus_ (MRSA) strains has increased, the relative incidence of MRSA as a causative organism in vertebral osteomyelitis has simultaneously increased.\n\n【95】_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ is more commonly associated with IV drug abuse or intravascular access sepsis. Tuberculous vertebral osteomyelitis (Pott disease) most commonly affects the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine. It presents with a subacute course, and diagnosis is often delayed, especially in regions where the incidence of tuberculosis is relatively low. _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ osteomyelitis, generally considered an uncommon cause of vertebral osteomyelitis in developed countries, is being encountered with increased frequency in countries such as Italy because of increasing immigration from Africa and Asia.\n\n【96】无关删除-2:<u>*   Concia E.\n*   Prandini N.\n*   Massari L.\n\n【97】Osteomyelitis: clinical update for practical guidelines.\n\n【98】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Nucl Med Commun._ 2006; 27 : 645-660</u></u>\n\n【99】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (44)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【100】_Salmonella_ is the most common cause of osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease.\n\n【101】The infectious diseases service was consulted for further guidance regarding a long-term antimicrobial plan and to help identify an etiology. The patient had no notable social risks or recent travel history and no major risk factors for tuberculosis that would warrant testing. Dental infection as a portal of entry was considered unlikely because dental sources tend to be associated more with an intermittent transient bacteremia than a sustained bacteremia capable of causing systemic signs of infection, as well as a multilevel disk involvement. A urinary tract infection was also considered as a possible infectious source leading to vertebral osteomyelitis, but findings on urinalysis, Gram stain, and culture were unremarkable.\n\n【102】Although there were no clinical signs of endocarditis, when a patient has presumed partially treated bacteremia and subsequent multilevel disk infection, it is imperative to rule out infective endocarditis. Transesophageal echocardiography was negative for vegetations.

Repeated MRI is not routinely indicated if favorable clinical and laboratory responses to antimicrobial therapy are achieved. In cases of suspected treatment failure, however, repeated MRI is recommended. Measurement of ESR and CRP along with clinical examination is recommended after 4 weeks of treatment. The evidence for this recommendation is relatively weak, but it is somewhat strengthened in the presence of improving ESR and CRP level.\n\n【127】Weekly clinical examinations alone are less objective and generally add very little given the typically slow rate of change in symptoms. Follow-up to ensure improvement is important in this situation so that treatment failure may be identified in a timely manner.

Keep from freezing.\n\n【49】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【50】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【51】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【52】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【53】It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【54】Do not use this medicine if you are using St. John's wort, cyclobenzaprine, dextromethorphan, meperidine, methadone, propoxyphene, tramadol, or used a MAO inhibitor within the past 14 days.\n\n【55】If you experience signs and symptoms of high blood pressure, you should seek immediate medical attention. Signs and symptoms include severe headache, blurred vision or visual disturbances, difficulty thinking, stupor or coma, seizures, chest pain, unexplained nausea or vomiting.\n\n【56】Make sure your doctor knows about all the other medicines you are using. Rasagiline may cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome when used with some medicines. This especially includes medicines used to treat depression, such as citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, olanzapine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, Celexa®, Cymbalta®, Effexor®, Lexapro®, Luvox®, Paxil®, Prozac®, Sarafem®, Symbyax®, or Zoloft®. Check with your doctor right away if you have agitation, confusion, diarrhea, excitement while talking that is not normal, fever, overactive reflexes, poor coordination, restlessness, shivering, sweating, trembling or shaking that you cannot control, or twitching. These could be symptoms of serotonin syndrome.\n\n【57】This medicine may make you dizzy or drowsy. It may even cause you to fall asleep without warning while you drive, talk, or eat. Do not drive or do anything that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\n【58】This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your medical doctor or dentist before taking any of the above while you are taking this medicine.\n\n【59】If you are taking this medicine with levodopa, you may experience increased dyskinesia (eg, twitching, twisting, uncontrolled repetitive movements of tongue, lips, face, arms, or legs). Check with your doctor if you have any of these symptoms.\n\n【60】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. If you should have this problem, check with your doctor.\n\n【61】If you develop any unusual or strange thoughts and behavior while receiving this medicine, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Other changes might be confusion, worsening of depression, visual hallucinations (seeing things that are not there), suicidal thoughts, and unusual excitement, nervousness, or irritability.\n\n【62】Some people who have used this medicine had unusual changes in their behavior. Talk with your doctor right away if you start having problems with gambling or an increased interest in sex while using this medicine.\n\n【63】Check with your doctor right away if you are having convulsions (seizures), difficulty with breathing, a fast heartbeat, a high fever, high or low blood pressure, increased sweating, loss of bladder control, severe muscle stiffness, unusually pale skin, or tiredness. These could be symptoms of a serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\n\n【64】Do not stop taking rasagiline without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are taking before stopping completely.\n\n【65】It is important that your doctor check your skin regularly for signs of a skin cancer called melanoma. If you notice any unusual red, brown, or black spots on your skin, talk to your doctor right away.\n\n【66】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems, since they may increase your blood pressure.\n\n【67】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【68】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【69】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【70】#### Less common\n\n【71】1.  Abdominal or stomach pain\n2.  arm, back, or jaw pain\n3.  black, tarry stools\n4.  chest pain or discomfort\n5.  chest tightness or heaviness\n6.  chills\n7.  cloudy urine\n8.  cough\n9.  diarrhea\n10.  difficulty swallowing\n11.  dizziness\n12.  fainting\n13.  fast or irregular heartbeat\n14.  fever\n15.  hives, itching, or skin rash\n16.  loss of appetite\n17.  nausea\n18.  painful or difficult urination\n19.  persistent, non-healing sore\n20.  pink growth on the skin\n21.  puffiness or swelling of the eyelids or around the eyes\n22.  reddish patch or irritated area\n23.  redness, blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin\n24.  seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there\n25.  shiny bump\n26.  sore throat\n27.  sores, ulcers, or white spots on lips or in mouth\n28.  sweating\n29.  swollen glands\n30.  tests that show problems with the liver\n31.  tightness in the chest\n32.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n33.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n34.  weakness\n35.  white, yellow or waxy scar-like area\n\n【72】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention.

We completed clinical assessment using a large cohort of human serum samples from 78 unique individuals, and subsequently used the assay in the evaluation of eight individuals with high diagnostic suspicion for factitious hypoglycemia.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The performance characteristics show that the LC-HRAM immunoassay can be applied to detect five commonly used synthetic insulin analogs (lispro, glulisine, aspart, glargine metabolite, and detemir) in human serum. Our clinical cases show that this assay could be used in the diagnosis of factitious hypoglycemia by identifying the analog insulin(s) in question.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The LC-HRAM immunoassay reported here overcomes a gap in our diagnostic pathway for hypoglycemia. The results obtained from our studies suggest that this method is appropriate for use in clinical laboratories when factitious hypoglycemia is considered as a differential diagnosis.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CMSL ( Clinical Mass Spectrometry Laboratory ), LC-HRAM ( liquid chromatography high resolution accurate mass ), MS ( mass spectrometry )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

If your child has too few or too many white blood cells, in general, here's what it means:\n\n【2】*   **Low white blood cell count (leukopenia)** means having too few leukocytes circulating in the blood. A long-term low white blood cell count increases the risk of infections and may be caused by a number of different diseases and conditions.\n*   **High white blood cell count (leukocytosis)** means having too many leukocytes circulating in the blood, usually from having an infection. A number of different diseases and conditions may cause a long-term high white blood cell count.\n\n【3】There are several types of white blood cells, each with a different disease-fighting activity. The main types are:\n\n【4】*   Neutrophils\n*   Lymphocytes\n*   Monocytes\n*   Eosinophils\n*   Basophils\n\n【5】White blood cell disorders involving a specific type of white blood cell include:\n\n【6】*   **Neutropenia.** Neutropenia (noo-troe-PEE-nee-uh) is a low number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that fights infections of fungi and bacteria. Neutropenia can be caused by cancer or by diseases, disorders or infections that damage bone marrow. In addition, certain medications and other diseases or conditions can cause neutropenia.\n*   **Lymphocytopenia.** Lymphocytopenia (lim-foe-sie-toe-PEE-nee-uh) is a decrease in lymphocytes, the type of white blood cell that, among other tasks, protects your body from viral infections. Lymphocytopenia can result from an inherited syndrome, be associated with certain diseases, or be a side effect from medications or other treatments.\n*   **Monocyte disorders.** Monocytes help get rid of dead or damaged tissue and regulate your body's immune response. Infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases and other conditions can cause an increased number of monocytes. A decreased number can be the result of toxins, chemotherapy and other causes.\n*   **Eosinophilia.** Eosinophilia (e-o-sin-o-FIL-e-uh) is a higher than normal number of eosinophil cells, a type of disease-fighting white blood cell. Eosinophilia can be caused by a variety of conditions and disorders, most commonly by an allergic reaction or a parasitic infection.\n*   **Basophilic disorders.** Basophils account for only a small number of white blood cells, but they have a role in wound healing, infection and allergic reactions. A decreased number of basophils can result from allergic reactions or infections. An increased number can be caused by certain types of blood cancer or other disorders.\n\n【7】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "06ecd116-a296-4d6a-b42d-66e618fa51ae", "title": "End-stage renal disease", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】End-stage renal disease, also called end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure, occurs when chronic kidney disease — the gradual loss of kidney function — reaches an advanced state. In end-stage renal disease, your kidneys no longer work as they should to meet your body's needs.\n\n【2】Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When your kidneys lose their filtering abilities, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body.\n\n【3】With end-stage renal disease, you need dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive. But you can also choose to opt for conservative care to manage your symptoms — aiming for the best quality of life during your remaining time.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Early in chronic kidney disease, you might have no signs or symptoms. As chronic kidney disease progresses to end-stage renal disease, signs and symptoms might include:\n\n【6】*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Fatigue and weakness\n*   Changes in how much you urinate\n*   Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart\n*   Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs\n*   Swelling of feet and ankles\n*   High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control\n*   Headaches\n*   Difficulty sleeping\n*   Decreased mental sharpness\n*   Muscle twitches and cramps\n*   Persistent itching\n*   Metallic taste\n\n【7】Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys can make up for lost function, signs and symptoms might not appear until irreversible damage has occurred.\n\n【8】### When to seek care\n\n【9】Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have signs or symptoms of kidney disease.\n\n【10】If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your care provider is likely to monitor your kidney function with urine and blood tests and your blood pressure during regular office visits. Ask your provider whether these tests are necessary for you.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】Kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years. For some people, kidney damage can continue to progress even after the underlying condition is resolved.\n\n【13】Diseases and conditions that can lead to kidney disease include:\n\n【14】*   Type 1 or type 2 diabetes\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis) — an inflammation of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli)\n*   Interstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures\n*   Polycystic kidney disease or other inherited kidney diseases\n*   Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers\n*   Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys\n*   Recurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis)\n\n【15】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【16】Certain factors increase the risk that chronic kidney disease will progress more quickly to end-stage renal disease, including:\n\n【17】*   Diabetes with poor blood sugar control\n*   Kidney disease that affects the glomeruli, the structures in the kidneys that filter wastes from the blood\n*   Polycystic kidney disease\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Tobacco use\n*   Black, Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander or American Indian heritage\n*   Family history of kidney failure\n*   Older age\n*   Frequent use of medications that could be damaging to the kidney\n\n【18】Complications\n-------------\n\n【19】Kidney damage, once it occurs, can't be reversed. Potential complications can affect almost any part of your body and can include:\n\n【20】*   Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema)\n*   A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's ability to function and may be life-threatening\n*   Heart disease\n*   Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures\n*   Anemia\n*   Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility\n*   Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures\n*   Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection\n*   Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium)\n*   Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus\n*   Malnutrition\n*   Irreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival\n\n【21】Prevention\n----------\n\n【22】If you have kidney disease, you may be able to slow its progress by making healthy lifestyle choices:\n\n【23】*   Achieve and maintain a healthy weight\n*   Be active most days\n*   Limit protein and eat a balanced diet of nutritious, low-sodium foods\n*   Control your blood pressure\n*   Take your medications as prescribed\n*   Have your cholesterol levels checked every year\n*   Control your blood sugar level\n*   Don't smoke or use tobacco products\n*   Get regular checkups\n\n【24】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

After Stanford University created one of the first health care CWO position in 2017, a number of organizations have subsequently followed suit. Although recent articles have articulated design considerations for organizational programs on health care professional well-being as well as recommendations addressing the roles and responsibilities of the health care CWO,\n\n【29】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ripp J.\n*   Shanafelt T.</u>\n\n【30】The health care chief wellness officer: what the role is and is not.\n\n【31】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Acad Med._ 2020; 95 : 1354-1358</u></u>\n\n【32】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (23)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【33】there is little information published regarding the typical responsibilities and job characteristics of existing health care CWOs in the United States.\n\n【34】In mid-2019, we formed the Collaborative for Healing and Renewal in Medicine CWO Network. Formal criteria for members were established in February 2021 . This network comprises health care CWOs or equivalent executive-level leaders responsible for overseeing the health care professional well-being efforts of their institutions. In early 2020, we asked network members to describe the characteristics of their positions and summarize here the profile of 21 health care CWOs across the United States. Analysis of these data for publication was deemed exempt by the Stanford Institutional Review Board.\n\n【35】The organizations represented by these CWOs are listed in Appendix 2 . In aggregate, 18 of 21 participating CWOs (85.7%) were located at university-affiliated academic centers. The primary organizational motivation for establishing a CWO was reported to be a desire to reduce burnout and increase professional fulfillment (n=16 \\[76.2%\\]), with fewer respondents reporting a desire to reduce depression/suicide (n=2 \\[9.5%\\]), reduce turnover (n=1 \\[4.8%\\]), generate a financial return on investment (n=1 \\[4.8%\\]), or reduce health care costs by improving the health of the workforce (n=1 \\[4.8%\\]).\n\n【36】The position title for most of these individuals (17 of 21 \\[81.0%\\]) 删除4:<u>( Table )</u> was CWO. Most (18 of 21 \\[85.7%\\]) devoted 50% or more of their professional work effort to their CWO role, with nearly 40% (8 of 21) dedicating 70% or more effort to the role. Although the reporting structure varied, 12 of 21 CWOs (57.1%) reported directly to the dean, chief executive officer, provost, vice-chancellor, or vice-dean. An additional 7 (33.3%) reported to the chief medical officer, chief clinical officer, or chief physician executive. Sixteen CWOs (76.2%) reported managing an independent budget. The median full-time equivalent of direct reports to the CWO was 1.8 (interquartile range \\[IQR\\], 1.0-4.0). All 21 CWOs indicated that the source of support for their time and program was institutional operational funds.\n\n【37】Table Chief Wellness Officer Position Description (N=21)\n\n【38】EHR, elctronic health records;

The CWO plays a pivotal role in leading organizational efforts to improve professional well-being. We believe that the information presented here may be helpful to other organizations creating CWO positions, particularly in the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Organizational efforts to improve well-being should center on addressing problems in the practice environment and organizational culture, rather than attempting to make individuals better equipped to endure broken systems.\n\n【46】无关删除-1:<u>Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------</u>\n\n【47】无关删除-2:<u>无关删除-1:<u>*   Download .docx (.01 MB)\n\n【48】    Help with docx files\n\n【49】    Appendix</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "82b49ac2-5b28-4e98-bb4a-5229b63ead8a", "title": "Doxazosin (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Doxazosin (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Cardura\n2.  Cardura XL\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Doxazosin belongs to the general class of medicines called antihypertensives. It is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).\n\n【6】High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.\n\n【7】Doxazosin works by relaxing blood vessels so that blood passes through them more easily. This helps to lower blood pressure.\n\n【8】Doxazosin is also used to treat benign (noncancerous) enlargement of the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia \\[BPH\\]). Benign enlargement of the prostate is a problem that can occur in men as they get older. The prostate gland is located below the bladder. As the prostate gland enlarges, certain muscles in the gland may become tight and get in the way of the tube that drains urine from the bladder. This can cause problems in urinating, such as a need to urinate often, a weak stream when urinating, or a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely.\n\n【9】Doxazosin helps relax the muscles in the prostate and the opening of the bladder. This may help increase the flow of urine and/or decrease the symptoms. However, doxazosin will not shrink the prostate. The prostate may continue to get larger. This may cause the symptoms to become worse over time. Therefore, even though doxazosin may lessen the problems caused by enlarged prostate now, surgery still may be needed in the future.\n\n【10】Doxazosin is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【11】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【12】*   Tablet\n*   Tablet, Extended Release\n\n【13】Before Using\n------------\n\n【14】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【15】### Allergies\n\n【16】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【17】### Pediatric\n\n【18】Studies on this medicine have been done only in adult patients, and there is no specific information comparing use of doxazosin in children with use in other age groups.\n\n【19】### Geriatric\n\n【20】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may be especially likely to occur in elderly patients with high blood pressure, because these patients are usually more sensitive than younger adults to the effects of doxazosin.\n\n【21】### Breastfeeding\n\n【22】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【23】### Drug Interactions\n\n【24】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【26】*   Boceprevir\n\n【27】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【28】*   Alfuzosin\n*   Asenapine\n*   Silodosin\n*   Tamsulosin\n*   Vardenafil\n\n【29】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【30】*   Acebutolol\n*   Alprenolol\n*   Atenolol\n*   Avanafil\n*   Betaxolol\n*   Bevantolol\n*   Bisoprolol\n*   Bucindolol\n*   Carteolol\n*   Carvedilol\n*   Celiprolol\n*   Dilevalol\n*   Esmolol\n*   Labetalol\n*   Levobunolol\n*   Mepindolol\n*   Metipranolol\n*   Metoprolol\n*   Nadolol\n*   Nebivolol\n*   Nifedipine\n*   Oxprenolol\n*   Penbutolol\n*   Pindolol\n*   Propranolol\n*   Sildenafil\n*   Sotalol\n*   Tadalafil\n*   Talinolol\n*   Tertatolol\n*   Timolol\n\n【31】### Other Interactions\n\n【32】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【33】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【34】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【35】*   Gastrointestinal (stomach and intestines) blockage—May increase the effect of doxazosin which could increase the chance of side effects.\n\n【36】*   Heart problems—May make condition worse.\n\n【37】*   Hypotension (decrease in blood pressure)—Possible increased chance of fainting, especially after the first dose or a dose increase of this medicine.\n\n【38】*   Kidney disease—Possible increased sensitivity to the effects of doxazosin\n\n【39】*   Liver disease—The effects of doxazosin may be increased, which may increase the chance of side effects\n\n【40】*   Prostate cancer—Your doctor will want to make sure that you do not have prostate cancer before starting you on this medicine.\n\n【41】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【42】For the regular tablet—To help you remember to take your medicine, try to get into the habit of taking it at the same time each day.\n\n【43】For the extended-release tablet—\n\n【44】*   Take in the morning with breakfast each day.\n*   Swallow whole. Do not crush or chew.\n*   Your doctor will not prescribe the extended-release tablet form of this medicine for high blood pressure. It can only be used in men for benign enlargement of the prostate.\n\n【45】For patients taking this medicine for high blood pressure :\n\n【46】*   In addition to the use of the medicine your doctor has prescribed, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and care in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium. Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet.\n*   Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal. It is very important that you take your medicine exactly as directed and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well.\n*   Remember that doxazosin will not cure your high blood pressure but it does help control it. Therefore, you must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life . If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, stroke, or kidney disease.\n\n【47】For patients taking this medicine for benign enlargement of the prostate:\n\n【48】*   Remember that doxazosin will not shrink the size of your prostate but it does help to relieve the symptoms of this condition. You may still need to have surgery later.\n*   It may take up to 2 weeks before your symptoms improve.\n\n【49】### Dosing\n\n【50】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【51】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【52】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   For benign enlargement of the prostate:\n        *   Adults—At first, 1 milligram (mg) once a day, in the morning or in the evening. Your doctor may increase your dose slowly up to 8 mg once a day.\n    *   For high blood pressure:\n        *   Adults—1 mg once a day to start. Your doctor may increase your dose slowly to as much as 16 mg once a day.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【53】*   For oral dosage form (extended-release tablets):\n    *   For benign enlargement of the prostate:\n        *   Adults—At first, 4 milligram (mg) once a day, in the morning with breakfast. Your doctor may increase your dose slowly up to 8 mg once a day.\n\n【54】### Missed Dose\n\n【55】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule.

This is especially important for elderly patients, who may be more sensitive to the effects of this medicine.\n\n【62】For patients taking this medicine for high blood pressure :\n\n【63】*   Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes over-the-counter (nonprescription) medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems, since they may tend to increase your blood pressure.\n\n【64】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or sudden fainting may occur after you take this medicine, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. These effects are more likely to occur when you take the first dose of this medicine. Taking the first dose at bedtime may prevent problems. However, be especially careful if you need to get up during the night. These effects may also occur with any doses you take after the first dose. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. If you feel dizzy, lie down so that you do not faint. Then sit for a few moments before standing to prevent the dizziness from returning.\n\n【65】The dizziness, lightheadedness, or sudden fainting is more likely to occur if you drink alcohol, stand for a long time, exercise, or if the weather is hot. While you are taking this medicine, be careful to limit the amount of alcohol you drink. Also, use extra care during exercise or hot weather or if you must stand for a long time.\n\n【66】Doxazosin may cause some people to become drowsy or less alert than they are normally. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy, drowsy, or are not alert. After you have taken several doses of this medicine, these effects should lessen.\n\n【67】The possibility of priapism, a painful or prolonged erection of the penis, is a rare side effect that can occur when taking doxazosin and must have immediate medical attention.\n\n【68】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【69】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.

Theories about the causes of DPNP are inextricably linked with the causes of diabetic neuropathies, yet most patients with such neuropathies do not experience pain. The factors that differentiate patients with pain from those without remain unknown and are the subject of much research. When choosing treatment for patients with DPNP, physicians are confronted with a myriad of choices, none of which has been shown to be effective for all patients.\n\n【15】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Related Articles\n----------------</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Hide Caption Download See figure in Article</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Toggle Thumbstrip</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>无关删除-1:<u>*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download .PPT</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Data collected and analyzed for this study included age, sex, race, admission type (urgent or emergent combined vs elective), any colectomy diagnosis, length of stay, type of discharge, and mortality. _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification_ codes were utilized to identify CKD patients and CDI events. Weighted analysis was performed using JMP version 9.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】An estimated 162 million adults were hospitalized during 2005-2009, and 8.03 million (5%) had CKD (median age, 71 years). The CDI rate in CKD patients was 1.49% (0.119 million) compared with 0.70% (1.14 million) in patients without CKD ( _P_ <.001). Patients with CKD who were undergoing long-term dialysis were more than 2 times as likely to develop CDI than non-CKD patients and 1.33 times more likely than CKD patients not undergoing dialysis (all _P_ <.001). In a weighted multivariate analysis adjusting for sex and comorbidities, patients with CKD and CDI had longer hospitalization, higher colectomy rate (adjusted odds ratio \\[aOR\\], 2.30; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 2.14-2.47), dismissal to a health care facility (aOR, 2.22; 95% CI, 2.19-2.25), and increased in-hospital mortality (aOR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.52-1.59; all _P_ <.001) as compared with CKD patients without CDI. Patients with CKD who were undergoing long-term dialysis did not have worse outcomes as compared with CKD patients who were not undergoing long-term dialysis.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】These data suggest that patients with CKD have a higher risk of CDI and increased hospital-associated morbidity and mortality. Future prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and to identify effective CDI prevention in CKD patients, who appear to have an increased risk of CDI acquisition.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AKI ( acute kidney injury ), CDI ( Clostridium difficile infection ), CI ( confidence interval ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), eGFR ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ), ICD-9-CM ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ), NHDS ( National Hospital Discharge Survey ), OR ( odds ratio )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Until recently, medical genetics was considered a specialty of minor practical relevance. This view has changed with the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. It is now realized that genetic disease represents an important part of medical practice. Achievements in cancer genetics, in the field of prenatal diagnostics (including carrier testing for common recessive disorders), and in newborn screening for treatable metabolic disorders reinforce the rapidly expanding role of genetics in medicine. Diagnosing a genetic disorder not only allows for disease-specific management options but also has implications for the affected individual's entire family. A working understanding of the underlying concepts of genetic disease with regard to chromosome, single gene, mitochondrial, and multifactorial disorders is necessary for today's practicing physician. Routine clinical practice in virtually all medical specialties will soon require integration of these fundamental concepts for use in accurate diagnosis and ensuring appropriate referrals for patients with genetic disease and their families.\n\n【1】AS ( Angelman syndrome ), FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ), mtDNA ( mitochondrial DNA ), PKU ( phenylketonuria ), PWS ( Prader-Willi syndrome ), UPD ( uniparental disomy )\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Endocrinologist-biologist Gregory Pincus conducted the early experimental work on laboratory animals and then collaborated with gynecologist-obstetrician John Rock on the clinical application. “The Pill” initiated a worldwide sociomedical revolution.\n\n【2】Pincus was born on April 9, 1903, in Woodbine in southern New Jersey, about 20 miles southwest of Atlantic City. His father was a teacher and editor of a farm journal. In 1924, Pincus received a BS degree from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, after which he attended Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where in 1927 he was awarded an ScD degree in genetics and physiology.\n\n【3】Pincus was a fellow of the National Research Council from 1927 to 1930, and as a fellow, he attended Cambridge University (England) from 1929 to 1930 and worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin (Germany) in 1930. In 1930, he returned to the United States to become an instructor in biology at Harvard University; in 1931, he was promoted to assistant professor.\n\n【4】Pincus was visiting professor at Cambridge University in 1937-1938. In 1938, he was named professor of experimental zoology at Clark University in Worcester (40 miles west of Boston).\n\n【5】In the early 1930s, Pincus began studying the effects of hormones on the reproductive process in mammals. In 1941, while at Clark University, Pincus brought about the first fatherless mammalian birth in history by inducing parthenogenesis in a female rabbit. From 1939 to 1941, his work was subsidized by a Guggenheim fellowship, and in 1942, he and a colleague at Clark University developed a quick-freeze method for preserving living sperm.\n\n【6】In 1944, Pincus founded the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury (in central Massachusetts near Worcester) and became director of its laboratories. At the time, he was also a professor at Clark University (until 1945) and a research professor in physiology at Tufts Medical School (until 1950) in Boston. In 1950, he was named professor of research at the graduate school of Boston University.\n\n【7】In 1951, Pincus and his colleague Min Chueh Chang (1908-1991) began to search for a progestin (a synthetic progesterone) that would be feasible for wide use as a birth control agent. After experimenting with more than 200 substances, they found 3 steroid compounds that could be useful. They found that these 3 substances, present in the root of _Dioscorea_ (a wild Mexican yam), prevented ovulation in laboratory animals and had a molecular structure similar to that of progesterone.\n\n【8】During this time, John Rock was working at the Fertility and Endocrine Clinic of the Free Hospital for Women in Brookline, Massachusetts, and using supplementary progesterone to cure infertility in childless patients. Beginning in December 1954, Rock used synthetic drugs as substitutes for natural progesterone in treating volunteers among his Brookline clinic patients; and he achieved a considerable degree of success. Pincus asked Rock to join him in conducting field trials. Pincus had been in touch with Rock from time to time many years before this request was made.\n\n【9】Beginning in 1956 and under the general supervision of Pincus, full trials for the contraceptive effectiveness of the pill were conducted successfully among hundreds of women in Brookline, Puerto Rico, Haiti, and elsewhere. In 1957, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the marketing of the steroids as specified for miscarriage and certain menstrual disorders. In 1960, the FDA licensed the first oral contraceptive (Enovid, a preparation of estrogen and progesterone) for sale as a contraceptive agent.\n\n【10】Pincus was the author of _The Eggs of Mammals_ (1936) and _The Control of Fertility_ (1965) as well as numerous articles in professional journals. He was a member of many professional organizations and societies.\n\n【11】删除3:<u>Pincus died in Boston on August 22, 1967; he was 64 years old. In 1994, the Philippine Islands indirectly honored him and John Rock by issuing a stamp (Scott No. 2317) promoting the International Year of the Family.</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【14】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.01.025</u></u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>© 2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Pooling analysis revealed that, compared with treatment without HBO, adjunctive treatment with HBO resulted in a significantly higher proportion of healed diabetic ulcers (relative risk, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.51-3.60). The analysis also revealed that treatment with HBO was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of major amputations (relative risk, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.19-0.44); however, the rate of minor amputations was not affected ( _P_ \\=.30). Adverse events associated with HBO treatment were rare and reversible and not more frequent than those occurring without HBO treatment ( _P_ \\=.37).\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】This meta-analysis reveals that treatment with HBO improved the rate of healing and reduced the risk of major amputations in patients with diabetic foot ulcers.

That means it is a congenital heart defect.\n\n【2】Other names for this condition are:\n\n【3】*   PAPVR.\n*   Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection.\n*   PAPVC.\n\n【4】In this condition, some of the blood vessels of the lungs attach to the wrong place in the heart. These blood vessels are called the pulmonary veins.\n\n【5】In a typical heart, oxygen-rich blood goes from the lungs to the upper left heart chamber, called the left atrium. Then the blood flows through the body.\n\n【6】In PAPVR, blood flows from the lungs into the upper right heart chamber, called the right atrium. Extra blood flows to the right side of the heart. This may cause swelling of the right heart chambers.\n\n【7】Some people with PAPVR have a hole between the upper heart chambers called an atrial septal defect. The hole lets blood flow between the upper heart chambers. Other heart problems also may occur. A child born with Turner syndrome has an increased risk of PAPVR.\n\n【8】### Symptoms\n\n【9】Symptoms depend on whether there are other heart problems. A common symptom of PAPVR is breathing trouble.\n\n【10】### Diagnosis\n\n【11】If PAPVR occurs with other heart problems, it may be diagnosed soon after birth. If the condition is mild, it may not be diagnosed until adulthood.\n\n【12】A health care provider does a physical exam and listens to the heart with a stethoscope. A whooshing sound, called a heart murmur, may be heard.\n\n【13】An echocardiogram is done to diagnose partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. This test uses sound waves to create images of the beating heart. An echocardiogram shows the pulmonary veins and the size of the heart chambers. It also measures the speed of blood flow. An echocardiogram can help diagnose a hole in the heart.\n\n【14】Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), a chest X-ray or a CT scan may be done if more information is needed.\n\n【15】### Treatment\n\n【16】Surgery to repair the heart may be needed if:\n\n【17】*   A lot of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood mixes in the heart.\n*   The condition causes many lung infections.\n\n【18】If you don't have symptoms, surgery may not be needed.

Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger signs and symptoms such as digestive problems, hives or swollen airways. In some people, a food allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis.\n\n【2】Food allergy affects an estimated 8% of children under age 5 and up to 4% of adults. While there's no cure, some children outgrow their food allergies as they get older.\n\n【3】It's easy to confuse a food allergy with a much more common reaction known as food intolerance. While bothersome, food intolerance is a less serious condition that does not involve the immune system.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】For some people, an allergic reaction to a particular food may be uncomfortable but not severe. For other people, an allergic food reaction can be frightening and even life-threatening. Food allergy symptoms usually develop within a few minutes to 2 hours after eating the offending food. Rarely, symptoms may be delayed for several hours.\n\n【6】The most common food allergy signs and symptoms include:\n\n【7】*   Tingling or itching in the mouth\n*   Hives, itching or eczema\n*   Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat or other parts of the body\n*   Wheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathing\n*   Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting\n*   Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting\n\n【8】### Anaphylaxis\n\n【9】In some people, a food allergy can trigger a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. This can cause life-threatening signs and symptoms, including:\n\n【10】*   Constriction and tightening of the airways\n*   A swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in your throat that makes it difficult to breathe\n*   Shock with a severe drop in blood pressure\n*   Rapid pulse\n*   Dizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness\n\n【11】Emergency treatment is critical for anaphylaxis. Untreated, anaphylaxis can cause a coma or even death.\n\n【12】### When to see a doctor\n\n【13】See your health care provider or allergist if you have food allergy symptoms shortly after eating. If possible, see your provider when the allergic reaction is occurring. This will help your provider make a diagnosis.\n\n【14】Seek emergency treatment if you develop any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as:\n\n【15】*   Constriction of airways that makes it difficult to breathe\n*   Shock with a severe drop in blood pressure\n*   Rapid pulse\n*   Dizziness or lightheadedness\n\n【16】Causes\n------\n\n【17】When you have a food allergy, your immune system mistakenly identifies a specific food or a substance in food as something harmful. In response, your immune system triggers cells to release an antibody known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) to neutralize the allergy-causing food or food substance (the allergen).\n\n【18】The next time you eat even the smallest amount of that food, IgE antibodies sense it and signal your immune system to release a chemical called histamine, as well as other chemicals, into your bloodstream. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.\n\n【19】The majority of food allergies are triggered by certain proteins in:\n\n【20】*   Crustacean shellfish, such as shrimp, lobster and crab\n*   Peanuts\n*   Tree nuts, such as walnuts and pecans\n*   Fish\n*   Chicken eggs\n*   Cow's milk\n*   Wheat\n*   Soy\n\n【21】### Pollen-food allergy syndrome\n\n【22】Also known as oral allergy syndrome, pollen-food allergy syndrome affects many people who have hay fever. In this condition, certain fresh fruits and vegetables or nuts and spices can trigger an allergic reaction that causes the mouth to tingle or itch. In serious cases, the reaction results in swelling of the throat or even anaphylaxis.\n\n【23】Proteins in certain fruits, vegetables, nuts and spices cause the reaction because they're similar to allergy-causing proteins found in certain pollens. This is an example of cross reactivity.\n\n【24】Symptoms are typically triggered by eating these foods when they're fresh and uncooked. However, when these foods are cooked, symptoms may be less severe.\n\n【25】The following table shows the specific fruits, vegetables, nuts and spices that can cause pollen-food allergy syndrome in people who are allergic to different pollens.\n\n| If you are allergic to: | Birch pollen | Ragweed pollen | Grasses | Mugwort pollen |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **You may also have a reaction to:** | AlmondAppleApricotCarrotCeleryCherryHazelnutPeachPeanutPearPlumRaw potatoesSoybeanSome herbs and spices (anise, caraway seed, coriander, fennel, parsley) | BananasCucumberMelons (cantaloupe, honeydew and watermelon)Zucchini | KiwiMelons (cantaloupe, honeydew and watermelon)OrangePeanutTomatoesWhite potatoZucchini | ApplesBell pepperBroccoliCabbageCarrotsCauliflowerCeleryGarlicOnionPeachSome herbs and spices (anise, black pepper, caraway seed, coriander, fennel, mustard, parsley) |\n\n【27】### Exercise-induced food allergy\n\n【28】Eating certain foods may cause some people to feel itchy and lightheaded soon after starting to exercise. Serious cases may even involve hives or anaphylaxis. Not eating for a couple of hours before exercising and avoiding certain foods may help prevent this problem.\n\n【29】### Food intolerance and other reactions\n\n【30】A food intolerance or a reaction to another substance you ate may cause the same signs and symptoms as a food allergy does — such as nausea, vomiting, cramping and diarrhea.\n\n【31】Depending on the type of food intolerance you have, you may be able to eat small amounts of problem foods without a reaction. By contrast, if you have a true food allergy, even a tiny amount of the food may trigger an allergic reaction.\n\n【32】One of the tricky aspects of diagnosing food intolerance is that some people are sensitive not to the food itself but to a substance or ingredient used in the preparation of the food.\n\n【33】Common conditions that can cause symptoms mistaken for a food allergy include:\n\n【34】*   **Absence of an enzyme needed to fully digest a food.** You may not have adequate amounts of some enzymes needed to digest certain foods. Insufficient quantities of the enzyme lactase, for example, reduce your ability to digest lactose, the main sugar in milk products. Lactose intolerance can cause bloating, cramping, diarrhea and excess gas.\n*   **Food poisoning.** Sometimes food poisoning can mimic an allergic reaction. Bacteria in spoiled tuna and other fish also can make a toxin that triggers harmful reactions.\n*   **Sensitivity to food additives.** Some people have digestive reactions and other symptoms after eating certain food additives. For example, sulfites used to preserve dried fruit, canned goods and wine can trigger asthma attacks in people with sensitivity to food additives.\n*   **Histamine toxicity.** Certain fish, such as tuna or mackerel, that are not refrigerated properly and that contain high amounts of bacteria may also contain high levels of histamine that trigger symptoms similar to those of food allergy. Rather than an allergic reaction, this is known as histamine toxicity or scombroid poisoning.\n*   **Celiac disease.** While celiac disease is sometimes referred to as a gluten allergy, it does not result in anaphylaxis. Like a food allergy, celiac disease does involve an immune system response, but it's a unique reaction that's more complex than a simple food allergy.\n\n【35】    This chronic digestive condition is triggered by eating gluten, a protein found in bread, pasta, cookies, and many other foods containing wheat, barley or rye.\n\n【36】    If you have celiac disease and eat foods containing gluten, an immune reaction occurs that causes damage to the surface of your small intestine, leading to an inability to absorb certain nutrients.\n\n【37】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【38】Food allergy risk factors include:\n\n【39】*   **Family history.** You're at increased risk of food allergies if asthma, eczema, hives or allergies such as hay fever are common in your family.\n*   **Other allergies.** If you're already allergic to one food, you may be at increased risk of becoming allergic to another. Similarly, if you have other types of allergic reactions, such as hay fever or eczema, your risk of having a food allergy is greater.\n*   **Age.** Food allergies are more common in children, especially toddlers and infants. As children grow older, their digestive systems mature and their bodies are less likely to absorb food or food components that trigger allergies.\n\n【40】    Fortunately, children typically outgrow allergies to milk, soy, wheat and eggs. Severe allergies and allergies to nuts and shellfish are more likely to be lifelong.\n\n【41】*   **Asthma.** Asthma and food allergy commonly occur together. When they do, both food allergy and asthma symptoms are more likely to be severe.\n\n【42】Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anaphylactic reaction include:\n\n【43】*   Having a history of asthma\n*   Being a teenager or younger\n*   Delaying use of epinephrine to treat your food allergy symptoms\n*   Not having hives or other skin symptoms\n\n【44】Complications\n-------------\n\n【45】Complications of food allergy can include:\n\n【46】*   **Anaphylaxis.** This is a life-threatening allergic reaction.\n*   **Atopic dermatitis (eczema).** Food allergy may cause a skin reaction, such as eczema.\n\n【47】Prevention\n----------\n\n【48】### Early exposure\n\n【49】Early introduction of peanut products has been associated with a lower risk of peanut allergy. In a recent study, high-risk infants — such as those with atopic dermatitis or egg allergy or both — were selected to either ingest or avoid peanut products from 4 to 6 months of age until 5 years of age.\n\n【50】Researchers found that high-risk children who regularly consumed peanut protein, such as peanut butter or peanut-flavored snacks, were around 80% less likely to develop a peanut allergy.\n\n【51】Before introducing allergenic foods, talk with your child's doctor about the best time to offer them.\n\n【52】### Taking precautions\n\n【53】Once a food allergy has already developed, the best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to know and avoid foods that cause signs and symptoms. For some people, this is a mere inconvenience, but others find it a greater hardship. Also, some foods — when used as ingredients in certain dishes — may be well hidden. This is especially true in restaurants and in other social settings.\n\n【54】If you know you have a food allergy, follow these steps:\n\n【55】*   **Know what you're eating and drinking.** Be sure to read food labels carefully.\n*   **If you have already had a severe reaction,** wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that lets others know that you have a food allergy in case you have a reaction and you're unable to communicate.\n*   **Talk with your doctor about prescribing emergency epinephrine.** You may need to carry an epinephrine autoinjector (Adrenaclick, EpiPen) if you're at risk of a severe allergic reaction.\n*   **Be careful at restaurants.** Be certain your server or chef is aware that you absolutely can't eat the food you're allergic to, and you need to be completely certain that the meal you order doesn't contain it. Also, make sure food isn't prepared on surfaces or in pans that contained any of the food you're allergic to.\n\n【56】    Don't be reluctant to make your needs known. Restaurant staff members are usually more than happy to help when they clearly understand your request.\n\n【57】*   **Plan meals and snacks before leaving home.** If necessary, take a cooler packed with allergen-free foods when you travel or go to an event. If you or your child can't have the cake or dessert at a party, bring an approved special treat so no one feels left out of the celebration.\n\n【58】If your child has a food allergy, take these precautions to ensure his or her safety:\n\n【59】*   **Notify key people that your child has a food allergy.** Talk with child care providers, school personnel, parents of your child's friends and other adults who regularly interact with your child. Emphasize that an allergic reaction can be life-threatening and requires immediate action. Make sure that your child also knows to ask for help right away if he or she reacts to food.\n*   **Explain food allergy symptoms.** Teach the adults who spend time with your child how to recognize signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction.\n*   **Write an action plan.** Your plan should describe how to care for your child when he or she has an allergic reaction to food. Provide a copy of the plan to your child's school nurse and others who care for and supervise your child.\n*   **Have your child wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace.** This alert lists your child's allergy symptoms and explains how others can provide first aid in an emergency.\n\n【60】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

With combined all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction as the primary outcome, weighted Cox proportional hazards regression was performed with screening stress testing within 2 years of diabetes diagnosis as the time-dependent covariate. For descriptive analysis, participants were classified by their clinical experience during the first 2 years postdiagnosis as screened (asymptomatic, underwent stress test), unscreened (asymptomatic, no stress test), or symptomatic (experienced symptoms or event).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Among the screened and unscreened participants, 54% (1358 of 2538) were men; the mean (SD) age at diabetes diagnosis was 55 years (13.8 years), and 97% (2442 of 2520) had type 2 diabetes. In event-free survival analysis, 292 patients comprised the screened cohort and 2246 patients comprised the unscreened cohort. Death or myocardial infarction occurred in 454 patients (32 patients in the screened cohort and 422 in the unscreened cohort \\[5-year rate, 1.9% and 5.3%, respectively\\]) during median (interquartile range) follow-up of 9.1 years (5.3-12.5 years).

The first 35 patients experienced increased numbers of VTEs. von Willebrand levels and platelet aggregation to ristocetin before and after treatment with DVd-T increased significantly, suggesting a pathophysiology involving platelet-endothelial interaction. Aspirin was added to the regimen, thus generating 3 patient groups: group 1 received aspirin from the start of DVd-T treatment before the study began (58 patients), group 2 received aspirin after the start of DVd-T treatment and after the study began (26 patients), and group 3 did not receive daily low-dose aspirin during the study (19 patients). Two patients being treated with warfarin for other indications were excluded from the study. The primary end point for this study was the incidence of VTE in the form of either deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Secondary end points were the time to the first VTE, time to the composite end point of death or first VTE, and incidence of bleeding complications.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】After a median follow-up of 24 months, on an intent-to-treat basis, 26 posttreatment VTEs occurred after a median of 90 days, with 19% occurring in group 1, 15% in group 2, and 58% in group 3. Following multivariate time-to-event analysis, aspirin use continued to be associated with lower relative risk of VTE (hazard ratio, 0.22; confidence interval, 0.10–0.47; _P_ <.001) and of the composite end point (hazard ratio, 0.28; confidence interval, 0.15-0.51; _P_ <.001).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Daily low-dose aspirin (81 mg orally) given to patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who were receiving DVd-T reduced the incidence of VTEs without an increase in bleeding complications.\n\n【8】ADP ( adenosine diphosphate ), DVd ( pegylated doxorubicin, vincris-tine, and decreased-frequency dexamethasone ), DVd-T ( DVd plus thalidomide ), DVT ( deep venous thrombosis ), IV ( intravenous ), MM ( multiple myeloma ), SWOG ( Southwest Oncology Group ), VTE ( venous thromboembolic event )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

This condition affects humans worldwide without respect to age, sex, race, or socioeconomic status. Epidemics are known to occur in overcrowded situations and in long-term care facilities. Transmission of the mite is by direct contact or via fomites. The primary symptom of infestation is intense pruritus with nocturnal exacerbation. This is due to type IV immune response to antigens deposited within the epidermis; therefore, the initial manifestations may not be noted until several weeks later. Immunocompetent patients typically have a low mite burden, and definitive diagnosis by demonstration of the mite may be challenging. We present clinical, dermatoscopic, and microscopic findings of infestation to serve as a reminder of the various clues that may be sought to confirm this important diagnosis. Of particular interest is the usefulness of the noninvasive technique, dermatoscopy. With a dermatoscope (essentially a magnifying glass with indwelling light source), one can visualize the mite in vivo and note the characteristic “hang-glider” appearance of the mite and its “jet-plane” trail of a burrow to establish the diagnosis.\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【4】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/mcp.2011.0306</u></u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>© 2011 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

The treatment of acquired angioedema is shaped after that of hereditary angioedema. However, the acquired form is even less prevalent than the hereditary form, precluding large-scale studies. Thus, current experience is mainly based on case reports and case series. It should be kept in mind that acquired angioedema or C1 inhibitor deficiency is immune-mediated. Thus, in contrast to patients with the hereditary form, patients with acquired angioedema may be partially resistant to C1 inhibitor substitution (given as a concentrate or as fresh frozen plasma) because of hypercatabolism. Theoretically, the problem of C1-inhibitor catabolism can be bypassed by products that inhibit the bradykinin pathway. However, to my knowledge, studies on these new agents in acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency are currently nonexistent.\n\n【1】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【3】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/mcp.2009.0625</u></u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>© 2010 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Hospitals in the highest quartile of institutional charge-to-cost ratio were more likely to be safety net, nonteaching, urban, lower surgical volume, smaller, and located outside the Midwest ( _P_ <.001 for each characteristic).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The pricing trends shown herein could indicate some success in cost-containment for surgical episodes of care, although higher hospital charges may be increasingly used to bolster reimbursement from third-party payers and to compensate for escalating costs in other areas.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CCR ( charge-to-cost ratio ), CMS ( Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ), TDABC ( time-driven activity-based costing )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "85146e70-fa03-485b-9196-831ea5310fc0", "title": "Horner syndrome", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Horner syndrome is a condition that affects the face and eye on one side of the body. It is caused by the disruption of a nerve pathway from the brain to the head and neck.\n\n【2】Typically, signs and symptoms of Horner syndrome include decreased pupil size, a drooping eyelid and decreased sweating on the affected side of the face.\n\n【3】Horner syndrome may be the result of another medical problem, such as a stroke, tumor or spinal cord injury. In some cases, no underlying cause can be found. There's no specific treatment for Horner syndrome, but treatment for the underlying cause may restore nerve function.\n\n【4】Horner syndrome is also known as Bernard-Horner syndrome or oculosympathetic palsy.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Horner syndrome usually affects only one side of the face. Common signs and symptoms include:\n\n【7】*   A persistently small pupil (miosis)\n*   A notable difference in pupil size between the two eyes (anisocoria)\n*   Little or delayed opening (dilation) of the affected pupil in dim light\n*   Drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis)\n*   Slight elevation of the lower lid, sometimes called upside-down ptosis\n*   Sunken appearance of the affected eye\n*   Little or no sweating (anhidrosis) on the affected side of the face\n\n【8】Signs and symptoms, particularly ptosis and anhidrosis, may be subtle and difficult to detect.\n\n【9】### Children\n\n【10】Additional signs and symptoms in children with Horner syndrome may include:\n\n【11】*   Lighter iris color in the affected eye of a child under the age of 1\n*   Change in color on the affected side of the face that would typically appear from heat, physical exertion or emotional reactions\n\n【12】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【13】A number of factors, some more serious than others, can cause Horner syndrome. It is important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis.\n\n【14】Get emergency care if signs or symptoms associated with Horner syndrome appear suddenly, appear after a traumatic injury, or are accompanied by other signs or symptoms, such as:\n\n【15】*   Impaired vision\n*   Dizziness\n*   Slurred speech\n*   Difficulty walking\n*   Muscle weakness or lack of muscle control\n*   Severe, sudden headache or neck pain\n\n【16】Causes\n------\n\n【17】Horner syndrome is caused by damage to a certain pathway in the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system regulates heart rate, pupil size, perspiration, blood pressure and other functions that enable you to respond quickly to changes in your environment.\n\n【18】The nerve pathway affected by Horner syndrome is divided into three groups of nerve cells (neurons).\n\n【19】### First-order neurons\n\n【20】This neuron pathway leads from the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, passes through the brainstem and extends into the upper portion of the spinal cord. Problems in this region that can disrupt nerve function related to Horner syndrome include:\n\n【21】*   Stroke\n*   Tumor\n*   Diseases that cause the loss of the protective sheath on neurons (myelin)\n*   Neck trauma\n*   Cyst in the spinal column (syringomyelia)\n\n【22】### Second-order neurons\n\n【23】This neuron path extends from the spinal column, across the upper part of the chest and into the side of the neck. Causes related to nerve damage in this region may include:\n\n【24】*   Lung cancer\n*   Tumor of the myelin sheath (schwannoma)\n*   Damage to the main blood vessel leading from the heart (aorta)\n*   Surgery in the chest cavity\n*   Traumatic injury\n\n【25】### Third-order neurons\n\n【26】This neuron path extends along the side of the neck and leads to facial skin and muscles of the iris and eyelids. Nerve damage in this region may be associated with the following:\n\n【27】*   Damage to the carotid artery along the side of the neck\n*   Damage to the jugular vein along the side of the neck\n*   Tumor or infection near the base of the skull\n*   Migraines\n*   Cluster headaches, a disorder that results in cyclical patterns of severe headaches\n\n【28】### Children\n\n【29】The most common causes of Horner syndrome in children include:\n\n【30】*   Injury to the neck or shoulders during delivery\n*   Defect of the aorta present at birth\n*   Tumor of the hormonal and nervous systems (neuroblastoma)\n\n【31】### Unknown causes\n\n【32】In some cases, the cause of Horner syndrome cannot be identified. This is known as idiopathic Horner syndrome.\n\n【33】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Amaryl\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Glimepiride is used to treat high blood sugar levels caused by type 2 diabetes. It may be used alone, or in combination with insulin or another oral medicine such as metformin. In type 2 diabetes, insulin produced by the pancreas is not able to get sugar into the cells of the body where it can work properly. Using this medicine will help lower blood sugar when it is too high and help restore the way you use food to make energy. Some people can control type 2 diabetes with diet alone or diet and exercise. Following a specially planned diet and exercising will always be important when you have diabetes, even when you are taking medicines. To work properly, the amount of glimepiride you take must be balanced against the amount and type of food you eat and the amount of exercise you do. If you change your diet, your exercise, or both, you will want to test your blood sugar to find out if it is too low. Your doctor will teach you what to do if this happens.\n\n【6】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Tablet\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

However, elderly patients are more likely to have low blood sugar and age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving glimepiride.\n\n【17】### Breastfeeding\n\n【18】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【21】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

Discuss this with your health care team.\n*   Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, patients with diabetes may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur in patients with diabetes during pregnancy.\n*   Travel—Keep your recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.\n*   In case of emergency—There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.\n\n【55】Check with your doctor right away if you start having chest pain or discomfort; nausea; pain or discomfort in the arms, jaw, back, or neck; shortness of breath; sweating; or vomiting while you are using this medicine. These may be symptoms of a serious heart problem, including a heart attack.\n\n【56】Too much glimepiride can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) when it is used under certain conditions. Symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they lead to unconsciousness (passing out). Different people may feel different symptoms of low blood sugar.

Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Glucagon is used in emergency situations when severe symptoms such as seizures (convulsions) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe or needle, and know how to use it. Members of your household also should know how to use it.\n\n【59】This medicine may cause dizziness, drowsiness, or less alert than they are normally. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do other jobs that require you to be alert or able to think well.\n\n【60】This medicine may cause serious types of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. These conditions may be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Stop using this medicine and check with your doctor right away if you have a blistering, peeling, or red skin rash; itching; a large, hive-like swelling on the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, throat, hands, legs, feet, or sex organs; trouble with breathing; or chest tightness while you are using this medicine.\n\n【61】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.

Incidence was adjusted by age and gender to the 2010 US white population. Controls were matched by sex and age to cases at time of diagnosis of melanoma.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】There were 1221 cases of melanoma (33 uveal, 1188 cutaneous). Combined incidence of uveal and cutaneous melanoma per 100,000 person-years varied by gender (male > female), age (older > younger), and time period: 2010 to 2014 (77.9, 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 71.1-84.7) ≈ 2005 to 2009 (78.0, 95% CI, 70.9-85.0) > 2000 to 2004 (42.5, 95% CI, 36.9-48.1, _P_ <.001). TNFa inhibitor prescription was not associated with significantly increased risk of melanoma vs controls (1.06% vs 0.41%, _P_ \\=.06). Immunosuppressive agents, high-dose corticosteroids, and topical immunosuppressants were associated with melanoma (odds ratio \\[OR\\] 1.42 CI, 1.03-1.95, 3.30 CI, 2.44-4.48, and 1.87 CI, 1.06-3.28, respectively). An increased number of patients with uveal melanoma received immune modulating agents vs controls, but this was not statistically significant ( _P_ \\=.36). Autoimmune disease itself was not correlated with melanoma ( _P_ \\=.73).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Exposure to immunosuppressive agents is associated with melanoma. TNFa inhibition and autoimmune disease alone do not significantly increase risk of melanoma. In patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments, physicians should consider monitoring with dilated ophthalmic and full-body skin examinations. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of TNFa inhibitors on development of melanoma, particularly in uveal melanoma.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CI ( confidence interval ), FDA ( food and drug administration (US) ), TNFa ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Scribes increase provider face time with patients and their level of engagement, improve work-life balance, reduce symptoms of burnout, increase documentation quality, and improve productivity and revenue. Projections are that by 2020 there will be 1 scribe for every 9 physicians in the United States, with demand far outpacing supply.\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>*   Gellert G.A.\n*   Ramirez R.\n*   Webster S.L.</u>\n\n【21】The rise of the medical scribe industry: implications for the advancement of electronic health records.\n\n【22】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 2015; 313 : 1315-1316</u></u>\n\n【23】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (90)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【24】The Table summarizes current team documentation models and their key strengths and weaknesses. Team documentation is performed by 4 role types: commercial, staff, learner, and digital. Commercial scribes come from third-party vendors that recruit, train, manage, and contract scribes to paying providers, practices, and health systems. Companies such as ScribeAmerica use this model, and it is designed to be plug-and-play so that the advantage for health systems is that it requires relatively low effort to implement. One disadvantage, though, is that start-up and maintenance costs can be high. Although studies have demonstrated cost-savings with commercial scribes in certain specialties, the data are less clear for lower-earning specialties such as primary care, where it can be challenging to make an economic case for scribes. A variation of this model is the remote scribe, where the provider uses technology, such as Google Glass, that beams a video from inside the examination room to an off-site location where a scribe documents the visit. Companies such as Augmedix use this model, and it shares many of the same characteristics as other commercial scribes.\n\n【25】Table Overview of Team Documentation Models\n\n| Model | Description | Strengths | Weaknesses |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Commercial scribes | Commercial scribes | Commercial scribes | Commercial scribes |\n| In-person | Third-party company recruits, trains, and manages human scribes who work as contractors to a paying health system | Low effort to implement for the health system client | Start-up and maintenance costs can be high for lower-earning specialties; scribes are third-party contractors |\n| Remote | Third-party company provides remote scribe services via technology to a paying health system | Low effort to implement for the health system client | Start-up and maintenance costs can be high for lower-earning specialties; scribes are third-party contractors |\n| Staff scribes | Staff scribes | Staff scribes | Staff scribes |\n| Medical assistants or patient flow coordinators | Nonlicensed team members trained to assist providers with care coordination _plus_ clinical documentation | Team-based care model | Requires sufficient baseline staffing levels; quality of documentation is variable |\n| Nurses or advanced practice providers | Licensed team members (LVN, RN, PA, NP) assist providers with direct patient care _plus_ clinical documentation | Team-based care model; documentation quality is generally high | Expensive business model; potential risk for burnout, especially for PAs and NPs |\n| Learner scribes | Learner scribes | Learner scribes | Learner scribes |\n| Premedical students | Health system recruits, trains, and manages premedical students to serve as scribes in homegrown, tuition-supported programs | Financially self-sustaining and cost neutral; benefits scribes in career goals | High effort to implement and scale; requires faculty leadership and time |\n| Medical students | Medical students tasked with providing documentation support for their clinical preceptors as part of their usual clerkships | No cost to health system; already happening in academic settings | Unreliable scribe coverage given rapid turnover; only works in academic settings |\n| Digital scribes | Digital scribes | Digital scribes | Digital scribes |\n| Artificial intelligence | Devices that listen in on patient-provider conversations and automatically generate notes using automatic speech recognition, natural language processing technologies | Theoretically scalable and potentially cost-effective | New technology with limited functionality; unestablished safety, accuracy, and reliability |\n\n【27】LVN = licensed vocational nurse; NP = nurse practitioner; PA = physician assistant; RN = registered nurse.\n\n【28】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【29】The second category is the staff partner. Some health systems do not want to contract with a third party for clinical documentation and choose instead to build this capacity internally. This model provides extra training for medical assistants or nurses, or uses advanced practice providers such as physician assistants or nurse practitioners, to share the documentation burden with physicians. The advantage here is that it is team-based care, with all the benefits of teamwork that have been shown in the literature.\n\n【30】无关删除-2:<u>*   Sinsky C.A.\n*   Bodenheimer T.</u>\n\n【31】Powering-up primary care teams: advanced team care with in-room support.\n\n【32】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Fam Med._ 2019; 17 : 367-371</u></u>\n\n【33】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (41)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【34】When implemented correctly, this model may also lead to lower overall staffing ratios compared with hiring commercial scribes. Done poorly, some people worry that it may push the burden of burnout onto other care team members, without really creating additional capacity for documentation support.\n\n【35】The third category is the learner scribe or the use of medical students or premedical students who are enrolled in tuition-paying academic programs in which scribing is a component of the service learning.\n\n【36】*   Stanford School of Medicine\n\n【37】Clinical Observation and Medical Transcription Fellowship.\n\n【38】删除3:<u>http://med.stanford.edu/comet</u>\n\n【39】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【40】This is a cost-effective approach, and the scribing experience itself actually benefits the learners as they progress through their medical training. The disadvantage is the natural cycle of turnover for these learners; also, the scalability and generalizability of the model remains unclear outside of academic settings.\n\n【41】The final category is the digital scribe, which leverages the tools of artificial intelligence. With recent advances in automatic speech recognition and natural language processing, it is possible to create machine learning algorithms and devices that can “listen in” on patient-physician encounters and automatically document certain parts of the note. Theoretically this could be scalable and cost-effective. Just in the past several years, more than a dozen companies have ventured into this space, a significant investment by industry that acknowledges both the magnitude of the clinical documentation problem and the size of the potential market.\n\n【42】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lin S.Y.\n*   Mahoney M.R.\n*   Sinsky C.A.</u>\n\n【43】Ten ways artificial intelligence will transform primary care.\n\n【44】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Gen Intern Med._ 2019; 34 : 1626-1630</u></u>\n\n【45】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (65)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【46】However, as with any emerging technology, the safety, accuracy, and reliability of digital scribes must be established first. Patient histories are often nonlinear, circuitous, multilayered, and even self-contradictory. To teach a computer algorithm how to recognize what’s important and what’s not, where to put what type of data, and how to clean up some of those internal inconsistencies is a nontrivial pursuit. It is simply not good enough for a digital scribe to generate a direct voice-to-text transcript of the entire patient-physician visit; in fact, that would make a lousy clinical note.\n\n【47】Furthermore, to realize its full potential, the digital scribe cannot be limited to the data verbalized within the 4 walls of the examination room. Suppose a primary care physician is seeing a patient who was just discharged from the hospital. The provider would need to know what happened during that hospitalization so that he or she can include the relevant data in the note and treatment plan. However, it is unlikely that all the data he or she needs will be verbalized by the patient during the visit, so he or she would need to get the data from the EHR ahead of time. A good human scribe could do this type of pre-charting, so a digital scribe should aim for the same. Also, for many providers, a growing portion of their interactions with patients now are through text messages via the patient health portal, and via telephone and video visits. As virtual visits start to replace traditional in-person visits, the overall balance of data start to shift away from brick-and-mortar clinics and into the digital space. If the digital scribe can access all these data and synthesize it into a cohesive patient narrative at the point of care for the physician, that would be a game changer.\n\n【48】Last, what is the role of patients and families in the future of team documentation? Historically the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have not allowed patients or families to be active participants in the generation of their own notes. If we want to achieve a future with fewer burned-out physicians and better notes—higher quality, less errors, more patient-centered—that patients can actually engage with for their own care,\n\n【49】无关删除-2:<u>*   Anderson M.O.\n*   Jackson S.L.\n*   Oster N.V.\n\n【50】Patients typing their own visit agendas into an electronic medical record: pilot in a safety-net clinic.\n\n【51】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Fam Med._ 2017; 15 : 158-161</u></u>\n\n【52】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (14)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【53】we need to rethink those rules. Fortunately, documentation guidelines are relaxing, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has recently allowed learners and support staff to help physicians write notes. So why not patients and families? After all, what are notes except stories about patients, and shouldn’t patients have the right to be co-authors of their own stories? With technology such as smartphones and smart speakers in the hands of more and more Americans, we have an opportunity to make patient-generated notes a reality, at scale, using the most natural and accessible form of communication available: our voices.\n\n【54】Each of the current team documentation models has its strengths and weaknesses. The future of clinical documentation can be one where physicians partner with patients and families as coequal storytellers in the task of creating the patient narrative using the power of our voices and voice-enabled digital scribes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Mesothelioma treatments are available, but for many people with mesothelioma, a cure isn't possible.\n\n【3】Doctors divide mesothelioma into different types based on what part of the mesothelium is affected. Mesothelioma most often affects the tissue that surrounds the lungs (pleura). This type is called pleural mesothelioma. Other, rarer types of mesothelioma affect tissue in the abdomen (peritoneal mesothelioma), around the heart and around the testicles.\n\n【4】Mesothelioma care at Mayo Clinic\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma vary depending on where the cancer occurs.\n\n【7】**Pleural mesothelioma**, which affects the tissue that surrounds the lungs, causes signs and symptoms that may include:\n\n【8】*   Chest pain\n*   Painful coughing\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Unusual lumps of tissue under the skin on your chest\n*   Unexplained weight loss\n\n【9】**Peritoneal mesothelioma**, which occurs in tissue in the abdomen, causes signs and symptoms that may include:\n\n【10】*   Abdominal pain\n*   Abdominal swelling\n*   Nausea\n*   Unexplained weight loss\n\n【11】#### Other forms of mesothelioma\n\n【12】Signs and symptoms of other types of mesothelioma are unclear, since these forms of the disease are very rare.\n\n【13】Pericardial mesothelioma, which affects tissue that surrounds the heart, can cause signs and symptoms such as breathing difficulty and chest pains.\n\n【14】Mesothelioma of tunica vaginalis, which affects tissue surrounding the testicles, may be first detected as swelling or a mass on a testicle.\n\n【15】### When to see a doctor\n\n【16】See your doctor if you have signs and symptoms that worry you. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma aren't specific to this disease and, due to the rarity of mesothelioma, are more likely to be related to other conditions. If any persistent signs and symptoms seem unusual or bothersome, ask your doctor to evaluate them. Tell your doctor if you've been exposed to asbestos.\n\n【17】Causes\n------\n\n【18】In general, cancer begins when a series of changes (mutations) happens in a cell's DNA. The DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutations tell the cell to grow and multiply out of control. The abnormal cells accumulate and form a tumor.\n\n【19】It isn't clear what causes the initial genetic mutations that lead to mesothelioma, though researchers have identified factors that may increase the risk. It's likely that cancers form because of an interaction between many factors, such as inherited conditions, your environment, your health conditions and your lifestyle choices.\n\n【20】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【21】### Asbestos exposure: The primary risk factor for mesothelioma\n\n【22】Most mesotheliomas are thought to be related to asbestos exposure. Asbestos is a mineral that's found naturally in the environment. Asbestos fibers are strong and resistant to heat, making them useful in a wide variety of applications, such as in insulation, brakes, shingles, flooring and many other products.\n\n【23】When asbestos is broken up, such as during the mining process or when removing asbestos insulation, dust may be created. If the dust is inhaled or swallowed, the asbestos fibers will settle in the lungs or in the stomach, where they can cause irritation that may lead to mesothelioma. Exactly how this happens isn't understood. It can take 20 to 60 years or more for mesothelioma to develop after asbestos exposure.\n\n【24】Most people with asbestos exposure never develop mesothelioma. This indicates that other factors may be involved in determining whether someone gets mesothelioma. For instance, you could inherit a predisposition to cancer or some other condition could increase your risk.\n\n【25】Factors that may increase the risk of mesothelioma include:\n\n【26】*   **Personal history of asbestos exposure.** If you've been directly exposed to asbestos fibers at work or at home, your risk of mesothelioma is greatly increased.\n*   **Living with someone who works with asbestos.** People who are exposed to asbestos may carry the fibers home on their skin and clothing. Exposure to these stray fibers over many years can put others in the home at risk of mesothelioma. People who work with high levels of asbestos can reduce the risk of bringing home asbestos fibers by showering and changing clothes before leaving work.\n*   **A family history of mesothelioma.** If your parent, sibling or child has mesothelioma, you may have an increased risk of this disease.\n*   **Radiation therapy to the chest.** If you had radiation therapy for cancer in your chest, you might have an increased risk of mesothelioma.\n\n【27】Complications\n-------------\n\n【28】As pleural mesothelioma spreads in the chest, it puts pressure on the structures in that area. This can cause complications, such as:\n\n【29】*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Chest pain\n*   Difficulty swallowing\n*   Pain caused by pressure on the nerves and spinal cord\n*   Accumulation of fluid in the chest (pleural effusion), which can compress the lung nearby and make breathing difficult\n\n【30】Prevention\n----------\n\n【31】Reducing your exposure to asbestos may lower your risk of mesothelioma.\n\n【32】### Find out whether you work with asbestos\n\n【33】Most people with mesothelioma were exposed to the asbestos fibers at work. Workers who may encounter asbestos fibers include:\n\n【34】*   Asbestos miners\n*   Electricians\n*   Plumbers\n*   Pipefitters\n*   Insulators\n*   Shipyard workers\n*   Demolition workers\n*   Brake mechanics\n*   Selected military personnel\n*   Home remodelers\n\n【35】Ask your employer whether you have a risk of asbestos exposure on the job.\n\n【36】### Follow your employer's safety regulations\n\n【37】Follow all safety precautions in your workplace, such as wearing protective equipment. You may also be required to shower and change out of your work clothes before taking a lunch break or going home. Talk to your doctor about other precautions you can take to protect yourself from asbestos exposure.\n\n【38】### Be safe around asbestos in your home\n\n【39】Older homes and buildings may contain asbestos. In many cases, it's more dangerous to remove the asbestos than it is to leave it intact. Breaking up asbestos may cause fibers to become airborne, where they can be inhaled. Consult experts trained to detect asbestos in your home. These experts may test the air in your home to determine whether the asbestos is a risk to your health. Don't attempt to remove asbestos from your home — hire a qualified expert.\n\n【40】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Women and non-White hospitalizations had higher rates of device related complications, longer lengths of in-hospital stay, and higher hospitalization costs compared with men and White race, respectively (all _P_ <.01).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Among HCM hospitalizations, ICD devices are underused in women and racial minorities independent of demographics, hospital characteristics, and comorbidities. Women and racial minorities also had higher rates of complications and greater resource use compared with men and those belonging to the White race, respectively.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】HCM ( hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ), HCUP ( Healthcare Quality and Utilization Project ), ICD ( implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ), NIS ( National Inpatient Sample ), OR ( odds ratio )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Twinject\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Epinephrine injection is used for emergency treatment of severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) to insect bites or stings, medicines, foods, or other substances. It is also used to treat anaphylaxis caused by unknown substances or triggered by exercise.\n\n【6】Epinephrine injection is also used to increase blood pressure in adult patients with hypotension (low blood pressure) and septic shock.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Solution\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of epinephrine injection in children. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children weighing less than 15 kilograms (kg) using Symjepi™ and in children using Adrenalin® to treat low blood pressure with septic shock.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Auvi-Q® injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects, which may require caution in patients receiving this medicine.\n\n【18】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Adrenalin®, Epipen®, or Symjepi™ in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine and more likely to have unwanted effects, which may require caution in patients receiving this medicine.\n\n【19】No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of epinephrine injection in geriatric patients. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related heart disease which may require caution in patients receiving epinephrine injection.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【29】*   Labetalol\n*   Metoprolol\n\n【30】### Other Interactions\n\n【31】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【32】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【33】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【34】*   Angina pectoris (severe chest pain) or\n*   Asthma or\n*   Blood vessel problems or\n*   Depression, history of or\n*   Diabetes or\n*   Heart attack or\n*   Heart disease (eg, cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, organic heart disease) or\n*   Heart rhythm problems (eg, arrhythmia) or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) or\n*   Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) or\n*   Kidney disease or\n*   Parkinson's disease—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【35】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【36】Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.\n\n【37】A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a medical facility to treat hypotension with septic shock. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins.\n\n【38】If you are using this medicine at home, make sure you or any of your family members understand exactly how to give them. Also, tell your doctor if you or your caregiver has severe arthritis of the hands. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.\n\n【39】This medicine is injected under the skin or into the muscle of your outer thigh only. Do not inject this medicine into a vein, into the muscle of your buttocks, or into your fingers, toes, hands, or feet. To do so, may increase the chance of having serious side effects.\n\n【40】This medicine comes with patient information and instructions leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Read it again each time you refill your prescription in case there is new information. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\n【41】This medicine comes in 3 forms:an autoinjector syringe and needle kit, a prefilled syringe, or a vial. This contains the correct dose of medicine your doctor has prescribed.\n\n【42】This medicine comes with an autoinjector trainer and a separate trainer instructions for use. Be sure to practice first with your autoinjector trainer before an allergy emergency happens to make sure you are ready to use the real Auvi-Q®, Adrenaclick®, EpiPen®, or EpiPen Jr® autoinjector in an actual emergency. The autoinjector trainer has a grey color (for Auvi-Q®, EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr®) or beige color (for Adrenaclick®) and does not contain any medicine or needle.\n\n【43】Inspect the autoinjector from time to time before needing it to ensure the blue safety release (EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr®) is not raised and that the autoinjector can be easily remove from the carrier tube.\n\n【44】Do not remove the blue safety release (EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr®), the gray end caps (Adrenaclick®), or the red safety guard (Auvi-Q®) on the autoinjector until you are ready to use it. Do not put your thumb, fingers, or hand over the black base (Auvi-Q®), orange (EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr®), or red (Adrenaclick®) tip of the autoinjector or over the needle of the Symjepi® prefilled syringe. This is to avoid an accidental injection.\n\n【45】If you are about to use the autoinjector, pull up straight the blue safety release (EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr®) with one hand and hold the pen with the other hand. Do not flip the blue safety release off using the thumb or by pulling it sideways, or by bending and twisting it. This may activate the device by accident (a \"click is heard, the orange needle is extended, and the window is blocked), making it unusable in case of an emergency. Push the needle end (orange end of the autoinjector) firmly against the outer thigh until it \"clicks\". This signals that the injection has started. The autoinjector needs to stay in place for a minimum of 3 seconds following activation.\n\n【46】If you use the Symjepi™ prefilled syringe:\n\n【47】*   Do not remove the needle cap until you are ready to use it.\n*   Slowly inject the syringe into the thigh while sitting down.\n*   Push the plunger all the way down until you hear a \"clicking\" sound. Hold it for 2 seconds.\n*   Remove the syringe and massage the area for 10 seconds.\n*   Call your medical provider right away after injection.\n*   You may inject the medicine through your clothing, if you need to.\n\n【48】You may need to use more than one injection if your allergic reaction does not get better after the first shot. If more than 2 injections are needed for 1 reaction, however, those should be given only under medical supervision.\n\n【49】If you are using the epinephrine injection in a child, make sure to hold his leg firmly in place and limit movement before and during an injection.\n\n【50】Carry this medicine with you at all times for emergency use in case you have a severe allergic reaction.\n\n【51】Check the injection kits regularly to make sure that the liquid has not changed its color. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use this medicine if the liquid has changed its color (pinkish or brown in color), has become cloudy, or if there are particles in it.\n\n【52】Do not reuse the remaining portion of the medicine that is left in the autoinjector, prefilled syringe, or vial. Throw away the autoinjector, prefilled syringe, or vial after you have used it.\n\n【53】### Dosing\n\n【54】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【55】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【56】*   For injection dosage form (solution):\n    *   For allergic reactions:\n        *   Adrenaclick®, Auvi-q®, Epipen®, Epipen Jr®, Twinject®:\n            *   Adults and children weighing 30 kilograms (kg) or more—0.3 milligram (mg) injected under the skin or into the muscle of your thigh.\n            *   Children weighing 15 to 30 kg—0.15 mg injected under the skin or into the muscle of your thigh.\n            *   Children weighing 7.5 to 15 kg—0.1 mg injected under the skin or into the muscle of your thigh.\n            *   Children weighing less than 7.5 kg—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n        *   Adrenalin®:\n            *   Adults and children weighing 30 kilograms (kg) or more—0.3 to 0.5 milligram (mg) injected under the skin or into the muscle of your thigh. You may repeat the injection every 5 to 10 minutes as needed.\n            *   Children weighing less than 30 kg—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The dose is 0.01 mg per kg of body weight injected under the skin or into the muscle of your thigh. You may repeat the injection every 5 to 10 minutes as needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 0.3 mg per injection.\n        *   Symjepi™:\n            *   Adults and children weighing 30 kilograms (kg) or more—0.3 milligrams (mg) injected under the skin or into the muscle of your thigh.\n            *   Children weighing 15 to 30 kg—0.15 mg injected under the skin or into the muscle of your thigh.\n            *   Children weighing less than 15 kg—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【57】### Storage\n\n【58】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【59】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【60】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【61】Store the injection kits at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Do not store the medicine in the refrigerator or freezer, or into your vehicle's glove box.\n\n【62】Keep the autoinjector or prefilled syringe in its carrier tube or case to protect from damage. However, this tube or case is not waterproof. If you accidentally drop it, check for damage or leakage.\n\n【63】Throw away expired, unwanted, or unused EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr® in an FDA-cleared sharps container. Do not throw it away in the trash bin.\n\n【64】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【65】Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away, or go to an emergency room as soon as possible, even if you feel better after using this medicine.\n\n【66】Tell your doctor if you develop symptoms of an infection (eg, redness that does not go away, swelling, warmth, or tenderness) at the injection site.\n\n【67】This medicine may affect blood sugar levels. If you notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests or if you have any questions, check with your doctor.\n\n【68】Do not inject this medicine into your buttocks. Epinephrine may not work as well and may cause gas gangrene. Check with your doctor or go to the hospital emergency room right away to get additional treatment.\n\n【69】Do not inject this medicine into your hands or feet. There is already less blood flow to the hands and feet, and epinephrine could make that worse and cause damage to these tissues. If you accidentally inject epinephrine into your hands or feet, check with your doctor or go to the hospital emergency room right away.\n\n【70】This medicine may worsen the condition of patients with heart disease or heart rhythm problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain or tightness, decreased urine output, dilated neck veins, extreme fatigue, irregular heartbeat, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, trouble breathing, or weight gain. You might also feel dizzy or faint, or you might have a fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat.\n\n【71】This medicine may cause pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs). Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain, difficult, fast, or noisy breathing, blue lips and fingernails, pale skin, increased sweating, coughing that sometimes produces a pink frothy sputum, or swelling in the legs and ankles.\n\n【72】Check with your doctor right away if you have bloody urine, a decrease in frequency or amount of urine, an increase in blood pressure, increased thirst, loss of appetite, lower back or side pain, nausea, swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs, trouble breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting, or weight gain. These could be symptoms of a serious kidney problem.\n\n【73】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【74】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【75】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【76】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【77】#### Incidence not known\n\n【78】1.  Abnormal or decreased touch sensation\n2.  anxiety\n3.  arm, back, or jaw pain\n4.  bleeding, blistering, burning, coldness, discoloration of the skin, feeling of pressure, hives, infection, inflammation, itching, lumps, numbness, pain, rash, redness, scarring, soreness, stinging, swelling, tenderness, tingling, ulceration, or warmth at the injection site\n5.  blurred vision\n6.  chest pain, tightness, heaviness, or discomfort\n7.  cold, pale, or bluish color of the skin of the fingers or toes\n8.  confusion\n9.  difficulty in speaking\n10.  dizziness\n11.  double vision\n12.  fainting\n13.  fast, slow, irregular, pounding, or racing heartbeat or pulse\n14.  headache\n15.  inability to move the arms, legs, or facial muscles\n16.  inability to speak\n17.  nausea\n18.  numbness, tingling, or pain in the fingers\n19.  paleness of the skin\n20.  pounding in the ears\n21.  restlessness\n22.  shakiness in the legs, arms, hands, or feet\n23.  slow speech\n24.  sweating\n25.  trembling or shaking of the hands or feet\n26.  trouble breathing\n27.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n28.  vomiting\n\n【79】Get emergency help immediately if any of the following symptoms of overdose occur:\n\n【80】#### Symptoms of overdose\n\n【81】1.  Agitation\n2.  coldness of the skin\n3.  confusion\n4.  decreased awareness or responsiveness\n5.  decreased urine output\n6.  depression\n7.  drowsiness\n8.  hostility\n9.  irritability\n10.  lightheadedness\n11.  loss of consciousness\n12.  muscle twitching\n13.  rapid weight gain\n14.  rapid, deep breathing\n15.  seizures\n16.  severe sleepiness\n17.  stomach cramps\n18.  swelling of the face, ankles, or hands\n19.  unusual drowsiness, dullness, or feeling of sluggishness\n\n【82】无关删除-1:<u>Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients.

Liver transplant may also be a treatment option in rare cases of sudden failure of a previously healthy liver.\n\n【5】The number of people waiting for a liver transplant greatly exceeds the number of available deceased-donor livers.\n\n【6】Receiving a portion of a liver from a living donor is an alternative to waiting for a deceased-donor liver to become available. Living-donor liver transplant is possible because the human liver regenerates and returns to its normal size shortly after surgical removal of part of the organ.\n\n【7】In 2018, about 8,200 liver transplants were performed in the U.S. among adults and children. Of those, about 390 involved livers from living donors. At the same time, about 12,800 people were registered on the waiting list for a liver transplant.\n\n【8】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【9】Liver transplant is a treatment option for some people with liver cancer and for people with liver failure whose condition can't be controlled with other treatments.\n\n【10】Liver failure may happen quickly or over a long period of time. Liver failure that occurs quickly, in a matter of weeks, is called acute liver failure. Acute liver failure is an uncommon condition that is usually the result of complications from certain medications.\n\n【11】Although a liver transplant may treat acute liver failure, it is more often used to treat chronic liver failure. Chronic liver failure occurs slowly over months and years.\n\n【12】Chronic liver failure may be caused by a variety of conditions. The most common cause of chronic liver failure is scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). When cirrhosis occurs, scar tissue replaces typical liver tissue and the liver doesn't function properly. Cirrhosis is the most frequent reason for a liver transplant.\n\n【13】Major causes of cirrhosis leading to liver failure and liver transplant include:\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hepatitis B and C.\n*   Alcoholic liver disease, which causes damage to the liver due to excessive alcohol consumption.\n*   Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition in which fat builds up in the liver, causing inflammation or liver cell damage.\n*   Genetic diseases affecting the liver. They include hemochromatosis, which causes excessive iron buildup in the liver, and Wilson's disease, which causes excessive copper buildup in the liver.\n*   Diseases that affect the tubes that carry bile away from the liver (bile ducts). They include primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and biliary atresia. Biliary atresia is the most common reason for liver transplant among children.</u>\n\n【15】Liver transplant may also treat certain cancers that originate in the liver.\n\n【16】Risks\n-----\n\n【17】### Complications of the procedure\n\n【18】Liver transplant surgery carries a risk of significant complications. There are risks associated with the procedure itself and with the drugs necessary to prevent rejection of the donor liver after the transplant.\n\n【19】Risks associated with the procedure include:\n\n【20】*   Bile duct complications, including bile duct leaks or shrinking of the bile ducts\n*   Bleeding\n*   Blood clots\n*   Failure of the donated liver\n*   Infection\n*   Rejection of the donated liver\n*   Mental confusion or seizures\n\n【21】Long-term complications may also include the liver disease returning in the transplanted liver.\n\n【22】### Anti-rejection medication side effects\n\n【23】After a liver transplant, you'll take medications for the rest of your life to help prevent your body from rejecting the donated liver. These anti-rejection medications can cause a variety of side effects, including:\n\n【24】*   Bone thinning\n*   Diabetes\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Headaches\n*   High blood pressure\n*   High cholesterol\n\n【25】Because anti-rejection drugs work by suppressing the immune system, they also increase risk of infection. Your doctor may give you medications to help you fight infections.\n\n【26】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【27】### Choosing a transplant center\n\n【28】If your doctor recommends a liver transplant, you may be referred to a transplant center. You're also free to select a transplant center on your own or choose a center from your insurance company's list of preferred providers.\n\n【29】When you're considering transplant centers, you may want to:\n\n【30】*   Learn about the number and type of transplants the center performs each year.\n*   Ask about the transplant center's liver transplant survival rates.\n*   Compare transplant center statistics through the database maintained by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients.\n*   Understand the costs that will be incurred before, during and after your transplant. Costs will include tests, organ procurement, surgery, hospital stays, and transportation to and from the center for the procedure and follow-up appointments.\n*   Consider additional services provided by the transplant center, such as coordinating support groups, assisting with travel arrangements, helping with local housing for your recovery period and offering referrals to other resources.\n*   Assess the center's commitment to keeping up with the latest transplant technology and techniques, which indicates that the program is growing.\n\n【31】After you've selected a transplant center, you'll need an evaluation to determine whether you meet the center's eligibility requirements. Each transplant center has its own eligibility criteria. If you aren't accepted at one transplant center, you may undergo evaluation at another center.\n\n【32】The goals of the evaluation process are to determine whether you:\n\n【33】*   Are healthy enough to have surgery and can tolerate lifelong post-transplant medications\n*   Have any medical conditions that would interfere with transplant success\n*   Are willing and able to take medications as directed and follow the suggestions of the transplant team\n\n【34】Specific tests, procedures and consultations you may undergo include:\n\n【35】*   **Laboratory tests,** such as blood and urine tests to assess the health of your organs, including your liver\n*   **Imaging tests,** such as an ultrasound of your liver\n*   **Heart tests** to determine the health of your cardiovascular system\n*   **A general health exam,** including routine cancer screening tests, to evaluate your overall health and to check for any other illnesses that may impact the success of your transplant\n\n【36】Your evaluation may also include:\n\n【37】*   **Nutrition counseling with dietitians** who assess your diet and make recommendations on how to plan healthy meals before and after your transplant\n*   **Psychological evaluation** to assess and treat any underlying issues, such as depression or anxiety, and determine whether you fully understand the risks of a liver transplant\n*   **Meetings with social workers** who assess your support network to determine whether you have friends or family to help care for you after transplant\n*   **Addiction counseling** to help people who are having difficulty stopping their use of alcohol, drugs or tobacco\n*   **Financial counseling** to help you understand the cost of a transplant and post-transplant care and to determine what costs are covered by your insurance\n\n【38】Once these tests and consultations are completed, the transplant center's selection committee meets to discuss your situation. The committee determines whether a liver transplant is the best treatment for you and whether you're healthy enough to undergo a transplant.\n\n【39】If the answer to both questions is yes, then you're placed on the liver transplant waiting list.\n\n【40】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【41】### Before the procedure\n\n【42】#### Being placed on the waiting list\n\n【43】Doctors will use the results of your liver function tests and other factors to assess the severity of your illness, how urgently you need a transplant and your place on the liver transplant waiting list.\n\n【44】Transplant waiting list priority is determined by a scoring system. Doctors use the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score for adults and Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) score for children younger than age 12.\n\n【45】Your doctor will use a specific formula to determine your MELD score, which can range from 6 to 40. The score estimates the risk of death within 90 days without a transplant. A high MELD score indicates the urgent need of a transplant.\n\n【46】As deceased-donor organs become available, they are classified by blood type and allocated according to MELD scores. People with higher MELD scores are generally offered donated livers first. Time spent on the liver transplant waiting list is used to break ties among people with the same MELD scores and blood types.\n\n【47】Some liver conditions, such as liver cancer, may not result in a person getting a high MELD score. The transplant center can request additional MELD points for people with specific diseases if they meet defined exception criteria.\n\n【48】In addition, adults with acute liver failure are exempted from the MELD\\-based donor organ prioritization system and may be placed higher on the transplant waiting list according to the severity of their disease.\n\n【49】#### Waiting for a new liver\n\n【50】The wait for a donor liver can vary greatly. Some people wait days, while others wait months or may never receive a deceased-donor liver.\n\n【51】As you wait for a new liver, your doctor will treat the complications of your liver failure to make you as comfortable as possible.\n\n【52】Complications of end-stage liver failure are serious, and you may be frequently hospitalized. If your liver deteriorates, your MELD score is updated.\n\n【53】#### Living liver donors\n\n【54】A small percentage of liver transplants each year are from living donors. In these cases, surgeons transplant a small portion of a liver from a healthy, living person. Living-donor liver transplants were initially used for children needing liver transplants because suitable deceased-donor organs are scarce. Now, it is also an option for adults who have end-stage liver disease.\n\n【55】Living-donor liver transplants offer an alternative to waiting for a deceased-donor liver and allow the organ recipient to avoid possible health complications of waiting for a transplant. The first step is to identify a living donor who is healthy and able to safely undergo a major surgical procedure. The donor's age, blood type and organ size also are critical considerations in determining whether you and the donor are a match for living-donor liver transplant.\n\n【56】Most living liver donors are close family members or friends of the liver transplant candidate. If you have a family member or friend who is willing to donate part of his or her liver to you, talk to your transplant team about this option.\n\n【57】Living-donor transplants have good results, just as transplants using livers from deceased donors. But finding a living donor may be difficult. Living liver donors go through extensive evaluation to ensure they are a match with the organ recipient and to assess their physical and mental health. The surgery also carries significant risks for the donor.\n\n【58】Your transplant team can discuss the benefits and risks with you and the potential donor.\n\n【59】#### Domino liver transplant\n\n【60】Another, less common, type of living-donor liver transplant is called a domino liver transplant. In a domino liver transplant, you receive a liver from a living donor who has a disease called familial amyloidosis. Familial amyloidosis is a very rare disorder in which an abnormal protein accumulates and eventually damages the body's internal organs.\n\n【61】In this procedure, the donor with familial amyloidosis receives a liver transplant to treat his or her condition. Then, the donor gives his or her liver to you in a domino liver transplant because the liver still functions well. You may eventually develop symptoms of amyloidosis, but these symptoms usually take decades to develop.\n\n【62】Doctors usually select recipients who are 55 years old or older and who aren't expected to develop symptoms before the end of their natural life expectancy. After the transplant, doctors monitor for signs of the condition.\n\n【63】Doctors will evaluate you to determine if you may be a candidate for a domino liver transplant or if another treatment option would be more appropriate for your condition.\n\n【64】#### Staying healthy\n\n【65】Whether you're waiting for a donated liver or your transplant surgery is already scheduled, work to stay healthy. Being healthy and as active as you're able can make it more likely you'll be ready for the transplant surgery when the time comes. It may also help speed your recovery from surgery. Work to:\n\n【66】*   Take your medications as prescribed\n*   Follow your diet and exercise guidelines\n*   Keep all appointments with your health care team\n*   Stay involved in healthy activities, including relaxing and spending time with family and friends\n\n【67】Stay in touch with your transplant team and let them know of any significant changes in your health. If you're waiting for a donated liver, make sure the transplant team knows how to reach you at all times. Keep your packed hospital bag ready and make arrangements for transportation to the transplant center in advance.\n\n【68】### During the procedure\n\n【69】#### Deceased-donor liver transplant\n\n【70】If you're notified that a liver from a deceased donor is available, you'll be asked to come to the hospital immediately. Your health care team will admit you to the hospital, and you'll undergo an exam to make sure you're healthy enough for the surgery.\n\n【71】Liver transplant surgery is done using general anesthesia, so you'll be in a sleep-like state during the procedure.\n\n【72】The transplant surgeon makes a long incision across your stomach to access your liver. The location and size of your incision varies according to your surgeon's approach and your own anatomy.\n\n【73】The surgeon removes your liver and places the donor liver in your body. Then the surgeon connects your blood vessels and bile ducts to the donor liver. Surgery can take up to 12 hours, depending on your situation.\n\n【74】Once your new liver is in place, the surgeon uses stitches and staples to close the surgical incision. You're then taken to the intensive care unit to begin recovery.\n\n【75】#### Living-donor liver transplant\n\n【76】If you're receiving a liver transplant from a living donor, your surgery will be scheduled in advance.\n\n【77】Surgeons first operate on the donor, removing the portion of the liver for transplant. Then surgeons remove your liver and place the donated liver portion in your body. They then connect your blood vessels and bile ducts to the new liver.\n\n【78】The transplanted liver portion in your body and the portion left behind in the donor's body regenerate rapidly, reaching normal volume within several weeks.\n\n【79】### After the procedure\n\n【80】#### After a liver transplant\n\n【81】After your liver transplant, you can expect to:\n\n【82】*   **Possibly stay in the intensive care unit for a few days.** Doctors and nurses will monitor your condition to watch for signs of complications. They'll also test your liver function frequently for signs that your new liver is working.\n*   **Spend 5 to 10 days in the hospital.** Once you're stable, you're taken to a transplant recovery area to continue recuperating.\n*   **Have frequent checkups as you continue recovering at home.** Your transplant team designs a checkup schedule for you. You may undergo blood tests a few times each week at first and then less often over time.\n*   **Take medications for the rest of your life.** You'll take a number of medications after your liver transplant. You'll need to continue taking many of them for the rest of your life. Drugs called immunosuppressants help keep your immune system from attacking your new liver. Other drugs help reduce the risk of other complications after your transplant.\n\n【83】Expect six months or more of recovery time before you'll feel fully healed after your liver transplant surgery. You may be able to resume normal activities or go back to work a few months after surgery. How long it takes you to recover may depend on how ill you were before your liver transplant.\n\n【84】Results\n-------\n\n【85】### Liver transplant survival rates\n\n【86】Your chances of a successful liver transplant and long-term survival depend on your particular situation.\n\n【87】In general, about 75% of people who undergo liver transplant live for at least five years. That means that for every 100 people who receive a liver transplant for any reason, about 75 will live for five years and 25 will die within five years.\n\n【88】People who receive a liver from a living donor often have better short-term survival rates than those who receive a deceased-donor liver. But comparing long-term results is difficult because people who have a living donor usually have a shorter wait for a transplant and aren't as sick as those who receive a deceased-donor liver.\n\n【89】Survival rates among liver transplant recipients also vary among U.S. transplant centers and can be found online at the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients.\n\n【90】Coping and Support\n------------------\n\n【91】It's normal to feel anxious or overwhelmed while waiting for a transplant or to have fears about rejection, returning to work or other issues after a transplant. Seeking the support of friends and family members can help you cope during this stressful time.\n\n【92】Your transplant team also can assist you with other useful resources and coping strategies throughout the transplant process, such as:\n\n【93】*   **Joining a support group for transplant recipients.** Talking with others who have shared your experience can ease fears and anxiety.\n*   **Sharing your experiences on social media.** Social media is another way to engage with others who have had a similar experience, which may help you adjust to your changing situation.\n*   **Finding rehabilitation services.** If you're returning to work, your social worker may be able to connect you with rehabilitation services provided by your home state's department of vocational rehabilitation.\n*   **Setting realistic goals and expectations.** Recognize that life after transplant may not be exactly the same as life before transplant. Having realistic expectations about results and recovery time can help reduce stress.\n*   **Educating yourself.** Learn as much as you can about your procedure and ask questions about things you don't understand. Knowledge is empowering.\n\n【94】Diet and nutrition\n------------------\n\n【95】After your liver transplant, it is especially important to eat a well-balanced diet to help you recover and keep your liver healthy.\n\n【96】Your transplant team includes a nutrition specialist (dietitian) who can discuss your nutrition and diet needs and answer any questions you have after your transplant.\n\n【97】In general, your diet after liver transplant should be low in salt, cholesterol, fat and sugar.\n\n【98】To prevent damaging your new liver, it's important to avoid alcohol. Do not drink alcoholic beverages or use alcohol in cooking.\n\n【99】Your dietitian will also provide you with several healthy food options and ideas to use in your nutrition plan. Your dietitian's recommendations may include:\n\n【100】*   Eating at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day\n*   Avoiding grapefruit and grapefruit juice because of their effect on a group of immunosuppression medications\n*   Having enough fiber in your daily diet\n*   Choosing whole-grain foods over processed ones\n*   Drinking low-fat or fat-free dairy products, which is important to maintain optimal calcium and phosphorus levels\n\n【101】Your dietitian may also recommend:\n\n【102】*   Eating lean meats, poultry and fish\n*   Following food safety guidelines\n*   Staying hydrated by drinking adequate water and other fluids each day\n\n【103】Exercise\n--------\n\n【104】Exercise and physical activity should be a regular part of your life after a liver transplant to continue improving your overall physical and mental health.\n\n【105】Soon after your transplant, you should walk as much as you can. Then, depending on your progress, you can start incorporating more physical activity into your daily life.\n\n【106】Walking, bicycling, swimming, low-impact strength training and other physical activities you enjoy can all be a part of a healthy, active lifestyle after transplant. But be sure to check in with your transplant team before starting or changing your post-transplant exercise routine.\n\n【107】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "ab556be0-c7ee-44ac-866c-3fdc0f8de896", "title": "Porphyria", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Porphyria (por-FEAR-e-uh) refers to a group of rare disorders that result from a buildup of natural chemicals called porphyrins in the body. Porphyrins are needed to make heme, a part of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues.\n\n【2】Eight enzymes are needed to change porphyrins into heme. Without enough of any of these enzymes, porphyrins build up in the body. High levels of porphyrins can cause major problems, mainly in the nervous system and skin.\n\n【3】There are two general types of porphyrias. Acute porphyrias start rapidly and mainly affect the nervous system. Cutaneous porphyrias mainly affect the skin. A few types of porphyrias affect both the nervous system and the skin.\n\n【4】Symptoms of porphyria vary, depending on the specific type of porphyria and how severe it is. Porphyria is usually inherited. One or both parents pass along a changed gene to their child.\n\n【5】Although porphyria can't be cured, medicines and certain lifestyle changes may help you manage it. Treatment for symptoms depends on the type of porphyria you have.\n\n【6】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【7】Symptoms can vary widely by type of porphyria and in how severe the symptoms are. Symptoms also can vary among people with the condition. Some people with a gene change that causes porphyria never have any symptoms.\n\n【8】### Acute porphyrias\n\n【9】Acute porphyrias include forms of the disease that usually cause nervous system symptoms. A few forms also can affect the skin. Symptoms appear quickly and can be severe. Symptoms may last hours, days or weeks.\n\n【10】The most common form of acute porphyria is called acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP may last hours or days. Intermittent means that the symptoms may go away but return later. When the symptoms occur they are sometimes called attacks.\n\n【11】Symptoms of acute porphyrias may include:\n\n【12】*   Severe pain in the belly, chest, legs or back.\n*   Digestive problems, such as constipation, nausea and vomiting.\n*   Muscle pain, tingling, numbness, weakness or paralysis.\n*   Red or brown urine.\n*   Mental changes, such as anxiety, hallucinations or mental confusion.\n*   Rapid or irregular heartbeats you can feel, called palpitations.\n*   Breathing problems.\n*   High blood pressure.\n*   Seizures.\n\n【13】### Cutaneous porphyrias\n\n【14】Cutaneous porphyrias include forms of the disease that cause skin symptoms as a result of sensitivity to sunlight. These forms usually don't affect the nervous system. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common type of all the porphyrias.\n\n【15】Sun exposure may cause:\n\n【16】*   Sensitivity to the sun and sometimes artificial light, causing burning pain in the skin.\n*   Sudden painful skin redness and swelling.\n*   Blisters on exposed skin, usually the hands, arms and face.\n*   Fragile thin skin with changes in skin color.\n*   Itching.\n*   Too much hair growth in affected areas.\n*   Red or brown urine.\n\n【17】Erythropoietic protoporphyria (uh-rith-roe-poi-ET-ik pro-toe-por-FEAR-e-uh), also called EPP, is a rare type of cutaneous porphyria. It's the most common childhood porphyria. Sun or artificial light exposure quickly results in painful skin burning, irritation and swelling. Small bumps and blisters also appear. Repeated exposures can cause thick, leathery skin and scarring.\n\n【18】### When to see a doctor\n\n【19】Many symptoms of porphyria are like those of other, more common conditions. This can make it difficult to know if you're having an attack of porphyria. If you have symptoms that could be porphyria, get medical attention. Prompt treatment is important.\n\n【20】Causes\n------\n\n【21】All types of porphyria involve a problem making heme. Heme is a part of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. Heme also plays a role in clearing drugs and hormones from the body.\n\n【22】Heme is made in the bone marrow and liver. This process involves eight different enzymes that turn porphyrins into heme. A shortage or change in any of these enzymes causes a buildup of porphyrins. Which enzyme is affected determines the type of porphyria.\n\n【23】In cutaneous porphyrias, porphyrins build up in the skin. When exposed to sunlight, they cause symptoms. In acute porphyrias, the buildup affects the nervous system, causing symptoms.\n\n【24】### Genetic forms\n\n【25】Most forms of porphyria are caused by a gene change passed down from one or both parents. Porphyria can occur if you inherit:\n\n【26】*   A changed gene from one of your parents (autosomal dominant pattern).\n*   Changed genes from both parents (autosomal recessive pattern).\n\n【27】Just because you inherit a gene or genes that can cause porphyria doesn't mean that you'll have symptoms. You might never have symptoms. This also is the case for most carriers of the changed genes.\n\n【28】### Acquired forms\n\n【29】Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) usually is not passed down in families. In PCT, certain triggers can cause a buildup of porphyrins that may cause symptoms. Examples of triggers include:\n\n【30】无关删除-2:<u>*   Too much iron in the body, often due to a condition called hemochromatosis, which is caused by a gene change.\n*   Viral infections, such as HIV or hepatitis C.\n*   Heavy alcohol use.\n*   Smoking.\n*   Hormones changes during the menstrual period.</u>\n\n【31】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【32】In addition to genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors may trigger symptoms in porphyria. When exposed to the trigger, the body's demand for heme production increases. This overwhelms the low level of a needed enzyme, setting in motion a process that causes a buildup of porphyrins.\n\n【33】Examples of triggers include:\n\n【34】*   Exposure to sunlight.\n*   Certain medicines, for example, birth control pills, sedatives and barbiturates.\n*   Recreational or illicit drugs.\n*   Dieting or fasting.\n*   Smoking.\n*   Physical stress, such as infections or other illnesses or surgery.\n*   Emotional stress.\n*   Alcohol use.\n*   Hormone changes during the menstrual period.\n\n【35】Complications\n-------------\n\n【36】Possible complications depend on the form of porphyria:\n\n【37】*   **Acute porphyrias** can be life-threatening if an attack isn't promptly treated. During an attack, you may experience dehydration from loss of fluids, breathing problems, seizures or high blood pressure. You may need a stay in the hospital for treatment. Long-term complications with repeat acute attacks may include long-term pain, chronic kidney failure, liver damage or liver cancer.\n*   **Cutaneous porphyrias** can result in permanent skin damage. And the skin blisters can become infected. When your skin heals after symptoms, it may have a changed appearance and coloring, be fragile and slow to heal, or leave scars. Cutaneous porphyrias also increase the risk of liver damage or liver cancer.\n\n【38】In rare cases, a bone marrow transplant or liver transplant may be needed.\n\n【39】Prevention\n----------\n\n【40】Although there's no way to prevent porphyria, if you have the condition, avoid triggers to help prevent symptoms.\n\n【41】Because porphyria is usually an inherited disorder, your siblings and other family members may want to consider genetic testing to determine if they have the condition. Genetic counseling is important to help understand test results and risks.\n\n【42】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "5699239e-146b-4271-a2c5-44fd68b3fd65", "title": "Alglucerase (Intravenous Route)", "text": "【0】Alglucerase (Intravenous Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Ceredase\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Alglucerase is used to treat Gaucher's disease caused by the lack of a certain enzyme, glucocerebrosidase, in the body. This enzyme is necessary for your body to use fats.\n\n【6】Alglucerase is made from human placenta tissue that is collected after a baby is born. Before it is used, the tissue is tested for hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is similar to the testing that a blood bank does on donated blood before it is given to anyone else.\n\n【7】Alglucerase is available with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】Before Using\n------------\n\n【9】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【10】### Allergies\n\n【11】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【12】### Pediatric\n\n【13】This medicine has been tested in a limited number of children. In effective doses, the medicine has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems than it does in adults.\n\n【14】### Geriatric\n\n【15】Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of alglucerase in the elderly with use in other age groups.\n\n【16】### Breastfeeding\n\n【17】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【18】### Drug Interactions\n\n【19】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【20】### Other Interactions\n\n【21】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【22】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【23】This medicine will not cure Gaucher's disease but it does help control it. Therefore, you must continue to receive it if you expect to keep your condition under control. You may have to receive alglucerase for the rest of your life. If Gaucher's disease is not treated, it can cause serious blood, liver, skeletal, or spleen problems.\n\n【24】### Dosing\n\n【25】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【26】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【27】*   For Gaucher's disease:\n    *   For injection dosage form:\n        *   Adults and children—The dose is based on body weight. It is injected slowly into a vein over one to two hours. To start, some patients may receive 1.15 Units per kilogram (kg) (0.52 Units per pound) of body weight three times a week. Other patients may receive up to 60 Units per kg (27 Units per pound) of body weight as often as once a week or as seldom as every four weeks. Later, your doctor may raise or lower your dose.\n\n【28】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【29】It is important that your doctor check your progress while you are receiving alglucerase to make sure that the dosage is correct for you.\n\n【30】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【31】Since alglucerase is made from human tissue, it is possible that diseases caused by viruses could be passed on. Examples of such diseases are hepatitis and HIV infection. These problems have not been reported to date, however, and are unlikely since the tissue is tested before being used. If you have questions or concerns about this, check with your doctor.\n\n【32】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【33】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【34】#### Less common\n\n【35】1.  Abdominal discomfort\n2.  chills\n3.  fever\n4.  nausea and vomiting\n5.  swelling at place of injection\n\n【36】无关删除-1:<u>Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients.

Demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, imaging studies, biochemical findings, operative intervention, and outcome were examined. Long-term follow-up was obtained via chart review and/or by direct telephone contact with the patient or a relative.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Twenty-four women and 23 men with a mean age of 53.1 years (range, 16-81 years) underwent attempted laparoscopic resection of pheochromocytomas. In 5 patients, the procedure was converted to open laparotomy because of bleeding (2), inadequate exposure (2), and adhesions (1). The mean tumor size was 4.3 cm. The mean operative time (181.8 vs 140.5 minutes; _P_ \\=.03), mean hospital stay (6.00 vs 2.64 days; _P_ <.001), and mean blood loss (340 mL vs 80 mL; _P_ <.001) were greater in patients who underwent open laparotomy vs those who underwent laparoscopic resection. All specimens were classified as benign. The mean follow-up was 41 months (range, 10-89 months). No patients experienced a recurrence or developed metastatic disease.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】In light of surgical and anesthesia expertise, laparoscopic resection of benign pheochromocytomas is safe and effective with resultant short hospital stays. A low threshold to convert to an open procedure reduces operative times and decreases potentially serious complications. Although there have been no recurrences to date, long-term follow-up is required for all patients, especially those with hereditary forms of pheochromocytomas.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "8f9a1118-4e42-4f83-9ccf-54defdca758d", "title": "Osteoporosis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and brittle — so brittle that a fall or even mild stresses such as bending over or coughing can cause a fracture. Osteoporosis-related fractures most commonly occur in the hip, wrist or spine.\n\n【2】Bone is living tissue that is constantly being broken down and replaced. Osteoporosis occurs when the creation of new bone doesn't keep up with the loss of old bone.\n\n【3】Osteoporosis affects men and women of all races. But white and Asian women, especially older women who are past menopause, are at highest risk. Medications, healthy diet and weight-bearing exercise can help prevent bone loss or strengthen already weak bones.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】There typically are no symptoms in the early stages of bone loss. But once your bones have been weakened by osteoporosis, you might have signs and symptoms that include:\n\n【6】*   Back pain, caused by a fractured or collapsed vertebra\n*   Loss of height over time\n*   A stooped posture\n*   A bone that breaks much more easily than expected\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】You might want to talk to your doctor about osteoporosis if you went through early menopause or took corticosteroids for several months at a time, or if either of your parents had hip fractures.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Your bones are in a constant state of renewal — new bone is made and old bone is broken down. When you're young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases. After the early 20s this process slows, and most people reach their peak bone mass by age 30. As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it's created.\n\n【11】How likely you are to develop osteoporosis depends partly on how much bone mass you attained in your youth. Peak bone mass is partly inherited and varies also by ethnic group. The higher your peak bone mass, the more bone you have \"in the bank\" and the less likely you are to develop osteoporosis as you age.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】A number of factors can increase the likelihood that you'll develop osteoporosis — including your age, race, lifestyle choices, and medical conditions and treatments.\n\n【14】### Unchangeable risks\n\n【15】Some risk factors for osteoporosis are out of your control, including:\n\n【16】*   **Your sex.** Women are much more likely to develop osteoporosis than are men.\n*   **Age.** The older you get, the greater your risk of osteoporosis.\n*   **Race.** You're at greatest risk of osteoporosis if you're white or of Asian descent.\n*   **Family history.** Having a parent or sibling with osteoporosis puts you at greater risk, especially if your mother or father fractured a hip.\n*   **Body frame size.** Men and women who have small body frames tend to have a higher risk because they might have less bone mass to draw from as they age.\n\n【17】### Hormone levels\n\n【18】Osteoporosis is more common in people who have too much or too little of certain hormones in their bodies. Examples include:\n\n【19】*   **Sex hormones.** Lowered sex hormone levels tend to weaken bone. The fall in estrogen levels in women at menopause is one of the strongest risk factors for developing osteoporosis. Treatments for prostate cancer that reduce testosterone levels in men and treatments for breast cancer that reduce estrogen levels in women are likely to accelerate bone loss.\n*   **Thyroid problems.** Too much thyroid hormone can cause bone loss. This can occur if your thyroid is overactive or if you take too much thyroid hormone medication to treat an underactive thyroid.\n*   **Other glands.** Osteoporosis has also been associated with overactive parathyroid and adrenal glands.\n\n【20】### Dietary factors\n\n【21】Osteoporosis is more likely to occur in people who have:\n\n【22】*   **Low calcium intake.** A lifelong lack of calcium plays a role in the development of osteoporosis. Low calcium intake contributes to diminished bone density, early bone loss and an increased risk of fractures.\n*   **Eating disorders.** Severely restricting food intake and being underweight weakens bone in both men and women.\n*   **Gastrointestinal surgery.** Surgery to reduce the size of your stomach or to remove part of the intestine limits the amount of surface area available to absorb nutrients, including calcium. These surgeries include those to help you lose weight and for other gastrointestinal disorders.\n\n【23】### Steroids and other medications\n\n【24】Long-term use of oral or injected corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone and cortisone, interferes with the bone-rebuilding process. Osteoporosis has also been associated with medications used to combat or prevent:\n\n【25】*   Seizures\n*   Gastric reflux\n*   Cancer\n*   Transplant rejection\n\n【26】### Medical conditions\n\n【27】The risk of osteoporosis is higher in people who have certain medical problems, including:\n\n【28】*   Celiac disease\n*   Inflammatory bowel disease\n*   Kidney or liver disease\n*   Cancer\n*   Multiple myeloma\n*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n\n【29】### Lifestyle choices\n\n【30】Some bad habits can increase your risk of osteoporosis. Examples include:\n\n【31】*   **Sedentary lifestyle.** People who spend a lot of time sitting have a higher risk of osteoporosis than do those who are more active. Any weight-bearing exercise and activities that promote balance and good posture are beneficial for your bones, but walking, running, jumping, dancing and weightlifting seem particularly helpful.\n*   **Excessive alcohol consumption.** Regular consumption of more than two alcoholic drinks a day increases the risk of osteoporosis.\n*   **Tobacco use.** The exact role tobacco plays in osteoporosis isn't clear, but it has been shown that tobacco use contributes to weak bones.\n\n【32】Complications\n-------------\n\n【33】Bone fractures, particularly in the spine or hip, are the most serious complications of osteoporosis. Hip fractures often are caused by a fall and can result in disability and even an increased risk of death within the first year after the injury.\n\n【34】In some cases, spinal fractures can occur even if you haven't fallen. The bones that make up your spine (vertebrae) can weaken to the point of collapsing, which can result in back pain, lost height and a hunched forward posture.\n\n【35】Prevention\n----------\n\n【36】Good nutrition and regular exercise are essential for keeping your bones healthy throughout your life.\n\n【37】### Calcium\n\n【38】Men and women between the ages of 18 and 50 need 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day. This daily amount increases to 1,200 milligrams when women turn 50 and men turn 70.\n\n【39】Good sources of calcium include:\n\n【40】*   Low-fat dairy products\n*   Dark green leafy vegetables\n*   Canned salmon or sardines with bones\n*   Soy products, such as tofu\n*   Calcium-fortified cereals and orange juice\n\n【41】If you find it difficult to get enough calcium from your diet, consider taking calcium supplements. However, too much calcium has been linked to kidney stones. Although yet unclear, some experts suggest that too much calcium, especially in supplements, can increase the risk of heart disease.\n\n【42】The Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends that total calcium intake, from supplements and diet combined, should be no more than 2,000 milligrams daily for people older than 50.\n\n【43】### Vitamin D\n\n【44】Vitamin D improves the body's ability to absorb calcium and improves bone health in other ways. People can get some of their vitamin D from sunlight, but this might not be a good source if you live in a high latitude, if you're housebound, or if you regularly use sunscreen or avoid the sun because of the risk of skin cancer.\n\n【45】无关删除-2:<u>Dietary sources of vitamin D include cod liver oil, trout and salmon. Many types of milk and cereal have been fortified with vitamin D.</u>\n\n【46】Most people need at least 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D a day. That recommendation increases to 800 IU a day after age 70.\n\n【47】People without other sources of vitamin D and especially with limited sun exposure might need a supplement. Most multivitamin products contain between 600 and 800 IU of vitamin D. Up to 4,000 IU of vitamin D a day is safe for most people.\n\n【48】### Exercise\n\n【49】Exercise can help you build strong bones and slow bone loss. Exercise will benefit your bones no matter when you start, but you'll gain the most benefits if you start exercising regularly when you're young and continue to exercise throughout your life.\n\n【50】Combine strength training exercises with weight-bearing and balance exercises. Strength training helps strengthen muscles and bones in your arms and upper spine. Weight-bearing exercises — such as walking, jogging, running, stair climbing, skipping rope, skiing and impact-producing sports — affect mainly the bones in your legs, hips and lower spine. Balance exercises such as tai chi can reduce your risk of falling especially as you get older.\n\n【51】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

This will allow the doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if your baby should continue to receive it. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【38】Your baby's doctor also needs to monitor your baby's breathing, oxygen levels, and other vital signs while receiving this medicine.\n\n【39】Stopping this medicine suddenly may increase your baby's risk to have rebound pulmonary hypertension syndrome. Symptoms include: bluish lips or skin, slow heartbeat, lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting, or decreased cardiac output.\n\n【40】This medicine may cause a rare, but serious blood problem called methemoglobinemia. Your baby's doctor will measure how much methemoglobin is in your baby's blood while receiving this medicine.\n\n【41】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【42】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【43】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.

The collarbone, also known as the clavicle, connects the shoulder blade to the breastbone. Common causes of a broken collarbone include falls, sports and traffic accidents. Infants sometimes break their collarbones while being born.\n\n【2】Seek medical help quickly for a broken collarbone. Most heal well with ice, pain relievers, a sling, physical therapy and time. Some breaks might require surgery to put plates, screws or rods into the bone to hold the pieces in place during healing.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Symptoms of a broken collarbone include:\n\n【5】*   Pain that increases when moving the shoulder.\n*   Swelling, tenderness or bruising.\n*   Skin over the break might look like a tent when gently pinched.\n*   A bump on or near the shoulder.\n*   A grinding or crackling sound when moving the shoulder.\n*   Stiffness or not being able to move the shoulder.\n\n【6】Newborns often will not move their arm for days after breaking the collarbone during birth and will cry if someone moves the arm.\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】If you notice symptoms of a broken collarbone or enough pain to prevent using the arm as usual, see a health care provider right away. Waiting to be treated can lead to poor healing.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Common causes of a broken collarbone include:\n\n【11】*   **Falls,** such as falling onto the shoulder or onto an outstretched arm.\n*   **Sports injuries,** such as a direct blow to the shoulder on the field, rink or court.\n*   **Traffic accidents,** from a car, motorcycle or bike crash.\n*   **Birth injury,** usually from a difficult vaginal birth.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】Teenagers and children are at higher risk of a broken collarbone than are adults. The risk goes down after age 20. Then it rises again in older people as they lose bone strength with age.\n\n【14】Complications\n-------------\n\n【15】Most broken collarbones heal without difficulty. Complications, when they occur, might include:\n\n【16】*   **Nerve or blood vessel injury.** Rarely, the jagged ends of a broken collarbone may injure nearby nerves and blood vessels. Seek immediate medical attention for numbness or coldness in an arm or hand.\n*   **Poor or slow healing.** A badly broken collarbone might heal slowly or not all the way. Poor joining of the bones during healing can shorten the bone.\n*   **A lump in the bone.** As part of the healing process, the place where the bone knits together forms a bony lump.

Associations of grip strength and walking pace with CVD outcomes were investigated using Cox models adjusting for classical risk factors (as included in established risk scores), and predictive utility was determined by changes in C-index and categorical net reclassification index.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Over a median of 8.87 years of follow-up (interquartile range 3, 8.25-9.47 years), there were 7274 composite fatal/nonfatal events (on the basis of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association \\[ACC/AHA\\] outcome) and 1955 fatal events (on the basis of the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation \\[SCORE\\] risk score). Both grip strength and walking pace were inversely associated with CVD outcomes after adjusting for classical risk factors. Addition of grip strength (change in C-index: ACC/AHA, +0.0017; SCORE, +0.0047), usual walking pace (ACC/AHA, +0.0031; SCORE, +0.0130), and both combined (ACC/AHA, +0.0041; SCORE, +0.0148) improved the C-index and also improved the net reclassification index (grip, +0.55%; walking pace, +0.53%; combined, 1.12%).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The present study has found that the addition of grip strength or usual walking pace to existing risk scores results in improved CVD risk prediction, with an additive effect when both are added. As both these measures are cheap and easy to administer, these tools could provide an important addition to CVD risk screening, although further external validation is required.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACC ( American College of Cardiology ), AHA ( American Heart Association ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), DBP ( diastolic blood pressure ), HDL ( high-density lipoprotein ), NRI ( net reclassification index ), SBP ( systolic blood pressure ), SCORE ( Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Whereas most opioid prescribing guidelines have focused on the prescription of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain, this study focuses on postoperative opioid prescriptions. This is important because postoperative opioid prescriptions have been associated with increased risk for prolonged opioid use, opioid overdose, and opioid use disorder. Approximately 6% of opioid-naïve patients who are prescribed postoperative opioids go on to persistent opioid use. This transition to persistent use can occur with minor as well as with major surgical procedures, including vasectomies and wisdom tooth extractions.\n\n【12】New persistent opioid use is important because it may lead to nonmedical prescription opioid use, illicit opioid use, opioid use disorder, and opioid overdose. Opioid prescribing has declined since 2012, but the number of drug overdose deaths was still 4 times higher in 2018 than in 1999. Although prescription opioid deaths are decreasing while synthetic opioid deaths are increasing, it is still true that most who use illicit opioids and who die of an illicit opioid overdose started with prescription opioids.\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hartung D.M.\n*   Johnston K.A.\n*   Hallvik S.\n\n【14】Prescription opioid dispensing patterns prior to heroin overdose in a state Medicaid program: a case-control study.\n\n【15】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Gen Intern Med._ 2020; 35 : 3188-3196</u></u>\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (8)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【17】Role of Dose in Opioid Guidelines\n---------------------------------\n\n【18】Early opioid guidelines focused on patient-centered risks for opioid adverse outcomes among those with long-term opioid use. It was only with the Washington State Opioid Guidelines, initially issued as an advisory in 2007 and then as state law in 2010, that dosing guidance was included in opioid guidelines. The guideline recommended avoiding doses above 120 mg oral morphine equivalents for patients who did not have clinically meaningful improvement in pain _and_ function, without first obtaining a pain specialist consultation. This provided a “line in the sand” that opioid dose titration should not exceed if the patient was not showing clear benefit. This was controversial because it contradicted the “titrate-to-effect” principle of opioid dosing that had been inherited from palliative care and cancer pain care. This principle stated that the correct opioid dose could not be prespecified but was that dose that relieved pain (ie, lowered pain intensity scores). When this principle was applied to chronic pain care, however, it led to the use of high opioid doses and opioid overdoses. The dosing component of the Washington guideline aimed to reduce this high-dose use. The CDC guideline also includes high-dose thresholds that have been lowered to reflect doses at which mortality has been demonstrated to increase. Recommendation 5 in the CDC guideline includes the following: Clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks when increasing dosage to ≥50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day, and should avoid increasing dosage to ≥90 MME/day or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to ≥90 MME/day.\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>*   Dowell D.\n*   Haegerich T.M.\n*   Chou R.</u>\n\n【20】CDC Guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain—United States, 2016 \\[erratum appears in _MMWR Recomm Rep_ . 2016;65(11):295\\].\n\n【21】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_MMWR Recomm Rep._ 2016; 65 : 1-49</u></u>\n\n【22】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2229)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【23】There is evidence that the Washington guidelines did lower high-dose opioid use and opioid-related mortality in both Medicaid and workers’ compensation populations.\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>*   Garg R.K.\n*   Fulton-Kehoe D.\n*   Franklin G.M.</u>\n\n【25】Patterns of opioid use and risk of opioid overdose death among Medicaid patients.\n\n【26】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Med Care._ 2017; 55 : 661-668</u></u>\n\n【27】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (111)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【28】States with opioid guidelines that specify a high-dose threshold (Colorado, Utah, Washington) have lower rates of opioid-related hospitalizations than 5 states without the high-dose threshold.\n\n【29】无关删除-2:<u>*   Sears J.M.\n*   Fulton-Kehoe D.\n*   Schulman B.A.\n*   Hogg-Johnson S.\n*   Franklin G.M.</u>\n\n【30】Opioid overdose hospitalization trajectories in states with and without opioid-dosing guidelines.\n\n【31】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Public Health Rep._ 2019; 134 : 567-576</u></u>\n\n【32】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (4)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【33】There is also evidence that the CDC guideline lowered overall opioid prescribing, high-dose opioid prescribing, and concurrent opioid-sedative prescribing.\n\n【34】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bohnert A.S.B.\n*   Guy Jr. G.P.\n*   Losby J.L.</u>\n\n【35】Opioid prescribing in the United States before and after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2016 opioid guideline.\n\n【36】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 2018; 169 : 367-375</u></u>\n\n【37】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (252)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【38】无关删除-2:<u>*   Sears J.M.\n*   Haight J.R.\n*   Fulton-Kehoe D.\n*   Wickizer T.M.\n*   Mai J.\n*   Franklin G.M.</u>\n\n【39】Changes in early high-risk opioid prescribing practices after policy interventions in Washington State.\n\n【40】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Health Serv Res._ 2021; 56 : 49-60</u></u>\n\n【41】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (9)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【42】The CDC guideline does not address the management of postsurgical pain but does address the management of other acute pain: When the diagnosis and severity of nontraumatic, nonsurgical acute pain are reasonably assumed to warrant the use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids, often 3 days or less, unless circumstances clearly warrant additional opioid therapy.

Overprescribing is often defined as opioid prescribing with high risk of opioid adverse events like overdose and addiction. This does not consider the possible benefits of this opioid prescribing. Underprescribing is often defined as prescribing that does not reduce high pain intensity scores. This simplifies opioid effects in a dangerous way. Pain control does not work as an isolated goal, even during the postoperative period. Pain control should support recovery from the surgery and resumption of normal activities. Zero pain is a not the right goal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "bfeffbb4-fac3-4b1c-9bab-e06a8ed49ce8", "title": "Phillip Sharp—Nobel Prize for Discovery of “Split Genes”", "text": "【0】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【1】American molecular biologist Phillip Allen Sharp received the 1993 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his discovery of “split genes.” He found that these genes are the most common type of gene structure in higher organisms, including humans. He shared the prize with Richard John Roberts (1943-), who discovered split genes independently of Sharp. The discovery of split genes has been of fundamental importance to basic research in biology as well as medical research on the development of cancer and other diseases. The discovery of split genes led to the prediction of the genetic process of splicing.\n\n【2】Sharp was born on June 6, 1944, in Falmouth, Ky, on a small farm where his parents grew tobacco and corn. He attended Union College in Barbourville in southeastern Kentucky and received his BA degree in 1966. He subsequently enrolled at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana and earned a PhD degree in chemistry in 1969. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena from 1969 to 1971.\n\n【3】In 1971, Sharp became a member of the faculty of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in southeastern New York State, where he worked (from 1971 to 1972) with 1962 Nobel laureate James Watson (1928-). From 1972 to 1974, Sharp was a senior research investigator at the laboratory.\n\n【4】Sharp left Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1974 to join the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, where his prize-winning research was performed. In the 1980s and the early 1990s, he was associate director and then director of the MIT Center for Cancer Research. In 1991, he was appointed head of the Department of Biology at MIT, and in 1992, he became the first Salvador E. Luria (1912-1991) Professor, a chair established at MIT to honor the 1969 Nobel laureate.\n\n【5】In 1977, Sharp and his colleagues discovered that a single molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA) from an adenovirus corresponds to 4 separate discontinuous segments of DNA. (The segments of DNA that code for proteins \\[exons\\] are separated by long stretches of DNA \\[introns\\] that do not contain genetic information; the terms _exon_ and _intron_ were coined by Walter Gilbert \\[1932-\\], the 1980 Nobel laureate in chemistry.) Working independently of Sharp, Richard Roberts and his research team made the same discovery. Previously, biologists had believed that genes were continuous stretches of DNA that served as direct templates for mRNA in the assembly of proteins.\n\n【6】In addition to the Nobel Prize, Sharp has received many honors and awards, including the Eli Lilly Award (1980), the Ricketts Award (1985), the Sloan Prize (1986), the Gairdner Foundation Award (1986), the Horwitz Prize (1988), the Lasker Award (1988), and the Dickson Prize (1990). He was honored on a stamp issued by the Palau Islands in 2000.\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【9】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/79.6.727</u></u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>© 2004 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

In that study, _intensive_ treatment is defined as any treatment that is not diet only. After exclusion of the mildest cases, the comparison is essentially between “no treatment” and any treatment at all, hardly what most people think of as intensive therapy. Most physicians can agree that treatment is better than no treatment, which is really all that the cited investigators conclude. The issue arises as to whether the pursuit of the academic target of 6.5% to 7.0% for glycated hemoglobin is required or whether any treatment that reduces the patient's glycated hemoglobin to less than 8% is adequate.

Diabetes mellitus is a severe public health problem, the incidence and prevalence of which are increasing. Finding and treating patients with type 2 DM is a goal broadly shared in the medical community. Most of the Wilson and Jungner criteria\n\n【44】无关删除-2:<u>*   Wilson JMG\n*   Jungner G</u>\n\n【45】_Principles and Practice of Screening for Disease_ .

Also, the Wilson and Jungner criteria are 40 years old and have been expanded to include caveats about the value of early treatment.\n\n【50】Screening criteria: the Wilson-Jungner criteria for appraising the validity of a screening programme.\n\n【51】删除3:<u>www.gp-training.net/training/tutorials/management/audit/screen.htm</u>\n\n【52】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【53】Whether screening for type 2 DM precisely meets all the relevant criteria for disease screening remains unclear. The primary concern is that the available evidence is neither clear nor conclusive that treatment is more beneficial if initiated at an early vs at a later stage. The pathophysiology and natural history of type 2 DM are still poorly understood despite basic science breakthroughs, ongoing research, and the disease burden on the population. Pending further evidence-based studies showing that early detection and treatment of asymptomatic type 2 DM are warranted, implementation of screening programs should perhaps be postponed.\n\n【54】Competing Priorities\n--------------------\n\n【55】Coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease are the number 1 and number 3 causes of death in the United States, respectively. Hypertension, elevated cholesterol levels, and type 2 DM all place patients at increased risk of these diseases. Which of these risk factors should we make it a priority to reduce? In my opinion, none of the above. Instead, lifestyle interventions should be encouraged. The 3 preferred interventions—smoking cessation, proper diet, and appropriate exercise—have salutary effects on both outcomes and risk factors but do not require medical care or incur expense. However, recidivism is common with these 3 preferred interventions, and long-term success is unusual.\n\n【56】Funds expended on lesser or futile interventions represent an opportunity cost (ie, the cost of an alternative path that must be foregone in order to pursue a certain action) for possibly more cost-effective services. Of course, appropriate pharmacologic intervention for these conditions should be instituted as warranted within the current standard of medical practice. The broad benefits of primary prevention of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease in terms of lifestyle changes and smoking cessation may outweigh the secondary prevention of detection of asymptomatic disease. However, in this age of $4.00 prescriptions for generic drugs, perhaps the answer _is_ a prescription for a pill, even though it may carry its own risks and adverse effects. The best option is not clear.\n\n【57】Testing Errors\n--------------\n\n【58】Test results can be classified as true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Unfortunately, the accurate classification of outcomes can be known only if a criterion standard for comparison of the screen exists. Expensive, difficult, or nonexistent criterion standards can lead to undue enthusiasm for the screen in the absence of evidence of adequate test characteristics. The test characteristics of glucose screening are reasonably good, but the clinical value is unclear. Mislabeling a patient as having type 2 DM may have unwelcome consequences in areas as diverse as psychological well-being or insurance coverage. The consequences of mislabeling a patient with hyperglycemia who is asymptomatic as not having diabetes are uncertain.\n\n【59】Bias\n----\n\n【60】Several types of bias exist regarding screening. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, most, if not all, favor screening. Among these types of bias are selection bias, lead-time bias, and length bias.\n\n【61】**Selection Bias.** Persons who desire screening tend to be those in a population who are relatively healthy and who desire to be healthier. These persons are not typical of the general population. Persons who are screened tend to have better outcomes because they are healthier to begin with, and they have different health objectives.\n\n【62】**Lead-Time Bias.** Suppose we have a screening test for lung cancer and assume that we have no truly effective treatment for lung cancer. If we apply our screening test outside of a nonrandomized, uncontrolled trial, those who are screened will be found to have cancer for a longer period of time, compared with an unscreened population, and will have a statistically longer life span after detection with a longer symptom-free period. Screening in and of itself creates the illusion of benefit.\n\n【63】无关删除-2:<u>*   Barratt A\n*   Irwig L\n*   Glasziou P\n*   Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group\n\n【64】Users' guides to the medical literature, XVII: how to use guidelines and recommendations about screening.\n\n【65】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 1999; 281 : 2029-2034</u></u>\n\n【66】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (152)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【67】Several trials have been conducted to assess the benefit of treatment of type 2 DM. Studies in patients with type 2 DM, such as ACCORD and ADVANCE, have given conflicting results. A rigorous study of screening likely will never be done, but that should not stop us from asking the question if lead-time bias is an important issue in screening for type 2 DM. The current status of the evidence is that proof of any benefit of early detection and treatment has been elusive. Perhaps a theoretical decision-analytic model\n\n【68】无关删除-2:<u>*   Weinstein MC\n*   Fineberg HV</u>\n\n【69】Clinical Decision Analysis.

Chapman & Hall , London, England 1996\n\n【74】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【75】would be useful.\n\n【76】**Length Bias.** Screening is best conducted in patients with diseases that have a long latency or long period of time between disease onset and outcome. Patients who have brief, aggressive, fatal diseases or outcomes will be missed in the intervals between screening and will not be counted in the statistics as a bad screening outcome. This could be considered a type of selection bias as those who die quickly are not screened.\n\n【77】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【78】Screening for type 2 DM is likely to remain controversial. Measurement of glycated hemoglobin is increasingly being considered a screening tool for detection of type 2 DM. The augmented Wilson and Jungner criteria for implementing this test as a screening strategy should be applied rigorously.\n\n【79】There is no question that type 2 DM is a serious and worsening public health problem. Finding and treating asymptomatic patients with type 2 DM may be a worthy goal, but the obstacles to overcome are many. However, use of the conventional methods of detecting type 2 DM may not meet rigorous criteria for implementation of a screening test. Issues of opportunity cost, testing errors, and the various types of bias need to be recognized and addressed.\n\n【80】Rather than promoting screening for type 2 DM, clinicians could perhaps achieve broader-reaching benefits by encouraging extensive lifestyle interventions that include diet, exercise, and smoking cessation. Such lifestyle interventions would depend less on our dysfunctional health care system, require less medication, cost less, benefit those persons with a broader range of diseases and conditions, and be more acceptable to the many parties involved.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Two data sets were collected from different time periods: development data set from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2011, and validation data set from December 1, 2012, through September 1, 2014. We used the development data set to identify the optimal definition of tachycardia with the strongest association with the vascular composite outcome (pulmonary embolism and myocardial necrosis and infarction). The predictive value of this definition was assessed in the validation data set for each outcome of interest, pulmonary embolism, myocardial necrosis and infarction, and infection using multiple logistic regression to control for known risk factors.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In 1755 patients in the development data set, a maximum heart rate (HR) greater than 110 beats/min was found to be the best cutoff as a correlate of the composite vascular outcome. Of the 4621 patients who underwent arthroplasty in the validation data set, 40 (0.9%) had pulmonary embolism. The maximum HR greater than 110 beats/min had an odds ratio (OR) of 9.39 (95% CI, 4.67-18.87; sensitivity, 72.5%; specificity, 78.0%; positive predictive value, 2.8%; negative predictive value, 99.7%) for pulmonary embolism. Ninety-seven patients (2.1%) had myocardial necrosis (elevated troponin). The maximum HR greater than 110 beats/min had an OR of 4.71 (95% CI, 3.06-7.24; sensitivity, 47.4%; specificity, 78.1%; positive predictive value, 4.4%; negative predictive value, 98.6%) for this outcome. Thirteen (.3%) patients had myocardial infarction according to our predetermined definition, and the maximum HR greater than 110 beats/min had an OR of 1.72 (95% CI, 0.47-6.27).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Postoperative tachycardia within the first 4 days of surgery should not be dismissed as a postoperative variation in HR, but may precede clinically significant adverse outcomes.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】DVT ( deep venous thrombosis ), EHR ( electronic health record ), HR ( heart rate ), ICD-9 ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), NPV ( negative predictive value ), OR ( odds ratio ), PE ( pulmonary embolism ), PPV ( positive predictive value ), SSI ( surgical site infection ), TJA ( total joint arthroplasty ), UTI ( urinary tract infection )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins.\n\n【34】Drink extra fluids so you will pass more urine before receiving this medicine. This may help prevent kidney problems.\n\n【35】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【36】It is very important that your doctor check you closely while you are receiving this medicine. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【37】This medicine may raise your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. This is more likely in people who already have heart disease. People who use this medicine for a long time might also have a higher risk.\n\n【38】This medicine may cause bleeding in your stomach or intestines. These problems can happen without warning signs. This is more likely if you have had a stomach ulcer in the past, if you smoke or drink alcohol regularly, are over 60 years of age, are in poor health, or are using certain medicines (such as a steroid medicine or a blood thinner).\n\n【39】Check with your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of liver problems including dark-colored urine or pale stools, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, pain in your upper stomach, or yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes.\n\n【40】If you are rapidly gaining weight, having shortness of breath, chest pain, extreme tiredness or weakness, irregular breathing, irregular heartbeat, or excessive swelling of the hands, wrist, ankles, or feet, check with your doctor immediately. These may be symptoms of heart problems or your body keeping too much water.\n\n【41】This medicine may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Although this is rare, it may occur more often in patients who are allergic to aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. The most serious signs of this reaction are very fast or irregular breathing, gasping for breath, or fainting.

Burns can be minor medical problems or life-threatening emergencies.\n\n【2】The treatment of burns depends on the location and severity of the damage. Sunburns and small scalds can usually be treated at home. Deep or widespread burns need immediate medical attention. Some people need treatment at specialized burn centers and monthslong follow-up care.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Burn symptoms vary depending on how deep the skin damage is. It can take a day or two for the signs and symptoms of a severe burn to develop.\n\n【5】*   **1st-degree burn.** This minor burn affects only the outer layer of the skin (epidermis). It may cause redness and pain.\n*   **2nd-degree burn.** This type of burn affects both the epidermis and the second layer of skin (dermis). It may cause swelling and red, white or splotchy skin. Blisters may develop, and pain can be severe. Deep second-degree burns can cause scarring.\n*   **3rd-degree burn.** This burn reaches to the fat layer beneath the skin. Burned areas may be black, brown or white. The skin may look leathery. Third-degree burns can destroy nerves, causing numbness.\n\n【6】### When to see a doctor\n\n【7】Seek emergency medical assistance for:\n\n【8】*   Burns that cover the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, a major joint or a large area of the body\n*   Deep burns, which means burns affecting all layers of the skin or even deeper tissues\n*   Burns that cause the skin to look leathery\n*   Burns that appear charred or have patches of black, brown or white\n*   Burns caused by chemicals or electricity\n*   Difficulty breathing or burns to the airway\n\n【9】Take first-aid measures while waiting for emergency assistance.\n\n【10】Call your doctor if you experience:\n\n【11】*   Signs of infection, such as oozing from the wound, increased pain, redness and swelling\n*   A burn or blister that's large or doesn't heal in two weeks\n*   New, unexplained symptoms\n*   Significant scarring\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】Burns are caused by:\n\n【14】*   Fire\n*   Hot liquid or steam\n*   Hot metal, glass or other objects\n*   Electrical currents\n*   Radiation, such as that from X-rays\n*   Sunlight or other sources of ultraviolet radiation, such as a tanning bed\n*   Chemicals such as strong acids, lye, paint thinner or gasoline\n*   Abuse\n\n【15】Complications\n-------------\n\n【16】Complications of deep or widespread burns can include:\n\n【17】*   Bacterial infection, which may lead to a bloodstream infection (sepsis)\n*   Fluid loss, including low blood volume (hypovolemia)\n*   Dangerously low body temperature (hypothermia)\n*   Breathing problems from the intake of hot air or smoke\n*   Scars or ridged areas caused by an overgrowth of scar tissue (keloids)\n*   Bone and joint problems, such as when scar tissue causes the shortening and tightening of skin, muscles or tendons (contractures)\n\n【18】Prevention\n----------\n\n【19】To reduce the risk of common household burns:\n\n【20】*   Never leave items cooking on the stove unattended.\n*   Turn pot handles toward the rear of the stove.\n*   Don't carry or hold a child while cooking at the stove.\n*   Keep hot liquids out of the reach of children and pets.\n*   Keep electrical appliances away from water.\n*   Check the temperature of food before serving it to a child. Don't heat a baby's bottle in the microwave.\n*   Never cook while wearing loosefitting clothes that could catch fire over the stove.\n*   If a small child is present, block his or her access to heat sources such as stoves, outdoor grills, fireplaces and space heaters.\n*   Before placing a child in a car seat, check for hot straps or buckles.\n*   Unplug irons and similar devices when not in use. Store them out of reach of small children.\n*   Cover unused electrical outlets with safety caps. Keep electrical cords and wires out of the way so that children can't chew on them.\n*   If you smoke, never smoke in bed.\n*   Be sure you have working smoke detectors on each floor of your home. Check them and change their batteries at least once a year.\n*   Keep a fire extinguisher on every floor of your house.\n*   When using chemicals, always wear protective eyewear and clothing.\n*   Keep chemicals, lighters and matches out of the reach of children. Use safety latches. And don't use lighters that look like toys.\n*   Set your water heater's thermostat to below 120 F (48.9 C) to prevent scalding. Test bath water before placing a child in it.\n\n【21】Also be alert to burn risks outside the home, especially if you are in places with open flames, chemicals or superheated materials.\n\n【22】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "452c9dca-aab3-4975-b264-3d70e0d11a72", "title": "Mumps", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Mumps is an illness caused by a virus. It usually affects the glands on each side of the face. These glands, called parotid glands, make saliva. Swollen glands may be tender or painful.\n\n【2】Mumps are not common in the United States because of vaccines. But outbreaks do happen. People who are not vaccinated are at high risk of infection. Vaccinated people who get mumps usually have milder symptoms and fewer complications.\n\n【3】There is no specific medicine for mumps. Treatment relieves pain and discomfort.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Symptoms of mumps show up about 2 to 3 weeks after exposure to the virus. Some people may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms.\n\n【6】The first symptoms may be similar to flu symptoms such as:\n\n【7】*   Fever.\n*   Headache.\n*   Muscle aches or pain.\n*   Not wanting to eat.\n*   Tiredness.\n\n【8】Swelling of the salivary glands usually starts within a few days. Symptoms may include:\n\n【9】*   Swelling of one or both glands on the sides of the face.\n*   Pain or tenderness around the swelling.\n*   Less often, swelling of glands below the floor of the mouth.\n\n【10】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【11】See your health care provider if you or your child has symptoms of mumps. Mumps spreads very easily for about five days after the swelling starts. If you think you have mumps, let the clinic know before you go. The clinic staff likely will take steps to prevent the spread of disease.\n\n【12】Other conditions may have similar symptoms, so it's important to get a quick diagnosis.\n\n【13】If you think your child has mumps, call your care provider if your child develops:\n\n【14】*   Fever of 103 F (39 C) or greater.\n*   Trouble eating or drinking.\n*   Confusion or disorientation.\n*   Stomach pain.\n*   Pain and swelling of the testicles.\n\n【15】In the meantime:\n\n【16】*   Rest as much as possible.\n*   Use pain relievers you can get without a prescription, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).\n*   Use a cold or warm cloth over swollen salivary glands.\n\n【17】Causes\n------\n\n【18】Mumps is caused by a type of germ called a virus. When someone has mumps, the virus is in saliva. Coughing or sneezing can release tiny droplets with the virus into the air.\n\n【19】You can get the virus by breathing in tiny droplets. Or you can get the virus by touching a surface where droplets have landed and then touching your face. You also can pick up the virus from direct contact, such as kissing or sharing a water bottle.\n\n【20】Outbreaks in the United States most often happen where people live or work in close contact. These may include college campuses, summer camps and schools.\n\n【21】Complications\n-------------\n\n【22】Complications of mumps are more likely among people who aren't vaccinated. They can happen even if a person didn't have swollen salivary glands.\n\n【23】Complications happen when the virus reaches other tissues in the body. Complications may include:\n\n【24】*   **Swollen testicles.** This complication, also called orchitis, causes severe pain. It's more common with a mumps infection after puberty. A swollen testicle may lead to a decrease in the size of the testicle and a decline in fertility.\n*   **Swollen ovaries.** This complication, also caused oophoritis, causes pain, upset stomach, vomiting and fever. This complication is more likely after puberty. The condition doesn't seem to affect fertility.\n*   **Encephalitis**. Encephalitis is swelling, called inflammation, in the brain that may damage tissues. This complication can cause changes in consciousness, seizures and loss of muscle control.\n*   **Meningitis.** Meningitis is swelling, or inflammation, of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord. It may cause head, fever and neck stiffness. Meningitis related to mumps rarely causes long-term problems.\n*   **Hearing loss.** This complication can happen suddenly or over time. Hearing usually gets better after the illness.\n*   **Pancreatitis.** Mumps can cause damage to the pancreas, called pancreatitis, from swelling. Symptoms may include pain or tenderness near the stomach, upset stomach, vomiting and fever.\n*   **Miscarriage.** Getting mumps during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy may increase the risk that a pregnancy will end, called miscarriage.\n\n【25】Prevention\n----------\n\n【26】Most people who have had the mumps vaccines, called fully vaccinated, are protected from mumps infections. People who aren't vaccinated are more likely to get mumps.\n\n【27】For some people, vaccine protection may go down over time. When fully vaccinated people get mumps, they usually have milder symptoms and fewer complications.\n\n【28】### The MMR vaccine\n\n【29】The mumps vaccine is a part of the recommended childhood vaccinations. It's usually given as a combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The schedule is:\n\n【30】*   The first dose between the ages of 12 and 15 months.\n*   The second dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years before entering school.\n\n【31】Another version of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) includes the vaccine against the virus that causes chickenpox, called varicella-zoster virus. But that vaccine, called the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV) is not used for the first dose in the standard vaccination schedule for children.\n\n【32】Extensive studies in several countries have shown that there is no link between the MMR or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccines and autism. The original study that suggested this connection in 1998 was based on scientific errors. That study was removed from the scientific record in 2010.\n\n【33】Extensive reports from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Academy of Medicine, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conclude that there is no scientifically proven link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\n【34】### People who need the MMR vaccine\n\n【35】If you haven't had two doses or aren't sure, talk to your health care provider. You may need two doses of the vaccine or a booster. This is especially important if you are in a high-risk setting or in an outbreak. The following people may need proof of vaccination or more doses:\n\n【36】*   College students.\n*   People in the military.\n*   International travelers.\n*   Health care workers.\n\n【37】### People who don't need the MMR vaccine\n\n【38】If you're not sure if you're vaccinated, a blood test can show whether you have antibodies to mumps. If you have antibodies to the virus, then your immune system would fight a mumps infection and you don't need another vaccine.\n\n【39】People who were born before 1957 were likely exposed to the virus. They likely are immune to mumps.\n\n【40】The mumps vaccine is made from a weak but still infectious mumps virus. A typical immune system can handle this weak virus easily. But people with immune systems that won't respond quickly or strongly to the vaccine don't usually get this vaccine. But there are some exceptions if the benefits outweigh the risks. Also, this type of vaccine is not suggested for people who are pregnant.\n\n【41】### Side effects of the MMR vaccine\n\n【42】The MMR vaccine is safe and effective. Most people have no side effects.\n\n【43】If they happen, mild side effects may include:\n\n【44】*   Soreness at the site of the shot.\n*   Fever.\n*   Rash at the site of the shot.\n*   Swelling of the glands in the cheeks or neck.\n\n【45】In rare cases, some people may have symptoms such as pain and stiffness in joints, seizures, short-term drop in blood platelets or a rash.\n\n【46】Severe allergic reactions are rare. People who have a severe allergic reaction to the first dose aren't given a second dose. Also, people won't get the vaccine if they've had a severe allergic reaction to an ingredient in the vaccine.\n\n【47】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "5e3814a0-c7a9-41c4-9fc1-edf60b18d51b", "title": "Treprostinil (Inhalation Route)", "text": "【0】Treprostinil (Inhalation Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Tyvaso\n2.  Tyvaso DPI\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Treprostinil inhalation is used to treat the symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary hypertension with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) to improve exercise ability. PAH is the high blood pressure that occurs in the main artery that carries blood from the right side of the heart (the ventricle) to the lungs. When the smaller blood vessels in the lungs become more resistant to blood flow, the right ventricle must work harder to pump enough blood through the lungs. Treprostinil works by blocking a hormone (a naturally occurring substance), that is found in the blood and lungs in large quantities of the people with pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\n【6】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Powder\n*   Solution\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【15】### Geriatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of treprostinil inhalation in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving treprostinil inhalation.\n\n【17】### Breastfeeding\n\n【18】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

The relative predictive value of circulating immune cell markers measured at enrollment—including total leukocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, absolute monocyte count, monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and C-reactive protein—for cardiovascular mortality was evaluated.

During a median follow-up of 9.6 years (interquartile range, 6.8-13.1 years), there were 627 cardiovascular deaths. MLR had the best predictive value for cardiovascular mortality. The addition of elevated MLR (≥0.3) to the 10-year ASCVD risk score improved the classification by 2.7%±1.4% ( _P_ \\=.04).

{"seq_id": "a98daeef-5a32-471b-9c71-394e733d0d69", "title": "General Principles of Antimicrobial Therapy", "text": "【0】General Principles of Antimicrobial Therapy\nAntimicrobial agents are some of the most widely, and often injudiciously, used therapeutic drugs worldwide. Important considerations when prescribing antimicrobial therapy include obtaining an accurate diagnosis of infection; understanding the difference between empiric and definitive therapy; identifying opportunities to switch to narrow-spectrum, cost-effective oral agents for the shortest duration necessary; understanding drug characteristics that are peculiar to antimicrobial agents (such as pharmacodynamics and efficacy at the site of infection); accounting for host characteristics that influence antimicrobial activity; and in turn, recognizing the adverse effects of antimicrobial agents on the host. It is also important to understand the importance of antimicrobial stewardship, to know when to consult infectious disease specialists for guidance, and to be able to identify situations when antimicrobial therapy is not needed. By following these general principles, all practicing physicians should be able to use antimicrobial agents in a responsible manner that benefits both the individual patient and the community.\n\n【1】AST ( antimicrobial susceptibility testing ), CSF ( cerebrospinal fluid ), ESBL ( extended-spectrum β-lactamase ), G6PD ( glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), MIC ( minimum inhibitory concentration ), MRSA ( methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ), OPAT ( outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy ), UTI ( urinary tract infection )\n\n【2】The terms _antimicrobial, antibiotic_ , and _anti-infective_ encompass a wide variety of pharmaceutical agents that include antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic drugs. Of these, antibacterial agents are by far the most commonly used and thus are the focus of this article, although similar principles apply to the other agents as well. Evidence-based practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America\n\n【3】*   ISDA, Infectious Diseases Society of America Web site\n\n【4】Standards, practice guidelines, and statements developed and/or endorsed by IDSA.\n\n【5】删除3:<u>http://www.idsociety.org/Content.aspx?id=9088</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【7】can help direct appropriate therapy for specific infectious disease syndromes as well as for infections caused by specific microorganisms. These guidelines should be applied in the context of host characteristics, response to therapy, and cost of therapy. This article discusses many such factors that should guide appropriate use of antimicrobial therapy.\n\n【8】SELECTING AND INITIATING AN ANTIBIOTIC REGIMEN\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【9】### Obtaining an Accurate Infectious Disease Diagnosis\n\n【10】An infectious disease diagnosis is reached by determining the site of infection, defining the host (eg, immunocompromised, diabetic, of advanced age), and establishing, when possible, a microbiological diagnosis. It is critical to isolate the specific pathogen in many serious, life-threatening infections, especially for situations that are likely to require prolonged therapy (eg, endocarditis, septic arthritis, disk space infection, and meningitis). Similarly, when a patient does not benefit from antimicrobial therapy chosen on the basis of clinical presentation, additional investigations are needed to determine the etiologic agent or exclude noninfectious diagnoses. To optimize an accurate microbiological diagnosis, clinicians should ensure that diagnostic specimens are properly obtained and promptly submitted to the microbiology laboratory, preferably before the institution of antimicrobial therapy. Infectious disease diagnoses also frequently rely on a detailed exposure history, as in the case of a patient with nonresolving pneumonia who has resided in or traveled to the southwestern United States where coccidioidomycosis is endemic. Although the microbiological diagnosis is ideally based on data such as bacterial or fungal culture or serologic testing, frequently the “most likely” microbiological etiology can be inferred from the clinical presentation. For example, cellulitis is most frequently assumed to be caused by streptococci or staphylococci, and antibacterial treatment can be administered in the absence of a positive culture. Similarly, community-acquired pneumonia that does not warrant hospitalization can also be treated empirically—with a macrolide or fluoroquinolone antibiotic—without performing specific diagnostic testing.\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   Mandell LA\n*   Wunderink RG\n*   Anzueto A\n\n【12】Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults.\n\n【13】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin Infect Dis._ 2007; 44 : S27-S72</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (4834)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【15】Finally, noninfectious conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis for infections, especially when the diagnosis is not clear-cut.\n\n【16】### Timing of Initiation of Antimicrobial Therapy\n\n【17】The timing of initial therapy should be guided by the urgency of the situation. In critically ill patients, such as those in septic shock, febrile neutropenic patients, and patients with bacterial meningitis, empiric therapy should be initiated immediately after or concurrently with collection of diagnostic specimens. In more stable clinical circumstances, antimicrobial therapy should be deliberately withheld until appropriate specimens have been collected and submitted to the microbiology laboratory. Important examples of this principle are subacute bacterial endocarditis and vertebral osteomyelitis/diskitis. Patients with these infections are frequently ill for a period of several days to weeks before presentation, and administration of antibiotic therapy should be delayed until multiple sets of blood cultures (in the case of endocarditis) or disk space aspirate and/or bone biopsy specimens (for osteomyelitis/diskitis) have been obtained. Premature initiation of antimicrobial therapy in these circumstances can suppress bacterial growth and preclude the opportunity to establish a microbiological diagnosis, which is critical in the management of these patients, who require several weeks to months of directed antimicrobial therapy to achieve cure.\n\n【18】### Empiric vs Definitive Antimicrobial Therapy\n\n【19】Because microbiological results do not become available for 24 to 72 hours, initial therapy for infection is often empiric and guided by the clinical presentation. It has been shown that inadequate therapy for infections in critically ill, hospitalized patients is associated with poor outcomes, including greater morbidity and mortality as well as increased length of stay.\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ibrahim EH\n*   Sherman G\n*   Ward S\n*   Fraser VJ\n*   Kollef MH</u>\n\n【21】The influence of inadequate antimicrobial treatment of bloodstream infections on patient outcomes in the ICU setting.\n\n【22】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Chest._ 2000; 118 : 146-155</u></u>\n\n【23】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1561)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kollef MH\n*   Sherman G\n*   Ward S\n*   Fraser VJ</u>\n\n【25】Inadequate antimicrobial treatment of infections: a risk factor for hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n【26】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Chest._ 1999; 115 : 462-474</u></u>\n\n【27】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1578)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【28】Therefore, a common approach is to use broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents as initial empiric therapy 删除4:<u>(sometimes with a combination of antimicrobial agents; for further information on these combination regimens, see “Use of Antimicrobial Combinations”)</u> with the intent to cover multiple possible pathogens commonly associated with the specific clinical syndrome. This is true for both community- and hospital-acquired infections. For example, in an otherwise healthy young adult with suspected bacterial meningitis who is seen in the emergency department, the most likely pathogens would be _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Neisseria meningitidis_ , and thus a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) plus vancomycin would be recommended as empiric therapy.\n\n【29】无关删除-2:<u>*   Tunkel AR\n*   Hartman BJ\n*   Kaplan SL\n\n【30】Practice guidelines for the management of bacterial meningitis.\n\n【31】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin Infect Dis._ 2004; 39 : 1267-1284</u></u>\n\n【32】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1590)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【33】Hospital-acquired infections are frequently related to the presence of invasive devices and procedures that result in loss of the normal barriers to infection, as is the case with intravascular catheter–associated bacteremia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (UTIs). They are commonly caused by drug-resistant organisms, both gram-positive (eg, methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ \\[MRSA\\]) and gram-negative (eg, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ ) bacteria, which are often endemic in hospitals because of the selection pressure from antimicrobial use. In selecting empiric antimicrobial therapy for such infections, clinicians should consider the following: (1) the site of infection and the organisms most likely to be colonizing that site (eg, intravascular catheter–associated bacteremia is frequently a result of colonization and infection caused by staphylococci present on the skin); (2) prior knowledge of bacteria known to colonize a given patient (eg, a screening nasal swab \\[currently conducted routinely by many hospitals before admitting patients to the intensive care unit\\] may indicate that the patient is colonized with MRSA); and (3) the local bacterial resistance patterns or antibiograms that are available for important pathogens at most hospitals.\n\n【34】无关删除-2:<u>*   Thompson RL\n*   Wright AJ</u>\n\n【35】General principles of antimicrobial therapy.\n\n【36】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 1998; 73 : 995-1006</u></u>\n\n【37】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (21)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【38】Once microbiology results have helped to identify the etiologic pathogen and/or antimicrobial susceptibility data are available, every attempt should be made to narrow the antibiotic spectrum. This is a critically important component of antibiotic therapy because it can reduce cost and toxicity and prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in the community. Antimicrobial agents with a narrower spectrum should be directed at the most likely pathogens for the duration of therapy for infections such as community-acquired pneumonia or cellulitis in the ambulatory setting because specific microbiological tests are not typically performed.\n\n【39】### Interpretation of Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Results\n\n【40】When a pathogenic microorganism is identified in clinical cultures, the next step performed in most microbiology laboratories is antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing measures the ability of a specific organism to grow in the presence of a particular drug in vitro and is performed using guidelines established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute,\n\n【41】*   Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute\n\n【42】删除3:<u>http://www.clsi.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=About\\_CLSI</u>\n\n【43】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【44】a nonprofit global organization that develops laboratory process standards through extensive testing and clinical correlation. The goal of AST is to predict the clinical success or failure of the antibiotic being tested against a particular organism. Data are reported in the form of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that inhibits visible growth of a microorganism, and are interpreted by the laboratory as “susceptible,” “resistant,” or “intermediate,” according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria. A report of “susceptible” indicates that the isolate is likely to be inhibited by the usually achievable concentration of a particular antimicrobial agent when the recommended dosage is used for the particular site of infection. For this reason, MICs of different agents for a particular organism are not directly comparable. For example, MICs of 1 (susceptible) for ciprofloxacin and 2 (susceptible) for ceftriaxone against _Escherichia coli_ do not imply that ciprofloxacin is twice as active as ceftriaxone. Instead, it indicates that concentrations achieved by giving recommended doses of both drugs are likely to be active against the organism. Although AST results are generally quite useful in narrowing the antibiotic regimen, AST has some limitations that should be kept in mind. First, it is important for both clinicians and laboratory personnel to be aware of the site of infection. For example, an isolate of _S aureus_ could be reported as susceptible to cefazolin in vitro; however, if this particular isolate was obtained from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cefazolin would not be an optimal therapeutic choice because it does not achieve therapeutic concentrations in the CSF. Clinical laboratories may provide different AST interpretations for different sites of infection (eg, meningitis and nonmeningitis AST results for _S pneumoniae_ ). In addition, some organisms carry enzymes that, when expressed in vivo, can inactivate antimicrobial agents to which the organism shows in vitro susceptibility. Although their presence is not immediately apparent from AST results, certain AST “patterns” can provide a clue to their existence. For example, extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) in _Enterobacteriaceae_ are enzymes that mediate resistance to almost all β-lactam agents except carbapenems (eg, meropenem or imipenem). Extended-spectrum β-lactamases can be difficult to detect because they have different levels of in vitro activity against various cephalosporins. In clinical practice, susceptibility to cephamycins (cefoxitin, cefotetan) but resistance to a third-generation cephalosporin (eg, cefpodoxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime) or aztreonam should alert one to the possibility of ESBL production. The production of ESBL should also be suspected when treatment with β-lactams fails despite apparent in vitro susceptibility. This should lead to additional testing, which usually involves growing the bacteria in the presence of a third-generation cephalosporin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (a β-lactamase inhibitor); enhanced bacterial inhibition with the addition of clavulanic acid indicates ESBL. When detected by the laboratory, these bacteria should be considered resistant to all β-lactam agents except the carbapenem class.\n\n【45】In general, it is good practice to communicate directly with the microbiology laboratory when antimicrobial susceptibility patterns appear unusual. It is also useful to be aware of the limitations of AST at the local laboratory, particularly in smaller hospitals (eg, testing of relatively newer agents \\[such as daptomycin for gram-positive cocci\\] might not be routinely performed or reported but could be available on request).\n\n【46】### Bactericidal vs Bacteriostatic Therapy\n\n【47】A commonly used distinction among antibacterial agents is that of bactericidal vs bacteriostatic agents. Bactericidal drugs, which cause death and disruption of the bacterial cell, include drugs that primarily act on the cell wall (eg, β-lactams), cell membrane (eg, daptomycin), or bacterial DNA (eg, fluoroquinolones). Bacteriostatic agents inhibit bacterial replication without killing the organism. Most bacteriostatic drugs, including sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and macrolides, act by inhibiting protein synthesis. The distinction is not absolute, and some agents that are bactericidal against certain organisms may only be bacteriostatic against others and vice versa. In most cases, this distinction is not significant in vivo; however, bactericidal agents are preferred in the case of serious infections such as endocarditis and meningitis to achieve rapid cure.\n\n【48】### Use of Antimicrobial Combinations\n\n【49】Although single-agent antimicrobial therapy is generally preferred, a combination of 2 or more antimicrobial agents is recommended in a few scenarios.\n\n【50】**When Agents Exhibit Synergistic Activity Against a Microorganism.** Synergy between antimicrobial agents means that, when studied in vitro, the combined effect of the agents is greater than the sum of their independent activities when measured separately.\n\n【51】无关删除-2:<u>*   Pillai SK\n*   Eliopoulos GM\n*   Moellering Jr, RC</u>\n\n【52】Section E: anti-infective therapy: principles of anti-infective therapy.\n\n【53】删除3:<u>in: Mandell GL Bennett JE Dolin R 7th ed.

In this setting, the addition of gentamicin to penicillin has been shown to be bactericidal, whereas penicillin alone is only bacteriostatic and gentamicin alone has no significant activity. For certain streptococci, similar synergistic combinations that result in more rapid clearance of the infecting microorganism can also be used to shorten the course of antimicrobial therapy (eg, for endocarditis due to viridans group streptococci, a combination of penicillin or ceftriaxone with gentamicin for 2 weeks can be as effective as penicillin or ceftriaxone alone for 4 weeks).\n\n【61】无关删除-2:<u>*   Baddour LM\n*   Wilson WR\n*   Bayer AS\n\n【62】Infective endocarditis: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Committee on Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease, Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young, and the Councils on Clinical Cardiology, Stroke, and Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia, American Heart Association.\n\n【63】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Circulation._ 2005; 111 : e394-e434</u></u>\n\n【64】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【65】无关删除-2:<u>*   Levison ME</u>\n\n【66】Pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial drugs.\n\n【67】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Infect Dis Clin North Am._ 2004; 18 ( vii. ) : 451-465</u></u>\n\n【68】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (178)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【69】**When Critically Ill Patients Require Empiric Therapy Before Microbiological Etiology and/or Antimicrobial Susceptibility Can Be Determined.** As already discussed, antibiotic combinations are used in empiric therapy for health care–associated infections that are frequently caused by bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics. Combination therapy is used in this setting to ensure that at least 1 of the administered antimicrobial agents will be active against the suspected organism(s). For example, when a patient who has been hospitalized for several weeks develops septic shock and blood cultures are reported to be growing gram-negative bacilli, it would be appropriate to provide initial therapy with 2 agents that have activity against gram-negative bacilli, particularly _P aeruginosa_ , which is both a common nosocomial pathogen and frequently resistant to multiple agents—in this case, a combination of an antipseudomonal β-lactam with a fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside could be used.\n\n【70】**To Extend the Antimicrobial Spectrum Beyond That Achieved by Use of a Single Agent for Treatment of Polymicrobial Infections.** When infections are thought to be caused by more than one organism, a combination regimen may be preferred because it would extend the antimicrobial spectrum beyond that achieved by a single agent. For example, most intra-abdominal infections are usually caused by multiple organisms with a variety of gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes. Antimicrobial combinations, such as a third-generation cephalosporin or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole, can be used as a potential treatment option in these cases and can sometimes be more cost-effective than a comparable single agent (eg, a carbapenem).\n\n【71】**To Prevent Emergence of Resistance.** The emergence of resistant mutants in a bacterial population is generally the result of selective pressure from antimicrobial therapy. Provided that the mechanisms of resistance to 2 antimicrobial agents are different, the chance of a mutant strain being resistant to both antimicrobial agents is much lower than the chance of it being resistant to either one. In other words, use of combination therapy would provide a better chance that at least one drug will be effective, thereby preventing the resistant mutant population from emerging as the dominant strain and causing therapeutic failure. This is why combination drug therapy is used as the standard for treatment of infections such as tuberculosis and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) when treatment duration is likely to be prolonged, resistance can emerge relatively easily, and therapeutic agents are limited.\n\n【72】### Host Factors to Be Considered in Selection of Antimicrobial Agents\n\n【73】Although it is helpful for clinicians to gain familiarity with a few specific antimicrobial agents, a “one size fits all” approach is not appropriate in antimicrobial selection, and several host factors must be taken into account. Published guidelines on appropriate dose adjustments for individual antimicrobial agents are available from a variety of sources.\n\n【74】Micromedex Healthcare Series \\[Internet database\\].

In most cases, one is concerned with dose reduction to prevent accumulation and toxicity in patients with reduced renal or hepatic function. However, sometimes doses might need to be increased to avoid underdosing young healthy patients with rapid renal elimination or those with rapid hepatic metabolism due to enzyme induction by concomitant use of drugs such as rifampin or phenytoin.\n\n【80】**Age.** Patients at both extremes of age handle drugs differently, primarily due to differences in body size and kidney function. Most pediatric drug dosing is guided by weight. In geriatric patients, the serum creatinine level alone is not completely reflective of kidney function, and the creatinine clearance should be estimated by factoring in age and weight for these patients.\n\n【81】**Genetic Variation.** Genetic susceptibility to the adverse effects of antimicrobial agents, which has been demonstrated for several antimicrobial agents, is occasionally significant enough to warrant testing for such variability before administration of certain drugs.\n\n【82】无关删除-2:<u>*   Pillai SK\n*   Eliopoulos GM\n*   Moellering Jr, RC</u>\n\n【83】Section E: anti-infective therapy: principles of anti-infective therapy.\n\n【84】删除3:<u>in: Mandell GL Bennett JE Dolin R 7th ed.

Another example is that of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which can result in hemolysis in individuals when exposed to certain antimicrobial agents, such as dapsone, primaquine, and nitrofurantoin. These drugs should be avoided in those known to be deficient in G6PD, and it is advisable to test for this predisposition in patients who might have a higher risk of G6PD deficiency (eg, African Americans) before prescribing these agents. Many antimicrobial agents are handled by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, and although variation in expression of these enzymes occurs, insufficient data are available to recommend routine clinical testing to guide antimicrobial dosing.\n\n【92】**Pregnancy and Lactation.** Special considerations for the use of antimicrobial agents in pregnancy relate to both the mother and the fetus. In the case of the mother, increases in plasma volume and renal blood flow, especially by the third trimester, can result in more rapid clearance and lower serum levels of pharmaceutical agents, including antimicrobial agents. However, data to support the clinical relevance of this change are sparse, and higher antimicrobial doses are not routinely recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy. Some experts recommend an increased dose of several protease inhibitors for the management of HIV infection in pregnancy. In the case of the developing fetus, many antimicrobial agents can be either teratogenic or otherwise toxic to the fetus. Penicillins, cephalosporins, and macrolides have historically been the most commonly used antimicrobial agents considered safe in pregnancy, and a recent multicenter study of more than 13,000 women with pregnancies affected by birth defects found no association between adverse outcomes and these particular antimicrobial agents.\n\n【93】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crider KS\n*   Cleves MA\n*   Reefhuis J\n*   Berry RJ\n*   Hobbs CA\n*   Hu DJ</u>\n\n【94】Antibacterial medication use during pregnancy and risk of birth defects: National Birth Defects Prevention Study.\n\n【95】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med._ 2009; 163 : 978-985</u></u>\n\n【96】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (181)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【97】In contrast, agents such as sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin, which were not previously considered harmful in early pregnancy, were found to be associated with several birth defects in this study. Other drugs, such as tetracyclines and chloramphenicol, have well-described fetal or neonatal adverse effects and should be avoided. In general, however, human studies on the safety of many antimicrobial agents in pregnancy and lactation are limited, and antimicrobial agents should be prescribed with caution.\n\n【98】**History of Allergy or Intolerance.** A history of antimicrobial allergy or intolerance should be routinely obtained in the evaluation and management of infection 删除4:<u>(for a fuller discussion, see “Adverse Effects”)</u>.\n\n【99】**History of Recent Antimicrobial Use.** Eliciting a history of exposure to antimicrobial agents in the recent past (approximately 3 months) can also help in selection of antimicrobial therapy. Because the causative microorganism for a current episode of infection emerged under the selective pressure of a recently used antimicrobial agent, it is likely to be resistant to that drug and/or drug class, and an alternative agent should be used.\n\n【100】### Oral vs Intravenous Therapy\n\n【101】Patients hospitalized with infections are often treated with intravenous antimicrobial therapy because their admission is often prompted by the severity of their infection. However, patients with mild to moderate infections who require hospitalization for other reasons (eg, dehydration, pain control, cardiac arrhythmias) and have normal gastrointestinal function are candidates for treatment with well-absorbed oral antimicrobial agents (eg, treatment of pyelonephritis and community-acquired pneumonia with oral fluoroquinolones). Furthermore, patients initially treated with parenteral therapy can be safely switched to oral antibiotics when they become clinically stable. When using oral therapy for invasive infections (such as pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or abscesses), clinicians are advised to select an agent that has excellent absorption and bioavailability (ie, the percentage of the oral dose that is available unchanged in the serum). Examples of antibiotics with excellent bioavailability are fluoroquinolones, linezolid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and metronidazole. For more serious infections, such as infective endocarditis and central nervous system infections (eg, meningitis), in which high serum or CSF drug concentrations are desired, a switch to oral therapy is less reliable and not generally recommended.\n\n【102】无关删除-2:<u>*   Baddour LM\n*   Wilson WR\n*   Bayer AS\n\n【103】Infective endocarditis: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Committee on Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease, Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young, and the Councils on Clinical Cardiology, Stroke, and Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia, American Heart Association.\n\n【104】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Circulation._ 2005; 111 : e394-e434</u></u>\n\n【105】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【106】### Pharmacodynamic Characteristics\n\n【107】Along with host factors, the pharmacodynamic properties of antimicrobial agents may also be important in establishing a dosing regimen.

In contrast, drugs that exhibit concentration-dependent killing (aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, metronidazole, and daptomycin) have enhanced bactericidal activity as the serum concentration is increased. With these agents, the “peak” serum concentration, and not the frequency of the dosing interval, is more closely associated with efficacy. To illustrate the impact of this distinction on dosing options, we can take the example of a 70-year-old woman with a creatinine clearance estimated to be 30 mL/min who is being treated with ciprofloxacin for pyelonephritis caused by _E coli_ . Antimicrobial dosing guidelines suggest that a dose of either 250 mg orally every 12 hours or 500 mg every 24 hours is an acceptable modification for her reduced kidney function. However, given that ciprofloxacin exhibits concentration-dependent killing, selection of the latter dosing schedule would be more appropriate.\n\n【113】无关删除-2:<u>*   Czock D\n*   Rasche FM</u>\n\n【114】Dose adjustment of ciprofloxacin in renal failure: reduce the dose or prolong the administration interval?\n\n【115】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Eur J Med Res._ 2005; 10 : 145-148</u></u>\n\n【116】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【117】In contrast, if the same patient were being treated with intravenous ampicillin, for which the time above the MIC is more closely related to efficacy, a dose of 1 g every 4 hours would be preferable to 2 g every 8 hours.\n\n【118】### Efficacy at the Site of Infection\n\n【119】In addition to possessing in vitro antimicrobial activity and achieving adequate serum levels, the efficacy of antimicrobial agents depends on their capacity to achieve a concentration equal to or greater than the MIC at the site of infection and modification of activity at certain sites. Antimicrobial concentrations attained at some sites (eg, ocular fluid, CSF, abscess cavity, prostate, and bone) are often much lower than serum levels. For example, first- and second-generation cephalosporins and macrolides do not cross the blood-brain barrier and are not recommended for central nervous system infections.

First, other things being equal, an agent that requires less frequent administration is preferred. For example, for the treatment of osteomyelitis or other serious infections caused by methicillin- or oxacillin-sensitive _S aureus_ , cefazolin is frequently used in favor of nafcillin or oxacillin because it allows administration every 8 hours. Its use makes treatment outside the hospital setting much more feasible than the administration every 4 hours required for the other drugs. Agents with once- or twice-daily dosing have gained popularity for OPAT and include ceftriaxone, ertapenem, vancomycin, and daptomycin. An alternative for most β-lactams, which require frequent dosing, is use of a continuous infusion pump; however, such a device can frequently be cost-prohibitive. Second, the agent must possess chemical stability and should last for about 24 hours after mixing to allow enough time for delivery and administration. As an important illustration of the principle, the use of intravenous ampicillin for OPAT via self-administration or continuous infusion is often precluded because of a short (approximately 8-hour) stability period at room temperature. Ampicillin or penicillin (in combination with an aminoglycoside) is the drug of choice for endocarditis caused by penicillin-sensitive enterococci; therefore, OPAT for this type of infection usually necessitates either nursing home stay or investment in a continuous infusion device (for penicillin only). Third, agents with minimal toxicity or predictable toxicity amenable to monitoring are preferred as OPAT is generally used in the context of longer-term antimicrobial therapy. Finally, when possible, provided adherence can be expected, consideration should be given to using oral agents (as discussed in “Oral vs Intravenous Therapy”) in the outpatient setting.\n\n【147】### Use of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring\n\n【148】Monitoring serum concentrations for drugs is most useful for medications that have a fairly narrow therapeutic index, which is the ratio of the toxic to the therapeutic dose.

In view of the deleterious effects of prolonged courses of antimicrobial agents, including the potential for adverse reactions, problems with adherence, selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms, and high cost, a number of studies have tried to define the optimal duration of therapy, with an emphasis on shorter courses of therapy.

In other situations, a longer duration of therapy is clearly warranted (eg, 4-6 weeks for endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and intra-abdominal abscesses, and weeks to months for invasive fungal infections) to achieve cure and prevent relapse. In many such infections, treatment duration has to be carefully individualized on the basis of clinical and radiologic response and may require the guidance of an expert in infectious diseases.\n\n【200】### Assessment of Response to Treatment\n\n【201】Response to treatment of an infection can be assessed using both clinical and microbiological parameters. Clinical parameters of improvement include symptoms and signs (eg, a decrease in fever, tachycardia, or confusion), laboratory values (eg, decreasing leukocyte count), and radiologic findings (eg, decrease in the size of an abscess). Although radiologic criteria are commonly used in assessing response to infectious disease therapy, radiologic improvement can frequently lag behind clinical improvement, and routine radiographic follow-up of all infections is not always necessary.

In fact, several weeks or even months may be required before chest radiography or computed tomography shows complete resolution of an infiltrate.\n\n【207】Bacteremia is the most common scenario in which microbiological response is closely assessed because clearance of the bloodstream is as important as clinical improvement. Persistent bacteremia can often be the only clue to the presence of an inadequately treated source or to the existence or development of endovascular infection (such as endocarditis or an intravascular device infection). Persistent bacteremia can also be associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and should always be investigated.\n\n【208】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bennett JW\n*   Murray CK\n*   Holmes RL\n*   Patterson JE\n*   Jorgensen JH</u>\n\n【209】Diminished vancomycin and daptomycin susceptibility during prolonged bacteremia with methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ .\n\n【210】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis._ 2008; 60 : 437-440</u></u>\n\n【211】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (25)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【212】### Adverse Effects\n\n【213】Although the term _antimicrobial allergy_ is frequently used synonymously with _adverse reaction_ or _adverse effect_ , allergic reactions constitute only one subset of adverse reactions to antimicrobial agents 删除4:<u>(see the Table for a useful classification of antimicrobial adverse effects)</u>.\n\n【214】TABLE Classification of the Adverse Effects of Antimicrobial Drugs\n\n| Direct | Direct | Direct |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Allergy | Allergy | Allergy |\n| Toxicity | Toxicity | Toxicity |\n| Drug-drug interaction | Drug-drug interaction | Drug-drug interaction |\n| Therapeutic failure | Therapeutic failure | Therapeutic failure |\n| Indirect | Indirect | Indirect |\n| Effects on commensal flora | Effects on commensal flora | Effects on commensal flora |\n| Human |  | _Clostridium difficile_ infection |\n| Animal |  | Increased chance of infection with drug-resistant pathogens |\n| Effects on environmental flora | Effects on environmental flora | Effects on environmental flora |\n\n【216】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【217】Allergic or hypersensitivity reactions can be either immediate (IgE-mediated) or delayed and usually manifest as a rash; anaphylaxis is the most severe manifestation of IgE-mediated allergy.

If an ongoing reaction is attributed to an antimicrobial drug allergy, this usually requires discontinuation of the offending agent. Related drugs (eg, cephalosporins in patients with a history of penicillin allergy) can be used under careful observation, provided that the reaction is not severe or the skin test is negative. In some cases, if the offending agent is the only or highly preferred agent, desensitization may be necessary. Desensitization involves administration of the drug in progressively increasing doses given by mouth; protocols are available for certain agents, such as β-lactams and sulfonamides, and should be guided by experts in allergic diseases.\n\n【241】Nonallergic drug toxicity is usually, but not always, associated with higher doses and/or prolonged use and is particularly noted in patients with poor kidney or liver function that results in impaired clearance. Examples include nephrotoxicity with aminoglycosides, neurotoxicity of penicillins, and peripheral neuropathy with prolonged use of metronidazole; these potential adverse effects need to be discussed with patients before initiation of therapy.

In addition, drug doses should be adjusted in response to changes in creatinine level to avoid toxicity and attain optimal serum concentrations.\n\n【247】Many antimicrobial agents interact with other drugs to increase or decrease their serum levels and effects. This is frequently the case with antimicrobial agents that are metabolized by and/or affect the cytochrome P450 enzyme system (eg, rifampin is a powerful inducer, whereas macrolides and azole antifungal agents are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes). Clinicians should always remain alert to the possibility of such interactions of antimicrobial agents with other drugs, and it is advisable to review a patient's medication list when prescribing antimicrobial agents. Certain drug combinations can also cause additive toxicity, as exemplified by the concomitant use of amphotericin and gentamicin, which can significantly increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.\n\n【248】SPECIAL SITUATIONS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE THERAPY\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【249】### Antimicrobial Therapy for Foreign Body–Associated Infections\n\n【250】Prosthetic implants and devices are increasingly being used in modern medical treatment. An unfortunate consequence of this increased use is the emergence of infections associated with the placement of such devices, involving both temporary (eg, urinary catheter, central venous catheter) and permanent (eg, prosthetic joint, artificial heart valve) implants. One of the important characteristics of device-related infection is the formation of biofilms, which have been described as “a structured community of bacterial cells enclosed in a self-produced polymeric matrix and adherent to an inert or living surface.”\n\n【251】无关删除-2:<u>*   Costerton JW\n*   Lewandowski Z\n*   DeBeer D\n*   Caldwell D\n*   Korber D\n*   James G</u>\n\n【252】Biofilms, the customized microniche.\n\n【253】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Bacteriol._ 1994; 176 : 2137-2142</u></u>\n\n【254】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (773)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【255】Bacteria growing in biofilms have been shown to be relatively protected from the effects of antimicrobial therapy, probably as a result of alteration of their metabolic state.\n\n【256】无关删除-2:<u>*   Anderl JN\n*   Franklin MJ\n*   Stewart PS</u>\n\n【257】Role of antibiotic penetration limitation in _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ biofilm resistance to ampicillin and ciprofloxacin.\n\n【258】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Antimicrob Agents Chemother._ 2000; 44 : 1818-1824</u></u>\n\n【259】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (713)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【260】Primary care physicians should be aware of this because prolonged antibiotic treatment for these infections can be ineffective, associated with adverse effects, and result in the emergence of resistant strains of organisms.\n\n【261】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lynch AS\n*   Robertson GT</u>\n\n【262】Bacterial and fungal biofilm infections.\n\n【263】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Annu Rev Med._ 2008; 59 : 415-428</u></u>\n\n【264】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (366)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【265】Certain agents (eg, rifampin\n\n【266】无关删除-2:<u>*   Zheng Z\n*   Stewart PS</u>\n\n【267】Penetration of rifampin through _Staphylococcus_ epidermidis biofilms.\n\n【268】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Antimicrob Agents Chemother._ 2002; 46 : 900-903</u></u>\n\n【269】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (164)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【270】and fluoroquinolones\n\n【271】无关删除-2:<u>*   Singh R\n*   Ray P\n*   Das A\n*   Sharma M</u>\n\n【272】Penetration of antibiotics through _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ biofilms.\n\n【273】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Antimicrob Chemother._ 2010; 65 : 1955-1958</u></u>\n\n【274】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (297)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【275】) have better activity against staphylococci in biofilms and are recommended in the management of infections of prosthetic valves\n\n【276】无关删除-2:<u>*   Baddour LM\n*   Wilson WR\n*   Bayer AS\n\n【277】Infective endocarditis: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Committee on Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease, Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young, and the Councils on Clinical Cardiology, Stroke, and Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia, American Heart Association.\n\n【278】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Circulation._ 2005; 111 : e394-e434</u></u>\n\n【279】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【280】and joints\n\n【281】无关删除-2:<u>*   Zimmerli W\n*   Widmer AF\n*   Blatter M\n*   Frei R\n*   Ochsner PE\n*   Foreign-Body Infection (FBI) Study Group</u>\n\n【282】Role of rifampin for treatment of orthopedic implant-related staphylococcal infections: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【283】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 1998; 279 : 1537-1541</u></u>\n\n【284】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (899)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【285】caused by these organisms.

Patients undergoing procedures associated with high infection rates, those involving implantation of prosthetic material, and those in which the consequences of infection are serious should receive perioperative antibiotics. The antibiotic(s) should cover the most likely organisms and be present in the tissues when the initial incision is made, and adequate serum concentrations should be maintained during the procedure. A single dose of a cephalosporin (such as cefazolin) administered within 1 hour before the initial incision is appropriate for most surgical procedures; this practice targets the most likely organisms (ie, skin flora), while avoiding unnecessary broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Duration of prophylaxis for surgical site infection should not exceed 24 hours in most cases.\n\n【294】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bratzler DW\n*   Houck PM</u>\n\n【295】Antimicrobial prophylaxis for surgery: an advisory statement from the National Surgical Infection Prevention Project.\n\n【296】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin Infect Dis._ 2004; 38 : 1706-1715</u></u>\n\n【297】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (786)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【298】**Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in Immunocompromised Patients.** Immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV infection/AIDS, those who are undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, or those who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy after organ transplant, are at increased risk of infection.

The best-recognized example of nonantimicrobial therapy in the treatment of infections is the use of operative drainage or débridement. This procedure is useful when the organism burden is very high or in the management of abscesses, for which the penetration and activity of antimicrobial agents are often inadequate. Other therapies used in the treatment of infectious diseases involve modulating the host inflammatory response to infection. Systemic corticosteroids, thought to act by decreasing the deleterious effects of the host inflammatory response, have been found beneficial when used in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of bacterial meningitis,\n\n【322】无关删除-2:<u>*   van de Beek D\n*   de Gans J\n*   McIntyre P\n*   Prasad K</u>\n\n【323】Steroids in adults with acute bacterial meningitis: a systematic review.\n\n【324】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Lancet Infect Dis._ 2004; 4 : 139-143</u></u>\n\n【325】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (201)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【326】tuberculous meningitis,\n\n【327】无关删除-2:<u>*   Thwaites GE\n*   Nguyen DB\n*   Nguyen HD\n\n【328】Dexamethasone for the treatment of tuberculous meningitis in adolescents and adults.\n\n【329】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 2004; 351 : 1741-1751</u></u>\n\n【330】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (777)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【331】and _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia in patients with AIDS.\n\n【332】无关删除-2:<u>*   Gagnon S\n*   Boota AM\n*   Fischl MA\n*   Baier H\n*   Kirksey OW\n*   La Voie L</u>\n\n【333】Corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy for severe _Pneumocystis carinii_ pneumonia in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\n\n【334】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1990; 323 : 1444-1450</u></u>\n\n【335】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (313)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【336】Temporary discontinuation or dose reduction of immunosuppressive agents is often required for successful treatment of infections, such as cytomegalovirus disease in organ transplant recipients or patients with rheumatologic disorders.

One strategy that can significantly reduce cost is the switch from intravenous to oral therapy. Oral therapy is generally less expensive, potentially associated with fewer adverse effects, and can result in considerable cost savings by facilitating earlier dismissal and a shortened hospital stay.\n\n【350】无关删除-2:<u>*   Amodio-Groton M\n*   Madu A\n*   Madu CN\n\n【351】Sequential parenteral and oral ciprofloxacin regimen versus parenteral therapy for bacteremia: a pharmacoeconomic analysis.\n\n【352】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Pharmacother._ 1996; 30 : 596-602</u></u>\n\n【353】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (60)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【354】Even if the purchase price of an oral agent is greater than its parenteral equivalent, the reduction in hospital stay can result in significant cost savings.

In the past few years, interest has been increasing in the development of rapid and accurate diagnostic tests for detection of viral respiratory pathogens with the ability to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections, such as measurement of procalcitonin levels and nucleic acid tests. Although not yet widely available in clinical practice, these tests have the potential to curtail the use of antibacterial agents for clinical syndromes that are clearly caused by viruses.\n\n【391】### Common Misuses of Antibiotics\n\n【392】In some settings, the use of antibiotics is clearly inappropriate. A discussion follows of some of the typical scenarios in which they are contraindicated.\n\n【393】无关删除-2:<u>*   Thompson RL\n*   Wright AJ</u>\n\n【394】General principles of antimicrobial therapy.\n\n【395】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 1998; 73 : 995-1006</u></u>\n\n【396】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (21)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【397】**Prolonged Empiric Antimicrobial Treatment Without Clear Evidence of Infection.** One of the most common mistakes in antimicrobial use is continuing to add or switch antibiotics when a patient does not appear to be responding to therapy, even though there is no clear evidence of an infectious disease. Many noninfectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic syndromes can present with symptoms and signs that mimic infectious diseases. Examples include adult-onset Still disease and other connective tissue disorders that can present with high fever; drug-induced fever; the fever associated with pulmonary embolism; lymphoma; and Wegener granulomatosis, which can present with fever, cavitary pulmonary nodules, and recurrent sinusitis.\n\n【398】**Treatment of a Positive Clinical Culture in the Absence of Disease.** Colonization with potentially pathogenic organisms without any associated manifestation of disease occurs frequently in certain populations (eg, colonization of the urinary tract in women of advanced age or in the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, colonization of endotracheal tubes in mechanically ventilated patients, and colonization of chronic wounds). Appropriate management in these situations involves obtaining cultures from these sites only when indicated and avoiding treatment of a “positive” culture result when symptoms and signs of active infection are absent (eg, asymptomatic bacteriuria).\n\n【399】**Failure to Narrow Antimicrobial Therapy When a Causative Organism Is Identified.** As already discussed, initial therapy is often empiric and relies on broad-spectrum agents until culture or other tests help determine the microbiological etiology. Once culture and susceptibility data are available, an antibiotic with the narrowest possible spectrum should be selected for continuation of therapy. Often, however, this does not occur, particularly if the patient has improved while receiving empiric therapy, and the physician is uncomfortable about changing therapy in the face of clinical improvement.\n\n【400】**Prolonged Prophylactic Therapy.** As already discussed, infection can be prevented in certain situations by the prophylactic use of antimicrobial agents (eg, presurgical prophylaxis). However, in most cases, guidelines support the use of a single, preoperative dose of an antimicrobial agent. Prolonged “prophylaxis” simply sets the stage for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. For example, the common practice of prolonging antimicrobial therapy until the removal of surgical drains is not evidence based.\n\n【401】**Excessive Use of Certain Antimicrobial Agents.** The frequent use of certain agents (or classes of antimicrobial agents) in a hospital or other health care setting can result in selection of organisms that are resistant to that particular antibiotic. For example, the increased use of fluoroquinolones during the past decade is thought to be, in part, responsible for the epidemic of a fluoroquinolone-resistant strain of _C difficile_ ,\n\n【402】无关删除-2:<u>*   Pepin J\n*   Saheb N\n*   Coulombe MA\n\n【403】Emergence of fluoroquinolones as the predominant risk factor for _Clostridium difficile_ \\-associated diarrhea: a cohort study during an epidemic in Quebec.\n\n【404】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin Infect Dis._ 2005; 41 : 1254-1260</u></u>\n\n【405】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (837)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【406】the most common cause of nosocomial infectious diarrhea.

In addition, nonantimicrobial interventions, such as abscess drainage, are equally or more important in some cases and should be pursued diligently in comprehensive infectious disease management.\n\n【414】CME Materials\n-------------\n\n【415】无关删除-2:<u>*   Download .pdf (.01 MB)\n\n【416】    Help with pdf files</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Differences in use of advanced therapies, in-hospital mortality, and bleeding events were compared between men and women.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 125,901 weighted hospitalizations with high-risk PE were identified during the study period; 46.3% were women (n=58,253). Women were older and had a higher prevalence of several comorbidities and risk factors of PE such as morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure, and metastatic cancer. Systemic thrombolysis and catheter-directed interventions were more commonly used among women; however, mechanical circulatory support was less frequently used. In-hospital mortality was higher among women in the unadjusted analysis (30.7% vs 27.8%, _P_ <.001) and after propensity score matching (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 1.16; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.08 to 1.25; _P<._ 001), whereas the rates of intracranial hemorrhage and non–intracranial hemorrhage were not different. On multivariate regression analysis, female sex (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.21; _P_ <.001) was independently associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In this contemporary observational cohort of patients admitted with high-risk PE, women had higher rates of in-hospital mortality despite receiving advanced therapies more frequently, whereas the rate of major bleeding events was not different from men. Efforts are needed to minimize the excess mortality observed among women.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CDE ( catheter-directed embolectomy ), CDI ( catheter-directed intervention ), CDT ( catheter-directed thrombolysis ), ICH ( intracranial hemorrhage ), MCS ( mechanical circulatory support ), NRD ( Nationwide Readmissions Database ), OR ( odds ratio ), PE ( pulmonary embolism ), US-CDT ( ultrasound-facilitated catheter-directed thrombolysis )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

The organization was founded in 1971 in France and currently has an international network with sections in 18 countries. In 2001, Sweden issued 2 stamps (Scott No. 2418a) to honor the organization. The issuance of these stamps provides an opportunity to honor the founder of MSF, Bernard Kouchner.\n\n【2】Bernard Kouchner was born on November 1, 1939, in Avignon in southeastern France, about 50 miles northwest of Marseilles. He grew up in the suburbs of Paris, where his father was a physician. While growing up and being educated, Kouchner was influenced by the works of existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) and poet Louis Aragon (1897-1982). In 1964, Kouchner received his MD degree and subsequently became certified as a gastroenterologist.\n\n【3】In 1967, Biafra, a region in eastern Nigeria, seceded from Nigeria and proclaimed its independence, which prompted a civil war in the region. With about 50 of his medical colleagues, Kouchner traveled to Biafra in the summer of 1968, where, as part of the International Red Cross, he tried to provide medical aid to the suffering population. When Kouchner returned to France in early 1969, he speculated on the problems of the conflict and voiced his disagreement with the International Red Cross and its policy of not interfering in the politics of the warring countries.\n\n【4】The civil war (and ensuing famine) in Biafra resulted in the founding of GIMCU (Groupe d'Intervention Medical et Chirurgical d'Urgence, or Emergency Medical and Surgical Intervention Group). A second disaster—a flood due to a tidal wave in eastern Pakistan (now Bangladesh)—led to the establishment of SMF (Secours Medical Français, or French Medical Relief). On December 20, 1971, MSF was born from the merger of GIMCU and SMF, with Kouchner as its first director. The MSF has essentially the same goals as the other 2 groups, that is, to bring food, medical supplies, and hope to the needy peoples of the world.\n\n【5】In late 1970, Kouchner cared for victims of an earthquake in Peru and the survivors of the Black September massacre of Palestinians in Jordan. He worked in Nicaragua (earthquake) in 1972, in Lebanon (civil war) and Vietnam (war) in 1975, and in Turkey (earthquake) in 1976.\n\n【6】Kouchner remained with MSF until 1979, when he left to form a new group, Médecins du Monde, or Doctors of the World. The goals of this group were essentially those of the previously mentioned organizations. The disagreement between Kouchner and MSF began with the Vietnamese refugee problem in 1979. Doctors of the World, founded in mid-1980, organized relief efforts in Afghanistan (civil war), Armenia (earthquake, 1988), Ethiopia (famine, late 1980s), Brazil (war with native Indians), and other Latin American countries (Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Mexico), as well as in Poland, Burma, and Mozambique.\n\n【7】After Kouchner left MSF in 1979, the organization became more international. The MSF movement was born in France but was enriched by the organization of Belgian and Swiss sections in 1981, a Dutch section in 1983, and Spanish and Luxembourgian sections in 1985. Between 1986 and 1995, this expansion continued with the creation of supporting sections in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\n\n【8】In about 1988, Kouchner began to be more political in his thinking than he had been earlier. He has served in several political posts in France, as France's first Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and later as French Minister of Health and has continued to exert pressure to allocate resources for the medical problems of needy populations throughout the world.\n\n【9】Kouchner has received many awards and honors, including the Dag Hammarskjold Award (1979), the Louise Weiss Prize of the European Parliament (1979), the Athinai Prize of the Alexander Onassis Foundation (1981), and the Prix Europe (1984).\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【12】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/mcp.2010.0796</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>© 2011 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Hyzaar\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Losartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure may reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.\n\n【6】Losartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination is also used to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with high blood pressure and enlargement of the heart.\n\n【7】Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. Losartan relaxes the blood vessels and lowers the blood pressure. A lower blood pressure will increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.\n\n【8】Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill) . It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Tablet\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Your doctor will tell you which of these is most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet.\n\n【42】Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal. It is very important that you take your medicine exactly as directed and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well.\n\n【43】Remember that this medicine will not cure your high blood pressure but it does help control it. You must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life.

Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy. If you feel dizzy, lie down so you do not faint. Then sit for a few moments before standing to prevent the dizziness from returning.\n\n【62】Check with your doctor right away if you become sick while taking this medicine, especially if you have severe or continuing nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea that does not stop. These conditions may cause you to lose too much water and may lead to low blood pressure. You can also lose water by sweating, so drink plenty of water during exercise or in hot weather.\n\n【63】Check with your doctor right away if you have bloody urine, a decrease in frequency or amount of urine, an increase in blood pressure, increased thirst, loss of appetite, lower back or side pain, nausea, swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs, trouble breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting, or weight gain.

After an initial greeting, my patient opens up about feeling overwhelmed. He is struggling to manage home and work responsibilities. In his professional sphere, he is experiencing pressure to be more productive and notes less energy and joy related to his work. At home, he is often too tired to spend quality time with his family. He worries that he is not supporting his spouse enough, who is at home with their young children. We discuss strategies to create better balance in his life. We never get a chance to talk about his medical issues. The next day I see my patient again. This time he is walking the halls of the hospital. He looks harried, but smiles and pauses to say to me in passing, “Thanks for letting me vent yesterday.” Today he is wearing his white coat; he is an attending physician overseeing the care of his own patients.\n\n【1】无关删除-2:<u>*   Shanafelt T.D.\n*   Mungo M.\n*   Schmitgen J.\n\n【2】Longitudinal study evaluating the association between physician burnout and changes in professional work effort.\n\n【3】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2016; 91 : 422-431</u></u>\n\n【4】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   Scopus (364)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【5】use a prospective, longitudinal research design to explore the impact of physician burnout and low work satisfaction on reductions in professional effort in a single large health care organization.

The safety valve option provides an alternative for physicians to leaving clinical practice altogether. Extending the safety valve metaphor may help to highlight the implications of physician burnout and low work satisfaction on the health care system and offer strategies to address them.\n\n【54】Safety valves are designed to prevent catastrophic events by automatically releasing a substance, such as steam from a closed system, when certain limits are reached. Generally, safety valves work well in this type of setting. However, the more complex the system, such as in politics, labor relations, environmental protection concerns, and health care, the less effective a safety valve becomes. A safety valve works by averting an impending disaster, often at the last possible moment, not by addressing root problems or by changing the way a system functions. Safety valves rarely lead to sweeping innovation.\n\n【55】Medicine as a profession has traditionally embraced the “ideal worker” role, in which physicians are available to work full time and without significant family obligations.\n\n【56】无关删除-2:<u>*   Williams J.</u>\n\n【57】Unbending Gender: Why Family and Work Conflict and What to Do About It.\n\n【58】Oxford University Press , New York, NY 2001\n\n【59】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【60】Typically, US physicians work, on average, 50 hours per week, with 30% working 60 hours or more per week.\n\n【61】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ly D.P.\n*   Seabury S.A.\n*   Jena A.B.</u>\n\n【62】Divorce among physicians and other healthcare professionals in the United States: analysis of census survey data.\n\n【63】删除3:<u>_BMJ._ 2015; 350 : h706</u>\n\n【64】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (47)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【65】Reducing work effort provides a very real option for many individual physicians experiencing burnout or other types of distress, and in some situations has led to local novel approaches to traditional medical careers and clinical care.\n\n【66】无关删除-2:<u>*   Levine R.B.\n*   Mechaber H.F.</u>\n\n【67】Opting in: part-time careers in academic medicine.\n\n【68】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Med._ 2006; 119 : 450-453</u></u>\n\n【69】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (12)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【70】For some physicians, the part-time option represents a proactive, conscious decision to “work differently,” for example by creating time to practice the self-care and healthy behaviors they encourage among their patients and to spend more time with family.\n\n【71】无关删除-2:<u>*   Harrison R.A.\n*   Gregg J.L.</u>\n\n【72】A time for change: an exploration of attitudes toward part-time work in academia among women internists and their division chiefs.\n\n【73】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Acad Med._ 2009; 84 : 80-86</u></u>\n\n【74】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (49)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【75】In fact, quality and satisfaction are not diminished (and are often improved) among patients of part-time physicians.\n\n【76】无关删除-2:<u>*   Parkerton P.H.\n*   Wagner E.H.\n*   Smith D.G.\n*   Straley H.L.</u>\n\n【77】Effect of part-time practice on patient outcomes.\n\n【78】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Gen Intern Med._ 2003; 18 : 717-724</u></u>\n\n【79】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (49)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【80】无关删除-2:<u>*   Panattoni L.\n*   Stone A.\n*   Chung S.\n*   Tai-Seale M.</u>\n\n【81】Patients report better satisfaction with part-time primary care physicians, despite less continuity of care and access.\n\n【82】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Gen Intern Med._ 2015; 30 : 327-333</u></u>\n\n【83】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (28)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【84】However, as pointed out by the authors, physician reductions in work effort may increase pressures on our health care system to maintain timely access to care and continuous clinical coverage. If up to 50% of our physicians are burned out and burnout predicts reduction in work effort, we may be at risk for overwhelming the part-time safety valve option.\n\n【85】To avert overwhelming our health care system, we must look beyond safety valves and address larger system issues—but where to start and on what foundation? In 1927, Dr Francis Peabody famously addressed what many at the time saw as an impending crisis in medicine: the triumph of scientific advancement to the detriment of humanism in caring for patients. Peabody wisely and simply reminded medical students, physicians, and the public that “the secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.”\n\n【86】无关删除-2:<u>*   Peabody F.W.</u>\n\n【87】The care of the patient.\n\n【88】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 1927; 88 : 877-882</u></u>\n\n【89】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (620)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【90】Any effort to address burnout and low work satisfaction among physicians should begin with understanding the context within which we currently live and practice, and from a place of also caring about the physician. My patient (the physician described at the beginning of this article) is unlikely to choose part-time work for a variety of reasons, and so I fear he is at risk for burnout. How shall we care for him and others like him?\n\n【91】An initial step to adequately address physician burnout is to measure it and to identify the factors that are associated with it. Mayo Clinic and the study authors should be commended for collecting and sharing these data at regular intervals. It is hoped that organizational leaders are using this information to develop and track efforts to address physician burnout and satisfaction at the systemwide level and in a way that values and cares for the physician. Other academic institutions and health care organizations are taking a similar path and have created wellness committees and programs to address physician burnout using a systemwide approach.\n\n【92】无关删除-2:<u>*   Linzer M.\n*   Levine R.\n*   Meltzer D.\n*   Poplau S.\n*   Warde C.\n*   West C.P.</u>\n\n【93】10 bold steps to prevent burnout in general internal medicine.\n\n【94】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Gen Intern Med._ 2014; 29 : 18-20</u></u>\n\n【95】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (109)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【96】无关删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【97】无关删除-1:<u>The title of this editorial is a reimagining of Francis Peabody's famous statement, “for the secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.”</u>\n\n【98】无关删除-1:<u>Details of the patient described in this editorial have been altered in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 regulations.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Participants completed the Collaboration and Satisfaction About Care Decisions (CSACD) survey before training and at 2 weeks and 2 months after training. Differences in CSACD summary scores between the time points were assessed with paired _t_ tests.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Twenty-eight health care professionals (19 nurses, 9 physicians) underwent simulation training. Nurses were of similar age to physicians (27.3 vs 34.5 years; _p_ \\=.82), were more likely to be women (95.0% vs 12.5%; _p_ <.001), and were less likely to have undergone prior simulation training (0% vs 37.5%; _p_ \\=.02). The pretest showed that physicians were more likely to perceive that open communication exists between nurses and physicians ( _p_ \\=.04) and that both medical and nursing concerns influence the decision-making process ( _p_ \\=.02). Pretest CSACD analysis revealed that most participants were dissatisfied with the decision-making process. The CSACD summary score showed significant improvement from baseline to 2 weeks (4.2 to 5.1; _p_ <.002), a trend that persisted at 2 months ( _p_ <.002).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Team training using high-fidelity simulation scenarios promoted collaboration between nurses and physicians and enhanced the patient care decision-making process.\n\n【8】AHRQ ( Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ), CSACD ( Collaboration and Satisfaction About Care Decisions )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "1128317e-6a54-4835-8bf5-a72e94d09188", "title": "Encephalitis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is inflammation of the brain. There are several causes, including viral infection, autoimmune inflammation, bacterial infection, insect bites and others. When inflammation is caused by an infection in the brain, it's known as infectious encephalitis. And when it's caused by your own immune system attacking the brain, it's known as autoimmune encephalitis. Sometimes there is no known cause.\n\n【2】In some cases, encephalitis can be life-threatening. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important because it's difficult to predict how encephalitis will affect each individual.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Encephalitis may cause many different symptoms including confusion, personality changes, seizures or problems with movement. Encephalitis also may cause changes in sight or hearing.\n\n【5】Most people with infectious encephalitis have flu-like symptoms, such as:\n\n【6】*   Headache.\n*   Fever.\n*   Aches in muscles or joints.\n*   Fatigue or weakness.\n\n【7】Typically, these are followed by more-severe symptoms over a period of hours to days, such as:\n\n【8】*   Stiff neck.\n*   Confusion, agitation or hallucinations.\n*   Seizures.\n*   Loss of sensation or being unable to move certain areas of the face or body.\n*   Irregular movements.\n*   Muscle weakness.\n*   Problems with speech or hearing.\n*   Loss of consciousness, including coma.\n\n【9】In infants and young children, signs and symptoms also might include:\n\n【10】*   Bulging in the soft spots of an infant's skull, known as fontanels.\n*   Nausea and vomiting.\n*   Stiffness affecting the whole body.\n*   Poor feeding or not waking for a feeding.\n*   Irritability.\n\n【11】In cases of autoimmune encephalitis, symptoms may develop more slowly over several weeks. Flu-like symptoms are less common, but can sometimes happen weeks before more-severe symptoms start. Symptoms are different for everyone, but it's common for people to have a combination of symptoms including:\n\n【12】*   Changes in personality.\n*   Memory loss.\n*   Problems understanding what is real and what is not, known as psychosis.\n*   Seeing or hearing things that aren't there. These are called hallucinations.\n*   Seizures.\n*   Changes in vision.\n*   Sleep problems.\n*   Muscle weakness.\n*   Loss of sensation.\n*   Problems walking.\n*   Abnormal movements.\n*   Bladder and bowel problems.\n\n【13】### When to see a doctor\n\n【14】Get immediate care if you are experiencing any of the more-severe symptoms associated with encephalitis. A severe headache, fever and change in consciousness require urgent care.\n\n【15】Infants and young children with any signs or symptoms of encephalitis should receive urgent care.\n\n【16】Causes\n------\n\n【17】In approximately half of patients, the exact cause of encephalitis is not known.\n\n【18】In those for whom a cause is identified, there are two main types of encephalitis:\n\n【19】*   **Infectious encephalitis.** This condition occurs when a virus or other agent directly infects the brain. The infection may affect one area or be widespread. Viruses are the most common causes of infectious encephalitis, including some that can be passed by mosquitoes or ticks. Very rarely, encephalitis may be caused by bacteria, fungus or parasites.\n*   **Autoimmune encephalitis.** This condition occurs when your own immune cells mistakenly attack the brain or make antibodies targeting proteins and receptors in the brain. The exact reason why this happens is not completely understood. Sometimes the abnormal immune response can be triggered by benign or cancerous tumors, known as paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis. Other types of autoimmune encephalitis such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) can be triggered by infection in your body. This is known as post-infectious autoimmune encephalitis. In many instances, no definitive trigger for the abnormal immune response is identified.\n\n【20】### Common viral causes\n\n【21】The viruses that can cause encephalitis include:\n\n【22】*   **Herpes simplex virus (HSV).** Both HSV type 1 — associated with cold sores and fever blisters around your mouth — and HSV type 2 — associated with genital herpes — can cause encephalitis. Encephalitis caused by HSV type 1 is rare but can result in significant brain damage or death.\n*   **Other herpes viruses.** These include the Epstein-Barr virus, which commonly causes infectious mononucleosis, and the varicella-zoster virus, which commonly causes chickenpox and shingles.\n*   **Enteroviruses.** These viruses include the poliovirus and the coxsackievirus, which usually cause an illness with flu-like symptoms, eye inflammation and abdominal pain.\n*   **Mosquito-borne viruses.** These viruses can cause infections such as West Nile, La Crosse, St. Louis, western equine and eastern equine encephalitis. Symptoms of an infection might appear within a few days to a couple of weeks after exposure to a mosquito-borne virus.\n*   **Tick-borne viruses.** The Powassan virus is carried by ticks and causes encephalitis in the Midwestern United States. Symptoms usually appear about a week after a bite from an infected tick.\n*   **Rabies virus.** Infection with the rabies virus, which is usually transmitted by a bite from an infected animal, causes a rapid progression to encephalitis once symptoms begin. Rabies is a rare cause of encephalitis in the United States.\n\n【23】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【24】Anyone can develop encephalitis. Factors that may increase the risk include:\n\n【25】*   **Age.** Some types of encephalitis are more common or more-severe in certain age groups. In general, young children and older adults are at greater risk of most types of viral encephalitis. Similarly, some forms of autoimmune encephalitis are more common in children and young adults, whereas others are more common in older adults.\n*   **Weakened immune system.** People who have HIV/AIDS, take immune-suppressing medicines or have another condition causing a weakened immune system are at increased risk of encephalitis.\n*   **Geographical regions.** Mosquito- or tick-borne viruses are common in particular geographical regions.\n*   **Season of the year.** Mosquito- and tick-borne diseases tend to be more common in summer in many areas of the United States.\n*   **Autoimmune disease.** People who already have an autoimmune condition may be more prone to develop autoimmune encephalitis.\n*   **Smoking.** Smoking increases the chances of developing lung cancer, which in turn increases the risk of developing paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis.\n\n【26】Complications\n-------------\n\n【27】The complications of encephalitis vary, depending on factors such as:\n\n【28】*   Your age.\n*   The cause of your infection.\n*   The severity of your initial illness.\n*   The time from disease onset to treatment.\n\n【29】People with relatively mild illness usually recover within a few weeks with no long-term complications.\n\n【30】### Complications of severe illness\n\n【31】Inflammation can injure the brain, possibly resulting in a coma or death.\n\n【32】Other complications may last for months or be permanent. These complications can vary widely in severity and can include:\n\n【33】*   Persistent fatigue.\n*   Weakness or lack of muscle coordination.\n*   Personality changes.\n*   Memory problems.\n*   Hearing or vision defects.\n*   Speech impairments.\n\n【34】Prevention\n----------\n\n【35】The best way to prevent viral encephalitis is to take precautions to avoid exposure to viruses that can cause the disease. Try to:\n\n【36】*   **Practice good hygiene.** Wash hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before and after meals.\n*   **Don't share utensils.** Don't share tableware and beverages.\n*   **Teach your children good habits.** Make sure they practice good hygiene and avoid sharing utensils at home and school.\n*   **Get vaccinations.** Keep your own and your children's vaccinations current. Before traveling, talk to your health care provider about recommended vaccinations for different destinations.\n\n【37】### Protection against mosquitoes and ticks\n\n【38】To minimize your exposure to mosquitoes and ticks:\n\n【39】*   **Dress to protect yourself.** Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants if you're outside between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active, and when you're in a wooded area with tall grasses and shrubs where ticks are more common.\n*   **Apply mosquito repellent.** Chemicals such as DEET can be applied to both the skin and clothes. To apply repellent to your face, spray it on your hands and then wipe it on your face. If you're using both sunscreen and a repellent, apply sunscreen first.\n*   **Use insecticide.** The Environmental Protection Agency recommends the use of products containing permethrin, which repels and kills ticks and mosquitoes. These products can be sprayed on clothing, tents and other outdoor gear. Permethrin shouldn't be applied to the skin.\n*   **Avoid mosquitoes.** Refrain from unnecessary activity in places where mosquitoes are most common. If possible, avoid being outdoors from dusk till dawn, when mosquitoes are most active. Repair broken windows and screens.\n*   **Get rid of water sources outside your home.** Eliminate standing water in your yard, where mosquitoes can lay their eggs. Common problems include flowerpots or other gardening containers, flat roofs, old tires, and clogged gutters.\n*   **Look for outdoor signs of viral disease.** If you notice sick or dying birds or animals, report your observations to your local health department.\n\n【40】### Protection for young children\n\n【41】Insect repellents aren't recommended for use on infants younger than 2 months of age. Instead, cover an infant carrier or stroller with mosquito netting.\n\n【42】For older infants and children, repellents with 10% to 30% DEET are considered safe. Products containing both DEET and sunscreen aren't recommended for children because reapplication — which might be necessary for the sunscreen component — will expose the child to too much DEET.\n\n【43】Tips for using mosquito repellent with children include:\n\n【44】*   Always assist children with the use of mosquito repellent.\n*   Spray on clothing and exposed skin.\n*   Apply the repellent when outdoors to lessen the risk of inhaling the repellent.\n*   Spray repellent on your hands and then apply it to your child's face. Take care around the eyes and ears.\n*   Don't use repellent on the hands of young children who may put their hands in their mouths.\n*   Wash treated skin with soap and water when you come indoors.\n\n【45】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

For most people, palliative care is not provided by hospice and palliative medicine specialists, but rather by their primary care providers. The recognition of hospice and palliative medicine as its own medical subspecialty in 2006 highlighted the importance of palliative care to the practice of medicine, yet many health care professionals harbor misconceptions about palliative care, which may be a barrier to ensuring that the palliative care needs of their patients are identified and met in a timely fashion. When physicians discuss end-of-life concerns proactively, many patients choose more comfort-focused care and receive care more aligned with their values and goals. This article defines palliative care, describes how it differs from hospice, debunks some common myths associated with hospice and palliative care, and offers suggestions on how primary care providers can integrate palliative care into their practice.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CPR ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation ), EOL ( end of life ), HPM ( hospice and palliative medicine ), PCP ( primary care provider )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .

Palliative care addresses symptoms directly to improve how the patient feels, regardless of the cause. As defined by the Center to Advance Palliative Care: Palliative care, also known as palliative medicine, is specialized medical care for people living with serious illness. It focuses on providing relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness—whatever the diagnosis. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the family.\n\n【28】删除3:<u>Center to Advance Palliative Care. About palliative care. https://www.capc.org/about/palliative-care/ .

Nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers, chaplains, and pharmacists work alongside physicians to address psychosocial and spiritual concerns of patients and families in addition to physical symptoms. Symptom management, psychosocial-spiritual support, and facilitation of medical decision making are 3 key domains of palliative care. The Table describes common elements of palliative care in each of these domains. Even with tremendous growth in the past 2 decades, including recognition of hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) as an official subspecialty of the American Board of Medical Subspecialties and the American Osteopathic Association, there remains a shortage of HPM specialists, which is projected to increase as the population ages.\n\n【31】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lupu D.</u>\n\n【32】American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine Workforce Task Force.

This lack of awareness creates an opportunity for clinicians to frame the benefits of palliative care for patients and their families. Yet the survey also found that most health care professionals erroneously equated palliative care with end-of-life (EOL) care. Clinicians who perceive palliative care as EOL care, or lack a clear understanding of its benefits, will miss critical opportunities to identify and address palliative care needs in their patients. Primary palliative care competencies for PCPs include (1) recognition of palliative care needs in patients, (2) prognostication, (3) advance care planning, (4) assessment and management of common symptoms in the seriously ill, (5) referral to specialty palliative, and (6) appropriate and timely referral to hospice.\n\n【54】Recognizing Palliative Care Needs in Primary Care Patients\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】Patients with a serious illness often experience substantial physical burden due to pain and symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and dyspnea. Anxiety and depression are also common after the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness. Any of these symptoms may alter a person's ability to fulfill roles critical to self-identity, such as athlete, caring spouse, or devoted parent. Through their longitudinal relationship, PCPs can help individuals explore these issues and find ways to adapt and prioritize in the face of a serious illness.\n\n【56】Many PCPs already engage in primary palliative care but may not recognize their actions as palliative care. Primary care providers commonly provide careful assessment of symptoms and recognition of how the symptoms affect that individual's quality of life. Many also routinely prescribe and titrate opioids for patients in pain.\n\n【57】无关删除-2:<u>*   Matlock D.D.</u>\n\n【58】The pain pendulum swinging again.\n\n【59】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Palliat Med._ 2015; 18 : 734-735</u></u>\n\n【60】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【61】Primary care providers often focus on maximizing quality of life by helping patients and their families find value and meaning, particularly when a patient's time or function is limited. It is important to help PCPs gain insight into primary palliative care that they already provide, so they may disentangle palliative care and EOL care and integrate palliative care to meet the needs of their patients. Effective symptom management promotes a patient's ability to remain active in important activities and relationships. When appropriate, palliative care counseling by PCPs can extend to family caregivers during active caregiving and into bereavement.\n\n【62】Prognostication and Communication\n---------------------------------\n\n【63】Patients with a serious illness commonly face difficult medical choices.

Thus, heightened awareness of patient factors that predict a shortened survival or elevated risks of decline are key palliative care skills.

Most PCPs believe that advance care planning is within their purview, but struggle to find adequate time during patient visits and address competing health conditions appropriately. In 2016, the Medicare program began reimbursing clinicians for counseling patients about advance care planning. This was an important step toward supporting clinicians for the considerable time it takes to have these crucial conversations. More deliberate prognostication efforts may help PCPs identify their patients for whom advance care planning is a priority.\n\n【85】Advance care planning includes encouraging patients to appoint a health care proxy or surrogate decision maker, facilitating discussions between the patient and their proxy about their wishes in the event of serious illness, and documenting these discussions. Importantly, most patients want information about prognosis in the setting of serious illness.\n\n【86】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hagerty R.G.\n*   Butow P.N.\n*   Ellis P.M.\n\n【87】Communicating with realism and hope: incurable cancer patients' views on the disclosure of prognosis.\n\n【88】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Clin Oncol._ 2005; 23 ( \\[published correction appears in J Clin Oncol. 2005;23(15):3652.

However, the terms _palliative care_ and _hospice_ should never be used interchangeably. In the United States, hospice is a critical, focused component of palliative care, with specific eligibility requirements driven by the 1983 Medicare hospice benefit. Hospice is usually provided in the patient's home to allow them to die comfortably surrounded by loved ones. Although fewer than 25% of Americans die at home despite an overwhelming desire to do so, more than 75% of patients on hospice die at home.\n\n【163】National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization\n\n【164】删除3:<u>http://www.allhealth.org/briefingmaterials/NHPCO-NHPCOsFactsandFigures-2005Findings-760.pdf</u>\n\n【165】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【166】Thus, hospice is really _the_ service that allows patients to die at home, if they choose to do so.\n\n【167】What Hospice Services Provide\n-----------------------------\n\n【168】Hospice is a team-based approach to care. Typically hospice is provided by an interdisciplinary team comprising a nurse, social worker, home health aides, chaplain, volunteers, and hospice medical director. Hospice has 4 levels of care: routine home care, general inpatient care, continuous care, and respite care. Most hospice care (96%) is routine home care, delivered in the patient's residence to ensure comfort and avoid hospitalization.\n\n【169】删除3:<u>http://www.nhpco.org/sites/default/files/public/Statistics\\_Research/Hospice\\_Levels\\_of\\_Care.pdf</u>\n\n【170】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【171】Members of the team visit the patient's home to assess symptoms, adjust medications to alleviate or mitigate symptoms, and provide support to the patient and family. Hospice covers durable medical equipment, such as a hospital bed, commode, and supplemental oxygen provided in the home as well as the cost of all medications related to the hospice diagnosis, including schedule II opioid analgesics. Finally, patients on hospice may access a hospice provider, usually a nurse, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by phone. When phone guidance is insufficient, the hospice provider will come to the patient's home day or night. Reliable, easy access to an expert provider provides comfort and reassurance to family members, who provide the bulk of care to patients, while helping to avoid emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Occasionally, patients on hospice with complex symptoms, such as refractory pain or agitated delirium, do require hospital care. Such patients can remain on hospice under the general inpatient benefit at either an inpatient hospice facility (if available) or a hospital, in which the hospice team visits them daily and continues to manage their care along with the inpatient hospital team. In contrast, the continuous care hospice benefit provides between 8 and 24 hours of medical care, usually nursing care, in the patient's home. The continuous care benefit is typically used to manage a complicated symptom or to allow a patient to remain at home, during a symptom crisis, with ample medical support. The hospice benefit will also provide up to 5 consecutive days of respite care in a facility, often a skilled nursing facility, to relieve stress of family caregivers. In 2012, continuous care and respite care combined accounted for less than 1% of hospice care delivered in the United States.\n\n【172】删除3:<u>http://www.nhpco.org/sites/default/files/public/Statistics\\_Research/Hospice\\_Levels\\_of\\_Care.pdf</u>\n\n【173】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【174】When starting hospice, patients choose a primary physician, often their PCP, to oversee their medical care while on hospice. This physician receives updates and changes in the patient's status and gives orders for medications as needed. Many patients fear abandonment by their regular providers when hospice is mentioned. By reassuring their patients that they will remain the physician in charge of their care, PCPs can mitigate this concern. Moreover, able patients on hospice can continue to come in for clinic visits with their PCP and other providers if they desire. However, most hospice benefits do not cover hospitalization unless required for a patient's comfort. In general, hospitalization requires that patients disenroll from hospice and resume prior insurance. Approximately 3% to 6% of patients enrolled in hospice get hospitalized, and many of these patients go on to receive high-intensity care, which indeed may conflict with their preference for comfort measures.\n\n【175】无关删除-2:<u>*   Cintron A.\n*   Hamel M.B.\n*   Davis R.B.\n*   Burns R.B.\n*   Phillips R.S.\n*   McCarthy E.P.</u>\n\n【176】Hospitalization of hospice patients with cancer.\n\n【177】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Palliat Med._ 2003; 6 : 757-768</u></u>\n\n【178】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (40)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【179】无关删除-2:<u>*   Wang S.Y.\n*   Aldridge M.D.\n*   Gross C.P.\n\n【180】Transitions Between Healthcare Settings of Hospice Enrollees at the End of Life.\n\n【181】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Am Geriatr Soc._ 2016; 64 : 314-322</u></u>\n\n【182】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (45)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【183】Limitations of Hospice\n----------------------\n\n【184】To qualify for hospice care, a physician must certify that the patient is expected to die within the next 6 months, if the disease follows its natural course. Once enrolled in hospice, a physician or hospice nurse practitioner must have at least 1 face-to-face visit with the patient in each of the first two 90-day periods, which certifies that the patient continues to meet the prognostic criteria. Patients surviving longer than 6 months require recertification once every 60 days, also accomplished through a face-to-face visit.\n\n【185】*   Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Medicare Hospice Benefit Facts\n\n【186】删除3:<u>https://www.cgsmedicare.com/hhh/education/materials/pdf/Medicare\\_Hospice\\_Benefit\\_Facts.pdf</u>\n\n【187】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【188】Occasionally, patients recover unexpectedly and no longer qualify for hospice. Such patients, often dubbed “hospice graduates,” disenroll from hospice and resume their prior medical care. Patients often qualify for hospice before actually being referred.

Primary care providers engaged in primary palliative care may help prepare patients and their families for an earlier transition to hospice.\n\n【194】The other major distinction in hospice care is that because of the reimbursement structure, hospice is required only to provide comfort-focused care related to the hospice diagnosis. The Medicare hospice benefit requires patients to forgo treatments aimed at curing their terminal diagnosis. Thus, many hospices will not accept patients receiving disease-directed care (eg, chemotherapy for cancer) because they will not be reimbursed for these therapies, even when the intent is palliative. Such treatments can delay referral to hospice while perpetuating the misconception that hospice is only for the final days of life. Some “open access” hospices allow patients to continue on disease-directed therapy, but this is negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Although receipt of hospice care has increased in recent years, the proportion of patients enrolling within 7 days has also increased.\n\n【195】无关删除-2:<u>*   Teno J.M.\n*   Gozalo P.L.\n*   Bynum J.P.\n\n【196】Change in end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries: site of death, place of care, and health care transitions in 2000, 2005, and 2009.\n\n【197】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 2013; 309 : 470-477</u></u>\n\n【198】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (771)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【199】Such late enrollment in hospice deprives patients and families of the chance to derive optimal benefits from hospice services\n\n【200】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bradley E.H.\n*   Prigerson H.\n*   Carlson M.D.\n*   Cherlin E.\n*   Johnson-Hurzeler R.\n*   Kasl S.V.</u>\n\n【201】Depression among surviving caregivers: does length of hospice enrollment matter?\n\n【202】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Psychiatry._ 2004; 161 : 2257-2262</u></u>\n\n【203】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (118)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【204】删除7:<u>;</u> timely referral to hospice is key to ensuring patients and families can take advantage of hospice benefits.\n\n【205】Overcoming Barriers to Hospice Use\n----------------------------------\n\n【206】Even among patients and health care professionals who understand the value of hospice, many still equate hospice to “giving up” and/or agreeing to shorten one's life.

The medical community is recognizing the importance of prioritizing medical treatments that promote quality of life along with interventions primarily aimed at prolonging survival. The expansion of primary palliative care delivered by PCPs will greatly promote symptom management and quality of life for patients throughout the course of a life-threatening illness, not just at the end. The development of new models of integrated palliative care will allow patients and families to consider their own personal goals and quality of life when making choices about the direction of their medical care. When attuned to patients' personal values, primary care providers can help individuals find meaning and joy when living with limited function and/or shortened life expectancy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Foreign visitors to Thailand during the 1850s and 1860s called him “The Doctor Prince.”\n\n【2】Prince Wongsa Dhiraj Snid (called Prince Nuam during his childhood) was the son of Somdej Pra Buddha Lertla Nabhalai (1767-1824; reigned in Siam from 1809-1824), later known as King Rama II, who served as the second monarch of Siam under the House of Chakri, the ruling royal dynasty of the Kingdom of Siam/Thailand since 1782. On his death, King Rama II was succeeded by his son, Prince Jessadabodindra, one of Prince Nuam's half brothers; Prince Jessadabodindra was later known as King Rama III (born 1787, reigned 1824-1851). Rama III's reign was notable for extensive wars against the neighboring kingdoms of Burma and Vietnam that established the Kingdom of Siam's political dominance in Southeast Asia, as well as increasing diplomatic contact with Western nations. When Rama III died, another of Prince Nuam's older brothers, Mongkut (later King Rama IV, 1804-1868; reigned 1851-1868) succeeded to the throne. Mongkut/Rama IV is best known to Westerners through the romantic but historically inaccurate 1956 Yul Brenner film, _The King and I_ .\n\n【3】Rama IV is remembered for his embrace of Western innovations and oversight of the technological and cultural modernization of Siam. Both Burma and Vietnam fell under European imperialistic hegemony during the early reign of Rama IV. Eager to avoid a similar fate for Siam, Rama IV sent numerous diplomatic missions to the governments of Great Britain, France, Denmark, Prussia, the United States, and other contemporary Western powers, seeking to maintain peace and strengthen trade links. Rama IV called on his younger brother, Prince Wongsa Dhiraj Snid, to lead Siam's international negotiation team. Like Rama IV, Prince Wongsa Dhiraj Snid was fluent in English and several other languages, and his adroit diplomacy and forceful personality led to numerous successful treaties that helped preserve peace and a balance of power in Siam and Southeast Asia for many years.\n\n【4】Apart from those official noble duties, Prince Wongsa Dhiraj Snid is recognized as the first Thai physician to use quinine to treat malaria, which he learned about as a young man from foreign religious missionaries. Little is known about the Prince's formal medical training, but it is probable that he was apprenticed to a senior Thai physician practicing traditional medicine. Prince Wongsa Dhiraj Snid also wrote the first textbook of Thai traditional herbal medicine, compiled in a comprehensive and “modern” scientific style after lengthy self-study. He served as his brother Rama IV's personal physician and led the Office of Royal Medicine for many years. In addition, he was the first Thai physician to be recognized by the Western medical establishment, and as such he was granted honorary membership by numerous European and American medical societies. He also wrote textbooks on grammar and history, which became part of the national school curriculum in Siam during the reign of King Rama V (1853-1910; ruled from 1868.)\n\n【5】Following recognition by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a “Great World Personality” in 2008 (the 200  anniversary of his birth), Prince Wongsa Dhiraj Snid was honored philatelically by Thailand in 2009 (Scott No. 2406).\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【8】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.04.020</u></u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>© 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

When the retractile testicle is residing in the groin, it might be easily guided by hand into its proper position in the scrotum — the bag of skin hanging behind the penis — during a physical exam. Upon release, the testicle will remain in the proper position at least temporarily.\n\n【2】For most boys, the problem of a retractile testicle goes away sometime before or during puberty. The testicle moves to its correct location in the scrotum and stays there permanently.\n\n【3】Sometimes the retractile testicle remains in the groin and is no longer movable. When this happens, the condition is called an ascending testicle or an acquired undescended testicle.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Testicles form in the abdomen during fetal development. During the final months of development, the testicles gradually descend into the scrotum. If this descent isn't completed at birth, the testicle usually descends within a few months. If your son has a retractile testicle, the testicle originally descended as it should, but doesn't remain in place.\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms of a retractile testicle include:\n\n【7】*   The testicle may be moved by hand from the groin into the scrotum and won't immediately retreat to the groin.\n*   The testicle might spontaneously appear in the scrotum and remain there for a time.\n*   The testicle might spontaneously disappear again for a time.\n\n【8】Retractile testicle is different from undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). An undescended testicle is one that never entered the scrotum.\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】During regular well-baby checkups and annual childhood checkups, your son's doctor will examine your son's testicles to determine if they're descended and appropriately developed. If you believe that your son has a retractile or ascending testicle — or have other concerns about the development of his testicles — see his doctor. He or she will tell you how often to schedule checkups to monitor changes in the condition.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】An overactive muscle causes a testicle to become a retractile testicle. The cremaster muscle is a thin pouch-like muscle in which a testicle rests. When the cremaster muscle contracts, it pulls the testicle up toward the body. The cremaster reflex can be stimulated by rubbing a nerve on the inner thigh and by emotion, such as fear and laughter. The cremaster is also activated by a cold environment.\n\n【13】If the cremaster reflex is strong enough, it can result in a retractile testicle, pulling the testicle out of the scrotum and up into the groin.\n\n【14】Complications\n-------------\n\n【15】Retractile testicles are generally not associated with complications, aside from a greater risk of the testicle becoming an ascending testicle.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Thrombotic outcomes (venous and arterial) were identified from the hospital problem list.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We identified 3790 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 testing across 19 hospitals, 102 of whom had positive test results. The median age was lower in the COVID-positive patients (62 vs 67 years; _P_ \\=.03). The median duration of hospitalization was longer in COVID-positive patients (8.5 vs 4 days; _P_ <.001) and more required intensive care unit care (56.9% \\[58 of 102\\] vs 26.8% \\[987 of 3688\\]; _P_ <.001). Comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation/flutter, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and malignancy, were observed less frequently with COVID-positive admissions. Any venous thromboembolism was identified in 2.9% of COVID-positive patients (3 of 102) and 4.6% of COVID-negative patients (168 of 3688). The frequency of venous and arterial events was not different between the groups. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for COVID-positive–patients for any venous thromboembolism was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.19 to 2.02). A multivariable logistic regression model evaluated death within 30 days of hospital discharge; neither COVID positivity (adjusted OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.54 to 2.34) nor thromboembolism (adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.32) was associated with death.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Early experience in patients with COVID-19 across multiple academic and regional hospitals representing different US regions demonstrates a lower than previously reported incidence of thrombotic events.

For patients with multiple hospitalizations during the study period, only the first hospital admission was included. Patients transferred between hospitals within the Mayo Clinic enterprise had the entire episode of care evaluated. Patients were excluded if lacking Minnesota research authorization.\n\n【51】#### Electronic Health Record Outcome Definitions\n\n【52】Patient characteristics were identified from clinically recorded data. The problem list (a list of physician-maintained diagnoses from discharge diagnoses) with a separate designation for hospital problems was used to identify comorbid conditions and thromboembolic outcomes. Venous and arterial macrovascular thrombotic outcomes were evaluated. Venous thromboembolism included diagnoses of pulmonary embolism (PE), upper and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT), portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis, and cerebral vein thrombosis. Arterial thrombotic events analyzed included myocardial infarction (ST or non-ST elevation), acute stroke or transient ischemic attack, systemic arterial thrombosis, renal infarction, or limb ischemia. Major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was determined by medical record review as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.\n\n【53】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kaatz S.\n*   Ahmad D.\n*   Spyropoulos A.C.\n*   Schulman S.</u>\n\n【54】Subcommittee on Control of Anticoagulation  \nDefinition of clinically relevant non-major bleeding in studies of anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolic disease in non-surgical patients: communication from the SSC of the ISTH.\n\n【55】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Thromb Haemost._ 2015; 13 : 2119-2126</u></u>\n\n【56】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (718)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【57】As determined by the hospital problem list, bleeding events were not included based on the severity of bleeding by these definitions. Thromboembolic outcomes and anticoagulant type, dosing, and duration used in the hospital were also evaluated specifically in COVID-19–positive patients by physician medical record review.\n\n【58】#### Natural Language Processing Outcome Definitions\n\n【59】Additionally, DVT and PE were evaluated using natural language processing (NLP) from radiology reports occurring immediately before or during admission. All radiology reports of computed tomography (CT) scans that included the chest and used intravenous contrast medium and all venous duplex ultrasonograms of the upper or lower extremity were analyzed. Natural language processing algorithms to identify new/acute, or progressive PE and new/acute, or progressive DVT were created, tested, and applied to the text from the radiology report. A separate database of imaging reports (not this cohort) was initially used for algorithm development (PE and DVT). After initial testing, a reiterative approach to algorithm refinement was used, adding additional reports, with subsequent analyses enriched with positive cases as defined by the previous algorithm. This step was done to more equally review reports with positive findings since a large majority of reports were negative. A physician reviewed radiology imaging reports from the testing database to make a determination of positive or negative for the finding as defined previously. For the DVT algorithm, 1752 lower extremity duplex ultrasonography reports were used in addition to 787 upper extremity duplex ultrasonography reports. The final NLP algorithm for DVT in the lower extremity reports had 98.2% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity and for the upper extremity had 97.8% sensitivity and 99.2% specificity. The final NLP algorithm for PE correctly identified 325 of 327 reports with PE (as defined previously; sensitivity of 99.4%) and 672 of 673 reports without PE (specificity of 99.9%).\n\n【60】### Statistical Analyses\n\n【61】Baseline demographic characteristics and clinical features were compared among patient groups: COVID-19–positive vs COVID-19–negative. Continuous variables were reported as median and interquartile ranges and were compared between groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers and percentages and compared between groups using the χ  test for independence. The odds ratio (OR) of any VTE and any thromboembolic event (composite of arterial and venous thrombosis) was examined by logistic regression based on results from COVID-19 testing. A multivariable logistic regression model with age, sex, body mass index, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation/flutter, cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cirrhosis was then used to examine the OR for any VTE and thromboembolism based on results from COVID-19 testing. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), and data analysis was performed using SAS statistical software (SAS Institute). The Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board approved the study.\n\n【62】Results\n-------\n\n【63】A total of 3790 patients with hospital admission and COVID-19 testing were identified across 19 different hospitals, and 102 patients had positive test results. COVID-19–positive patients were initially identified in early March, with patients being identified in all states with Mayo Clinic sites (Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) by the end of March. The median age was lower in the COVID-positive patients 删除4:<u>(62 vs 67 years; _P_ \\=.03; Table 1 )</u>, and most patients were White. Comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation/flutter, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and malignancy were all observed less frequently with COVID-positive admissions 删除4:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. A history of VTE was present in 2.9% of COVID-19–positive (3 of 102) vs 3.4% of COVID-19–negative (127 of 3688) patients ( _P_ \\=.78). Among patients with a previously known and recorded ABO blood type, there was no significant difference between COVID-19–positive and COVID-19–negative patients ( _P_ \\=.21). The median length of hospitalization was longer in COVID-positive patients (8.5 vs 4 days; _P_ <.001), and more required ICU care (56.9% \\[58 of 102\\] vs 26.8% \\[987 of 3688\\]; _P_ <.001). COVID-19–positive patients were more likely to have upper extremity duplex ultrasonography (3.9% \\[4 of 102\\] vs 1.5% \\[54 of 3688\\]; _P_ \\=.05) and lower extremity duplex ultrasonography (20.6% \\[21 of 102\\] vs 13.0% \\[481 of 3688\\]; _P_ \\=.03), with a trend toward more CT scans of the chest (26.5% \\[27 of 102\\] vs 20.7% \\[763 of 3688\\]; _P_ \\=.08).\n\n【64】Table 1 Characteristics and Comorbidities in 3790 COVID-19–Positive and COVID-19–Negative Hospitalized Patients\n\n【65】删除3:<u>BMI, body mass index; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CT, computed tomography; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; LOS, length of stay; US, ultrasonography; VTE, venous thromboembolism.</u>\n\n【66】Data are presented as median (IQR) or No. (percentage) of patients.\n\n| Variable | COVID-19– positive (N=102) | COVID-19– negative (N=3688) | _P_ value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age (y) | 62 (52-74) | 67 (54-78) | .03 |\n| BMI (kg/m 2 ) | 28.9 (24.7-35.7) | 27.2 (23.4-32.5) | .005 |\n| Male | 60 (58.8) | 1907 (51.7) | .16 |\n| Race |  |  | <.001 |\n| White | 71 (69.6) | 3278 (88.9) |  |\n| Black | 9 (8.8) | 193 (5.2) |  |\n| Asian | 7 (6.9) | 56 (1.5) |  |\n| Other | 5 (4.9) | 30 (0.8) |  |\n| Unknown | 10 (9.8) | 131 (3.6) |  |\n| LOS (d) | 8.5 (4.0-14.25) | 4 (3-7) | <.001 |\n| ICU care | 58 (56.9) | 987 (26.8) | <.001 |\n| Hospital day of COVID test | 1 (0-4) | 0 (0-1) | <.001 |\n| Blood type | 41 (40.2) | 2184 (59.2) | .21 |\n| AB | 2 (4.9) | 84 (3.8) |  |\n| A | 16 (39.0) | 905 (41.4) |  |\n| B | 1 (2.4) | 267 (12.2) |  |\n| O | 22 (53.7) | 928 (42.5) |  |\n| Comorbidities |  |  |  |\n| History of VTE | 3 (2.9) | 127 (3.4) | .78 |\n| Atrial fibrillation/flutter | 13 (12.7) | 848 (23.0) | .02 |\n| Heart failure | 14 (13.7) | 968 (26.2) | .004 |\n| Atherosclerosis | 12 (11.8) | 956 (25.9) | .001 |\n| Hypertension | 48 (47.1) | 2188 (59.3) | .01 |\n| Diabetes mellitus | 28 (27.4) | 1080 (29.3) | .68 |\n| Malignancy | 13 (12.7) | 983 (26.6) | .002 |\n| Acute kidney injury | 8 (7.8) | 332 (9.0) | .69 |\n| Chronic kidney disease | 14 (13.7) | 952 (25.8) | .006 |\n| End-stage renal disease | 3 (2.9) | 153 (4.1) | .55 |\n| Asthma | 9 (8.8) | 312 (8.5) | .90 |\n| COPD | 9 (8.8) | 497 (13.5) | .17 |\n| Obstructive sleep apnea | 10 (9.8) | 422 (11.4) | .61 |\n| Hypothyroidism | 17 (16.7) | 639 (17.3) | .86 |\n| Cirrhosis | 0 | 161 (4.4) | .03 |\n| Imaging studies (at least once during hospitalization) |  |  |  |\n| Any chest CT with contrast | 27 (26.5) | 763 (20.7) | .08 |\n| Upper extremity duplex US | 4 (3.9) | 54 (1.5) | .05 |\n| Lower extremity duplex US | 21 (20.6) | 481 (13.0) | .03 |\n\n【68】删除3:<u>a BMI, body mass index; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CT, computed tomography; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; LOS, length of stay; US, ultrasonography; VTE, venous thromboembolism.</u>\n\n【69】b Data are presented as median (IQR) or No. (percentage) of patients.\n\n【70】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【71】### Evaluation of Clinical Outcomes Using the Hospital Problem List\n\n【72】Using the hospital problem list to identify outcomes, there were no significant differences between COVID-19–positive and COVID-19–negative patients in the frequency of venous thrombosis, including any VTE event (2.9% \\[3 of 102\\] vs 4.6% \\[168 of 3688\\]), PE (1.0% \\[1 of 102\\] vs 2.5% \\[91 of 3688\\]), lower extremity DVT (0% \\[0 of 102\\] vs 1.7% \\[62 of 3688\\]), cerebral vein (0% \\[0 of 102\\] vs 0.2% \\[6 of 3688\\]), and atypical DVT (0% \\[0 of 102\\] vs 0.5% \\[19 of 3688\\]) 删除4:<u>( _P_ \\>.05 for all; Table 2 )</u>.

No differences were noted between the medical record review and hospital problem list regarding acute stroke and myocardial infarction outcomes. Despite some minor differences, there were no changes in the aforementioned results 删除4:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Five major bleeding events occurred. All major bleeding occurred in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. Of the 5 major bleeding events, 3 occurred in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation for diagnosis of upper extremity catheter-associated DVT. One bleeding event was associated with therapeutic anticoagulation for an incidentally identified right atrial thrombus. The other major bleeding event was related to anticoagulation in a patient receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Major bleeding occurred in the respiratory tract in 2 patients, in the gastrointestinal tract in 1, as a retroperitoneal hemorrhage in 1, and at other sites in 1. Nonmajor bleeding occurred in 2 patients, 1 who was receiving therapeutic anticoagulation and 1 who was not receiving anticoagulation.\n\n【83】When using NLP to measure outcomes from radiology reports, no significant differences were observed between the COVID-19–positive and COVID-19–negative groups 删除4:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Minor discrepancies were noted between the NLP algorithm interpretation of imaging studies and the medical record review outcomes. The discrepancies included one PE noted on the problem list that occurred at an outside hospital before the patient was transferred to our facility and therefore was not captured as an “in-hospital” event by the NLP imaging definition. Additionally, one upper extremity DVT was described as a chronic DVT on ultrasonography, yet due to the presence of an associated central catheter, the treatment team had decided to initiate anticoagulation and it was therefore considered to be an “acute DVT” on medical record review.\n\n【84】Discussion\n----------\n\n【85】In this enterprise-wide sample of regional and tertiary care hospitals early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the clinically important findings in 3790 hospitalized patients included (1) no major difference in the rates of thromboembolic complications (both arterial and venous) among COVID-19–positive vs COVID-19–negative patients, (2) COVID-19 positivity or thromboembolic events were not found to be associated with death within 30 days of hospitalization on multivariable analysis, and (3) COVID-19–positive patients had longer median length of hospitalization and more often needed ICU care than COVID-19–negative patients.\n\n【86】The findings of longer median length of hospitalization and need for ICU care among COVID-19–positive patients are in concordance with those of other studies that report an increased length of hospital stay and the probability of ICU admission in COVID-19–positive patients.\n\n【87】无关删除-2:<u>*   Rees E.M.\n*   Nightingale E.S.\n*   Jafari Y.\n\n【88】COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis.\n\n【89】删除3:<u>_BMC Med._ 2020; 18 : 270</u>\n\n【90】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (295)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【91】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lewnard J.A.\n*   Liu V.X.\n*   Jackson M.L.\n\n【92】Incidence, clinical outcomes, and transmission dynamics of severe coronavirus disease 2019 in California and Washington: prospective cohort study \\[published correction appears in _BM_ J. 2020;369:m2205\\].\n\n【93】删除3:<u>_BMJ._ 2020; 369 : m1923</u>\n\n【94】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (136)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【95】The length of stay depends on multiple factors, including varying levels of severity of COVID-19 presentation, associated comorbidity burden, and mortality.

Compared with the traditionally used risk assessment models (eg, the Padua Prediction Score), which do not address the increased risk of thromboembolism in the setting of COVID-19, 2 possible approaches of personalizing thromboprophylactic regimens could include (1) assessment of intrinsic thrombogenicity using viscoelastic methods of clot formation\n\n【134】无关删除-2:<u>*   Chaudhary R.\n*   Kreutz R.P.\n*   Bliden K.P.\n*   Tantry U.S.\n*   Gurbel P.A.</u>\n\n【135】Personalizing antithrombotic therapy in COVID-19: role of thromboelastography and thromboelastometry.\n\n【136】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Thromb Haemost._ 2020; 120 : 1594-1596</u></u>\n\n【137】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (31)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【138】and (2) using factor Xa levels to guide the intensity of thromboprophylactic regimens.\n\n【139】无关删除-2:<u>*   Dutt T.\n*   Simcox D.\n*   Downey C.\n\n【140】Thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19: anti-FXa—the missing factor \\[letter\\]?\n\n【141】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Respir Crit Care Med._ 2020; 202 : 455-457</u></u>\n\n【142】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (35)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【143】Our study has both strengths and limitations. The combined methodologies to identify outcomes within the COVID-19–positive and COVID-19–negative groups makes it extremely unlikely that thromboembolic outcome definitions were substantially underrepresented or overrepresented. Furthermore, the electronic definitions, even with a finite error rate, help eliminate assessment bias. Increased imaging within the COVID-19–positive cohort would be anticipated, with a larger number requiring ICU care. If anything, this finding would bias the results toward a higher thromboembolic rate due to the potential to identify incidental thrombotic events. Including all CT scans of the chest that used contrast medium in the NLP algorithm to identify PE also helps account for the potential incidental PEs identified. Another strength of this analysis is the study design and inclusion of only patients undergoing COVID-19 testing during associated hospital admission. This factor helps to create similar cohorts for comparison because patients testing positive for COVID-19 as an outpatient who are struggling with the illness for days or weeks preceding the hospitalization may be likely to have a higher baseline thrombotic risk than patients presenting more acutely due to the preceding inflammatory state and immobility. Also, selecting a control population that also had testing and was known to have negative results helps reduce unmeasured confounding between the groups and provides the most accurate control population. Some patients with COVID-19 might have been unrecognized early in the pandemic. Another possible source of bias in other studies from large academic medical centers is referral bias. Although this cohort did include patients from tertiary referral centers, it also included numerous smaller regional hospitals that likely better reflect the population as a whole.\n\n【144】Despite attempts to create more similar patient cohorts for comparison, we did see substantial differences in underlying comorbidities between the groups. As expected, patients who required hospitalization in the absence of COVID-19–positive testing had a higher degree of comorbid disease, which could not be fully adjusted for in multivariable analyses due to the sample size and low event rate. However, when considering whether anticoagulation should be used at higher than prophylactic doses, assessing these event rates in an unadjusted comparison can be helpful. Another important consideration in the data presented is that no formal or enterprise-wide algorithm was in place during the study period for either anticoagulation management or serial assessment for thromboembolic events. This factor helps reduce bias that may have occurred in other observational studies from increased testing and screening of COVID-19–positive patients. Additionally, the readmission group was excluded by the design of the current study, and therefore, we may have missed quite a few VTEs in COVID-19–positive patients that occurred at a later stage of the disease; future studies should investigate VTE events more broadly.\n\n【145】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【146】Early experience with COVID-19–positive patients across multiple academic and regional hospitals representing different regions of the United States demonstrated a lower than previously reported incidence of thrombotic events in a high-risk cohort, which was not considerably higher than that of COVID-19–negative hospitalized patients. Although some COVID-19–positive patients may be at very high risk for thromboembolism, further risk classification strategies are needed to better identify these patients. Our data do not support a more aggressive anticoagulation regimen for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We recommend a more conservative/cautious approach until clinical trials demonstrate the benefit of higher-intensity anticoagulation regimens.\n\n【147】无关删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【148】无关删除-1:<u>The content of this work is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.</u>\n\n【149】无关删除-1:<u>All the authors were involved in the conception and design of the study or analysis and interpretation of the data and drafting of the manuscript or revising it critically and have read and approved the final submitted manuscript.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

FA-8\n2.  Folacin-800\n3.  Natures Blend Folic Acid\n4.  ViloFane-Dp 75\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Vitamins are compounds that you must have for growth and health. They are needed in small amounts only and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Folic acid (vitamin B 9) is necessary for strong blood.\n\n【6】Lack of folic acid may lead to anemia (weak blood). Your health care professional may treat this by prescribing folic acid for you.\n\n【7】Some conditions may increase your need for folic acid. These include:\n\n【8】*   Alcoholism\n*   Anemia, hemolytic\n*   Diarrhea (continuing)\n*   Fever (prolonged)\n*   Hemodialysis\n*   Illness (prolonged)\n*   Intestinal diseases\n*   Liver disease\n*   Stress (continuing)\n*   Surgical removal of stomach\n\n【9】In addition, infants smaller than normal, breast-fed infants, or those receiving unfortified formulas (such as evaporated milk or goat's milk) may need additional folic acid.\n\n【10】Increased need for folic acid should be determined by your health care professional.\n\n【11】Some studies have found that folic acid taken by women before they become pregnant and during early pregnancy may reduce the chances of certain birth defects (neural tube defects).\n\n【12】Claims that folic acid and other B vitamins are effective for preventing mental problems have not been proven. Many of these treatments involve large and expensive amounts of vitamins.\n\n【13】Injectable folic acid is given by or under the direction of your health care professional. Another form of folic acid is available without a prescription.\n\n【14】### Importance of Diet\n\n【15】For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.\n\n【16】Folic acid is found in various foods, including vegetables, especially green vegetables; potatoes; cereal and cereal products; fruits; and organ meats (for example, liver or kidney). It is best to eat fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible since they contain the most vitamins. Food processing may destroy some of the vitamins. For example, heat may reduce the amount of folic acid in foods.\n\n【17】Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods.\n\n【18】The daily amount of folic acid needed is defined in several different ways.\n\n【19】#### For U.S.—\n\n【20】*   Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g. pregnancy).\n*   Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).\n\n【21】#### For Canada—\n\n【22】*   Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.\n\n【23】Normal daily recommended intakes in micrograms (mcg) for folic acid are generally defined as follows:\n\n【24】Information about this folic-acid-oral-route-injection-route\n\n| Persons | U.S.(mcg) | Canada(mcg) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Infants and childrenBirth to 3 years of age | 25–100 | 50–80 |\n| 4 to 6 years of age | 75–400 | 90 |\n| 7 to 10 years of age | 100–400 | 125–180 |\n| Adolescent and adult males | 150–400 | 150–220 |\n| Adolescent and adult females | 150–400 | 145–190 |\n| Pregnant females | 400–800 | 445–475 |\n| Breast-feeding females | 260–800 | 245–275 |\n\n【26】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【27】*   Capsule\n*   Solution\n*   Tablet\n\n【28】Before Using\n------------\n\n【29】If you are taking this dietary supplement without a prescription, carefully read and follow any precautions on the label.

The results of the BAL-ICH panel and TBBx were compared and subsequent management decisions analyzed from clinical notes. We identified changes in immunosuppressive agents, antibiotics, chemotherapy, goals of care, and decisions on further evaluation and procedures. We assessed whether the TBBx findings added information not identified on the BAL-ICH panel and other bronchoscopic sampling methods performed during the same procedure that justified subsequent management changes.</u>\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 192 bronchoscopic procedures performed on immunocompromised patients with acute and subacute pulmonary radiographic abnormalities, management changes justified by the unique positive results of the TBBx occurred 28% (51/192) of the time. Those immunocompromised by solid malignant neoplasms and receiving active immunosuppressive therapy had management changes justified 62.1% (18/29) of the time by the TBBx results. No additional fungal organisms were identified on TBBx that were accounted for on the BAL-ICH panel.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Transbronchial biopsy may add information to other bronchoscopic findings in immunocompromised patients, especially those with solid malignant neoplasms receiving active immunosuppressive treatment.

Pseudobulbar affect typically occurs in people with certain neurological conditions or injuries, which might affect the way the brain controls emotion.\n\n【2】If you have pseudobulbar affect you'll experience emotions normally, but you'll sometimes express them in an exaggerated or inappropriate way. As a result, the condition can be embarrassing and disruptive to your daily life.\n\n【3】Pseudobulbar affect often goes undiagnosed or is mistaken for mood disorders. Once diagnosed, however, pseudobulbar affect can be managed with medication.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The primary sign of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is frequent, involuntary and uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing that are exaggerated or not connected to your emotional state. Laughter often turns to tears. Your mood will appear normal between episodes, which can occur at any time. Crying appears to be a more common sign of PBA than laughing.\n\n【6】The degree of the emotional response caused by PBA is often striking, with crying or laughing lasting up to several minutes. For example, you might laugh uncontrollably in response to a mildly amusing comment. Or you might laugh or cry in situations that others don't see as funny or sad. These emotional responses typically represent a change from how you would have previously responded.\n\n【7】Because pseudobulbar affect often involves crying, the condition is frequently mistaken for depression. However, PBA episodes tend to be short in duration, while depression causes a persistent feeling of sadness. Also, people with PBA often lack certain features of depression, such as sleep disturbances or a loss of appetite. But depression is common among those who have pseudobulbar affect.\n\n【8】#### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】If you think you have PBA, talk to your doctor. If you have a neurological condition, you might already be treated by a doctor who can diagnose PBA. Helpful specialists include neuropsychologists, neurologists and psychiatrists.\n\n【10】It's suspected that many cases of pseudobulbar affect go unreported and undiagnosed due to a lack of awareness about the condition.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) typically occurs in people with neurological conditions or injuries, including:\n\n【13】*   Stroke\n*   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\n*   Multiple sclerosis (MS)\n*   Traumatic brain injury\n*   Alzheimer's disease\n*   Parkinson's disease\n\n【14】While further research is needed, the cause of PBA is believed to involve injury to the neurological pathways that regulate the external expression of emotion (affect).\n\n【15】Complications\n-------------\n\n【16】Severe symptoms of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) can cause embarrassment, social isolation, anxiety and depression. The condition might interfere with your ability to work and do daily tasks, especially when you're already coping with a neurological condition.\n\n【17】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "66007a0d-2c78-4196-a86c-3929fa7a16db", "title": "Wheat allergy", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Wheat allergy is an allergic reaction to foods containing wheat. Allergic reactions can be caused by eating wheat and also, in some cases, by inhaling wheat flour.\n\n【2】Avoiding wheat is the primary treatment for wheat allergy, but that isn't always as easy as it sounds. Wheat is found in many foods, including some you might not suspect, such as soy sauce, ice cream and hot dogs. Medications may be necessary to manage allergic reactions if you accidentally eat wheat.\n\n【3】Wheat allergy sometimes is confused with celiac disease, but these conditions differ. Wheat allergy occurs when your body produces antibodies to proteins found in wheat. In celiac disease, a specific protein in wheat — gluten — causes a different kind of abnormal immune system reaction.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】A child or adult with wheat allergy is likely to develop signs and symptoms within minutes to hours after eating something containing wheat. Wheat allergy signs and symptoms include:\n\n【6】*   Swelling, itching or irritation of the mouth or throat\n*   Hives, itchy rash or swelling of the skin\n*   Nasal congestion\n*   Headache\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Cramps, nausea or vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Anaphylaxis\n\n【7】### Anaphylaxis\n\n【8】For some people, wheat allergy may cause a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. In addition to other signs and symptoms of wheat allergy, anaphylaxis may cause:\n\n【9】*   Swelling or tightness of the throat\n*   Chest pain or tightness\n*   Severe difficulty breathing\n*   Trouble swallowing\n*   Pale, blue skin color\n*   Dizziness or fainting\n\n【10】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【11】If someone shows signs of anaphylaxis, call 911 or your local emergency number. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires immediate care.\n\n【12】If you suspect that you or your child is allergic to wheat or another food, see your doctor.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】If you have wheat allergy, exposure to a wheat protein primes your immune system for an allergic reaction. You can develop an allergy to any of the four classes of wheat proteins — albumin, globulin, gliadin and gluten.\n\n【15】### Sources of wheat proteins\n\n【16】Some sources of wheat proteins are obvious, such as bread, but all wheat proteins — and gluten in particular — can be found in many prepared foods and even in some cosmetics, bath products and play dough. Foods that may include wheat proteins include:\n\n【17】*   Breads and bread crumbs\n*   Cakes, muffins and cookies\n*   Breakfast cereals\n*   Pasta\n*   Couscous\n*   Farina\n*   Semolina\n*   Spelt\n*   Crackers\n*   Hydrolyzed vegetable protein\n*   Soy sauce\n*   Meat products, such as hot dogs\n*   Dairy products, such as ice cream\n*   Natural flavorings\n*   Gelatinized starch\n*   Modified food starch\n*   Vegetable gum\n\n【18】If you have wheat allergy, it's possible you might also be allergic to barley, oats and rye. Unless you're allergic to grains other than wheat, though, the recommended wheat-free diet is less restrictive than a gluten-free diet.\n\n【19】### Wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis\n\n【20】Some people with wheat allergy develop symptoms only if they exercise within a few hours after eating wheat. Exercise-induced changes in your body either trigger an allergic reaction or worsen an immune system response to a wheat protein. This condition usually results in life-threatening anaphylaxis.\n\n【21】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【22】Certain factors may put you at greater risk of developing wheat allergy:\n\n【23】*   **Family history.** You're at increased risk of allergy to wheat or other foods if your parents have food allergies or other allergies, such as asthma.\n*   **Age.** Wheat allergy is most common in babies and toddlers, who have immature immune and digestive systems. Most children outgrow wheat allergy by 16, but adults can develop it, often as a cross-sensitivity to grass pollen.\n\n【24】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Medical records were abstracted to determine admission diagnoses; patient demographics and comorbid conditions; indications for anticoagulation; laboratory data; and treatment and discharge medications, including whether LMWH was prescribed. A _delay_ was defined as the continuation of hospitalization solely to administer intravenous heparin. Predefined criteria were used to classify the delay of discharge as appropriate or avoidable on the basis of the patient's potential eligibility for outpatient treatment with LMWH.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Discharge was delayed for 75 of 309 patients (24%; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 19%-29%); during analysis of the avoidability of delay, 67 of the 75 medical records were available and showed that 32 of 67 delays (48%; 95% CI, 35%-60%) were avoidable. Of patients taking long-term OAC medications who were admitted for reasons unrelated to thromboembolism or bleeding, discharge was delayed for 18 of 146 (12%; 95% CI, 7%-19%); during analysis of the avoidability of delay, 16 of the 18 medical records were available and showed that 9 of 16 delays (56%; 95% CI, 30%-80%) were avoidable. Of patients admitted for acute venous thromboembolism who were not taking long-term OAC medications, discharge was delayed for 24 of 38 (63%; 95% CI, 46%-78%); during analysis of the avoidability of delay, 22 of the 24 medical records were available and showed that 11 of 22 delays (50%; 95% CI, 28%-72%) were avoidable.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】For patients taking OAC medications, hospital discharge is frequently delayed so that intravenous heparin can be administered; approximately half of these delays could be avoided by outpatient use of LMWH. Studies of the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of outpatient use of LMWH for indications other than deep venous thrombosis are needed because timely discharge of these patients could substantially decrease health care costs.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】CI ( confidence interval ), DVT ( deep venous thrombosis ), LMWH ( low-molecular-weight heparin ), OAC ( oral anticoagulation )\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "a0a6aeaf-f941-4cf9-86d1-409a3c02eea5", "title": "Medical abortion", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Medical abortion is a procedure that uses medicine to end a pregnancy. A medical abortion doesn't require surgery or anesthesia. It can be started in a medical office or at home with follow-up visits to your health care provider. It's safest and most effective during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\n【2】Having a medical abortion is a major decision with emotional and psychological consequences. If you're considering this procedure, make sure you understand what it entails, side effects, possible risks, complications and alternatives.\n\n【3】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【4】The reasons for having a medical abortion are highly personal. You can choose medical abortion to complete an early miscarriage or end an unintended pregnancy. You can also choose to have a medical abortion if you have a medical condition that makes continuing a pregnancy life-threatening.\n\n【5】Risks\n-----\n\n【6】Potential risks of medical abortion include:\n\n【7】*   Incomplete abortion, which may need to be followed by surgical abortion\n*   An ongoing pregnancy if the procedure doesn't work\n*   Heavy and prolonged bleeding\n*   Infection\n*   Fever\n*   Digestive system discomfort\n\n【8】If you decide to continue the pregnancy after taking medicine used in medical abortion, your pregnancy may be at risk of major complications.\n\n【9】Medical abortion hasn't been shown to affect future pregnancies unless complications develop.\n\n【10】Medical abortion isn't an option if you:\n\n【11】*   **Are too far along in your pregnancy.** You shouldn't attempt a medical abortion if you've been pregnant for more than nine weeks (after the start of your last period). Some types of medical abortion aren't done after seven weeks of pregnancy.\n*   **Have an intrauterine device (IUD)** currently in place.\n*   **Have a suspected pregnancy outside of the uterus.** This is called ectopic pregnancy.\n*   **Have certain medical conditions.** These include bleeding disorders; certain heart or blood vessel diseases; severe liver, kidney or lung disease; or an uncontrolled seizure disorder.\n*   **Take a blood thinner** or certain steroid medicines.\n*   **Can't make follow-up visits to your provider** or don't have access to emergency care.\n*   **Have an allergy to the medicine used.**\n\n【12】A surgical procedure called a dilation and curettage (D&C) may be an option if you can't have a medical abortion.\n\n【13】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【14】Before a medical abortion, your health care provider will likely:\n\n【15】*   Evaluate your medical history and overall health\n*   Confirm your pregnancy with a physical exam\n*   Do an ultrasound exam to date the pregnancy and check that it's not outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) and not a tumor that developed in the uterus (molar pregnancy)\n*   Do blood and urine tests\n*   Explain how the procedure works, the side effects, and possible risks and complications\n\n【16】Making the decision to have an abortion might not be easy. Consider seeking support from your partner, a family member or a friend as you think about your options. Talk with your health care provider to get answers to your questions, help you weigh alternatives and consider the impact the procedure may have on your future.\n\n【17】No health care provider is required to perform an elective abortion. In some places, an elective abortion may not be legal. Or there may be certain legal requirements and waiting periods to follow before having an elective abortion. If you're having an abortion procedure for a miscarriage, there are no special legal requirements or waiting periods required.\n\n【18】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【19】Medical abortion doesn't require surgery or anesthesia. The procedure can be started in a medical office or clinic. A medical abortion can also be done at home, though you'll still need to visit your health care provider to be sure there are no complications.\n\n【20】### During the procedure\n\n【21】Medical abortion can be done using these medicines:\n\n【22】*   **Oral mifepristone (Mifeprex) and oral misoprostol (Cytotec).** This is the most common type of medical abortion. These medicines are usually taken within seven weeks of the first day of your last period.\n\n【23】    Mifepristone (mif-uh-PRIS-tone) blocks the hormone progesterone, causing the lining of the uterus to thin and preventing the embryo from staying implanted and growing. Misoprostol (my-so-PROS-tol), a different kind of medicine, causes the uterus to contract and expel the embryo through the vagina.\n\n【24】    You may take the mifepristone in your provider's office or clinic. Then you might take the misoprostol at home, hours or days later.\n\n【25】    You'll need to visit your health care provider again about a week later to make sure the abortion is complete. This regimen is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\n【26】*   **Oral mifepristone and vaginal, buccal or sublingual misoprostol.** With this type of medical abortion, you take a mifepristone tablet by mouth. The next step is to use a slowly dissolving misoprostol tablet placed in your vagina (vaginal route), in your mouth between your teeth and cheek (buccal route), or under your tongue (sublingual route).\n\n【27】    The vaginal, buccal or sublingual approach lessens side effects and may be more effective. To be most effective, these medicines must be taken within nine weeks of the first day of your last period.\n\n【28】*   **Methotrexate and vaginal misoprostol.** Methotrexate is rarely used for elective, unintended pregnancies, although it's still used for pregnancies outside of the uterus (ectopic pregnancies). This type of medical abortion must be done within seven weeks of the first day of your last period. It can take up to a month for methotrexate to complete the abortion. You receive methotrexate as a shot or a pill you take by mouth. The misoprostol is later used at home.\n*   **Vaginal misoprostol alone.** Vaginal misoprostol alone can be effective when used before nine weeks of gestation of the embryo. But vaginal misoprostol alone is less effective than other types of medical abortion.\n\n【29】The medicines used in a medical abortion cause vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramping. They may also cause:\n\n【30】*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n*   Fever\n*   Chills\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Headache\n\n【31】You may be given medicine to manage pain during and after the medical abortion. You may also be given antibiotics, although infection after medical abortion is rare.\n\n【32】Your health care provider will let you know how much pain and bleeding to expect, depending on the number of weeks of your pregnancy. You might not be able to go about your usual daily routine during this time, but it's unlikely you'll need bed rest. Make sure you have plenty of absorbent sanitary pads.\n\n【33】If you have a medical abortion at home, you'll need access to a health care provider who can answer questions by phone and access to emergency services. You'll also need to be able to identify complications.\n\n【34】### After the procedure\n\n【35】Signs and symptoms that may require medical attention after a medical abortion include:\n\n【36】*   Heavy bleeding — soaking two or more pads an hour for two hours\n*   Severe abdominal or back pain\n*   Fever lasting more than 24 hours\n*   Foul-smelling vaginal discharge\n\n【37】After a medical abortion, you'll need a follow-up visit with your provider to make sure you're healing properly and to evaluate your uterine size, bleeding and any signs of infection. To reduce the risk of infection, don't put anything into your vagina for two weeks after the abortion.\n\n【38】Your health care provider may ask if you still feel pregnant, if you saw the expulsion of the gestational sac or embryo, how much bleeding you had, and whether you're still bleeding. If your provider suspects an incomplete abortion or ongoing pregnancy, you may need an ultrasound and possibly a surgical abortion.\n\n【39】After a medical abortion, you may have a mix of emotions, including relief, loss, sadness or guilt. If these feelings bother you, it might help to talk to a counselor about them.\n\n【40】### Preventing pregnancy\n\n【41】Ovulation usually occurs as soon as two weeks after a medical abortion, and another pregnancy is possible even before your period begins. Before the abortion, talk to your provider about contraception that you can start as soon as the procedure is over.\n\n【42】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Walking pace was self-reported and classified as brisk, average, or slow. Total physical activity and walking time were self-reported using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Association between walking pace and T2D incidence and the potential moderating role of physical activity and walking time were investigated using Cox proportional hazards models.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The median follow-up was 7.4 (interquartile range, 6.7 to 8.2) years. There were 4442 participants in whom T2D developed during the follow-up period. In the fully adjusted model (sociodemographic factors, diet, body mass index, and physical activity), average walking pace (hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.44) and slow walking pace (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.62 to 2.24) were associated with a higher T2D risk compared with brisk walking among women. Among men, average walking pace (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.40) and slow walking pace (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.50 to 1.99) were also associated with higher T2D risk. Compared with slow walkers, brisk walkers have the same diabetes incidence rate 18.6 and 16.0 years later, for women and men, respectively.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Average and slow walking pace was associated with a higher risk of incident T2D in both men and women, independent of major confounding factors.

We estimated the incidence of hyperkalemia and AKI associated with spironolactone initiation, and used target trial emulation methods to minimize confounding by indication.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】During a mean follow-up of 134 mo, 3229 of 17,110 patients (18.9%) initiated spironolactone. Incidence rates of hyperkalemia and AKI in patients using spironolactone with a loop diuretic were 2.9 and 10.1 events per 1000 person-months, respectively. In propensity score–matched analyses, spironolactone initiation was associated with higher hyperkalemia and AKI risk compared with loop alone (hazard ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.10; _P_ <.001, and hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.26; _P_ \\=.04, respectively). There were no differences in the relative risk of either outcome associated with spironolactone by level of kidney function.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The addition of spironolactone to loop diuretics in patients with heart failure was associated with higher risk of hyperkalemia and AKI; these risks must be weighed against the potential benefits of spironolactone.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACEi ( angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ), ARB ( angiotensin II receptor blockers ), AKI ( acute kidney injury ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), CCI ( Charlson comorbidity index ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), eGFR ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ), EHR ( electronic health record ), HFpEF ( heart failure with preserved ejection ), HFrEF ( heart failure with reduced ejection ), ITT ( intention-to-treat ), K ( potassium ), PAD ( peripheral artery disease ), PS ( propensity score ), RALES ( Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study ), SCr ( serum creatinine ), sHR ( subdistribution hazard ratios ), TOPCAT ( Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Computed tomography of the chest revealed central bronchiectasis. Moderate lymphopenia was identified, with decreased counts in all subpopulations except natural killer cells. Diminished mitogen-induced blastogenesis was evident. Natural killer cell and neutrophil function were normal. Although CHH predominantly affects cellular immunity, our patient had a profound humoral deficit with remarkably low IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 subclass levels despite a high-normal total IgG level. His response to pneumococcal polysaccharide was extremely limited. Genomic DNA analysis characterized the patient as compound heterozygotic, with 2 changes in the _RMRP_ gene.

This medicine is given through a needle placed into one of your veins.\n\n【29】Amifostine injection is given before cisplatin therapy or radiation therapy. It must be injected slowly, so your IV tube will need to stay in place for at least 15 minutes before cisplatin treatment or at least 3 minutes before radiation therapy.\n\n【30】You may receive other medicines to help prevent nausea and vomiting. You may also be given calcium supplements if needed.\n\n【31】Drink plenty of fluids during the 24 hours before receiving amifostine.\n\n【32】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【33】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.\n\n【34】Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment with this medicine. If you think you have become pregnant while using this medicine, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【35】Low blood pressure (hypotension) may occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have the following symptoms: blurred vision, confusion, severe dizziness, faintness, or lightheadedness, sweating, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【36】Serious skin reactions can occur during treatment or weeks after starting this medicine.

Colectomy may be necessary to treat or prevent diseases and conditions that affect your colon.\n\n【2】There are various types of colectomy operations:\n\n【3】*   **Total colectomy** involves removing the entire colon.\n*   **Partial colectomy** involves removing part of the colon and may also be called subtotal colectomy.\n*   **Hemicolectomy** involves removing the right or left portion of the colon.\n*   **Proctocolectomy** involves removing both the colon and rectum.\n\n【4】Colectomy surgery usually requires other procedures to reattach the remaining portions of your digestive system and permit waste to leave your body.\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】Colectomy is used to treat and prevent diseases and conditions that affect the colon, such as:\n\n【7】*   **Bleeding that can't be controlled.** Severe bleeding from the colon may require surgery to remove the affected portion of the colon.\n*   **Bowel obstruction.** A blocked colon is an emergency that may require total or partial colectomy, depending on the situation.\n*   **Colon cancer.** Early-stage cancers may require only a small section of the colon to be removed during colectomy. Cancers at a later stage may require more of the colon to be removed.\n*   **Crohn's disease.** If medications aren't helping you, removing the affected part of your colon may offer temporary relief from signs and symptoms. Colectomy may also be an option if precancerous changes are found during a test to examine the colon (colonoscopy).\n*   **Ulcerative colitis.** Your doctor may recommend total colectomy or proctocolectomy if medications aren't helping to control your signs and symptoms. Proctocolectomy may also be recommended if precancerous changes are found during a colonoscopy.\n*   **Diverticulitis.** Your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the affected portion of the colon if your diverticulitis recurs or if you experience complications of diverticulitis.\n*   **Preventive surgery.** If you have a very high risk of colon cancer due to the formation of multiple precancerous colon polyps, you may choose to undergo total colectomy to prevent cancer in the future. Colectomy may be an option for people with inherited genetic conditions that increase colon cancer risk, such as familial adenomatous polyposis or Lynch syndrome.\n\n【8】Discuss your treatment options with your doctor. In some situations, you may have a choice between various types of colectomy operations. Your doctor can discuss the benefits and risks of each.\n\n【9】Risks\n-----\n\n【10】Colectomy carries a risk of serious complications. Your risk of complications is based on your general health, the type of colectomy you undergo and the approach your surgeon uses to perform the operation.\n\n【11】In general, complications of colectomy can include:\n\n【12】*   Bleeding\n*   Blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis) and the lungs (pulmonary embolism)\n*   Infection\n*   Injury to organs near your colon, such as the bladder and small intestines\n*   Tears in the sutures that reconnect the remaining parts of your digestive system\n\n【13】You'll spend time in the hospital after your colectomy to allow your digestive system to heal. Your health care team will also monitor you for signs of complications from your surgery. You may spend a few days to a week in the hospital, depending on your condition and your situation.\n\n【14】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【15】During the days leading up to your colon surgery, your doctor may ask that you:\n\n【16】*   **Stop taking certain medications.** Certain medications can increase your risk of complications during surgery, so your doctor may ask that you stop taking those medications before your surgery.\n*   **Fast before your surgery.** Your doctor will give you specific instructions. You may be asked to stop eating and drinking several hours to a day before your procedure.\n*   **Drink a solution that clears your bowels.** Your doctor may prescribe a laxative solution that you mix with water at home. You drink the solution over several hours, following the directions. The solution causes diarrhea to help empty your colon. Your doctor may also recommend enemas.\n*   **Take antibiotics.** In some cases, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to suppress the bacteria found naturally in your colon and to help prevent infection.\n\n【17】Preparing for colectomy isn't always possible. For instance, if you need an emergency colectomy due to bowel obstruction or bowel perforation, there may not be time to prepare.\n\n【18】### Plan for your hospital stay\n\n【19】You'll spend at least a few days in the hospital after your colectomy, depending on your situation. Make arrangements for someone to take care of your responsibilities at home and at work.\n\n【20】Think ahead to what you might like to have with you while you're recovering in the hospital. Things you might pack include:\n\n【21】*   A robe and slippers\n*   Toiletries, such as your toothbrush and toothpaste and, if needed, your shaving supplies\n*   Comfortable clothes to wear home\n*   Activities to pass the time, such as a book, magazine or games\n\n【22】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【23】### During your colectomy\n\n【24】On the day of your surgery, your health care team will take you to a preparation room. Your blood pressure and breathing will be monitored. You may receive an antibiotic medication through a vein in your arm.\n\n【25】You will then be taken to an operating room and positioned on a table. You'll be given a general anesthesia medication to put you in a sleep-like state so that you won't be aware during your operation.\n\n【26】The surgical team will then proceed with your colectomy. Colon surgery may be performed in two ways:\n\n【27】*   **Open colectomy.** Open surgery involves making a longer incision in your abdomen to access your colon. Your surgeon uses surgical tools to free your colon from the surrounding tissue and cuts out either a portion of the colon or the entire colon.\n*   **Laparoscopic colectomy.** Laparoscopic colectomy, also called minimally invasive colectomy, involves several small incisions in your abdomen. Your surgeon passes a tiny video camera through one incision and special surgical tools through the other incisions.\n\n【28】    The surgeon watches a video screen in the operating room as the tools are used to free the colon from the surrounding tissue. The colon is then brought out through a small incision in your abdomen. This allows the surgeon to operate on the colon outside of your body.\n\n【29】    Once repairs are made to the colon, the surgeon reinserts the colon through the incision.\n\n【30】The type of operation you undergo depends on your situation and your surgeon's expertise. Laparoscopic colectomy may reduce the pain and recovery time after surgery. But not everyone is a candidate for this procedure. Also, in some situations your operation may begin as a laparoscopic colectomy, but circumstances may force your surgical team to convert to an open colectomy.\n\n【31】Once the colon has been repaired or removed, your surgeon will reconnect your digestive system to allow your body to expel waste. Options may include:\n\n【32】*   **Rejoining the remaining portions of your colon.** The surgeon may stitch the remaining portions of your colon together or attach your colon to your small intestine, creating what is called an anastomosis. Stool then leaves your body as before.\n*   **Connecting your intestine to an opening created in your abdomen.** The surgeon may attach your colon (colostomy) or small intestine (ileostomy) to an opening created in your abdomen. This allows waste to leave your body through the opening (stoma).\n\n【33】    You may wear a bag on the outside of the stoma to collect stool. This can be permanent or temporary.\n\n【34】*   **Connecting your small intestine to your anus.** After removing both the colon and the rectum (proctocolectomy), the surgeon may use a portion of your small intestine to create a pouch that is attached to your anus (ileoanal anastomosis). This allows you to expel waste normally, though you may have several watery bowel movements each day.\n\n【35】    As part of this procedure, you may undergo a temporary ileostomy.\n\n【36】Your surgeon will discuss your options with you before your operation.\n\n【37】### After your colectomy\n\n【38】After surgery you'll be taken to a recovery room to be monitored as the anesthesia wears off. Then your health care team will take you to your hospital room to continue your recovery.\n\n【39】You'll stay in the hospital until you regain bowel function. This may take a couple of days to a week.\n\n【40】You may not be able to eat solid foods at first. You might receive liquid nutrition through a vein, often in your arm, and then transition to drinking clear liquids. As your intestines recover, you can eventually add solid foods.\n\n【41】If your surgery involved a colostomy or ileostomy to attach your intestine to the outside of your abdomen, you'll meet with an ostomy nurse who will show you how to care for your stoma. The nurse will explain how to change the ostomy bag that will collect waste.\n\n【42】Once you leave the hospital, expect a couple of weeks of recovery at home. You may feel weak at first, but eventually your strength will return. Ask your doctor when you can expect to get back to your normal routine.\n\n【43】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

These efforts have found that diversion of controlled substances is not uncommon and can result in substantial risk not only to the individual who is diverting the drugs but also to patients, co-workers, and employers. We believe that all health care facilities should have systems in place to deter controlled substance diversion and to promptly identify diversion and intervene when it is occurring. Such systems are multifaceted and require close cooperation between multiple stakeholders including, but not limited to, departments of pharmacy, safety and security, anesthesiology, nursing, legal counsel, and human resources. Ideally, there should be a broad-based appreciation of the dangers that diversion creates not only for patients but also for all employees of health care facilities, because diversion can occur at any point along a long supply chain. All health care workers must be vigilant for signs of possible diversion and must be aware of how to engage a preexisting group with expertise in investigating possible diversions. In addition, clear policies and procedures should be in place for dealing with such investigations and for managing the many possible outcomes of a confirmed diversion. This article provides an overview of the multiple types of risk that result from drug diversion from health care facilities. Further, we describe a system developed at Mayo Clinic for evaluating episodes of potential drug diversion and for taking action once diversion is confirmed.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ADM ( automated distribution machine ), CS ( controlled substance ), DEA ( Drug Enforcement Administration ), DDiRT ( drug diversion response team ), HCW ( health care worker ), MDPC ( medication diversion prevention coordinator ), OR ( operating room ), PCA ( patient-controlled analgesia )\n\n【4】_“Diversion” means the transfer of a controlled substance from a lawful to an unlawful channel of distribution or use._ Uniform Controlled Substances Act (1994)\n\n【5】Drug Abuse Prevention and Control  \n21 USC Chapter 13 (2011).\n\n【6】删除3:<u>http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/21C13.txt</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【8】_“Diversion” means “Any criminal act involving a prescription drug.”_ National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators\n\n【9】National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators (NADDI) Web site\n\n【10】删除3:<u>http://naddi.associationdatabase.com/aws/NADDI/pt/sp/Home\\_Page</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【12】In the United States in 2010, nearly 4 billion retail prescriptions were filled, with sales totaling $307 billion.

Although most of these sales resulted in the legitimate, targeted administration of pharmaceutical agents to patients, a fraction of the drugs manufactured and prescribed for patients are diverted for illicit purposes.

This less appreciated form of drug diversion is associated with adverse consequences, the scope of which is incalculable, with harm to the drug diverter and others that is at times horrific. There are no available data that precisely define the extent of drug diversion from the health care facility workplace. However, it is well recognized that anesthesiologists, perhaps more than any other class of physician, have ready access to highly addictive psychotropic medications and have a higher rate of addiction to opioid drugs than physicians in other specialties.\n\n【21】无关删除-2:<u>*   Alexander B.H.\n*   Checkoway H.\n*   Nagahama B.A.\n*   Domino K.B.</u>\n\n【22】Cause-specific mortality risks of anesthesiologists.\n\n【23】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Anesthesiology._ 2000; 93 : 922-930</u></u>\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (144)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【25】Furthermore, the drugs most commonly abused by anesthesiologists are obtained through diversion.\n\n【26】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bryson E.O.\n*   Silverstein J.H.</u>\n\n【27】Addiction and substance abuse in anesthesiology.\n\n【28】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Anesthesiology._ 2008; 109 : 905-917</u></u>\n\n【29】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (136)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【30】Such data suggest that ready access is a critical component of drug diversion from the health care facility workplace.\n\n【31】The most common drugs diverted from the health care facility setting are opioids.

Typically, drugs stolen from health care facilities are used to support an addiction of either the health care worker (HCW) or an associate and, less commonly, for sale for financial gain. This theft can be of unopened vials; vials or syringes that have been tampered with, resulting in either substituted or diluted dosages being administered to the patient; or residual drug left in a syringe or vial after only a fraction of the drug that has been signed out was actually administered to the patient. In addition, this theft can be of discarded syringes or ampules that have been properly disposed of in a “sharps” safety container.\n\n【41】In the outpatient setting, there is an elaborate system of checks and balances for prescription, procurement, and dosing of a CS. However, in the health care facility environment, vulnerability to diversion exists when a single provider, out of view of others, is free to engage in drug procurement from central stores, drug preparation, drug administration to patients, and/or disposal of drug waste. Given that CSs are often titrated to a desired effect in patients who may have widely varying drug requirements (eg, as a result of baseline individual variability, acquired habituation, or other factors), in the absence of sufficient controls, it is relatively easy for a single HCW, without the knowledge or collusion of others, to divert drugs intended for patients. It is beyond question that HCW diversion of opioids and other CSs from the health care workplace has occurred since time immemorial.\n\n【42】Recent experience at Mayo Clinic and elsewhere have revealed that such health care workplace drug diversion creates numerous potential victims. Specifically, harm can come not only to drug diverters but also to their patients and co-workers and to the reputation of the health care institution that employs them. A recent devastating example is that of an infected HCW in the Denver, Colorado, area who, in the process of diverting narcotics for self-use, passed on hepatitis C virus to approximately 36 patients.\n\n【43】无关删除-2:<u>AP Daily News Staff Writer  \nHeroin-addicted technician Kristen Diane Parker infected 3 dozen with hepatitis C.</u>\n\n【44】删除3:<u>http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-01-18/news/17945085\\_1\\_kristen-diane-parker-heroin-addiction-infected</u>\n\n【45】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【46】Such cases provide graphic examples of why it is essential to reduce or eliminate opportunities for diversion of drugs in the health care facility workplace.\n\n【47】Mayo Clinic has recently expanded its efforts to better educate its staff about the risks of drug diversion and to enhance its methods for detection. With encouragement from institutional physician-executives, we provide details of several instances that are instructive in alerting others to the sub-rosa crimes and harms that are likely occurring in health care systems worldwide. In addition, we define the many potential harms and victims associated with drug diversion. We also review strategies that we have developed, and that continue to evolve, in our efforts to combat diversion.\n\n【48】Illustrative Vignettes\n----------------------\n\n【49】There are many patterns of drug diversion in the health care facility workplace environment, involving personnel from diverse backgrounds engaged in diversions in a variety of practice locations. The heterogeneity of drug diversion practices is exemplified in the following vignettes, all based on cases detected at Mayo Clinic medical centers during 2010 and 2011. These vignettes represent only a portion of the instances of diversion that were detected during that time. For reasons of confidentiality, the vignettes have been slightly altered.\n\n【50】*   •\n\n【51】    A visitor to the hospital asked to assist in bathing a patient, who was a loved one. After the bath, the patient's nurse noticed that the time-released patches used to transcutaneously administer the potent opioid fentanyl were no longer attached to the patient. An initial search of the patient's room, including a search of the trash cans, yielded nothing. When pressed, the visitor later “found” the missing fentanyl patches in a previously searched trash can.\n\n【52】*   •\n\n【53】    A nurse working in a hospital unit discovered that during her work shift she had misplaced her security key, which was required to refill and alter the electronic programming of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) devices used to administer opioids to patients. Later in that same work shift, a PCA pump on the same hospital unit was found to have “malfunctioned” and delivered the entire syringe of the potent opioid hydromorphone to a single patient over a relatively short time. However, it was astonishing that the patient exhibited no evidence of narcotic overdose. Electronic analysis of the pump revealed that the PCA device had been entered on several occasions, using a security key, and large amounts of opioid were administered during each trespass. On questioning, the patient admitted to having found and hidden the key and to having overridden the pump's safety lockout in order to self-administer large dosages of opioid. It was only by virtue of this patient being chronically habituated to opioids that a potentially fatal overdose was avoided.\n\n【54】*   •\n\n【55】    A procedural sedation nurse assigned to administer opioids and sedatives to patients during colonoscopy was found to have a secret pocket sewn inside her uniform top, into which she dropped syringes of the potent opioid fentanyl and substituted them with syringes containing saline solution. During the colonoscopy, the nurse would inject saline solution, rather than the prescribed fentanyl, into the patients and divert the prescribed fentanyl for her own use.\n\n【56】*   •\n\n【57】    A radiology technician who was positive for hepatitis C diverted unused fentanyl syringes intended for administration to patients in the interventional radiology area. It is believed that the technician would remove the needle from a syringe, replace it with a smaller gauge needle for self-injection, and then reattach the original needle to the syringe. The technician would then refill the syringe with saline solution and return it to the patient care area. In so doing, the technician infected 5 patients with hepatitis C virus.\n\n【58】*   •\n\n【59】    Sharps waste containers (used to collect previously used syringes, needles, and vials) filled with uncapped needles and used syringes were on multiple occasions found hidden in hospital areas where they did not belong. Many containers had clearly been broken into, and nearby were plastic bags filled with unprotected used needles protruding from them. Video surveillance ultimately led to discovery of an employee who was stealing waste by transferring the contents of used sharps containers into the bags and taking them home in a search for discarded CSs. Video surveillance also revealed this employee attempting to retrieve narcotics from an intact sharps container by sticking her hand blindly into the container, resulting in her hand being cut and bleeding from contact with needles and glass.\n\n【60】*   •\n\n【61】    A night custodian was discovered rummaging through sharps waste containers holding nearly empty vials of fentanyl. On questioning, the custodian revealed that he had been withdrawing and consolidating the miniscule remaining fentanyl from each vial, which he later self-injected to support his addiction.\n\n【62】Potential Harm Arising From Drug Diversion\n------------------------------------------\n\n【63】Addiction is sometimes viewed as a victimless crime. When the addiction is supported by drug diversion within the health care facility workplace environment, it becomes, in most situations, a multiple-victim crime in which patients, health care workers, and employers can be harmed directly or indirectly.\n\n【64】### Harm to the Patient\n\n【65】In cases of drug diversion, patients may potentially receive substandard care from an addicted and drug-diverting individual. If one assumes that the patients required the drugs that were prescribed for them, the absence of the drug entirely or dilution of the drug such that they receive a dosage less than that intended will likely result in the patient experiencing undue pain and/or anxiety, at least temporarily. This pain can be excruciating, as evidenced by the recent diversion of fentanyl by a sedation nurse in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\n【66】无关删除-2:<u>*   Van Denburg H.\n*   Larry V.

This patient, a law enforcement officer, was so distressed by the care he received that he reported it to the police.\n\n【71】无关删除-2:<u>*   Van Denburg H.\n*   Larry V.

In vignette 2, the patient might easily have brought harm or death to herself by overriding the safety mechanism built into the PCA. In vignette 3, multiple patients likely experienced pain as a consequence of insufficient sedation and analgesia because they did not receive the analgesia that was ordered for their procedures. In vignette 4, 5 patients were infected with hepatitis C, and in 1 of these, the infection contributed to the patient's death. Only in vignettes 5 and 6 was there no clear patient harm, yet the reckless actions occurring in vignette 5 exposed many other innocent HCWs, and possibly patients and visitors, to the danger of a needle stick injury with all of the attendant infectious risks of bloodborne pathogens.\n\n【76】Other potential harm to patients includes the possibility that they will receive an adulterated or contaminated drug in place of the diverted drug, such as the substitution of unsterile tap water for the sterile drug that was intended for them, or an alternate drug to which they may be allergic. A contaminated drug could put patients at risk for blood-borne infections, sepsis, wound infections, and infections of implanted foreign bodies such as prosthetic joints and heart valves.\n\n【77】无关删除-2:<u>*   Maki D.G.\n*   Klein B.S.\n*   McCormick R.D.\n\n【78】Nosocomial _Pseudomonas pickettii_ bacteremias traced to narcotic tampering: a case for selective drug screening of health care personnel.\n\n【79】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 1991; 265 : 981-986</u></u>\n\n【80】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (60)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【81】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ostrowsky B.E.\n*   Whitener C.\n*   Bredenberg H.K.\n\n【82】_Serratia marcescens_ bacteremia traced to an infused narcotic.\n\n【83】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 2002; 346 : 1529-1537</u></u>\n\n【84】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (64)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【85】Furthermore, patients are at risk simply by virtue of being under the care of an addicted and potentially impaired HCW. The impairment may be as obvious as the HCW being acutely intoxicated by a drug or as subtle as the risk posed by a distracted HCW whose primary focus is not patient care but where, when, and how to obtain the next needed dose of drug to stave off withdrawal symptoms. In such a state, it is easy to imagine an HCW being susceptible to making cognitive patient-management or medication errors that might directly harm the patient.\n\n【86】### Potential Risks Addicted HCWs Pose to Themselves\n\n【87】An individual who diverts drugs within the hospital environment introduces a profound risk of morbidity and mortality to himself or herself. One need look no further than the anesthesiology literature to find numerous examples of presumably unintentional overdose and death associated with the diversion of drugs, typically highly potent sedative, opioid, and anesthetic agents.\n\n【88】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bryson E.O.\n*   Silverstein J.H.</u>\n\n【89】Addiction and substance abuse in anesthesiology.\n\n【90】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Anesthesiology._ 2008; 109 : 905-917</u></u>\n\n【91】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (136)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【92】无关删除-2:<u>*   Berge K.H.\n*   Seppala M.D.\n*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【93】The anesthesiology communities approach to opioid- and anesthetic-abusing personnel: time to change course.\n\n【94】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Anesthesiology._ 2008; 109 : 762-764</u></u>\n\n【95】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (52)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【96】Death typically results from severe respiratory depression or arrest, producing anoxic insults to the brain, heart, and other organs. Death or anoxic brain injury to those who otherwise survive the drug overdose are certainly the most feared consequences; however, there are many other important risks to the addicted HCW. Among these are the risk of infection from unsterile drugs and needles, unsanitary injection techniques, or blood-to-blood transmission of pathogens from a patient to an HCW.\n\n【97】In addition to the biologic risks, drug diversion is associated with profound professional risks for HCWs. Stealing CSs from the supply chain exposes them to felony criminal prosecution and civil malpractice actions, as well as actions against their professional licenses. Other potential professional hazards include the risk of prosecution for fraudulent charting if they chart that the patient received medication that they know they did not give and the attendant risk of prosecution for billing fraud resulting from submitting charges to the patient or insurance provider for drugs and services they know the patient did not receive.\n\n【98】### Potential Risk to Other HCWs\n\n【99】Vignette 5 graphically demonstrates a potential source of risk to other HCWs from the irresponsible actions of an HCW who was diverting drugs. Unexpectedly finding uncapped contaminated needles and broken glass vials in areas where they should not be puts fellow HCWs at risk for mechanical injury and infection by bloodborne pathogens. In addition, although co-workers may be unaware of the colleague's impairment, shared patient-care responsibilities might result in adverse patient outcomes, thereby placing all members of the care team at risk for medicolegal liability.\n\n【100】Many addicted HCWs become masters at manipulating both the drug control systems in the areas where they work and at manipulating their colleagues so that the addict can divert drugs undetected. Often this involves breaches of policies and procedures on the part of the addicted HCW's colleagues, whereby they unwittingly aid their addicted colleague by “witnessing” the disposal of leftover CSs that they did not witness. This puts the otherwise innocent HCW at risk of disciplinary action for being found in violation of such routine policies and procedures.\n\n【101】### Potential Risk to Employer\n\n【102】Health care workers who divert CSs from the workplace introduce potential risk to their employer. Harms include the loss of revenue from diverted drugs and the potentially poor work quality or absenteeism of the addicted HCW. Drug-diverting HCWs also place their employer at risk of civil liability for failure to prevent, recognize, or address signs of drug diversion or of an impaired or addicted employee. Should harm befall a patient while under the care of an addicted HCW, both the HCW and the employer are vulnerable to civil litigation.\n\n【103】无关删除-2:<u>*   Thompson N.D.\n*   Hellinger W.C.\n*   Kay R.S.\n\n【104】Healthcare-associated hepatitis C virus transmission among patients in an abdominal organ transplant center \\[published online ahead of print May 26, 2009\\].\n\n【105】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Transpl Infect Dis._ 2009; 11 : 324-329</u></u>\n\n【106】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (16)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【107】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hellinger W.C.\n*   Bacalis L.P.\n*   Kay R.S.\n\n【108】Health care-associated hepatitis C virus infections attributed to narcotic diversion.\n\n【109】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 2012; 156 : 477-482</u></u>\n\n【110】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (29)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【111】The sense that the illicit activities by this HCW could have possibly harmed scores of patients resulted in a massive “look back” evaluation of the practices and timelines involving the suspected HCW. Free testing was offered to nearly 4,000 patients who were believed to have possibly been at risk of exposure. As a result of these tests, 5 patients were ultimately proved to have the same genetic subtype of hepatitis C as the infected HCW, presumably because the infections emanated from a common source.\n\n【112】Investigations such as this are expensive in terms of human and nonhuman resources, time, and finances; however, they are a necessary part of health care systems acting responsibly. Such efforts first and foremost fulfill an ethical obligation to past, present, and future patients. They also are a critical component of long-term risk management for the employer.\n\n【113】Mandatory reporting requirements may cause diversion incidents to become public knowledge and potentially highly publicized in the media. In the long term, this can have a devastating effect on the morale of the employees of the health care institution. It also can have an even more profound effect on the patients and their families who have entrusted their care to the institution, whether or not they were directly affected by an episode of drug diversion. Disappointed or mistrustful patients may seek medical care elsewhere, resulting in financial losses to the institution that, in turn, harm its ability to sustain a mission of providing high-quality patient-centered care.\n\n【114】Because of these cumulative risks, it is essential that all health care institutions establish surveillance programs in an effort to detect potential diversion of CSs and implement mechanisms, policies, and procedures that enable quick intervention when diversion is identified, ideally before harm to patients and HCWs can ensue. This is true not only because it is an ethical imperative but also because it is the most fiscally responsible plan for the survival and prosperity of the mission of the health care institution.\n\n【115】General Concepts of Prevention and Detection\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【116】Many HCWs are unaware that drug diversion is a serious problem in the workplace. Thus, broad-based educational efforts must be instituted that focus on the nature and scope of the problem, signs and symptoms of possible diversion and addiction, and proper ways to respond if diversion is suspected. The entire workforce, not only those with ready access to CSs, should be informed of the threats to life and career presented by drug diversion. Orientation of new employees should include such education, and ongoing education should occur throughout an HCW's career. In an effort to discourage diversion, all employees should be made aware that procedures are in place to facilitate detection, with the objective of preventing patient harm, diversion-related addictive illness, and drug-related deaths. Employees also should be taught how to access available resources if they suspect diversion is occurring. A Web-based teaching module on the topic of diversion is currently being created at Mayo Clinic to facilitate these educational goals, with consideration being given to making the satisfactory completion of this module a required part of annual employee competency assessments.\n\n【117】The ideal drug-diversion and prevention program is highly sophisticated, drawing from the knowledge bases of behavioral and biologic sciences, information technology, law enforcement, pharmacy sciences, credentialing and licensure experts, and industry loss-prevention sciences. There is tremendous diversity among the prevention and detection efforts of various medical centers, ranging from haphazard reactionary programs to highly sophisticated proactive programs. This is an evolving field, and even the best efforts have not yet achieved the ideal situation in which the numbers of drug diversions and their harmful consequences approach zero. Mayo Clinic has, for the past several years, been developing and fine-tuning a uniform response to suspected diversion. The following is a brief timeline of the evolution of such diversion prevention efforts by Mayo Clinic.\n\n【118】Operationalization of Drug Diversion Prevention and Detection Efforts at Mayo Clinic\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【119】### Department of Anesthesiology\n\n【120】Anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists are health care providers in whom psychotropic drug use and addiction is considered an occupational hazard.\n\n【121】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bryson E.O.\n*   Silverstein J.H.</u>\n\n【122】Addiction and substance abuse in anesthesiology.\n\n【123】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Anesthesiology._ 2008; 109 : 905-917</u></u>\n\n【124】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (136)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【125】无关删除-2:<u>*   Berge K.H.\n*   Seppala M.D.\n*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【126】The anesthesiology communities approach to opioid- and anesthetic-abusing personnel: time to change course.\n\n【127】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Anesthesiology._ 2008; 109 : 762-764</u></u>\n\n【128】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (52)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【129】无关删除-2:<u>*   Berge K.H.\n*   Seppala M.D.\n*   Schipper A.M.</u>\n\n【130】Chemical dependency and the physician.\n\n【131】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2009; 84 : 625-631</u></u>\n\n【132】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (68)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【133】Mayo Clinic is no exception in this regard; thus, it is not surprising that concerted efforts to detect drug diversion began in the Department of Anesthesiology. Detection has often been precipitated by personnel underperformance or behavioral changes at work, frequent unexplained work absences, patients who seem to be undermedicated in the period after surgery despite documentation of administration of seemingly adequate narcotic dosages, and, rarely, HCW death related to a CS.\n\n【134】In the early 1990s, in response to several episodes of fentanyl diversion from anesthesia supplies in the operating room (OR) environment, an improvement in CS handling was sought. After a review of procedures used by multiple health care institutions was conducted by members of the departments of anesthesiology and pharmacy, departmental leadership decided to purchase automated distribution machines (ADMs) for the OR environment. Secure return bins were also installed so that all unused portions of CS doses could be submitted for subsequent random quantitative drug assays before destruction of the CS. In addition, close cooperation between the departments of anesthesiology and pharmacy created a system whereby returned waste volumes were reconciled with ADM dispensing records and patient anesthesia records, and any discrepancies were aggressively investigated until resolved. Since initiation of these improved control systems, there has been a dramatic decrease in the frequency of CS diversions (unpublished data, Keith Berge, MD, Department of Anesthesiology, Mayo Clinic, June 7, 2012). Frequent educational sessions about the risk of addiction and diversion by Department of Anesthesiology personnel were also undertaken for all workers in the OR environment, not only anesthesia personnel but also surgical nurses and surgical technicians, among others. In these sessions, the signs and symptoms of drug diversion and use, as we have previously described,\n\n【135】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hellinger W.C.\n*   Bacalis L.P.\n*   Kay R.S.\n\n【136】Health care-associated hepatitis C virus infections attributed to narcotic diversion.\n\n【137】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 2012; 156 : 477-482</u></u>\n\n【138】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (29)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【139】are discussed in an effort to promote rapid identification of aberrant behavior.\n\n【140】### Institution-Wide Reforms at Mayo Clinic\n\n【141】Mayo Clinic is a large and complex organization with 55,000 employees in multiple states. After several diversion incidents in multiple Mayo Clinic facilities, a unified policy has been evolving to combat the problem. As part of this effort, a new position called the Medication Diversion Prevention Coordinator (MDPC) was created within the Department of Pharmacy in the larger facilities. This role calls for an individual familiar with the CS supply chain and management policies who is, therefore, able to assess areas of vulnerability for potential diversion. This individual must also be skilled in the use of systems available for tracking, trending, and evaluating the dispensing patterns of health care professionals and be willing to participate in educational efforts about the dangers of, and recognition of, drug diversion.\n\n【142】With input from multiple participants, a “best practices” list was created that identified 77 specific points that, were all the points implemented, would create what we believe to be the best possible system to date to prevent CS diversion . Inasmuch as all of the most recently discovered diversion episodes were occurring outside of the tightly controlled OR environment, OR control systems were expanded to enable similar controls in other areas with high CS use. Thus, the ADM/waste retrieval system has been implemented in the Emergency Department and the gastrointestinal endoscopy suite at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. In time, it will also be used in the intensive care unit and other nursing units with high CS use. Educational efforts have been increased to publicize the Medication Diversion Prevention Committee and the active surveillance efforts it brings to the problem. Although institution-wide uniformity in the approach to diversion prevention efforts is the desired goal, at this time, various entities within the Mayo Clinic system are at different points along the continuum of developing and introducing this uniform approach. The ultimate goal is for an MDPC or designee to be available via pager at all times to respond to and rapidly investigate potential diversions, with the number for this pager prominently displayed on every ADM. Some Mayo Clinic sites currently rely on a compliance hotline to service this notification role.\n\n【143】As further best practices are identified, they are distributed to all Mayo Clinic facilities. In addition, details of each incident of confirmed diversion are shared among the MDPCs at each site in an effort to gain insights into and address any potential areas of vulnerability. Efforts are under way to align policies and procedures across all Mayo Clinic facilities for response to suspected drug diversions. Uniform policies will provide a consistent approach to confirming that a diversion has occurred, notifying the appropriate institutional leaders and other parties with a need to know, altering employment status of the drug-diverting personnel, and ensuring that mandatory reporting requirements are met (eg, to governmental agencies). Although some of these efforts are still evolving, many of these policies are now in the final stages of implementation. All policies adhere to core principles but are tailored to both the requirements of the individual health care site and the laws of the state in which each affected Mayo Clinic site is located.\n\n【144】### Organizational Features of Institution-Wide Mayo Clinic Effort\n\n【145】At the larger Mayo Clinic facilities, teams have been created to investigate suspected diversion episodes. These multidisciplinary teams, all subgroups of the Medication Diversion Prevention Committees, are called the drug diversion response teams (DDiRT). Each team consists of the MDPC, the Director of Pharmacy, a member of the Department of Safety and Security, and a physician chair of the Medication Diversion Prevention Committee. Other departments represented include human resources, legal, nursing, and administration. The Rochester-based team currently assists with investigation in the Mayo Clinic Health System sites near Mayo Clinic Rochester, although some of the larger sites are in the process of creating their own on-site DDiRTs.\n\n【146】When diversion is suspected, any Mayo Clinic employee can initiate the chain of events that results in a thorough investigation. The Figure provides a flowchart of how these investigations proceed, starting with the diversion either suspected as a result of aberrancies identified through routine surveillance of prescribing patterns or by a witnessed event. If there is concern that the diversion might involve an acutely impaired or intoxicated HCW, his or her supervisor is engaged and the HCW is immediately, but discreetly, removed from patient care duties and escorted to a new location (eg, Employee Health Services) for further evaluation including a “for cause” drug test. However, such drug testing can neither conclusively confirm nor conclusively rule out all forms of CS diversion or HCW self-administration. If the test result is negative, it does not eliminate the possibility that the drug was being diverted for use by another. If the test is positive, it does not eliminate the possibility that the individual under suspicion for diversion might in addition have a legitimate prescription for and use of the drug allegedly diverted. In any event, the MDPC (or designee) is promptly contacted via pager.\n\n【147】FIGURE Medication diversion response flowchart. DDiRT = Drug Diversion Response Team; DOP = Director of Pharmacy; EOHS = Employee and Occupational Health Services; HR = Department of Human Resources; MDPC = Medication Diversion Prevention Coordinator.\n\n【148】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【149】In the absence of obvious employee impairment, the MDPC will ask the supervisor to secure any evidence that might be inadvertently destroyed but not to initiate an investigation and to refrain from questioning the employee about the event. If possible, the MDPC notifies the chair of the local DDiRT and the Director of Pharmacy and promptly initiates a preliminary investigation consisting of review of the documentary records and a discussion with the immediate supervisor in the area of the suspected diversion. If this inquiry reveals no evidence of diversion, the case is closed and logged into the database. Should the investigation reveal cause for ongoing concern, the MDPC convenes the DDiRT within 24 hours to determine the optimal course of action. This may involve further surveillance, an employee interview by the MDPC and the DDiRT Department of Security representative, for-cause drug testing, consideration of enlisting the assistance of law enforcement agencies (eg, local law enforcement, the DEA, and the US Food and Drug Administration), or other approaches deemed appropriate by the group. As the investigation proceeds, each DDiRT meeting gives consideration to the most appropriate time for reporting on the presence or progress of the investigation to senior institutional leadership.\n\n【150】The investigation ends when enough proof is gathered to determine that a diversion has or has not occurred. If it is determined that there was no diversion, the case is closed. If, however, a diversion has been found, the case is turned over to the Department of Human Resources to determine what action will be taken insofar as the employment status of the drug diverter. At this point, the role of the DDiRT is complete but for the MDPC entering the details into the database and making certain that all mandatory internal and external reporting (eg, to the DEA, the state Pharmacy Board, and local law enforcement) has been accomplished. Then, details of the drug diversion incident are shared among MDPCs in an effort to identify and remedy areas of shared vulnerability for future diversions.\n\n【151】Prompt actions are of utmost importance throughout these deliberations, both to remove those guilty of drug diversion from the patient care environment and to avert harming the well-being of HCWs who are innocent. In actual practice, we estimate that approximately 75% of suspected diversion investigations at the Rochester Mayo Clinic location have been brought to closure by a confession on the part of the drug diverter (personal communication, Karen Sikkink, CPhT, Mayo Clinic Rochester MDPC, August 26, 2011).\n\n【152】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【153】Diversion of drugs from legitimate to illicit use is being recognized with increasing frequency in the United States. Although the full extent of diversion from health care facilities is unknown and probably unknowable, our experience makes clear that it is a considerable and ongoing problem. Addicted HCWs who are diverting drugs from the health care facility workplace pose a risk to their patients, their employers, their co-workers, and themselves. It is essential that all health care institutions have a robust system in place to identify and investigate suspected diversion as rapidly and efficiently as possible and that they implement policies and procedures that enable a standardized and effective response to confirmed diversion.\n\n【154】Drug diversion by HCWs violates the core value that the needs of the patient come first. Clearly, if we are to optimize our approach to inpatient drug diversion and its consequences, we must look at such diversion not as a victimless act but as a multiple-victim crime.\n\n【155】无关删除-1:<u>Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------</u>\n\n【156】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>Supplemental material can be found online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org .</u></u>\n\n【157】无关删除-1:<u>Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------</u>\n\n【158】无关删除-2:<u>无关删除-1:<u>*   Download .pdf (.03 MB)\n\n【159】    Help with pdf files\n\n【160】    Supplemental Table\n    </u></u>\n\n【161】无关删除-1:<u>*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIwZTUwNDA4ZGU3MTkyY2M5N2Y2YTdkZTc5ZmM2ODcwZSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDIzNTE0fQ.GVF8l6d\\_hS8KnhFNAWmd-N6c-FEod3kBXDgarr09-b7Y9giDojHkkpmHAB4QIdmiL685i-VeKRACxnGhLDR2fYeI0XR3itVdS8GydCxwTWEwEg-BkWw7LkuNmS-q9M4t6cHmDBeXhsimloFOyi2EfsanLZdlX4TzBT050is2YtVpfIxJSjBGM5jxCpbcd5xbiP9J17P217Py3xi40bpXU03Fj5y4mR8eFfobIYjr4aONsHBOxYXd4PR9zayzn9W261QYyLiQTnidYAX7qLTI8C7zq-ZTuMXjRidOxQeFiuha6q1fwg-37tPg5jtUqlVmvvBmYvVAbI3LCsdBYn4QSA\n\n【162】    Download .mp4 (86.16 MB)\n\n【163】    Help with .mp4 files\n\n【164】    Video 1\n\n【165】    Author Interview Video</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

We also examined the impact of comorbid conditions, including cancer, tobacco smoking, and recent weight changes, on the associations and adjusted for other potential confounding factors.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The 90-day mortality after hospital admission was 9.8% (3479 of 35,406) for any infection, 10.5% (466 of 4425) for urinary tract infection, 17.3% (1536 of 8855) for pneumonia, 24.9% (986 of 3964) for sepsis, and 6.2% (114 of 1831) for skin infection. The 90-day adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for death was substantially increased in patients with underweight (aHR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.58 to 1.94) compared with normal-weight patients. In contrast, mortality aHRs were decreased in patients with overweight (aHR, 0.64; 95% CI; 0.58 to 0.69) and obesity (aHR, 0.55; 95% CI; 0.49 to 0.62). Mortality reductions with overweight and obesity were consistent for all major infection types and remained robust independent of recent weight changes, smoking status, or comorbid conditions. Mortality was highest in patients without an apparent reason for their underweight (smoking/known disease), suggesting a role of undiagnosed comorbid conditions.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】We found evidence that higher BMI (overweight and obesity) is associated with improved survival following acute hospitalization for infection, whereas underweight increases the risk for death.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】aHR ( adjusted hazard ratio ), BMI ( body mass index ), CCI ( Charlson Comorbidity Index ), CDRCIS ( Central Denmark Region Clinical Information System ), CRS ( The Civil Registration System ), DNPR ( The Danish National Patient Registry ), HR ( hazard ratio ), ICU ( intensive care unit ), OR ( odds ratio )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "8b089ad6-6738-4531-b9a3-49d61b1d9edb", "title": "Liver hemangioma", "text": "【0】Liver hemangioma\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】A liver hemangioma (he-man-jee-O-muh) is a noncancerous (benign) mass in the liver made up of a tangle of blood vessels. Also known as hepatic hemangiomas or cavernous hemangiomas, these liver masses are common and are estimated to occur in up to 20% of the population.\n\n【2】Most cases of liver hemangiomas are discovered during an imaging study done for some other condition. People who have a liver hemangioma rarely experience signs and symptoms and typically don't need treatment.\n\n【3】It may be unsettling to know you have a mass in your liver, even if it's a benign mass. However, there's no evidence that an untreated liver hemangioma can lead to liver cancer.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】In most cases, a liver hemangioma doesn't cause any signs or symptoms.\n\n【6】When a liver hemangioma causes signs and symptoms, they may include:\n\n【7】*   Pain in the upper right abdomen\n*   Feeling full after eating only a small amount of food (early satiety)\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n\n【8】However, these symptoms are nonspecific and in most instances are due to something else even if you have a liver hemangioma, as these tend to be asymptomatic.\n\n【9】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【10】Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】It's not clear what causes a liver hemangioma to form. Doctors believe liver hemangiomas are present at birth (congenital).\n\n【13】A liver hemangioma usually occurs as a single abnormal collection of blood vessels that is less than about 1.5 inches (about 4 centimeters) wide. Occasionally liver hemangiomas can be larger or occur in multiples. Large hemangiomas can occur in young children, but this is rare.\n\n【14】In most people, a liver hemangioma will never grow and never cause any signs and symptoms. But in a small number of people, a liver hemangioma will grow to cause symptoms and require treatment. It's not clear why this happens.\n\n【15】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【16】Factors that can increase the risk that a liver hemangioma will be diagnosed include:\n\n【17】*   **Your age.** A liver hemangioma can be diagnosed at any age, but it's most commonly diagnosed in people ages 30 to 50.\n*   **Your sex.** Women are more likely to be diagnosed with a liver hemangioma than are men.\n*   **Pregnancy.** Women who have been pregnant are more likely to be diagnosed with a liver hemangioma than women who have never been pregnant. It's believed the hormone estrogen, which rises during pregnancy, may play a role in liver hemangioma growth.\n*   **Hormone replacement therapy.** Women who use hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms may be more likely to be diagnosed with a liver hemangioma than women who do not.\n\n【18】Complications\n-------------\n\n【19】Women who have been diagnosed with liver hemangiomas face a risk of complications if they become pregnant. The female hormone estrogen, which increases during pregnancy, is believed to cause some liver hemangiomas to grow larger.\n\n【20】Very rarely, a growing hemangioma can cause signs and symptoms that may require treatment, including pain in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, abdominal bloating or nausea. Having a liver hemangioma doesn't mean you can't become pregnant. However, discussing the possible complications with your doctor can help you make a more informed choice.\n\n【21】Medications that affect hormone levels in your body, such as birth control pills, could cause an increase in size and complications if you've been diagnosed with a liver hemangioma. But this is controversial. If you're considering this type of medication, discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor.\n\n【22】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Cases and controls were matched for age and sex in a 1:3 ratio, with diagnostic and/or billing codes used to enumerate and classify health care visits in the year before the index suicide. Matched analysis via conditional logistic regression related odds of suicide to visit type. A generalized estimating equation model was used to compare timing and frequency of visits between cases and controls.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In the year before death, cases had an increased odds of both inpatient hospitalizations and emergency department nonmental health visits (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 1.55; 95% CI, 1.27-1.88; _P_ <.001 and OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.26-1.60; _P_ <.001) but not outpatient nonmental health visits (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.01; _P_ \\=.63). Decedents increased health care utilization closer to suicide death and had significantly more health care visits than did controls 3 months before suicide (6 vs 2; _P_ \\=.01) but not 9 to 12 months before suicide (4 vs 2; _P_ \\=.07). At all time points, cases used more mental health care services than did controls.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Compared with controls, suicide decedents had emergency department visits and more inpatient hospitalizations, both mental health and nonmental health related. As death approached, cases' frequency of health care usage increased. The only category in which cases and controls did not differ was in the frequency of outpatient nonmental health visits.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ED ( emergency department ), EMR ( electronic medical record ), ICD-9 ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ), ICD-10 ( International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision ), OR ( odds ratio )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【32】*   Addison's disease (underactive adrenal glands) or\n*   Type 2 diabetes mellitus or\n*   Kidney disease—The potassium in potassium-containing citrates may worsen or cause heart problems in patients with these conditions.\n\n【33】*   Diarrhea (chronic)—Treatment with citrates may not be effective; a change in dose of citrate may be needed.\n\n【34】*   Edema (swelling of the feet or lower legs) or\n*   High blood pressure or\n*   Toxemia of pregnancy—The sodium in sodium-containing citrates may cause the body to retain (keep) water.\n\n【35】*   Heart disease—The sodium in sodium-containing citrates may cause the body to retain (keep) water; the potassium in potassium-containing citrates may make heart disease worse.\n\n【36】*   Intestinal or esophageal blockage—Potassium citrate tablets may cause irritation of the stomach or intestines.\n\n【37】*   Stomach ulcer or other stomach problems—Potassium citrate–containing products may make these conditions worse.\n\n【38】*   Urinary tract infection—Citrates may make conditions worse.\n\n【39】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【40】For patients taking the tablet form of this medicine:\n\n【41】*   Swallow the tablets whole. Do not crush, chew, or suck the tablet.\n*   Take with a full glass (8 ounces) of water.\n*   If you have trouble swallowing the tablets or they seem to stick in your throat, check with your doctor at once. If this medicine is not completely swallowed and not properly dissolved, it can cause severe irritation.\n\n【42】For patients taking the liquid form of this medicine:\n\n【43】*   Dilute with a full glass (6 ounces) of water or juice and drink; follow with additional water, if desired.\n*   Chill, but do not freeze, this medicine before taking it, for a better taste.\n\n【44】For patients taking the crystals form of this medicine:\n\n【45】*   Add the contents of one packet to at least 6 ounces of cool water or juice.\n*   Stir well to make sure the crystals are completely dissolved.\n*   Drink all the mixture to be sure you are taking the correct dose. Follow with additional water or juice, if desired.\n\n【46】Take each dose immediately after a meal or within 30 minutes after a meal or bedtime snack. This helps prevent the medicine from causing stomach pain or a laxative effect.\n\n【47】Drink at least a full glass (8 ounces) of water or other liquid (except milk) every hour during the day (about 3 quarts a day), unless otherwise directed by your doctor. This will increase the flow of urine and help prevent kidney stones.\n\n【48】Take this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. This is especially important if you are also taking a diuretic (water pill) or digitalis medicine for your heart.\n\n【49】### Dosing\n\n【50】The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【51】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【52】#### For potassium citrate\n\n【53】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   To make the urine more alkaline (less acidic) and to prevent kidney stones:\n        *   Adults—At first, 1.08 to 2.16 grams three times a day with meals. Some people may take 1.62 grams four times a day with meals or within thirty minutes after a meal or bedtime snack. Your doctor may change your dose if needed. However, most people usually will not take more than 10.8 grams a day.\n        *   Children—Dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【54】#### For potassium citrate and citric acid\n\n【55】*   For oral dosage form (solution):\n    *   To make the urine or blood more alkaline (less acidic) and to prevent kidney stones:\n        *   Adults—At first, 2 to 3 teaspoonfuls of solution, mixed with water or juice, four times a day, after meals and at bedtime. Your doctor may change the dose if needed.\n        *   Children—Dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   To make the urine more alkaline (less acidic):\n        *   Children—At first, 1 to 3 teaspoonfuls of solution, mixed with water or juice, four times a day after meals and at bedtime. Your doctor may change the dose if needed.\n*   For oral dosage form (crystals for solution):\n    *   To make the urine or blood more alkaline (less acidic) and to prevent kidney stones:\n        *   Adults—At first, 3.3 grams of potassium citrate, mixed with water or juice, four times a day, after meals and at bedtime. Your doctor may change the dose if needed.\n        *   Children—Use is not recommended.\n\n【56】#### For potassium citrate and sodium citrate\n\n【57】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   To make the urine more alkaline (less acidic) and to prevent kidney stones:\n        *   Adults—At first, 1 to 4 tablets after meals and at bedtime.\n        *   Children—Dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【58】#### For sodium citrate and citric acid\n\n【59】*   For oral dosage form (solution):\n    *   To make the urine and blood more alkaline (less acidic) and to prevent kidney stones:\n        *   Adults—At first, 2 to 6 teaspoonfuls of solution four times a day, after meals and at bedtime. The solution should be mixed in one to three ounces of water. Your doctor may change the dose if needed. However, most people will usually not take more than five ounces a day.\n    *   To make the blood more alkaline (less acidic):\n        *   Adults—1 to 2 tablespoonfuls as a single dose. You may mix it in one to two tablespoonfuls of water.\n    *   To make the contents of the stomach less acidic before surgery:\n        *   Children—At first, 1 to 3 teaspoonfuls of solution four times a day, after meals and at bedtime. The solution should be mixed in one to three ounces of water. Your doctor may change the dose if needed.\n\n【60】#### For tricitrates\n\n【61】*   For oral dosage form (solution):\n    *   To make the urine and blood more alkaline (less acidic) and to prevent kidney stones:\n        *   Adults—At first, 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls of solution four times a day, after meals and at bedtime. Your doctor may change the dose if needed.\n    *   To make the contents of the stomach less acidic before surgery:\n        *   Adults—1 tablespoonful as a single dose. You should mix the solution in one tablespoonful of water.\n    *   To make the urine or blood more alkaline (less acidic):\n        *   Children—At first, 5 to 10 mL four times a day after meals and at bedtime. Your doctor may change the dose if needed.\n\n【62】### Missed Dose\n\n【63】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【64】### Storage\n\n【65】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【66】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【67】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【68】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【69】It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits. This is to make sure the medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【70】Do not eat salty foods or use extra table salt on your food while you are taking citrates. This will help prevent kidney stones and unwanted effects.\n\n【71】Check with your doctor before starting any strenuous physical exercise, especially if you are out of condition and are taking any other medication. Exercise and certain medications may increase the amount of potassium in the blood.\n\n【72】For patients taking potassium citrate–containing medicines:\n\n【73】*   Do not use salt substitutes and low-salt milk unless told to do so by your doctor.

The fluid can range from thin and clear to thick and yellow-green. The fluid might drip or run out of the nose, down the back of the throat, or both. If it runs down the back of the throat, it's called postnasal drip.\n\n【2】A runny nose is often called rhinorrhea or rhinitis. But the terms are different. Rhinorrhea involves a thin, mostly clear fluid running from the nose. Rhinitis involves irritation and swelling inside the nose.\n\n【3】Rhinitis is the usual cause of a runny nose. A runny nose also might be stuffy, also called congested.\n\n【4】Anything that irritates the inside of the nose can cause a runny nose. Infections — such as colds, flu or sinusitis — and allergies often cause runny and stuffy noses. Some people have noses that run all the time without a known reason. This is called nonallergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis.\n\n【5】A polyp, an object such as a small toy stuck in the nose, or a tumor might cause the nose to run from only one side. Sometimes migraine-like headaches can cause a runny nose.\n\n【6】### Call your health care provider if:\n\n【7】*   Your symptoms last more than 10 days.\n*   You have a high fever.\n*   What comes from your nose is yellow and green. Your face hurts or you have fever. This may be a sign of a bacterial infection.\n*   What comes out of your nose is bloody. Or your nose keeps running after a head injury.\n\n【8】### Call your child's doctor if:\n\n【9】*   Your child is younger than 2 months and is running a fever.\n*   Your baby's runny nose or congestion causes trouble nursing or makes breathing difficult.\n\n【10】### Self-care\n\n【11】Until you see your health care provider, try these simple steps to relieve symptoms:\n\n【12】*   Avoid anything you know you're allergic to.\n*   Try an allergy medicine you can get without a prescription. If you're also sneezing and your eyes are itching or watering, you might have allergies. Be sure to follow the label instructions exactly.\n*   For babies, put several saline drops into one nostril. Then gently suction that nostril with a soft rubber-bulb syringe.\n\n【13】To relieve saliva that builds up at the back of the throat, also known as postnasal drip, try these measures:\n\n【14】*   Avoid common irritants such as cigarette smoke and sudden humidity changes\n*   Drink plenty of water.\n*   Use nasal saline sprays or rinses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

After being evaluated and stabilized in the emergency department, he is admitted to the critical care unit for catheterization. When his medical team enters the room for the first time, Mr A haughtily surveys the group and announces: “Well, if it isn't another white-coat brigade…and this one looks younger than the last group! Don't think you're going to get me to jump through any more hoops…I did that already for those clowns in the emergency room, and I'm done. I'm outta here.”_\n\n【1】How should a physician respond to such a patient? Frequently, the first reaction is surprise and anger, often mixed with a desire to avoid the patient as much as possible. However, the physician must be flexible enough to move beyond this initial reaction to an attitude conducive to the development of a working relationship, often despite the patient's best efforts to prevent it. As Groves wisely says in his classic paper, “What the behaviors of such patients teach over time is that it is not how one feels about them that is most important in their care.

A better understanding of what is happening experientially for the patient can provide a basis for more useful responses. What do we know so far about Mr A? It would appear that he can be rude, dismissive, demeaning, and controlling. These are signs; but what are the symptoms—and the human story—behind them? One of the problems with patients like Mr A (and indeed, what helps make them difficult) is that they are unaware of their emotional state, aside, perhaps, from their anger. The task for the clinician is to realize the degree to which fear, anxiety, or other feelings—rather than simple hostility—produce the patient's offensiveness.\n\n【21】Recognition that some degree of fear and anxiety is natural in hospitalized patients can help a physician remain constructively engaged with them. The clinician with a personal or family history of serious illness could more easily see the hospital milieu from the patient's perspective and begin to understand the off-putting behavior. The physician must lose no time in quickly translating the patient's communication into less toxic language. In this case, Mr A has essentially said “I'm mad, I don't take your authority for granted, and I'm doing what _I_ want to do.” Keeping this translation in mind allows the clinician to avoid the following kinds of potentially inflammatory response: _“I'm Dr B, and this is the team. As you know, you've suffered a significant heart attack and it would not be safe to leave the hospital now;”_ _“Mr A, I'm afraid I can't talk to you if you make threats and demands;” or_ _“Pardon me, but we need to know if you're still having chest pain or shortness of breath.”_\n\n【22】Such responses risk inflaming Mr A because they do not recognize that his hostility is not personally directed but rather serves to keep others at arm's length so that he can avoid feeling fear and anxiety. This is what he _knows how to do_ in dangerous situations; his offensiveness is not reserved for physicians alone. The wise clinician deflects the anger and responds first to the fear, recognizing that despite appearances, the anger is not meant personally. The physician needs to _show_ , rather than _explain_ , that he intends no threat and just wants to help. Three tools are of vital importance here: the handshake, the ID badge, and the chair.\n\n【23】_Smiling, Dr B walks up to Mr A's bedside, offers his hand, shows him his hospital ID badge, and says: “I'm Dr B and I hear you were in the emergency department for a long time. Would you mind if I sat down so we can talk a bit about your condition?”_\n\n【24】Skeptical readers can be forgiven for thinking that “making nice” with such patients is a waste of time. The attitude exemplified, however, serves 3 useful functions. It communicates respect for the patient's feelings (however unpleasantly expressed), emphasizes the collaborative nature of the work to be done, and allows the patient some measure of control over the interaction. Dr B is careful to avoid even subtly taking the bait of Mr A's hostility, invariably a fruitless proposition.\n\n【25】_Mr A warily shakes Dr B's hand, glances at the other team members with contempt, but does not object when Dr B sits down next to him. Mr A continues:“I told you, I'm getting out of here. I've had it with needles and \\[he flings off his nasal oxygen\\] this stupid tube. My wife is coming to get me. I'm fine.”_\n\n【26】Is this really a competency issue? Does Mr A not understand that he has had a myocardial infarction? Is he about to leave against medical advice? These questions can be answered only after someone asks Mr A what _he_ thinks is going on. Unless a few minutes are immediately invested in allowing the patient to tell his story, convey his view of the situation, and vent his emotions, the possibility for collaborative understanding could be lost. A common tactical error is to address competency (more accurately, “capacity”) issues before some minimal solidification of the therapeutic relationship. Dr B sidesteps the discharge issue, recognizing that it is not yet ripe; he first needs to know more about how the situation looks from Mr A's perspective.\n\n【27】_Dr B, avoiding the temptation to remind Mr A of the gravity of his situation, says to him: “I understand you were in a bar with some friends when you began having some pain in your chest. How do you feel now?”_\n\n【28】Even the well-adjusted patient can hear the question “What brought you to the hospital?” only so many times in the course of a day without becoming irritated. For the angry and demanding patient, twice can be too often. The prepared clinician already has some idea of what brought the patient in; communicating this knowledge to the patient staves off the “Don't you idiots _talk_ to each other?” reply that often greets the clinician who asks _first_ to be told the whole story again. Dr B leads his inquiry _not_ with a request to be told the chief complaint, _not_ with an attempt to determine Mr A's capacity to sign out against medical advice, and _not_ with an attempt to maintain authority by making it clear who's the boss. Instead, he prioritizes the patient's discomfort and asks about it.\n\n【29】_“Goddamn lousy,” replies Mr A. “I still can't breathe right, I'm black and blue from where some moron stuck me 10 times looking for a vein, and now little Miss Barbie over there \\[he points to his nurse\\] says I'll need a 6-foot wire up my crotch for the next test? You're dreaming. My wife's taking me out of here.”_\n\n【30】Mr A makes nothing easy. Yet like a rock climber searching for the tiniest handhold, the clinician in these circumstances must look for any opportunity to have a nonvolatile exchange with the patient. For the moment, Mr A seems too upset to discuss the medical specifics of his situation; a different tack should be tried.\n\n【31】_Dr B (having noted that Mr A has mentioned his wife twice) says: “How is your wife doing with all this?” Mr A answers: “She was goddamn hysterical on the phone when they told her I had_ had _a heart attack. That's how my old man died, and he was younger than me. Jesus—first we find out last week that our kid has been using cocaine, and now this.”_\n\n【32】Now things have started to open up a little bit. By consistently refusing to verbally retaliate, Dr B has efficiently uncovered other stresses burdening Mr A, who has, probably without being aware of it, confided in his physician. Physicians often feel that they lack both the time and the skill with which to uncover such matters. In fact, it may only take a few minutes; what matters is that the physician approaches the patient with curiosity about his activities and relationships.\n\n【33】无关删除-2:<u>*   Fitzgerald FT</u>\n\n【34】Curiosity.\n\n【35】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 1999; 130 : 70-72</u></u>\n\n【36】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (62)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【37】无关删除-2:<u>*   Barondess JA</u>\n\n【38】Viewpoint: on wondering.\n\n【39】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Acad Med._ 2005; 80 : 62-65</u></u>\n\n【40】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (5)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【41】Common sense is more useful than expertise here. Once physician and patient have had a conversation _on any topic,_ it will be easier to get down to business. (Dr B makes note of another important point: Mr A knows that he has had a heart attack, and that heart attacks kill people. These will be important data if the AMA discharge issue comes to a head.)\n\n【42】Is Dr B losing valuable time by not focusing on the medical facts? In reality, the scenario played out thus far would likely take less than a minute or two, and this small investment of time could make the difference in developing a working rather than an adversarial relationship. Just as the typical operative note indicates that before an incision was made the patient had been “prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion,” so with the contentious patient some preparatory alliance-building must be done if the patient is to decide to collaborate—rather than fight—with his caregivers. Often this involves talking about anything _but_ the disease process itself; physicians must resist the temptation to think that their job is only to manage disease.\n\n【43】_Dr B decides to stick with Mr A's family situation briefly and asks: “Will your wife be OK?” Mr A replies: “She's already frantic about our kid, and I'm the breadwinner. If I kick off, she's sunk. Am I gonna die, Doc?”_\n\n【44】Now Mr A is starting to sound less like a difficult patient. This is the opening for which Dr B has been preparing. Here is the chance to begin a dialogue about the medical aspects of the case.\n\n【45】_Dr B replies: “Well, things could have been much worse. It looks as if you're going to pull through fine, as long as we can work together. Can I explain what our game plan should be?”_\n\n【46】Now Dr B can begin to discuss more traditional medical subjects such as diagnosis and treatment. Keeping in mind the fact that Mr A is obviously not someone who likes feeling dictated to, Dr B emphasizes the _collaborative_ nature of medical care and is careful to again ask Mr A's permission to explain how they might work together. As a general rule, discussions with challenging patients should make copious use of the pronouns _we, us_ , and _our_ rather than _I, you_ and, _your_ . A helpful model here is that of “doing business” with a patient. This implies a need to recognize the patient's position and to be willing to _negotiate, rather than dictate_ a plan with which each party feels reasonably satisfied.\n\n【47】Does this approach sound like indulging or caving in to the needs of a demanding person? Should the physician not take a firm line to ensure best medical practice and to keep the patient from running the show? Obviously, the goal is not to cater to all the whims of the demanding patient. Neither physicians nor other staff members should be the objects of ongoing harassment. Yet by bending a little at the beginning of the interview, by giving the patient a _limited_ opportunity to be difficult, physicians will find that, as in the case of Mr A, they are soon able to move forward.\n\n【48】_Mr A replies: “OK, but I'm not staying for a week…I have to get back to work. And what about this business with that wire up my crotch? You can forget about that. Isn't there some other test you can do?”_\n\n【49】Mr A is trading hostility for curiosity, a sure sign of a patient who is feeling less threatened and more listened to. Now that Mr A is more receptive, Dr B can carefully begin to communicate more medical information: _“If we can be on the same page and there are no complications, I think you'll be out of here in a few days. Here's the deal with that wire: the bad news is that we do need to put it in to see what shape your heart's blood vessels are in; the good news is that we can give you some numbing medicine first, and it's not usually too bad.”_\n\n【50】Once again, Dr B emphasizes the fact that medical treatment involves _working together_ , not _being done to._ Some standard clarification regarding length of stay and the nature of cardiac catheterization begins to defuse those subjects as opportunities for struggle. Dr B is careful to respond concretely and specifically to Mr A's fears; once the patient knows that the physician knows how he feels, he has less need to get his point across by making threats.\n\n【51】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kahn MW</u>\n\n【52】Emergency psychiatry: tools of engagement: avoiding pitfalls in collaborating with patients.\n\n【53】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Psychiatr Serv._ 2001; 52 : 1571-1572</u></u>\n\n【54】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (8)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【55】_Mr A visibly relaxes a bit and replies: “Doc, I'll be honest with you…don't take this personal…I hate doctors and hospitals…always have since my old man kicked. I was only 8 when that happened. When my chest started to hurt I kind of knew what it was, and it freaked me out.”_\n\n【56】This is a frequent outcome: by remaining engaged while refusing to retaliate, Dr B has discovered a clearer view of the reasons behind Mr A's behavior. What is hard, especially for doctors in training, is “not taking it personally.” Like all clinical skills, this can be practiced.\n\n【57】However, we still know very little about Mr A's formal psychiatric diagnosis, or if he has one. In the heat of the moment, such information is often a luxury; the physician must “aim high” in his attitude to the patient, treating the patient _as if_ he could respond positively to being treated as a more adaptive person.

Unfortunately not. Such an approach works with many—but by no means all—patients such as Mr A, who lead with controlling, angry threats. The wide variety of difficult patients demands a wide variety of responses.

Elderly persons are more susceptible to the effects of various medications for a number of reasons. It is well known that polypharmacy is one of the most serious problems in caring for elderly persons; however, many of these patients continue to receive medications that have an increased risk of causing harm. In 1991, an important article was published about inappropriate medication use in the elderly population. This article raised awareness of the problem and presented explicit criteria for determining which medications were inappropriate for elderly patients residing in long-term care facilities. This list of drugs is still used for evaluating medications taken by elderly persons and for determining whether satisfactory prescribing practices are being used. We reviewed the medications described as inappropriate for elderly persons and searched the scientific literature to determine whether evidence exists to defend or refute the labeling of particular drugs. At times, evidence was difficult to find, and many of the original studies were dated. For most medications listed as inappropriate, we found evidence to support these designations.\n\n【1】AV ( atrioventricular ), CHF ( congestive heart failure ), CNS ( central nervous system ), COX-2 ( cyclooxygenase 2 ), GI ( gastrointestinal ), NSAID ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ), OBRA ( Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ), REM ( rapid eye movement ), SSRI ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ), TCA ( tricyclic antidepressant ), UKPDS ( United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study )\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Cytovene\n2.  Cytovene IV\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Ganciclovir is an antiviral. It is used to treat infections caused by viruses.\n\n【6】Ganciclovir is used to treat the symptoms of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of the eyes in people whose immune system is not working fully. This includes patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Ganciclovir will not cure this eye infection, but it may help to keep the symptoms from becoming worse. It is also used to help prevent CMV infection in patients who receive organ or bone marrow transplants, as well as in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Ganciclovir may be used for other serious CMV infections as determined by your doctor. However, it does not work in treating certain viruses, such as the common cold or the flu.\n\n【7】This medicine may cause some serious side effects, including anemia and other blood problems. Before you begin treatment with ganciclovir, you and your doctor should talk about the good this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.\n\n【8】Ganciclovir is to be administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Powder for Solution\n*   Solution\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Ganciclovir can cause serious side effects in any patient. Therefore, it is especially important that you discuss with the child's doctor the good that this medicine may do as well as the risks of using it.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of ganciclovir in the elderly with use in other age groups.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【24】*   Bupropion\n*   Emtricitabine\n*   Imipenem\n*   Maribavir\n*   Methotrexate\n*   Tenofovir Alafenamide\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【26】*   Didanosine\n\n【27】### Other Interactions\n\n【28】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【30】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【31】*   Kidney disease—Ganciclovir may build up in the blood in patients with kidney disease, increasing the chance of side effects\n\n【32】*   Low platelet count or\n*   Low white blood cell count—Ganciclovir may make these blood diseases worse\n\n【33】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【34】It is important that you take ganciclovir capsules with food. This is to make sure the medicine is fully absorbed into the body and will work properly.\n\n【35】To get the best results, ganciclovir must be given for the full time of treatment. Also, this medicine works best when there is a constant amount in the blood.

{"seq_id": "629bea0c-fad6-44a0-ba2d-34f615983f6d", "title": "Amiloride And Hydrochlorothiazide (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Amiloride And Hydrochlorothiazide (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】无关删除-2:<u>1.  Moduretic 5-50</u>\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide combination is used alone or with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.\n\n【6】This medicine is also used to treat water retention (edema) in patients with congestive heart failure.\n\n【7】Amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide are both diuretic medicines (water pills). They reduce the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure. Amiloride keeps your body from losing too much potassium when urine flow is increased.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatrics-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney or heart problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide combination.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Echocardiography revealed a large ascending aortic aneurysm accompanied by severe aortic regurgitation and giant coronary artery aneurysms involving the right, left main, left anterior descending, and circumflex coronary arteries. Coronary angiography clearly defined multiple aneurysms involving the aorta and coronary arteries. The patient underwent complex and successful surgical repair of the aneurysms. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of extensive cardiac involvement in a patient with this uncommon genetic disorder.\n\n【1】Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) (Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) is an uncommon autosomal dominant disorder. Severe and recurrent epistaxis and skin mucosal telangiectases are universal features. More than 50% of patients with HHT also have pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Some patients have brain abscesses or various forms of cerebrovascular accidents due to the underlying right-to-left shunt. Also, gastrointestinal bleeding and abnormal liver function may result from underlying arteriovenous malformations. Direct cardiac involvement is extremely rare.\n\n【2】REPORT OF A CASE\n----------------\n\n【3】A 50-year-old man presented to our hospital with chest pain, palpitations, and substantial dyspnea on exertion. He had a lengthy history of HHT with multiple episodes of severe and life-threatening epistaxes that required numerous hospitalizations and interventions. He had chronic hypoxemia due to multiple pulmonary arteriovenous malformations that were treated with multiple coil embolization therapy. The patient had no traditional coronary risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Although he was tall and thin and had long fingers, he had no history of Marfan syndrome. The patient had no history of ectopia lentis, pectus excavatum, arachnodactyly, or hypermobile joints. Echocardiography performed 7 years previously revealed aortic root enlargement to 4.1 cm with no evidence of aortic regurgitation. Three years previously, an ascending aortic aneurysm (6.0-cm diameter) with moderate aortic regurgitation was found, but the patient declined further surgical evaluation. On admission to our hospital, physical examination revealed a thin, chronically ill man with mild to moderate dyspnea at rest. His blood pressure level was 110/20 mm Hg, and his heart rate was 140 beats/min. Electrocardiography showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. His oxygen saturation while breathing room air was 87%. Transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular enlargement, an ejection fraction of about 50% to 55%, a large ascending aortic aneurysm with a maximum diameter of 7.14 cm, severe aortic regurgitation, a giant right coronary artery aneurysm, and aneurysms of the left main, left anterior descending, and left circumflex coronary arteries visualized from parasternal views 删除4:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【4】Figure 1 Transthoracic echocardiograms from parasternal views.

The left coronary artery aneurysm showed filling defect and hypodensity, highly suggestive of thrombus formation. Several coronary stenoses appeared to be near the aneurysms. Supravalvar aortography confirmed a large ascending aortic aneurysm accompanied by severe aortic regurgitation.\n\n【7】Figure 2 Selective right and left coronary angiograms.

Surgical inspection confirmed the presence of multiple thrombi in the coronary artery aneurysms but revealed no evidence of atherosclerosis. The diameter of the right coronary artery aneurysm was up to 4 cm (larger than the normal-sized aorta), and the left coronary artery aneurysms were up to 3 cm. Pathological examination of the resected ascending aortic aneurysm showed patchy disruption of the elastic lamellar pattern of the media 删除4:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. There was no overt cystic medial necrosis, which can be seen in patients with Marfan syndrome or other connective tissue diseases. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of extensive aneurysms involving the aorta and coronary arteries in a patient with HHT.\n\n【10】Figure 3 Pathological examination of the resected ascending aortic aneurysm shows patchy disruption of the elastic lamellar pattern of the media.

The usual sites involved include the nose, skin, lung, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract. The fundamental mechanism of this disease is related to the mutations of the endoglin leading to vascular dysplasia. Our case is unusual because the patient presented with a large ascending aortic aneurysm, severe aortic regurgitation, and giant coronary artery aneurysms involving every major epicardial coronary artery, which we believe has not been reported previously.

This will allow your doctor to see if this medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it. Blood, urine, and other laboratory tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【55】Do not use rabeprazole together with medicines containing rilpivirine (eg, Complera®, Edurant®, Odefsey®). Using these medicines together may cause unwanted side effects.\n\n【56】Rabeprazole may cause a serious type of allergic reaction when used in patients with conditions treated with antibiotics. Call your doctor right away if you or your child has itching, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth.\n\n【57】Check with your doctor right away if you have a change in frequency of urination or amount of urine, blood in the urine, fever, joint pain, loss of appetite, skin rash, swelling of the body or feet and ankles, unusual tiredness or weakness, or unusual weight gain. These may be symptoms of a serious kidney problem called acute tubulointerstitial nephritis.\n\n【58】Taking this medicine for a long time may make it harder for your body to absorb vitamin B12. Tell your doctor if you have concerns about vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n【59】Serious stomach conditions may occur while taking this medicine alone or together with antibiotics. Check with your doctor immediately if you or your child has stomach cramps, bloated feeling, watery and severe diarrhea which may also be bloody sometimes, fever, nausea or vomiting, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【60】This medicine may increase your risk of having fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine. This is more likely if you are 50 years of age and older, if you receive high doses of this medicine, or use it for one year or more.\n\n【61】Cutaneous or systemic lupus erythematosus may occur or gets worse in lupus patients and are taking PPI. Call your doctor right away if you have a joint pain or skin rash on your cheeks or arms that gets worse when exposed in the sun.\n\n【62】This medicine may cause serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).

Effective management requires timely recognition and accurate diagnosis of the disorder and appropriate selection among therapeutic alternatives. Despite progress in treatment, obstacles remain that impede the achievement of optimal outcomes. The current article provides an overview of the pathobiologic mechanisms of pulmonary arterial hypertension, including genetic substrates and molecular and cellular mechanisms, and describes the clinical manifestations and classification of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The article also reviews established approaches to evaluation and treatment, with emphasis on the appropriate application of calcium channel blockers, prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors. In addition, the authors discuss unresolved issues that may complicate patient management, such as the clinical importance of mild or exercise-related pulmonary arterial hypertension, and they identify avenues by which treatment may advance in the future through the use of combination treatment, outcomes assessment, and exploration of alternative pharmacologic strategies.\n\n【1】5-HTT ( 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter ), BMPR2 ( bone morphogenetic protein receptor, type II ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), IPAH ( idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension ), mPAP ( mean pulmonary arterial pressure ), PAH ( pulmonary arterial hypertension ), PASP ( pulmonary arterial systolic pressure ), PCWP ( pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ), PDE5 ( phosphodiesterase 5 ), PH ( pulmonary hypertension ), TGF-β ( transforming growth factor β ), WHO ( World Health Organization )\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Dr Hayes contends that the recent changes to the ABIM’s certification status reporting format “provide patients with inadequate information about the recertification status of their physicians”; however, these changes are intended to do the opposite. By paring down the amount of information publicly reported about ABIM diplomates, we believe the certification status reporting on our website is now clearer and more understandable to the public and other stakeholders. Although we applaud physicians who have voluntarily recertified in the past, our new reporting focuses on recency—whether physicians are _currently_ and _continuously_ engaged in activities to stay up-to-date.\n\n【1】The new reporting format is also designed to enhance clarity regarding the certification status of physicians with multiple certifications. The ABIM encourages diplomates to maintain only the certifications that are relevant to their practice. However, before the recent reporting changes, the way certification status was reported could appear misleading to patients. For example, if a cardiologist decided to maintain only his cardiovascular disease certification because his internal medicine certification was not relevant to his current practice, he would be listed under the old reporting format on the ABIM’s website as “Not Certified” in internal medicine. With the new reporting format, this diplomate would be listed as “Certified” in cardiovascular disease, and internal medicine would be listed only with the date of initial certification, without designating lapsed certifications as “Not Certified.” The only physicians who are reported as “Not Certified” under the new reporting format are those who no longer have any valid certifications. Diplomates can access their complete certification history by logging in to their account on the ABIM website.\n\n【2】Dr Hayes asks why the ABIM did not address the “grandfather” issue sooner. Incidentally, the ABIM Board of Directors decided to discontinue issuing “lifetime” certifications in 1968, but they concluded at the time that the ABIM did not yet have the capacity to develop a comprehensive recertification program. When the ABIM rolled out recertification and began issuing time-limited certifications in the late 1980s, they made the decision to honor certifications that had been issued without expiration dates, thus creating the grandfathers. The ABIM has sought ways to engage grandfathers in the MOC process for many years. The new MOC requirements do not take away the certification of physicians with lifetime certifications, but the ABIM now reports whether all physicians, including grandfathers, are “Meeting MOC Requirements” on a continuous basis. Since the new program launched on January 1, 2014, more than 8000 grandfathers have chosen to enroll in MOC.\n\n【3】The ABIM believes it is critical that its leadership be held to the same or higher standard for MOC participation as its diplomates. All physicians in service to the ABIM—including staff, directors, councilors, and members of ABIM committees—are required to adhere to the ABIM’s MOC Policy for Physicians Serving ABIM.\n\n【4】删除3:<u>American Board of Internal Medicine.

The policy also requires that all internists/subspecialists serving the ABIM, including grandfathers, must continuously meet MOC requirements throughout their ABIM service.\n\n【7】The principles behind MOC are, in fact, based on evidence.

Given its relatively long half-life (14-17 hours), the lack of dabigatran-specific monitoring assays at most hospitals, and the absence of an approved reversal agent, the routine use of dabigatran in the management of HIT cannot be recommended. In contrast, argatroban, lepirudin, and bivalirudin are relatively more time-tested treatment options, have shorter half-lives and readily available monitoring assays, and have safely been administered in patients with renal (argatroban) or hepatic (lepirudin and bivalirudin) dysfunction.\n\n【17】Nevertheless, we are hopeful that, given the preclinical data that suggest the lack of dabigatran interaction with PF4 or anti-PF4/heparin antibodies and platelets,\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>*   Krauel K.\n*   Hackbarth C.\n*   Fűrll B.\n*   Greinacher A.</u>\n\n【19】Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: in vitro studies on the interaction of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and low-sulfated heparin, with platelet factor 4 and anti-PF4/heparin antibodies.\n\n【20】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Blood._ 2012; 119 : 1248-1255</u></u>\n\n【21】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (93)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【22】dabigatran may be a potential option for anticoagulation in patients with HIT who have intact hepatic and renal function.

Yet during the last decade, increasing concerns (both real and imagined) regarding vaccine adverse effects and safety have arisen. In turn, this has engendered an increasing number of “antivaccine” vaccine” groups, further fueling public and media concerns over a gamut of disorders—hair loss and demyelinating syndromes due to hepatitis B vaccine, autism and inflammatory bowel disease due to measles vaccine, Gulf War illness due to anthrax vaccine, mercury exposure due to the use of thimerosal as a vaccine preservative, and intussusception due to rotavirus vaccine. In addition, these protest groups have raised objections over federal mandates regarding vaccination as a condition for elementary and middle school entry. As we stand on the verge of eradicating and controlling multiple vaccine-preventable diseases, this state of affairs has raised alarm among both scientists and public health officials, as individuals and groups increasingly refuse vaccines.\n\n【6】While the pace of public, media, and congressional interest appears to be accelerating, concerns over vaccine safety are not new. There have always been those opposed to the use of vaccines, even in the face of overwhelming evidence of their benefit. Such was the case with the first vaccine used widely, the smallpox vaccine.

Nonetheless, undue fear of such adverse effects prevents some older people who are at high risk of influenza-related hospitalization or death from receiving the vaccine (or some clinicians from recommending vaccination) simply because they fear GBS. Yet, by not accepting the vaccine, such individuals accept risks that are orders of magnitude higher (such as the 20,000 excess deaths or 250,000 excess hospitalizations due to influenza observed nearly every year) than any possible risk from the vaccine. Unfortunately health care workers themselves are not immune to unfounded fears of adverse effects.

It is our view that a discussion of how the public views vaccine safety cannot be divorced from the culture in which we live, work, and make decisions. Many would argue that we have become a “zero risk” culture. We behave as though any risk of any harm can be reduced to zero—especially with regard to technologic risk. Our litigious society focuses on the concept that a bad outcome is a wrongful outcome and that someone must be held responsible and pay damages. Appropriately, so as to avoid accusations of malice and lawsuits for recovery of damages, government and industry work to minimize liability by minimizing risk. While this focus and the response it engenders clearly result in some level of public good, they also create a dissonant atmosphere where harm cannot be completely prevented and some risks remain irreducible or uncertain. Yet to do nothing harms the greater public good. In our society, individuals sue for spilled hot coffee and falls on rain-slick pavement. A bad medical outcome engenders plans for a malpractice suit even when no evidence exists for incompetent practice. The bad outcome itself becomes prima facie evidence of incompetence. In part, juries and judges need not ground their decisions in science but can be moved by emotion and public opinion. Further, US consumers can generally afford the manufacturers' increases in product charges when the costs of product liability insurance and legal expenses are passed on to them. However, in the case of the controversy over whole-cell pertussis vaccine, manufacturers substantially increased the cost of pertussis vaccine in response to an ever-increasing number of lawsuits and financial liability. Due to concerns over liability, several manufacturers simply stopped producing pertussis vaccine, which resulted in a sufficient crisis that the federal government developed a vaccine injury compensation program to protect manufacturers and prevent the loss of the nation's ability to manufacture and distribute pertussis vaccine.\n\n【71】无关删除-2:<u>*   Brink FW\n*   Hinman AR</u>\n\n【72】The vaccine injury compensation act: the new law and you.\n\n【73】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Contemp Pedialr._ 1989; 6 : 28-42</u></u>\n\n【74】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【75】无关删除-2:<u>*   Loyd-Purvear MA\n*   Ball LK\n*   Benor D</u>\n\n【76】Should the vaccine injury compensation program be expanded to cover adults'?\n\n【77】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Public Health Rep._ 1998; 113 : 236-242</u></u>\n\n【78】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【79】无关删除-2:<u>*   Fiekhoff TC</u>\n\n【80】An idea whose time has come.\n\n【81】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Public Health Rep._ 1998; 113 : 243-244</u></u>\n\n【82】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【83】We propose that a “pyramid effect” is operative in the way decisions are made about vaccine safety and acceptance in our risk-intolerant society. The base of the pyramid can be imagined to resemble the benefit of a widespread public health policy such as the use of a vaccine to prevent a common disease that causes harm. It is broad in its effects. The vaccine benefits the vast majority of the public. The peak of the pyramid represents harm or risk. It is small but sharp. While it may affect very few individuals, its effects are perceived as severe and acute. The majority benefits from the vaccine but feels the benefit only indirectly or perhaps not at all. A minority may actually be harmed or perceive harm, but they perceive it sharply, acutely, and substantially. For this reason, the voices of the shareholders in the public health policy debate over vaccines are unbalanced. The majority who benefit will not champion or defend the program but are likely to be passive participants. The minority who experience or perceive harm may choose to fight against the program that they perceive as causing harm and may become passionate and vociferous opponents. In fact, they may become the only individuals who voice their opinions.\n\n【84】In part, the perception of risk or probability of harm in this pyramid model may arise from another problem, namely, a dilution of benefit. As the use of a safe and efficacious vaccine becomes widespread and gradually diminishes or eliminates the risk of a disease, the public's perception of the vaccine's value paradoxically diminishes—because the public no longer observes the disease or its aftermath. The very success of the vaccine causes its benefit to be diluted or less valued once the disease is no longer considered a high-level threat or risk. Vaccines commonly suffer from this dilution of benefit. For example, the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine has been extraordinarily successful in reducing deaths and morbidity such as sterility, encephalitis, and congenital rubella syndrome.\n\n【85】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n【86】无关删除-2:<u>Impact of vaccines universally recommended for children United States. 1990-1998.</u>\n\n【87】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_MMWRM Morb Mortal Wkly Rep._ 1999; 48 : 243-248</u></u>\n\n【88】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【89】However, individual parents may fail to see its current relevance for their children in that the parents do not perceive the children to be at risk and are unaware of the disease and its consequences. Naturally then such parents would fail to understand the importance of protection against these diseases. For these parents, the vaccine seems unnecessary at best and an intrusive and dangerous assault on personal liberties at worst. Further, those who claim that the measles vaccine is the agent responsible for inflammatory bowel disease or autism raise unfounded fears in others' minds and may accuse the physician, medical industry, public health officials, and the government of incompetence and even malevolence. Unfortunately, while the overwhelming majority suffers no harm from the vaccine, they may also perceive no immediate benefit and therefore see no reason to challenge or resist the accusation. The person at the point of the pyramid, acutely harmed and intensely emotional, commands more “voice” with the media and captures the attention of the public (or Congress). The majority at the base of the pyramid, with their real but diffuse and poorly perceived benefit, remains silent because of little or no emotional investment in the issue. The more effective a vaccine is the more powerful the dilution of benefit appears to be. Everyone gains but no one perceives that benefit.\n\n【90】Chen\n\n【91】无关删除-2:<u>*   Chen RT</u>\n\n【92】Safety of vaccines.\n\n【93】无关删除-2:<u>in: Plotkin SA Orenstein WA Vaccines. 3rd ed.

We must keep in the forefront of any discussion of vaccine safety the understanding of this benefit-risk balance. Vaccines can and do cause harm and may even theoretically carry unknown risks. Vaccines are immunobiologics, and all immunobiologics have been associated with adverse effects, from the frequent occurrence of brief and mild local inflammation following tetanus toxoid injection to the rare occurrence of paralytic polio following administration of the oral polio vaccine. The whole-cell pertussis vaccine may rarely result in hypotonic, hyporesponsive episodes. The hepatitis B vaccine can cause a febrile reaction in a small percentage of newborn infants, which could lead to an unnecessary medical evaluation if not presumptive antibiotic treatment. The rotavirus vaccine appears to increase the risk of intussusception in the weeks that follow the first dose of vaccine in infants. These adverse effects complicate decision making about vaccines at the individual and societal levels, in part because it is impossible to know all the possible risks of a given vaccine until it is used widely in the population.\n\n【97】A current example is that of the rhesus reassortant rotavirus vaccine and the association with intussusception.\n\n【98】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n【99】Withdrawal of rolavirus vaccine recommendation.\n\n【100】删除3:<u>_MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep._ 1999; 48 : 1007</u>\n\n【101】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【102】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n【103】无关删除-2:<u>Intussusception among recipients of rotavirus vaccine United States. 1998-1999.</u>\n\n【104】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep._ 1999; 48 : 577-581</u></u>\n\n【105】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【106】In modern vaccine development, prelicensure studies identify only frequent adverse events, regardless of whether the adverse events are mild, moderate, or severe. In the case of the prelicensure studies of the rotavirus vaccine, approximately 10,000 children received the vaccine. While 5 children did suffer from intussusception, so did 1 child among the 5000 controls; the rates of intussusception were not statistically different between the 2 groups.\n\n【107】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n【108】无关删除-2:<u>Intussusception among recipients of rotavirus vaccine United States. 1998-1999.</u>\n\n【109】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep._ 1999; 48 : 577-581</u></u>\n\n【110】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【111】This is not surprising, as prelicensure studies are unlikely to identify statistically significant rare adverse events that occur at rates in the range of greater than 1 of 1000 to 10,000.

Antivaccine groups see this episode as evidence that vaccines are unsafe, while scientists and public health officials see this as proof that the detection system for adverse events works. What is unclear to the antivaccine groups is that one can never prove or disprove absolute safety of a vaccine or completely eliminate all uncertainty or risk of an adverse event. We are only able to lower the probability of an adverse event into an interval of extraordinary infrequency. This is the nature of scientific proof in clinical trials and of the difficulty in demonstrating cause and effect. In tum, these risk probability concepts and results are extremely difficult to articulate clearly to a risk-averse public.\n\n【125】Despite such irreducible uncertainties, the modern use of vaccines has clearly benefited more than harmed. Over the last century, the human life span has increased 20 to 25 years. It is postulated that this profound change in life span has resulted from 2 major changes: clean water and sanitation and the control of infectious diseases. To the latter, we must give credit to the development and widespread population use of vaccines. As an example, diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, smallpox, and polio have been either reduced from their baseline levels by 98% to 99% in the United States or completely eradicated as in the case with smallpox and polio.\n\n【126】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n【127】无关删除-2:<u>Impact of vaccines universally recommended for children United States. 1990-1998.</u>\n\n【128】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_MMWRM Morb Mortal Wkly Rep._ 1999; 48 : 243-248</u></u>\n\n【129】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【130】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n【131】无关删除-2:<u>Paralytic poliomyelitis—United States, 1980-1994.</u>\n\n【132】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep._ 1997; 46 : 79-83</u></u>\n\n【133】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【134】Such results are unprecedented in human history and are an outcome of the nearly universal population use of multiple safe and effective vaccines.\n\n【135】Maintaining the current success of disease control by vaccines and extending that success to other potentially vaccine-preventable diseases (such as group B streptococcus, herpes simplex, human papillomavirus, cytomegalovirus, and others) is threatened. This may be due in part to an eroding trust on the public's part regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines, an erosion of trust in “experts” and the government, and the (generally) poor attempts on the part of the health community to communicate the risks and benefits of vaccines to the public. Moreover, any discussion of risk suffers from the “hidden” nature of many communicable diseases and their complications. Lay people and even clinicians may not feel the urgency for varicella immunization, for example. Many recall chickenpox as a mild childhood annoyance and have little experience with varicella as a disease with considerable attendant morbidity and mortality. Thus, most do not perceive varicella as a real threat, despite the fact that it is a highly contagious human virus causing 100 deaths per year in the United States and resulting in hospitalization of approximately 1 of every 164 persons with varicella.\n\n【136】无关删除-2:<u>*   Gershon AA\n*   Takahashi M\n*   White CJ</u>\n\n【137】Varicella vaccine.\n\n【138】无关删除-2:<u>in: Plotkin SA Orenstein WA Vaccines. 3rd ed.

They regularly witnessed the devastation caused by polio on their community, friends, and family. Thus, the perception of both disease and vaccine risk within a culture may heavily influence choices regarding immunization. In addition, others have commented on the growing role of the current antivaccine movement in the United States and Europe and have documented the consequences of such groups' actions in creating fear of receiving vaccines such as pertussis, the resultant lower immunization coverage rates, and the inevitable reemergence in morbidity and mortality due to those diseases.\n\n【145】无关删除-2:<u>*   Gangarosa EJ\n*   Galazka AM\n*   Wolfe CR\n\n【146】Impact of anti-vaccine movements on pertussis control: the untold story.\n\n【147】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Lancet._ 1998; 351 : 356-361</u></u>\n\n【148】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (538)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【149】What other factors have contributed to the current antivaccine ethos? In part, the federal government's response to concerns over vaccine safety and its role in vaccine delivery at the population level may inadvertently stimulate negative responses from the populace.

Evidence for this is the number of anti vaccine groups that frequently cite this very issue. Additionally, federal attempts to institute childhood immunization registries in each county and each state may further fuel concerns about the role of government in individual health affairs and raise additional privacy concerns. In turn, these factors feed into the cultural milieu in the United States of questioning authority, particularly the right of the government, to “coerce individuals to have themselves or their children vaccinated.”\n\n【155】无关删除-2:<u>*   Slreefland P\n*   Chowdhury AM\n*   Ramos-Jimenez P</u>\n\n【156】Patterns of vaccination acceptance.\n\n【157】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Soc SeiMed._ 1999; 49 : 1705-1716</u></u>\n\n【158】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【159】In addition, the widespread electronic information network and ease of communication now allow all voices to be heard in the public debate, without regard to the authenticity or agenda of the information presented. Thus, we see the propagation of Web sites with misguided and, in some cases, simply wrong information presented as established scientific fact. Inappropriate actions by opinion leaders also contribute to suspicion regarding vaccines. Recent examples include the widely reported congressional hearings on vaccine safety and actions taken by the French government to suspend temporarily the adolescent hepatitis B immunization program in that country (they have since restored the program).\n\n【160】How then do public health and individual practitioners proceed in such an environment? To protect the public health, vaccinologists, scientists, and public health officials must participate in the current debate over vaccine safety, risks, and benefits and carefully examine the consequences of individual and collective societal decisions about vaccines. They must do this with solid scientific data and with skills in transmitting such information despite irreducible uncertainties. Policymakers and public health officials must develop an explicit framework or “decision map” on which to make rational and explicit decisions about the deployment of vaccines. Doing so facilitates public debate and understanding and provides a basis by which we can defend decisions that occasionally result in unexpected, unacceptable risks and the retreat from a previous recommendation. Public health officials must recognize that such a process may result in the viewpoint that not all vaccines should necessarily be received by everyone, without regard to individual or group risk, simply because such a vaccine exists.\n\n【161】We propose that practical first steps include ensuring that physicians, nurses, and other health care workers are better informed and educated regarding vaccines and riskbenefit issues regarding vaccines. This education process needs to start during professional education and extend throughout continuing education. Ample evidence suggests that frontline providers have inadequate knowledge about vaccines and vaccine administration prograrns.\n\n【162】无关删除-2:<u>*   Fedson DS</u>\n\n【163】Adult immunization: summary of the National Vaccine-Advisory Committee Report.\n\n【164】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 1994; 272 : 1133-1137</u></u>\n\n【165】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (137)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【166】无关删除-2:<u>*   Zimmerman RK\n*   Barker WII\n*   Strikas RA\n\n【167】Time Development Committee.

It will stress parents' perception that, in vaccination practice, ‘experts’ are making fundamental decisions about their children's health, without consultation or providing the option to exempt.” For this reason, our own view is that the role of the government is to inform, educate, recommend, and even provide incentives for immunization—but not to mandate without exclusion acceptance among the civilian population. Informed refusal must remain an acceptable choice in a free democracy, and the culture of informed consent, with both religious and philosophical exemption, must be maintained. The difficult balancing act will be in determining the right of the state to control an infectious disease and the right of the individual to choose. This might be partly resolved by considering (with informed refusal) universal immunization against those diseases that pose unacceptable risks to others in the community.\n\n【175】In addition, increasing the funds available for vaccine research, including funding for the development of safer and more effective vaccines,\n\n【176】*   National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\n\n【177】National Institutes of Health.

A major priority should be to set aside research funds dedicated to finding and understanding genetic (and other) factors predictive of severe vaccine adverse events. Finally, government and the health care industry would be wise to fund social research aimed at understanding immunization acceptance behaviors of the public in general and specific ethnic groups with low vaccine uptake in particular.\n\n【181】As a society, it is in our interest to protect ourselves against the morbidity and mortality of diseases we can prevent with vaccines. It is also to our benefit to minimize any harm that may arise from such vaccines. But we must recognize that to maximize widespread benefits, we must be prepared to incur some lesser risks, and in the final analysis, government and public health officials must be prepared to engage in the hard work of forming partnerships with vaccine experts and the public in order to make decisions that are seen as benefiting both the individual and society. Coupled with informed debate, we must use science, technology, and common sense to our maximum advantage, while maintaining rights of freedom of choice, in order to choose wisely among the growing number of vaccines and deploy the optimal set of vaccines for each individual and for society as a whole.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Diflucan\n\n【4】### Canadian Brand Name\n\n【5】1.  CanesOral\n\n【6】### Descriptions\n\n【7】Fluconazole is used to treat serious fungal or yeast infections, including vaginal candidiasis, oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush, oral thrush), esophageal candidiasis (candida esophagitis), other candida infections (including urinary tract infections, peritonitis \\[inflammation of the lining of the stomach\\], and infections that may occur in different parts of the body), or fungal (cryptococcal) meningitis. This medicine works by killing the fungus or yeast, or preventing its growth.\n\n【8】Fluconazole is also used to prevent candidiasis in patients having bone marrow transplants who receive cancer or radiation treatment.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Tablet\n*   Powder for Suspension\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluconazole in children 6 months to 13 years of age. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 6 months of age.\n\n【18】### Geriatric\n\n【19】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluconazole in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fluconazole.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Fertinex\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Urofollitropin injection is used to treat infertility in women. This medicine is a man-made hormone called follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH is produced in the body by the pituitary gland. FSH helps to develop eggs in the ovaries of women.\n\n【6】Urofollitropin will help develop and release eggs in women who have not been able to become pregnant because of problems with ovulation, and have already received a medicine to control their pituitary gland.\n\n【7】This medicine is also used in women with healthy ovaries who are enrolled in a fertility program called assisted reproductive technology (ART). ART uses procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). Urofollitropin is used together with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in these procedures.\n\n【8】Urofollitropin is often used in women who have low levels of FSH and too-high levels of LH. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome usually have hormone levels such as this and are treated with urofollitropin to make up for the low amounts of FSH. Many women being treated with urofollitropin have already tried clomiphene (eg, Serophene) and have not been able to conceive yet. Urofollitropin may also be used to cause the ovary to produce several follicles, which can then be harvested for use in gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) or in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

After mixing, use it immediately. Throw away any unused mixed medicine.\n\n【45】Throw away used needles and syringes in a hard, closed container that the needles cannot poke through. Keep this container away from children and pets.\n\n【46】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【47】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that the medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects. Blood and urine tests, and ultrasound examinations are needed to check for any unwanted effects caused by this medicine.\n\n【48】Call your doctor right away if you think you have become pregnant while you are using this medicine.

In 2 recent communications that focused on short-term and long-term ruxolitinib treatment outcome, respectively, the drug was shown to be effective in controlling constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly but was also associated with important adverse effects, including moderate to severe thrombocytopenia and anemia. The most recent of the 2 communications focused on 51 Mayo Clinic patients who participated in the original phase 1/2 ruxolitinib clinical trial and highlighted a high treatment discontinuation rate (92% after a median time of 9.2 months), primarily for loss of treatment benefit but also because of drug-associated adverse effects. The report also discussed the occurrence of sometimes severe withdrawal symptoms during ruxolitinib treatment discontinuation. This “ruxolitinib withdrawal syndrome” was characterized by acute relapse of disease symptoms, accelerated splenomegaly, worsening of cytopenias, and occasional hemodynamic decompensation, including a septic shocklike syndrome. In the current sponsor-independent analysis, we describe the details of these events in 5 severely affected cases (11%) among 47 Mayo Clinic patients with MF in whom ruxolitinib therapy had been discontinued. Our experience calls for full disclosure of the ruxolitinib withdrawal syndrome to patients with MF before initiating ruxolitinib therapy, and treatment discontinuation must be done under close physician supervision and preferably in a tapering schedule.\n\n【1】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【2】DLT ( dose-limiting toxicity ), ET ( essential thrombocythemia ), MF ( myelofibrosis ), MPN ( myeloproliferative neoplasm ), MTD ( maximum tolerated dose ), PMF ( primary MF ), PV ( polycythemia vera )\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

A common local adverse effect of ICS therapy is dysphonia, which has been reported to affect 5% to 58% of patients. Although causes of dysphonia associated with ICS therapy have been underinvestigated, it may result from deposition of an active ICS in the oropharynx during administration, which then causes myopathy or a mucosal effect in the laryngopharynx. Use of ICS should be considered during any evaluation of dysphonia. We recommend using the lowest effective dosage of ICS, administering medication with a spacer, gargling, rinsing the mouth and washing the face after inhalation, and washing the spacer. If dysphonia develops despite these interventions, ICS use should be suspended until symptoms resolve, provided that asthma control is not compromised.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】DPI ( dry-powder inhaler ), ICS ( inhaled corticosteroid ), MDI ( metered-dose inhaler )\n\n【4】CME Activity\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care providers must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic designates this Journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s).™ Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【9】**Learning Objectives:** Educational Objectives.

Seventeen of the 22 were affected by dysphonia on a daily basis: 9 had some evidence of poor vocal fold apposition, and supraglottic hyperfunction was identified in 8. Mucosal quality abnormalities were identified in 13 patients. The mucosal wave was difficult to evaluate; however, the authors identified 2 patients with mucosal wave asynchrony. Insofar as speech evaluation, they noted cycle-to-cycle irregularity of 39% (mean, range between 2%-94%), and the maximum phonation time was reduced in 16 patients. The individual analysis found no correlation between the degree of vocal cord apposition and the speech evaluation findings. The authors suggested that atrophy with bowing was not likely the primary cause of dysphonia. Although they noted that the primary cause was difficult to establish because of the various findings, they maintained that corticosteroids had a direct effect on the mucosa or on the mucus-secreting glands of the ventricles or the trachea.\n\n【126】Some studies have found that ICS use predisposes to development of an inflammatory infiltrate; however, this does not necessarily have a clinical correlate.

Any evaluation of dysphonia should consider use of ICS or other medications as an adverse effect, include a thorough examination of the larynx, and rule out vocal cord nodules, posttussive trauma, and gastroesophageal reflux. Well-designed studies, particularly prospective studies, must be conducted to identify clinical, endoscopic, functional, and histopathologic correlates of ICS-associated dysphonia.\n\n【178】Because ICS therapy is the cornerstone of asthma treatment, we recommend using the lowest effective dosage of ICS and administering it with a spacer to decrease oropharyngeal deposition of inhaled aerosols. After using a spacer, it must be washed with tap water and allowed to air dry. Patients should be instructed to rinse the mouth, gargle, and wash the face after inhalation. Instructions should be provided on the proper method of inhalation. Some of these recommendations are pragmatic expert opinions that need future research 删除4:<u>( Table )</u>. If dysphonia develops despite these interventions, ICS use should be suspended until symptoms resolve, provided that asthma control is not compromised.\n\n【179】TABLE Practical Recommendations to Reduce Dysphonia Caused by Inhaled Corticosteroids\n\n| Use the lowest dosage of inhaled corticosteroid that maintains asthma control |\n| --- |\n| Use a spacer, wash it with tap water, and allow it to air dry after use |\n| Rinse the mouth, gargle, and wash the face after inhalation |\n| Instruct patients in the proper method of inhalation |\n\n【181】无关删除-2:<u>*   Open table in a new tab</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Although VCA can restore form and function, it exposes the patient to the risks associated with lifelong immunosuppression. Hopefully, ongoing advances in regenerative medicine will someday obviate the need for VCA, but until that time, VCA remains an immediate means of reconstructing otherwise unreconstructable defects. We review the outcomes of hand and face transplants, as well as the recent developments in immunosuppression as it relates to the field of VCA.\n\n【16】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Related Articles\n----------------</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Hide Caption Download See figure in Article</u>\n\n【19】无关删除-1:<u>Toggle Thumbstrip</u>\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>无关删除-1:<u>*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download .PPT</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Of patients who were discharged, 37 (47%) had a reversible cause of the arrest (perimyocardial infarction) and received treatment of the primary process. The other 42 patients who were discharged had ischemic coronary heart disease (CHD) (n=25), nonischemic CHD (n=10), or idiopathic VF (n=7). Four of the patients with CHD but no left ventricular dysfunction were treated with coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention alone. A total of 52 patients (66%) were candidates for electrophysiologic testing. Of these patients, 48 (92%) underwent electrophysiologic testing; of these patients, 10 received amiodarone alone, and 35 received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) (of whom 3 also received amiodarone). Patients who did not receive ICD therapy typically presented before 1998 with CHD and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention only. Of 79 patients who were discharged, 14 (18%) with an ICD have received subsequent shocks. Nineteen (24%) of 79 patients have died, 5 of a primary cardiac etiology (including 2 with repeated OHCA).\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】The VF OHCA survival rate is high in the setting of rapid defibrillation, with 40% of patients being discharged from the hospital. By the end of the 10-year study, more patients were receiving antiarrhythmic therapy, in particular ICD implantation, after hospital admission. Overall, the long-term survival in patients with VF OHCA is favorable.\n\n【8】AMI ( acute myocardial infarction ), AVID ( Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators ), CABG ( coronary artery bypass grafting ), CHD ( coronary heart disease ), EF ( ejection fraction ), EP ( electrophysiologic ), ICD ( implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ), MADIT ( Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), MUSTT ( Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial ), OHCA ( out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ), OPC ( overall performance category ), PCI ( percutaneous coronary intervention ), VF ( ventricular fibrillation ), VT ( ventricular tachycardia )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

The discovery of insulin and the start of insulin therapy represent a marvelous multidisciplinary team effort that profoundly transformed the lives of people with diabetes mellitus (DM). Insulin treatment substantially extended the very short life span and health span of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). It was further shown that insulin action is lower (insulin resistance \\[IR\\]) in obesity and that IR in combination with insufficient insulin secretion is the underpinning of type 2 diabetes (T2D) stimulated momentous research on ways to enhance insulin action. The ramification of the discovery of insulin and its actions in different tissues stimulated not only technological advances in devices to monitor glucose and deliver insulin, but also novel oral and injectable therapies to treat T2D. Today we have unprecedented options in treating all patients with DM that substantially reduce the burden of debilitating diabetic complications. This is an appropriate time and context for an overview of the transformative impact of insulin discovery in treating a widely prevalent global disease that causes substantial morbidity and mortality around the world. In the next 18 months, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ will publish insightful reviews offering an opportunity for readers to look back and also look forward to the future of treatment, prevention, and potential cure of DM.\n\n【1】Development of Insulin Therapeutics\n-----------------------------------\n\n【2】Insulin extracts were used initially to treat patients with T1D and a single type of preparation was used and administered multiple times daily.\n\n【3】无关删除-2:<u>*   Banting F.G.\n*   Best C.H.\n*   Collip J.B.\n*   Campbell W.R.\n*   Fletcher A.A.</u>\n\n【4】Pancreatic extracts in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.\n\n【5】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Can Med Assoc J._ 1922; 12 : 141-146</u></u>\n\n【6】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【7】Realization of the need for higher throughput, the preparation of insulin extracts from porcine and beef pancreas, crystallization of insulin, and soluble insulin were developed by pharmaceutical organizations. After the early years of regular insulin therapy with each meal, the imperative need for a longer-acting insulin to achieve better glucose control in the post-absorptive period and overnight prompted the development of longer-acting insulin preparations. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of insulin was altered by the presence of other molecules in the solution starting with the development of longer-acting protamine zinc insulin in 1936\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hagedorn H.C.</u>\n\n【9】Protamine insulinate: (section of therapeutics and pharmacology).\n\n【10】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Proc R Soc Med._ 1937; 30 : 805-814</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>*   Himsworth H.P.</u>\n\n【13】Diabetes mellitus: its differentiation into insulin-sensitive and insulin-insensitive types.\n\n【14】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Lancet._ 1936; 227 : 127-130</u></u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【16】and neutral protamine Hagedorn or isophane insulin (in 1946) and Lente further advanced the goal to better glycemic control.

However, time greater than 180 mg/dL continues to be a challenge everyday, even with HCL, occurring mostly in the postprandial period, and hypoglycemia continues to be experienced by patients with T1D serving as a barrier to regular health-promoting exercise. This has stimulated the development of non-glucose signals such as physical activity measurement for incorporation into automated insulin delivery and also the development of dual hormone insulin and glucagon artificial pancreas to prevent hypoglycemia and promote exercise.\n\n【68】Transplantation Therapy for Diabetes\n------------------------------------\n\n【69】Solid organ transplantation has transformed management of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in diabetes. Kidney transplantation developed in the 1950s changed the natural history of patients with both type 1 and type 2 DM with ESRD. Subsequently, technical aspects of pancreas transplantation were addressed by the 1980s and simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation has been performed mainly for patients who have T1D with ESRD since the 1980s and is an extremely transformational therapy for such patients. The importance of kidney transplantation being performed before initiating dialysis has been recognized with an increasing number of pre-emptive transplantations.\n\n【70】无关删除-2:<u>*   Redfield R.R.\n*   Scalea J.R.\n*   Odorico J.S.</u>\n\n【71】2015\\.

A few centers in the world continue to pursue islet xenotransplantation with wild-type pigs or genetically manipulated pigs serving as organ donors. Stem cell–based islet products have been pursued. The ViaCyte studies use an encapsulated pancreatic endocrine precursor cell product and phase 1/2 trials have not shown function of this product in patients with T1D in good health. A second-generation product with encapsulation but blood vessel formation from the embryonic stem cell product necessitates immunosuppressant use and is being pursued at multiple US and Canadian sites at present in patients with T1D and hypoglycemia unawareness.\n\n【80】A Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy Study of VC-0 Combination Product in Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypoglycemia Unawareness (2017).\n\n【81】删除3:<u>https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03163511?term=viacyte&draw=1&rank=1</u>\n\n【82】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【83】The development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology raised hopes of autologous stem cell–based therapy, but this technology is labor intensive, time consuming, inefficient, and expensive at this time.

The retinopathy endpoint was a 2-step progression based on fundus photographs. The DCCT showed that tight glucose control decreased the progression of retinopathy but also increased the risk of mild and severe hypoglycemia. A small subset of patients experienced much more severe hypoglycemia compared with others in the experimental cohort. Laser photocoagulation to treat proliferative retinopathy decreased the risk of severe vision loss but also increased the risk of isolated defects in the field of vision. The development of angiogenesis inhibitors has transformed management of diabetic retinopathy. Subjects enrolled in the DCCT were offered enrollment in the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study and more than 80% are being followed. Tight glucose control during the DCCT has been shown to decrease the risk of target organ complications including microvascular complications and major acute cardiovascular events (MACE).\n\n【90】Insulin Resistance\n------------------\n\n【91】Harold Himsworth proposed a classification of diabetes into two types\n\n【92】无关删除-2:<u>*   Himsworth H.P.</u>\n\n【93】Diabetes mellitus: its differentiation into insulin-sensitive and insulin-insensitive types.\n\n【94】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Lancet._ 1936; 227 : 127-130</u></u>\n\n【95】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【96】: insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant.

Results of gastric bypass surgery that significantly improves insulin action clearly supports the notion that in most cases T2D and related metabolic problems can be ameliorated with significant intentional weight loss. It is likely that mitigation of IR in multiple organs by interventions is a logical approach in preventing T2D and its complications.\n\n【107】Pharmacotherapy for T2D and Impact on Target Organ Complications\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【108】In the 1970s, therapeutic trials were started to show the impact on diabetes-associated complications. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study included testing of blood pressure and glucose control and showed an impact on microvascular complications. There was no significant impact on macrovascular complications with glycemic control, but blood pressure control was shown to play a critical role in improving morbidity. The results of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes trial, which unexpectedly increased mortality in the intensive therapy group, led to a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendation that trials of new antihyerglycemic agents include assessment of cardiovascular safety.\n\n【109】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hiatt W.R.\n*   Kaul S.\n*   Smith R.J.</u>\n\n【110】The cardiovascular safety of diabetes drugs—insights from the rosiglitazone experience.\n\n【111】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 2013; 369 : 1285-1287</u></u>\n\n【112】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【113】The past 15 years have seen the testing and publication of results from trials designed to test the safety of a therapeutic approach including impact on cardiovascular and renal endpoints.

New classes of drugs, particularly GLP1 Receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and SGLT2 inhibitors, have been shown to impact target organ complications in T2D\n\n【118】Recognition of the incretin effect led to the development of GLP-1 RAs that use this effect to improve glycemic control and decrease weight in overweight and obese patients and T2D. Multiple GLP-1 RA and SGLT2 inhibitors have been tested in large multinational trials. Some GLP-1 RAs decrease the risk of MACE.

The a priori identification of patients at risk for these adverse events is important for future clinical practice and research. With the ability to improve glucose control and impact target organ complications, more thought must be directed towards improving A1c without increasing adverse events associated with rapid improvement. Research is needed to study whether clinical phenotype, pharmacogenomics, or environmental factors can predict the complications related to effective pharmacotherapeutic agents.\n\n【140】These large multinational trials have also clarified concerns raised about possible adverse events associated with these agents. The risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic neoplasia with GLP-1 agonists has been studied extensively. Although the risk is not increased with these agents, there is agreement that these agents are best not prescribed in individuals with past history of pancreatitis and pancreas neoplasia. Increased risk of lower extremity amputations associated with canagliflozin was a concern with early reports but this has since been clarified as not an issue.\n\n【141】American Diabetes Association  \nPharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of medical care in diabetes—2019.\n\n【142】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Diabetes Care._ 2019; 42 : S90-S102</u></u>\n\n【143】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【144】### Need to Consider Normal Physiologic Insulin Milieu in Diabetic Patients\n\n【145】Insulin treatment by peripheral insulin administration results in alteration of normal insulin milieu.

However, somewhat unexpected and frustrating has been the increase in the cost of insulin, even after expiration of the patent and the availability of generic preparations. This issue appears complex and concern has been expressed by various subspecialty medical organizations. The American Diabetes Association developed a multidisciplinary task force called the Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group to evaluate the extent of this issue and propose solutions. Much work lies ahead to address this important issue if patients are to experience the benefits of clinical evidence generated.\n\n【194】无关删除-2:<u>*   Cefalu W.T.\n*   Dawes D.E.\n*   Gavlak G.\n\n【195】无关删除-2:<u>Erratum.

There is an imperative need to address several gaps in our understanding of diabetes. Although glucose is the seminal biomarker of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance, insulin effect on a multitude of other areas, especially energy metabolism, oxidative stress, fatty acid, and protein metabolism remains to be fully understood. Advances in these areas potentially will have substantial impact in preventing diabetes and its debilitating complications. Over the next 18 months, several of the milestones described will be addressed in insightful, clinically relevant, reviews in _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ by experts in each area.\n\n【201】无关删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【202】无关删除-1:<u>The authors thank Dr Ravinder Jeet Kaur and Ms Melissa Aakre for their assistance.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "f639a837-2e20-4cc0-9b51-6fdef7f54223", "title": "In reply", "text": "【0】In reply\nWe appreciate the communication from Drs Menne and Haller regarding their review of the gastrointestinal adverse events in the Randomised Olmesartan and Diabetes Microalbuminuria Prevention (ROADMAP) study. The lack of excess adverse effects relating to the gastrointestinal system in individuals enrolled in the ROADMAP study, half of whom were actively treated with olmesartan, puts our report in perspective. Their data suggest that the association we had described is likely quite rare. This finding should be reassuring for both prescribers and patients who are doing well with olmesartan. Drs Menne and Haller rightly point out that our report was based on patients drawn from a wide referral base. Rare associations of other drug therapies can be clinically important, yet not seen in many of the often quite large initial clinical trials. In particular, Drs Menne and Haller report on just more than 2200 individuals exposed to olmesartan (40 mg) followed up for a mean of 3 years, or approximately 6600 years of patient follow-up. Our research reported on a relatively small number of patients (22 total) who were drawn from a likely much larger population of individuals taking olmesartan. Further, the population from which our patients were drawn likely had more heterogeneous clinical characteristics than permitted by the strict inclusion criteria used in the ROADMAP study. We have since identified more patients with a similar syndrome, including 1 patient with diabetes who was prescribed olmesartan for microalbuminuria prevention (ie, a profile similar to that of the patients enrolled in the ROADMAP research). Larger postmarketing surveillance studies will be necessary, along with other studies, for example, pharmacogenetic studies, to understand the mechanisms of this important, albeit rare, association.\n\n【1】In his letter, Dr Talbot described a 59-year-old man who had abnormal intestinal biopsy findings (intraepithelial lymphocytosis on a first biopsy specimen and intraepithelial lymphocytosis with mild villous blunting on a subsequent biopsy specimen) without diarrhea and also had “symptoms consistent with worsening gastric reflux” and mild constipation. This profile suggests the possibility of a spectrum of severity in olmesartan-associated enteropathy. In addition to diarrhea, many of our patients also experienced upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Other clinical characteristics of Dr Talbot's reported case are consistent with our observations. Demonstration of complete recovery of the mucosa of the duodenum after suspension of olmesartan therapy in his patient will be required to support an association between olmesartan and histologic abnormalities in the absence of symptomatic malabsorption.\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【4】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.10.006</u></u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>© 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Although not widely recognized by clinicians, this risk factor is easily assessed by measures such as resting and peak exercise heart rate, heart rate recovery after exercise, and heart rate variability. Any factor that leads to inappropriate activation of the sympathetic nervous system can be expected to have an adverse effect on these measures and thus on patient outcomes, while any factor that augments vagal tone tends to improve outcomes. insulin resistance, sympathomimetic medications, and negative psychosocial factors all have the potential to affect autonomic function adversely and thus cardiovascular prognosis. Congestive heart failure and hypertension also provide important lessons about the adverse effects of sympathetic predominance, as well as illustrate the benefits of β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 2 classes of drugs that reduce adrenergic tone. Other interventions, such as exercise, improve cardiovascular outcomes partially by increasing vagal activity and attenuating sympathetic hyperactivity.\n\n【1】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【2】ACE ( angiotensin-converting enzyme ), CCB ( calcium channel blocker ), CHD ( coronary heart disease ), CHF ( congestive heart failure ), LV ( left ventricular ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), PPA ( phenylpropanolamine )\n\n【3】Evolutionary pressures over millions of years have adapted the sympathetic nervous system as a major mediator of the fight or flight response. Adrenergic neurohumoral activation increases heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output and dilates large muscular arteries and the bronchioles. These changes are meant to prepare humans for physical confrontation or to respond to acute hemodynamic collapse or respiratory compromise. When the sympathetic nervous system is used in these settings, it improves a person's chance of survival and increases the likelihood that his or her genes will be passed on to the next generation.\n\n【4】Appropriate and intermittent stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system produces immediate improvement in various symptoms, from the mundane (fatigue, weakness, nasal congestion, etc) to the more serious (bronchial constriction, hypotension, and shock). Additionally, some of the exhilaration of life is mediated by adrenergic stimulation, commonly referred to as an _adrenaline rush._ Conversely, a reduction in sympathetic neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain can produce dysphoria and lethargy. These factors have encouraged the liberal use of sympathomimetics for long-term therapy, ranging from prescription and over-the-counter drugs to “natural” supplements to illicit or illegal drugs. Although these agents produce short-term beneficial effects in many acute situations, long-term use not only results in tachyphylaxis but also exacts a toll on the integrity of the cardiovascular system.\n\n【5】The status of the autonomic nervous system, although often ignored by clinicians, is a major determinant of cardiovascular health and prognosis. Any therapy that chronically activates the sympathetic nervous system and/or diminishes parasympathetic (vagal) tone will increase the risk of cardiovascular events. In contrast, therapies that tip the autonomic balance toward parasympathetic dominance and decrease sympathetic tone will improve prognosis. This simple axiom explains many observations and should be used as a guide in clinical decision making in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease. In this article, we review the relationship between autonomic tone and cardiovascular risk and suggest strategies for recognizing and treating this risk factor.\n\n【6】AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION AS A RISK FACTOR\n--------------------------------------\n\n【7】Many studies have established an elevated resting heart rate as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality.\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>*   Gillman MW\n*   Kannel WB\n*   Belanger A\n*   D'Agostino RB</u>\n\n【9】Influence of heart rate on mortality among persons with hypertension: the Framingham Study.\n\n【10】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am Heart J._ 1993; 125 : 1148-1154</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hjalmarson A</u>\n\n【13】Significance of reduction in heart rate in cardiovascular disease.\n\n【14】删除3:<u>_Clin Cardiol._ 1998; 21 : II3-II7</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【16】Astute clinicians have long recognized the paradoxically worrisome nature of a “normal” sinus rhythm of 90 beats/min compared with a reassuringly “abnormal” sinus bradycardia of 50 beats/min.

A dramatic example of this phenomenon occurs under the extreme conditions of high-altitude mountain climbing. Elite alpinists are highly trained athletes who at sea level have a resting heart rate of less than 55 beats/min, a peak exercise heart rate of greater than 180 beats/min, and a brisk heart rate recovery within the first minute of resting. Within the days to weeks that climbers are acclimating to progressively higher altitudes, their resting heart rate gradually increases, peak exercise heart rate decreases, and heart rate recovery becomes delayed.\n\n【94】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ponchia A\n*   Noventa D\n*   Bertaglia M\n\n【95】Cardiovascular neural regulation during and after prolonged high altitude exposure.\n\n【96】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Eur Heart J._ 1994; 15 : 1463-1469</u></u>\n\n【97】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【98】无关删除-2:<u>*   Farinelli CC\n*   Kayser B\n*   Binzoni T\n*   Cerretelli P\n*   Girardier L</u>\n\n【99】Autonomic nervous control of heart rate at altitude (5050 m).\n\n【100】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Eur J Appl Physiol Occup Physiol._ 1994; 69 : 502-507</u></u>\n\n【101】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (23)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【102】Altitudes greater than 26,000 feet are termed the _death zone._ As climbers ascend above this level, their resting heart rate typically increases to 120 to 140 beats/ min, and their peak exercise heart rate decreases to this same level; thus, their heart rate recovery is nonexistent. Essentially, climbers are dying of hypoxia and exposure, and the sympathetic nervous system, while trying to compensate, is becoming less and less effective because of down-regulation of the adrenergic receptors in the face of continuous maximal sympathetic stimulation. These same adaptations, although less extreme, operate under normal ambient conditions.\n\n【103】Excessive sympathetic stimulation and diminished vagal tone not only are markers of an unhealthy cardiovascular system but also in part cause the adverse events. Chronic sympathetic hyperactivity increases the cardiovascular workload and hemodynamic stresses and predisposes to endothelial dysfunction, coronary spasm, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and serious dysrhythmias.\n\n【104】无关删除-2:<u>*   Metra M\n*   Nodari S\n*   D'Aloia A\n*   Bontempi L\n*   Boldi E\n*   Cas LD</u>\n\n【105】A rationale for the use of β-blockers as standard treatment for heart failure.\n\n【106】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am Heart J._ 2000; 139 : 511-521</u></u>\n\n【107】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【108】Increased vagal activity exerts a protective effect against ischemia-related dysrhythmias and also reduces heart rate and blood pressure.\n\n【109】无关删除-2:<u>*   Iellamo F\n*   Legramante JM\n*   Massaro M\n*   Raimondi G\n*   Galante A</u>\n\n【110】Effects of a residential exercise training on baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability in patients with coronary artery disease: a randomized, controlled study.\n\n【111】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Circulation._ 2000; 102 : 2588-2592</u></u>\n\n【112】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【113】The risks of MI, sudden cardiac death, and stroke are highest during the first few hours after awakening in the morning, correlating with the circadian peak in sympathetic activity.\n\n【114】无关删除-2:<u>*   Muller JE</u>\n\n【115】Circadian variation and triggering of acute coronary events.\n\n【116】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am Heart J._ 1999; 137 : S1-S8</u></u>\n\n【117】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【118】Mortality due to CHD is higher on Monday than on other days of the week but only in employed people.\n\n【119】无关删除-2:<u>*   Willich SN\n*   Lowel H\n*   Lewis M\n*   Hormann A\n*   Arntz HR\n*   Keil U</u>\n\n【120】Weekly variation of acute myocardial infarction: increased Monday risk in the working population.\n\n【121】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Circulation._ 1994; 90 : 87-93</u></u>\n\n【122】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【123】β -Blockers normalize these increased risks related to circadian catecholamine peaks.\n\n【124】无关删除-2:<u>*   Peters RW</u>\n\n【125】Propranolol and the morning increase in sudden cardiac death: the beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial experience.\n\n【126】删除3:<u>_Am J Cardiol._ 1990; 66 : 57G-59G</u>\n\n【127】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【128】In the setting of LV dysfunction, abnormal autonomic tone is the _most_ sensitive predictor of cardiac and arrhythmic mortality, even more so than documented ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【129】无关删除-2:<u>*   La Rovere MT\n*   Pinna GD\n*   Hohnloser SH\n*   Autonomic Tone and Reflexes After Myocardial Infarction (ATRAMI) Investigators\n\n【130】Baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability in the identification of patients at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias: implications for clinical trials.\n\n【131】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Circulation._ 2001; 103 : 2072-2077</u></u>\n\n【132】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【133】Major noncardiac surgery is associated with activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased CHD risk,\n\n【134】无关删除-2:<u>*   Mangano DT\n*   Hollenberg M\n*   Fegert G\n*   Study of Perioperative Ischemia (SPI) Research Group\n\n【135】Perioperative myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, I: incidence and severity during the 4 day perioperative period.\n\n【136】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Am Coll Cardiol._ 1991; 17 : 843-850</u></u>\n\n【137】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【138】and β -blockers normalize this perioperative cardiovascular risk.\n\n【139】无关删除-2:<u>*   Mangano DT\n*   Layug EL\n*   Wallace A\n*   Tateo I\n*   Multicenter Study of Perioperative Ischemia Research Group</u>\n\n【140】Effect of atenolol on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity after noncardiac surgery.\n\n【141】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1996; 335 : 1713-1720</u></u>\n\n【142】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1153)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【143】无关删除-2:<u>*   Poldermans D\n*   Boersma E\n*   Bax JJ\n*   Dutch Echocardiographic Cardiac Risk Evaluation Applying Stress Echocardiography Study Group\n\n【144】The effect of bisoprolol on perioperative mortality and myocardial infarction in high-risk patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\n【145】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1999; 341 : 1789-1794</u></u>\n\n【146】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1013)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【147】The rates of sudden cardiac death and acute MI are increased in earthquake survivors during the days to weeks after the event.

Indeed, the normal heart will respond to sympathetic stimulation by increasing cardiac output, but in the setting of an injured heart, adrenergic stimulation is analogous to “flogging a sick horse.” A series of agents, from dopamine and dobutamine decades ago to more recent designer inotropes with associated vasodilatation like milrinone or vesnarinone, showed transient, inconsistent improvements in CHF symptoms that were offset by an exacerbation (often doubling) of mortality over a 6- to 12-month period 删除4:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>.\n\n【324】无关删除-2:<u>*   Packer M\n*   Carver JR\n*   Rodeheffer RJ\n*   PROMISE Study Research Group\n\n【325】Effect of oral milrinone on mortality in severe chronic heart failure.\n\n【326】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1991; 325 : 1468-1475</u></u>\n\n【327】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【328】无关删除-2:<u>*   Bouvy ML\n*   Heerdink ER\n*   De Bruin ML\n*   Herings RM\n*   Leufkens HG\n*   Hoes AW</u>\n\n【329】Use of sympathomimetic drugs leads to increased risk of hospitalization for arrhythmias in patients with congestive heart failure.\n\n【330】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arch Intern Med._ 2000; 160 : 2477-2480</u></u>\n\n【331】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【332】recently reported that use of sympathomimetic drugs increased the risk of hospitalization for arrhythmias in patients with CHF.\n\n【333】无关删除-2:<u>*   Packer M\n*   Carver JR\n*   Rodeheffer RJ\n*   PROMISE Study Research Group\n\n【334】Effect of oral milrinone on mortality in severe chronic heart failure.\n\n【335】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1991; 325 : 1468-1475</u></u>\n\n【336】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【337】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【338】In contrast, the use of β-blockers has revolutionized the prognosis of cardiomyopathy and CHF.

Therefore, we urge clinicians to develop an increased awareness of the effects of various therapies on autonomic function; consider carefully the risks involved before prescribing medications with sympathomimetic effects, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease; and place greater emphasis on interventions (like regular, moderate-intensity exercise, β-blockers, and ACE inhibitors) that have been shown to improve autonomic function and outcomes in patients with CHD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Having a tooth removed is called an extraction. Dry socket happens when a blood clot at the site where the tooth was removed does not form, comes out or dissolves before the wound has healed.\n\n【2】Usually a blood clot forms at the site where a tooth was removed. This blood clot is a protective layer over the underlying bone and nerve endings in the empty tooth socket. Also, the clot contains cells that are needed for proper healing of the site.\n\n【3】Intense pain happens when the underlying bone and nerves are exposed. Pain occurs in the socket and along the nerves to the side of the face. The socket becomes swollen and irritated. It may fill with bits of food, making the pain worse. If you get a dry socket, the pain usually begins 1 to 3 days after the tooth removal.\n\n【4】Dry socket is the most common complication following tooth removals, such as the removal of third molars, also called wisdom teeth. Medicine you can buy without a prescription usually will not be enough to treat dry socket pain. Your dentist or oral surgeon can offer treatments to relieve your pain.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Symptoms of dry socket may include:\n\n【7】*   Severe pain within a few days after removing a tooth.\n*   Loss of part or all of the blood clot at the tooth removal site. The socket may look empty.\n*   Bone that you can see in the socket.\n*   Pain that spreads from the socket to your ear, eye, temple or neck on the same side of your face as the tooth removal.\n*   Bad breath or a foul odor coming from your mouth.\n*   Bad taste in your mouth.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】A certain amount of pain and discomfort is typical after a tooth removal. But you should be able to manage the pain with the pain reliever your dentist or oral surgeon prescribed. The pain should lessen with time.\n\n【10】If you develop new pain or the pain gets worse in the days after your tooth removal, contact your dentist or oral surgeon right away.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】The exact cause of dry socket is still being studied. Researchers think that certain issues may be involved, such as:\n\n【13】*   Bacteria that gets into the socket.\n*   Injury at the surgical site when tooth removal is difficult. This can happen with irregular wisdom tooth development or position, called an impacted wisdom tooth.\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】Factors that can increase your risk of developing dry socket include:\n\n【16】*   **Smoking and tobacco use.** Chemicals in cigarettes or other forms of tobacco may prevent or slow healing. These chemicals can get into the wound site. Also, the act of sucking on a cigarette may cause the blood clot to come out too early.\n*   **Birth control pills.** High estrogen levels from birth control pills may cause problems with healing and increase the risk of dry socket.\n*   **Improper at-home care.** Not following home-care instructions and having poor mouth care may increase the risk of dry socket.\n*   **Tooth or gum infection.** Current or previous infections around the area where the tooth was removed increase the risk of dry socket.\n\n【17】Complications\n-------------\n\n【18】Even though a dry socket can be painful, it rarely causes an infection or serious complications. But healing in the socket may be delayed. Pain may last longer than usual after a tooth removal. Dry socket also may lead to an infection in the socket.\n\n【19】Prevention\n----------\n\n【20】### What you can do before surgery\n\n【21】You can take these steps to help prevent dry socket:\n\n【22】*   Look for a dentist or oral surgeon with experience in removing teeth.\n*   Practice good oral care by brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing once a day. Good oral care before surgery keeps your teeth and gums clean and removes bacteria.\n*   If you smoke or use other tobacco products, try to stop smoking before your tooth is removed. Smoking and using other tobacco products increase your risk of dry socket. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about a program to help you quit for good.\n*   Talk to your dentist or oral surgeon about any prescription medicines, medicines you can buy off the shelf, herbs, or other supplements you're taking. Some may cause problems with blood clotting.\n\n【23】### What your dentist or oral surgeon may do\n\n【24】Your dentist or oral surgeon can take steps to help with proper healing of the socket and prevent dry socket. These steps may include recommending one or more of these medicines, which may help prevent dry socket and infections:\n\n【25】*   Dressing with medicine to put on the wound after surgery.\n*   Antibacterial mouthwashes or gels immediately before and after surgery.\n*   Antiseptic solutions to put on the wound.\n*   Oral antibiotics, usually only if you have a weakened immune system.\n\n【26】### What you can do after surgery\n\n【27】Your dentist or oral surgeon can give you instructions about what to expect during the healing process after a tooth removal and how to care for the site. Proper at-home care after a tooth removal helps with healing and prevents damage to the wound. To help prevent dry socket, instructions will likely include:\n\n【28】*   **Activity.** After your surgery, plan to rest for that day. Follow instructions from your dentist or oral surgeon about when you can return to your usual activities. Also follow instructions about how long to avoid vigorous exercise and sports that might cause the blood clot to come out of the socket.\n*   **Pain management.** Put cold packs on the outside of your face on the first day after tooth removal. After the first day, warm packs may help. Cold and warm packs can help decrease pain and swelling. Follow instructions from your dentist or oral surgeon about putting cold or heat on your face. Take pain medicines as prescribed.\n*   **Beverages.** Drink lots of water after the surgery. Avoid alcoholic, caffeinated, carbonated or hot beverages for as long as recommended. Do not drink with a straw for at least a week. The sucking action may cause the blood clot to come out of the socket.\n*   **Food.** Eat only soft foods, such as yogurt or applesauce, for the first day. Be careful with hot and cold liquids or biting your cheek until the numbness wears off. When you feel ready, start eating foods that do not need a lot of chewing. Avoid chewing on the surgery side of your mouth.\n*   **Cleaning your mouth.** After surgery, you may gently rinse your mouth and brush your teeth, but avoid the site where the tooth was removed for the first 24 hours. After the first 24 hours, gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water several times a day for a week after your surgery. Mix 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) of table salt in 8 ounces (237 milliliters) of water. Follow the instructions from your dentist or oral surgeon.\n*   **Tobacco use.** If you smoke or use tobacco, do not do so for at least 48 hours after surgery and as long as you can after that. Using tobacco products after oral surgery can slow healing and increase the risk of complications.\n\n【29】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "3b5869c7-0de2-4bb8-9035-012a668b6153", "title": "Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line", "text": "【0】Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), also called a PICC line, is a long, thin tube that's inserted through a vein in your arm and passed through to the larger veins near your heart. Very rarely, the PICC line may be placed in your leg.\n\n【2】A PICC line gives your doctor access to the large central veins near the heart. It's generally used to give medications or liquid nutrition. A PICC line can help avoid the pain of frequent needle sticks and reduce the risk of irritation to the smaller veins in your arms.\n\n【3】A PICC line requires careful care and monitoring for complications, including infection and blood clots. If you're considering a PICC line, discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor.\n\n【4】A PICC line is one type of catheter used to access the large veins in your chest (central venous catheter). Examples of other types of central venous catheters include implantable ports and central lines.\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】A PICC line is used to deliver medications and other treatments directly to the large central veins near your heart.\n\n【7】Your doctor might recommend a PICC line if your treatment plan requires frequent needle sticks for medicine or blood draws. A PICC line is usually intended to be temporary and might be an option if your treatment is expected to last up to several weeks.\n\n【8】A PICC line is commonly recommended for:\n\n【9】*   **Cancer treatments.** Medicines that are infused through a vein, such as some chemotherapy and targeted therapy drugs, can be delivered through a PICC line.\n*   **Liquid nutrition (total parenteral nutrition).** If your body can't process nutrients from food because of digestive system problems, you may need a PICC line for receiving liquid nutrition.\n*   **Infection treatments.** Antibiotics and antifungal medicines can be given through a PICC line for serious infections.\n*   **Other medications.** Some medicines can irritate the small veins, and giving these treatments through the PICC line reduces that risk. The larger veins in your chest carry more blood, so the medicines are diluted much faster, reducing the risk of injury to the veins.\n\n【10】Once your PICC line is in place, it can be used for other things, too, such as blood draws, blood transfusions and receiving contrast material before an imaging test.\n\n【11】Risks\n-----\n\n【12】PICC line complications can include:\n\n【13】*   Bleeding\n*   Nerve injury\n*   Irregular heartbeat\n*   Damage to veins in your arm\n*   Blood clots\n*   Infection\n*   A blocked or broken PICC line\n\n【14】Some complications can be treated so that your PICC line can remain in place. Other complications might require removing the PICC line. Depending on your situation, your doctor might recommend placing another PICC line or using a different type of central venous catheter.\n\n【15】Contact your doctor right away if you notice any signs or symptoms of PICC line complications, such as if:\n\n【16】*   The area around your PICC line is increasingly red, swollen, bruised or warm to the touch\n*   You develop a fever or shortness of breath\n*   The length of the catheter that sticks out of your arm gets longer\n*   You have difficulty flushing your PICC line because it seems to be blocked\n*   You notice changes in your heartbeat\n\n【17】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【18】To prepare for your PICC line insertion, you might have:\n\n【19】*   **Blood tests.** Your doctor may need to test your blood to make sure you have enough blood-clotting cells (platelets). If you don't have enough platelets, you may have an increased risk of bleeding. Medicine or a blood transfusion can increase the number of platelets in your blood.\n*   **Imaging tests.** Your doctor might recommend imaging tests, such as an X-ray and ultrasound, to create pictures of your veins to plan the procedure.\n*   **A discussion of your other health conditions.** Tell your doctor if you've had breast-removal surgery (mastectomy), as that may affect which arm is used for placing your PICC line. Also let your doctor know about previous arm injuries, serious burns or radiation treatment. A PICC line generally isn't recommended if there's a chance you may one day need dialysis for kidney failure, so let your doctor know if you have a history of kidney disease.\n\n【20】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【21】The procedure to insert the PICC line takes about an hour and can be done as an outpatient procedure, meaning it won't require a hospital stay. It's usually done in a procedure room that's equipped with imaging technology, such as X-ray machines, to help guide the procedure. PICC line insertion can be done by a nurse, doctor or other trained medical provider.\n\n【22】If you're staying in the hospital, the procedure might be done in your hospital room.\n\n【23】### During PICC line insertion\n\n【24】During the PICC line insertion you'll lie down on your back with your arm extended to your side. You'll be awake during the procedure, but numbing medicine will be used to minimize discomfort.\n\n【25】A PICC line is usually inserted in a vein in your upper arm, above your elbow. Which arm is used depends on your particular situation, but usually the nondominant arm is used.\n\n【26】The doctor or nurse may use an ultrasound machine to assess the veins in your arm and make sure they're healthy enough to use for the PICC line. You might have a cuff tightened around your arm so that your veins stand out for inspection.\n\n【27】Once a suitable vein is identified in your arm, the skin around the area is cleaned and prepared. Numbing medicine is injected into the skin to minimize pain.\n\n【28】To place the PICC line, a needle is inserted through your skin and into the vein in your arm. Ultrasound or an X-ray might be used to confirm the placement. A small incision is made in the vein so that a thin, hollow tube (catheter) can be inserted.\n\n【29】Once the catheter is in your arm, it's carefully advanced along the vein. The catheter continues up your arm and toward your heart.\n\n【30】When the catheter reaches the right location, you might have an X-ray to verify the catheter is in place. If the procedure is being done in your hospital room, the doctor or nurse may use a heart-monitoring device to determine that the catheter has reached the correct location. You might have an X-ray later.\n\n【31】The other end of the catheter will stick out of your arm. A cap is placed over the end of the catheter to keep it free of germs. It may be taped down so it won't get in the way of your daily activities.\n\n【32】### After PICC line insertion\n\n【33】After a PICC line insertion, there may be some tenderness in the area where the catheter enters your arm. It should go away within a few days.\n\n【34】As you adjust to life with a PICC line, you'll need to consider:\n\n【35】*   **PICC line protection.** Your doctor may recommend specific ways to protect the arm with the PICC line. For instance, don't lift heavy objects and don't have blood pressure readings taken on the affected arm. Your doctor might recommend avoiding jarring activities with your arm, such as throwing a ball. Avoid submerging the PICC line in water, such as might happen with swimming or using a hot tub.\n*   **PICC line care.** A nurse or other provider will show you how to care for your PICC line. This might involve checking the area daily for signs of infection and flushing the line with solution weekly to keep it clear from clogs. It's easier if you have someone to help you with PICC line care. If you need help, you might consider hiring a home health care provider.\n*   **PICC line covers.** You'll need to cover your PICC line when you take a shower, as the area shouldn't get wet. Your doctor or nurse might provide a cover or you can buy one at a drugstore. Other PICC line covers are available for daily use to protect the area or make it less obvious to other people.\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Your PICC line is kept in place for as long as you need it for treatment.\n\n【38】### PICC line removal\n\n【39】Your PICC line can be removed when your treatment ends. To remove the line, a doctor or nurse gently pulls on the end of the catheter to remove it from your arm.\n\n【40】PICC line removal reduces your risk of complications, such as infection. But if there's a chance you may need a PICC line again, your doctor may recommend keeping it in place. That's because repeatedly placing the PICC line increases the risk of damage to your veins.\n\n【41】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Possible infectious causes include common bacterial pathogens (anaerobic, aerobic, or mixed), mycobacteria (tuberculous or nontuberculous), filamentous bacteria ( _Nocardia_ and _Actinomyces_ ), and fungal organisms (endemic mycosis: histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, or blastomycosis). A careful microbiological evaluation, including Gram, acid fast, and fungal stains and bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal nucleic acid amplification testing, and cultures of sputum and bronchial secretions are needed to evaluate most focal cavitary lung lesions. In this otherwise healthy patient with a relatively short antecedent history, as well as a background of infrequent binge drinking, a bacterial lung abscess is the most likely differential diagnosis, pending further diagnostic workup. Endemic or filamentous fungal infections are possible and need to be excluded. Tuberculosis is less likely given the absence of travel or known exposures.\n\n【20】Cavitary lung lesions also occur in systemic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and the presence of extrapulmonary disease manifestations should be assessed in these patients. Serologic testing for rheumatoid factor, anticitrullinated peptide antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) is valuable in the evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis and GPA.\n\n【21】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hagen E.C.\n*   Daha M.R.\n*   Hermans J.\n\n【22】Diagnostic value of standardized assays for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in idiopathic systemic vasculitis: EC/BCR Project for ANCA Assay Standardization.\n\n【23】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Kidney Int._ 1998; 53 : 743-753</u></u>\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (679)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【25】Various neoplasms, such as bronchogenic carcinomas, lymphomas, and metastatic malignant tumors, also frequently cause focal cavitary lung lesions. Bronchoscopy with biopsy of the cavitary lesion should be performed if a malignant tumor is suspected. Lastly, focal cavitary lung lesions are rarely caused by pulmonary infarcts due to septic or pulmonary thromboembolic disease.\n\n【26】The results of sputum microbial stains and cultures, human immunodeficiency virus and fungal serologic testing, purified protein derivative skin testing, and _M tuberculosis_ interferon γ release testing were all negative. The ANCA testing revealed low-positive anti–proteinase-3 (PR3) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (1.0 units; reference range, 0-0.9 units). However, the result of ANCA testing by indirect immunofluorescence on ethanol-fixed neutrophils and PR3-transfected human mast cells was negative. Bronchoscopy demonstrated no endobronchial abnormalities, and endobronchial ultrasonography–guided biopsy of the cavitary lesion revealed acute inflammation with negative microbial stains. Cultures of bronchial secretions yielded _Actinomyces_ and _Veillonella_ species.\n\n【27】*   **2.**\n\n【28】    **Which _one_ of the following would be the _best_ treatment at this time?**\n\n【29】    *   a.\n\n【30】        Intravenous therapy with penicillin G for 3 weeks\n\n【31】    *   b.\n\n【32】        Intravenous therapy with penicillin G for 3 months\n\n【33】    *   c.\n\n【34】        Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics for 3 weeks\n\n【35】    *   d.\n\n【36】        Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics for 3 months\n\n【37】    *   e.\n\n【38】        Surgical referral for refractory lung abscess\n\n【39】On the basis of the available information, the patient was diagnosed as having a mixed bacterial lung abscess.

Consequently, regardless of the bacterial organisms isolated from the respiratory tract, antibiotic treatment for lung abscess generally includes broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\n【48】In this patient, _Actinomyces_ , a branching (filamentous), gram-positive bacillus, and _Veillonella,_ a gram-negative anaerobic coccus, both part of the normal intestinal and oral flora, were isolated from the respiratory tract. Penicillin G represents the first-line therapy for both of these organisms. Nevertheless, given the limited yield of bacterial cultures and the polymicrobial nature of these infections, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is indicated for this patient. Treatment options include clindamycin and β-lactam antibiotics with anaerobic coverage, such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or carbapenems. Metronidazole is not preferred for treating lung abscesses. It has little activity against actinomyces and the microaerophilic streptococci commonly found in abscesses. There is no established duration of antibiotic therapy. Therapy is typically continued until there is notable or total radiologic response, usually for several months. Surgical resection is infrequently needed for patients without radiologic and/or clinical improvement despite appropriate antibiotic therapy or to manage complications such as major hemoptysis.\n\n【49】The patient was prescribed outpatient intravenous ertapenem therapy. After an initial radiologic and clinical improvement, her abscess cavity did not decrease further after 3 months of treatment. In addition, her fever and cough returned after the transition from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy. Consequently, she underwent surgical resection of her refractory lung abscess. Unfortunately, because of the hilar location of the lesion, she required a left pneumonectomy. The initial pathology was interpreted as an abscess cavity. All stains and cultures were negative, and antimicrobial therapy was discontinued.\n\n【50】Six weeks later she experienced recurrent fevers and abdominal pain. Repeated chest CT demonstrated the expected postoperative changes but no new abnormalities. Abdominal CT revealed 2 complex cavitary mass lesions—in the left pelvis involving the iliac artery and in the right kidney. Blood and urine culture results were negative, and the lesions progressed despite the reinitiation of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. She subsequently underwent complex multispecialty abdominal surgery for decortication of both lesions and vascular bypass of the compressed left iliac artery. The results of cultures and microbial stains remained negative. Histopathologic analysis of the renal lesion demonstrated extensive areas of geographic ne-crosis, numerous neutrophilic microabscesses, and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. In addition, pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis was present within the renal parenchyma.\n\n【51】*   **3.**\n\n【52】    **Which _one_ of the following tests would be _most helpful_ in confirming the clinically suspected diagnosis in this patient?**\n\n【53】    *   a.\n\n【54】        Repeated ANCA testing\n\n【55】    *   b.\n\n【56】        Repeated bronchoscopy with biopsy\n\n【57】    *   c.\n\n【58】        Repeated _M tuberculosis_ interferon γ release testing\n\n【59】    *   d.\n\n【60】        Repeated fungal serologic testing\n\n【61】    *   e.\n\n【62】        Angiotensin-converting enzyme level\n\n【63】The lack of clinical response to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and negative results from cultures of surgically removed tissue suggest a noninfectious inflammatory process. Histopathologic changes of geographic necrosis, neutrophilic microabscesses, and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, the presence of crescentic glomerulonephritis, and the previously low-positive PR3-ANCA test result are highly suggestive of GPA. On the basis of these observations, ANCA testing, which usually involves a stepwise approach, should be repeated in this patient. The PR3- and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCAs are measured using an antigen-specific assay, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. If PR3- and/or MPO-ANCAs are detected, the sample is further evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence staining of ethanol-fixed neutrophils. The staining pattern is generally categorized as cytoplasmic or perinuclear ANCA. Positive PR3-ANCA results are typically associated with a cytoplasmic ANCA pattern, whereas MPO-ANCAs result in a perinuclear ANCA pattern. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of a combined positive PR3-ANCA result and cytoplasmic ANCAs for GPA are excellent (73% and 99%, respectively).\n\n【64】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hagen E.C.\n*   Daha M.R.\n*   Hermans J.\n\n【65】Diagnostic value of standardized assays for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in idiopathic systemic vasculitis: EC/BCR Project for ANCA Assay Standardization.\n\n【66】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Kidney Int._ 1998; 53 : 743-753</u></u>\n\n【67】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (679)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【68】There are 2 major classification systems for the vasculitides. The American College of Rheumatology criteria, published in 1990, require the presence of 2 or more of the following 4 criteria: nasal or oral inflammation, an abnormal chest radiograph finding (nodules, fixed infiltrates, or cavities), an abnormal urinalysis result (microscopic hematuria), and evidence of granulomatous arterial or perivascular inflammation on biopsy. The presence of 2 or more criteria has a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 92% for diagnosing GPA. The Chapel Hill Consensus criteria, published in 1994, were created for the purposes of identifying pathologic differences among the different vasculitides. These criteria defined GPA as a granulomatous inflammation involving the respiratory tract with a vasculitis of small to medium vessels. Neither system includes the presence of ANCAs as a requirement to fulfill the disease definition. Given her cavitary lung lesion and biopsy-proven granulomatous disease, our patient met criteria for GPA under the American College of Rheumatology classification and fulfilled the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference definition of GPA. Consequently, a diagnosis of GPA was established.\n\n【69】Repeated chest CT did not reveal any new pulmonary processes; therefore, repeated bronchoscopy with biopsy would not be indicated. However, reevaluation of the prior lung pathology in light of the additional information is essential. It too demonstrated geographic necrosis, neutrophilic microabscesses, and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, adding further support to the clinical diagnosis of GPA. Repeating the _M tuberculosis_ interferon γ release assay, performing more fungal serologic tests, or measuring an angiotensin-converting enzyme level would not be helpful in this patient.\n\n【70】The results of repeated ANCA testing for PR3-ANCA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (2.5 units; reference range, 0-0.9 units; previously 1.0 unit) and cytoplasmic ANCA by indirect immunofluorescence were now clearly positive (1:8), and a diagnosis of GPA was established.\n\n【71】*   **4.**\n\n【72】    **Which _one_ of the following statements is _true_ in regard to the cause of the GPA in this patient?**\n\n【73】    *   a.\n\n【74】        Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding PR3 are found in approximately 90% of cases of GPA\n\n【75】    *   b.\n\n【76】        Special stains frequently demonstrate organisms within the necrotizing granulomas of GPA\n\n【77】    *   c.\n\n【78】        The upper airway of patients with GPA is commonly colonized with _S aureus_\n\n【79】    *   d.\n\n【80】        Therapy with azithromycin may decrease the number of exacerbations in GPA patients\n\n【81】    *   e.\n\n【82】        ANCA seroconversion is only seen with the vasculitides\n\n【83】The pathogenesis of GPA remains unclear, and GPA is classified as an idiopathic small vessel vasculitis. Multiple genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors have been associated with the development of GPA. However, no definite causal genetic or environmental exposure has been identified. Multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in PR3, but none of these is routinely associated with GPA. Microbial stain results are typically negative for the necrotizing granulomas associated with GPA. In this patient, the cavitary lung lesion and positive culture results for _Actinomyces_ and _Veillonella_ from within the lesion, in conjunction with a clinical and radiologic response to appropriate antibiotic therapy, are highly suggestive of a lung abscess. Interestingly, over time the patient’s therapeutic progress stalled, and the disease progressed despite surgical site control and antimicrobial therapy, indicating a transition to a noninfectious inflammatory process.\n\n【84】Infections are not uncommonly reported before the initial presentation or exacerbations of GPA cases. Patients with GPA are more likely to carry _S aureus_ in their nasal passages than age-matched controls. These carriers are at higher risk for disease flares, and therapy with a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole may prevent these events. The putative mechanisms for the benefit of trimoxazole-sulfamethoxazole remain speculative. Azithromycin has some anti-inflammatory properties and has been found to reduce exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis, follicular bronchiolitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but not in GPA. Several systemic infections, including bacterial endocarditis, may mimic the clinical presentation of GPA and cause ANCA seroconversion. Consequently, it is crucial to exclude systemic infections before establishing a diagnosis of GPA.\n\n【85】*   **5.**\n\n【86】    **Which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ next step in managing this patient’s GPA?**\n\n【87】    *   a.\n\n【88】        Because the disease has been resected, observe and repeat imaging in 1 month\n\n【89】    *   b.\n\n【90】        Immunosuppression with prednisone alone\n\n【91】    *   c.\n\n【92】        Immunosuppression with prednisone and cyclophosphamide\n\n【93】    *   d.\n\n【94】        Immunosuppression with prednisone and methotrexate\n\n【95】    *   e.\n\n【96】        Immunosuppression with prednisone and rituximab (anti-CD20 chimeric antibody)\n\n【97】The goal of immunosuppressive therapy in GPA is to treat acute inflammation and prevent irreversible organ damage and mortality. The mortality of untreated severe GPA approaches 90% at 2 years; however, combination therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide improves long-term survival to closer to 80%.\n\n【98】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hoffman G.S.\n*   Kerr G.S.\n*   Leavitt R.Y.\n\n【99】Wegener granulomatosis: an analysis of 158 patients.\n\n【100】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 1992; 116 : 488-498</u></u>\n\n【101】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2610)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【102】Consequently, once a diagnosis of GPA has been established, it should be treated promptly and aggressively. Selection of optimal treatment regimen for GPA is based on disease extent (nonsevere disease \\[limited\\] vs severe), stage (remission induction vs remission maintenance), and patient-specific risk of treatment-associated adverse effects. Our patient is a young woman of childbearing age who needs remission induction therapy for a new diagnosis of severe GPA (given the pauci-immune glomerulonephritis). Despite the crucial role of corticosteroids in controlling acute inflammation in patients with GPA, the long-term effects of corticosteroid monotherapy are suboptimal. Historically, combination therapy with high-dose corticosteroids tapered during 3 to 6 months in combination with 3 to 6 months of either oral or pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide was considered the standard of care for these patients.\n\n【103】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hoffman G.S.\n*   Kerr G.S.\n*   Leavitt R.Y.\n\n【104】Wegener granulomatosis: an analysis of 158 patients.\n\n【105】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 1992; 116 : 488-498</u></u>\n\n【106】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2610)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【107】However, the use of cyclophosphamide has been associated with major acute and chronic adverse events. Patients frequently develop severe leukopenia in the short term, which has been associated with a high risk of severe, potentially life-threatening acute infections or acute hemorrhagic cystitis. Long-term adverse effects of cyclophosphamide include an increased risk for hematologic and solid malignant tumors, including bladder cancer, and irreversible infertility.\n\n【108】Methotrexate is not indicated for remission induction therapy in patients with severe GPA. However, it effectively induces remission in nonsevere disease and can be used for remission maintenance therapy. On the basis of the results of a recent clinical trial demonstrating the noninferiority of B-cell depletion therapy with the humanized anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in combination with corticosteroids compared with cyclophosphamide in severe GPA, the Food and Drug Administration approved rituximab as the first-line agent for remission induction therapy of GPA.\n\n【109】无关删除-2:<u>*   Stone J.H.\n*   Merkel P.A.\n*   Spiera R.\n\n【110】Rituximab versus cyclophosphamide for ANCA-associated vasculitis.\n\n【111】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 2010; 363 : 221-232</u></u>\n\n【112】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1962)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【113】Rituximab has a more favorable adverse effect profile, especially in younger patients.

It is a rare disease, with an incidence of approximately 3.0 per 100,000 persons in the United States.\n\n【116】无关删除-2:<u>*   Cotch M.F.\n*   Hoffman G.S.\n*   Yerg D.E.\n*   Kaufman G.I.\n*   Targonski P.\n*   Kaslow R.A.</u>\n\n【117】The epidemiology of Wegener's granulomatosis: estimates of the five-year period prevalence, annual mortality, and geographic disease distribution from population-based data sources.\n\n【118】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Arthritis Rheum._ 1996; 39 : 87-92</u></u>\n\n【119】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (288)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【120】Clinical presentation of GPA is highly variable and can include constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, arthralgias, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss) and organ-specific symptoms (eg, hemoptysis, cavitary lung nodules or masses, sinusitis, hematuria, palpable purpura, and mononeuritis multiplex). The most commonly affected organs are the upper and lower respiratory tract and the kidneys.\n\n【121】The cause of GPA remains poorly defined and is likely multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors. In the case described, an antibiotic-responsive polymicrobial lung abscess preceded the clinical development of GPA and ANCA seroconversion. It is possible that the prior infection triggered the autoimmune process. Chronic smoldering inflammation (in our case due to polymicrobial infection with _Actinomyces_ and _Veillonella_ sp) may result in persistent neutrophil activation, autoantigen presentation (PR3), and the subsequent generation of ANCA targeting PR3. Interestingly, although low-grade chronic inflammation is relatively common, the development of vasculitis is rarely seen, indicating that host and pathogen-specific factors likely contribute to the development of autoimmunity.\n\n【122】The association between GPA and _S aureus_ is well established. Commonly, _S aureus_ colonizes patients with GPA and represents an independent risk factor for disease relapse (relative risk, 7.2).\n\n【123】无关删除-2:<u>*   Stegeman C.A.\n*   Tervaert J.W.\n*   Sluiter W.J.\n*   Manson W.L.\n*   de Jong P.E.\n*   Kallenberg C.G.</u>\n\n【124】Association of chronic nasal carriage of _Staphylococcus aureus_ and higher relapse rates in Wegener granulomatosis.\n\n【125】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 1994; 120 : 12-17</u></u>\n\n【126】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (683)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【127】The chances of developing vasculitis may be further augmented through immune activation by _S aureus_ superantigens. Associations among other infective agents have been much less frequently reported.\n\n【128】Whereas ANCAs represent a valuable diagnostic marker, their role in the disease pathogenesis remains controversial. Putative mechanisms include neutrophil activation followed by release of proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species, mediated by binding of ANCAs to the PR3 on activated neutrophils. Over time, ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation may result in damage to vascular endothelium and surrounding tissues.\n\n【129】Active GPA needs to be treated promptly and aggressively with high-dose corticosteroids in conjunction with other immunosuppressive agents. Severe (ie, life or organ threatening) disease is treated with either rituximab or cyclophosphamide, whereas nonsevere disease may be treated with methotrexate. The successful induction of remission is typically based on the comprehensive clinical assessment of all organ manifestations and systemic symptoms. To help with this assessment, clinical scoring systems, such as the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for GPA, have been developed to measure disease activity. Aggressive therapy results in disease remission in approximately 90% of patients. Once remission is achieved, the goal of therapy becomes remission maintenance. Preferred medications for maintenance therapy are azathioprine and methotrexate, which have similar safety and efficacy profiles.\n\n【130】无关删除-2:<u>*   Pagnoux C.\n*   Mahr A.\n*   Hamidou M.A.\n\n【131】Azathioprine or methotrexate maintenance for ANCA-associated vasculitis.\n\n【132】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 2008; 359 : 2790-2803</u></u>\n\n【133】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (537)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【134】In contrast, a recent study demonstrated mycophenolate mofetil to be less efficacious.\n\n【135】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hiemstra T.F.\n*   Walsh M.\n*   Mahr A.\n\n【136】Mycophenolate mofetil vs azathioprine for remission maintenance in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【137】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 2010; 304 : 2381-2388</u></u>\n\n【138】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (468)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【139】Recent retrospective case series also suggest a potential role of rituximab for remission maintenance therapy, and an international, prospective randomized controlled trial is being developed.\n\n【140】Despite remission maintenance therapy, 30% to 60% of patients will experience disease relapses.\n\n【141】无关删除-2:<u>*   Hoffman G.S.\n*   Kerr G.S.\n*   Leavitt R.Y.\n\n【142】Wegener granulomatosis: an analysis of 158 patients.\n\n【143】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Ann Intern Med._ 1992; 116 : 488-498</u></u>\n\n【144】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2610)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【145】Risk factors for relapse include persistent ANCA positivity, upper respiratory tract and lung involvement, and airway colonization with _S aureus_ .

Your tonsils are two oval-shaped pads in the back of your mouth that are part of your body's germ-fighting immune system.\n\n【2】Tonsil cancer can cause difficulty swallowing and a sensation that something is caught in your throat. Tonsil cancer is often diagnosed late in the disease, when cancer has spread to nearby areas, such as the lymph nodes in the neck.\n\n【3】Treatments for tonsil cancer include surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of tonsil cancer include:\n\n【6】*   Difficulty swallowing\n*   A sensation that something is caught in the back of your throat\n*   Swelling and pain in the neck\n*   Earache\n*   Jaw stiffness\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Make an appointment with your doctor or dentist if you experience any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Tonsil cancer forms when healthy cells in the tonsils develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to grow out of control and to continue living when healthy cells would normally die. The accumulating cells form a tumor that can grow beyond the tonsils and spread to other areas of the body.\n\n【11】It's not clear what causes tonsil cancer, but doctors are finding that human papillomavirus (HPV) is increasingly playing a role. This common sexually transmitted infection is detected in most tonsil cancers in the United States. Tonsil cancer caused by HPV tends to occur at a younger age and is more likely to respond well to available treatments.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】Factors that may increase the risk of tonsil cancer include:\n\n【14】*   Using tobacco\n*   Drinking alcohol\n*   Being infected with human papillomavirus (HPV)\n\n【15】Prevention\n----------\n\n【16】To reduce your risk of tonsil cancer:\n\n【17】*   **Don't use tobacco.** If you don't use tobacco, don't start. If you currently use tobacco of any kind, talk with your doctor about strategies to help you quit.\n*   **Limit alcohol if you choose to drink.** If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.\n*   **Get regular dental care.** During your appointment, your dentist will check your mouth for signs of cancer and precancerous changes.\n*   **Consider the HPV vaccine.** Receiving a vaccination to prevent HPV infection may reduce your risk of HPV\\-related cancers, such as tonsil cancer. Ask your doctor whether an HPV vaccine is appropriate for you.\n\n【18】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Simulect\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Basiliximab belongs to a group of medicines known as immunosuppressive agents. It is used to lower the body's natural immunity in patients who receive kidney transplants.\n\n【6】When a patient receives a kidney transplant, the body's white blood cells will try to get rid of (reject) the transplanted kidney. Basiliximab works by preventing the white blood cells from getting rid of the transplanted kidney. The effect of basiliximab on the white blood cells may also reduce the body's ability to fight infections.\n\n【7】Basiliximab is to be administered only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Powder for Solution\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Studies on the use of basiliximab in children have not been completed. Preliminary information on the use of basiliximab in children suggests children have the same side effects from receiving basiliximab as those experienced by adult patients, and basiliximab works as well to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney in children as it does in adult patients.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way as they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of basiliximab in the elderly with use in other age groups.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【23】*   Echinacea\n\n【24】### Other Interactions\n\n【25】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【26】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【27】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【28】*   Cancer—Basiliximab may make this condition worse\n\n【29】*   Infection—Basiliximab may decrease the body's ability to fight infection\n\n【30】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【31】### Dosing\n\n【32】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【33】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【34】*   For injection dosage form:\n    *   To prevent kidney transplant rejection:\n        *   Adults—20 milligrams (mg).\n        *   Children—12 mg per square meter of body surface area (mg/m 2).\n\n【35】Most patients receive one dose before and one dose after surgery.\n\n【36】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【37】If you are continuing your course of therapy with basiliximab after you are discharged from the hospital, it is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits. Your doctor will want to do laboratory tests to make sure basiliximab is working properly.\n\n【38】It is important to maintain good dental hygiene and see a dentist regularly for teeth cleaning.\n\n【39】If you are a woman of childbearing age, you should use effective contraception while receiving this medicine and for 2 months after treatment with basiliximab is completed.\n\n【40】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【41】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【42】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【43】#### More common\n\n【44】1.  Abdominal pain\n2.  back pain\n3.  coughing\n4.  dizziness\n5.  fever or chills\n6.  loss of energy or weakness\n7.  painful urination\n8.  shortness of breath\n9.  sore throat\n10.  swelling of the ankles, body, face, feet or lower legs\n11.  trembling or shaking of the hands or feet\n12.  vomiting\n13.  white patches in the mouth or throat or on the tongue\n\n【45】#### Less common\n\n【46】1.

This method (developed in the 1930s) made it possible to measure the magnetic properties of atoms, atomic nuclei, and molecules. The method is based on measuring the spin of the protons in the atom's core, a phenomenon known as nuclear magnetic moments. With the application of Rabi's magnetic resonance method, several mechanical and magnetic properties, as well as the shape, of an atomic nucleus can be deduced. The precise measurements yielded by this method made possible such subsequent applications as the atomic clock, the maser, the laser, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging used in diagnostic medicine. Rabi's method provided the central technique for virtually all molecular and atomic beam experimentation.\n\n【2】Isidor Rabi was born on July 29, 1898, in Rymanov, Austria (now in Poland). He was the older of 2 children. When Isidor was 1 year old, his family immigrated to the United States, where they settled in New York City. His father became the owner of a grocery store.\n\n【3】Rabi's early education was obtained in the New York City public schools; for his secondary education, he attended the Manual Training High School in Brooklyn, NY. He won a New York State scholarship that enabled him to attend Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. He started his college career in 1916 as an electrical engineering student but soon transferred to a major in chemistry. He obtained the BS degree in 1919.\n\n【4】After college graduation, Rabi worked for 3 years as a chemist before returning, in 1922, to Cornell University for graduate work in chemistry. However, he changed his major to physics and, in 1926, was awarded the PhD degree in physics for a thesis on the measurement of the magnetic properties of crystals.\n\n【5】Rabi was awarded a 2-year fellowship for postgraduate work in Europe, where he worked with such eminent physicists as Niels Bohr (1885-1962), Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958), Otto Stern (1888-1969), Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976), Erwin Schrödinger (1887-1961), and Arnold Sommerfeld (1868-1951). In 1929, Rabi returned to the United States and joined the faculty of Columbia University (New York City), where he worked from 1929 to 1967. He was appointed professor of physics at the university in 1937, university professor in 1964, and professor emeritus in 1967.\n\n【6】While on the faculty of Columbia University, Rabi worked in various capacities for the US government. From 1940 to 1945, he led a group of scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, where he helped develop radar for World War II (1939-1945). He also was associate director of the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He served on the Atomic Energy Commission, eventually succeeding J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967) as chair. Rabi was chair of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957.\n\n【7】As a member of the American delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, Rabi was prominent in the movement that led to the founding of the international laboratory for high-energy physics in Geneva, Switzerland, known as CERN. He also was one of the founders of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York.\n\n【8】Rabi was the author of many scientific articles, covering such fields as magnetism, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, and molecular beams. His writings included _My Life and Times as a Physicist_ (1960) and _Science: The Center of Culture_ (1970).\n\n【9】Besides the Nobel Prize, Rabi received many awards and honors, including honorary doctorates and membership in prestigious scientific organizations. On January 11, 1988, at the age of 89 years, Rabi died in New York City. He was honored as a Nobel laureate in physics on a stamp (Scott No. 2130c) issued in 2001 by Guinea.\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【12】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.11.012</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>© 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Kettering—Medical Philanthropist and Inventor", "text": "【0】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【1】Although the American engineer Charles Frederick Kettering is known primarily for his contributions to the development and evolution of the automobile, he also made valuable contributions to medicine and science. As a philanthropist, in 1927 he established the C. F. Kettering Foundation for the Study of Chlorophyll and Photosynthesis at Antioch College (Yellow Springs, Ohio), and in 1945, in collaboration with American industrialist Alfred Pritchard Sloan (1875-1966), he funded the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research at the Memorial Cancer Center in New York City. As an inventor, Kettering designed and built the “Kettering hypertherm,” a device used to treat neurosyphilis (syphilis of the brain) by intensely heating the body.\n\n【2】Charles F. Kettering was born on August 29, 1876, on a farm near Loudonville in north central Ohio (15 miles southeast of Mansfield). He attended a small district school near his home and the high school in Loudonville. After graduating from high school, he enrolled at Wooster Normal School in Wooster, Ohio, and at the age of 19 years, he became a country schoolteacher at Bunker Hill, Ohio. He taught for 1 year and then left to attend Ohio State University in Columbus. However, after completing his freshman year, he left school for 2 years because of an eye ailment. During this time, he worked for the Star Telephone Company in Ashland, Ohio (13 miles northeast of Mansfield). After this 2-year interval, Kettering reentered Ohio State University and graduated with a degree in electrical engineering at 27 years of age.\n\n【3】After he received his engineering degree, Kettering joined the National Cash Register Company (NCR) in Dayton, Ohio, where he became director of a research group. While at NCR, he invented the first electric cash register and was named chief of research and development.\n\n【4】In 1909 Kettering left NCR and, with Edward Andrew Deeds (died in 1960), an NCR executive, founded the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (Delco), to design automobile electrical equipment and to develop their recently invented automobile battery ignition system. As part of this system, Kettering designed the storage battery, the voltage regulator, the generator, and the first electric starter (1911), which was introduced in Cadillacs in 1912. Electric starters eliminated the need to manually crank an engine to start it. While at Delco, Kettering also developed the Delco light, a self-contained light and power unit for farms and other places that did not have access to power lines.\n\n【5】In 1916 Delco became a subsidiary of United Motors Corporation, later (1919) General Motors (GM). Kettering remained with Delco and served as vice president and director of research for GM from 1920 to 1947. In 1925 he moved to Detroit, Michigan, to form GM Research Corporation, later known as the Research Laboratories Division of the General Motors Corporation. After his retirement in 1947, he remained as a consultant.\n\n【6】In 1914 Kettering founded the Dayton Wright Airplane Corporation, which during World War I (1914-1918) designed and built a self-guided aerial torpedo. This was a small monoplane with a highly explosive warhead and automatic controls—a direct precursor of the cruise missile. During the war, Kettering also manufactured airplane ignition systems and developed synthetic aircraft fuel.\n\n【7】Kettering's inventions covered many diverse fields. He contributed to the development of safety glass, crankcase ventilation systems, 4-wheel drive brakes, the nontoxic refrigerant Freon-12 (developed for GM's Frigidaire subsidiary), a process for extracting bromine from sea water, and quick-drying lacquers (for painting automobiles). In 1921 he also contributed to the development of antiknock fuels and leaded gasoline by the addition of tetraethyl lead, and in 1923 he coined the word _Ethyl_ for high-octane gasoline. His work with high-octane fuels was in collaboration with the American chemist Thomas Midgley, Jr (1889-1944). In addition, Kettering developed a high-speed, 2-cycle diesel engine for trains. In 1951 he developed a revolutionary high-compression automobile engine, a V-8 engine (the Kettering Engine).\n\n【8】Kettering held more than 185 patents and was awarded honorary degrees from 29 educational institutions, including doctorates from Northwestern University, New York University, Columbia University, and Harvard University. Among his many honors was being elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n【9】On November 25, 1958, at the age of 82 years, Charles Frederick Kettering died in Dayton, Ohio. As an inventor whose work was instrumental in the evolution of the modern automobile, he was honored on a stamp (Scott No. 380g) issued by Micronesia in 2000.\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【12】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.01.014</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>© 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

{"seq_id": "e8b5c663-9b85-4aa2-8021-e552faa373a1", "title": "Intrauterine insemination (IUI)", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Intrauterine insemination (IUI) — a type of artificial insemination — is a procedure for treating infertility.\n\n【2】Sperm that have been washed and concentrated are placed directly in your uterus around the time your ovary releases one or more eggs to be fertilized.\n\n【3】The hoped-for outcome of intrauterine insemination is for the sperm to swim into the fallopian tube and fertilize a waiting egg, resulting in pregnancy. Depending on the reasons for infertility, IUI can be coordinated with your normal cycle or with fertility medications.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】A couple's ability to become pregnant depends on many different factors. Intrauterine insemination is used most often in couples who have:\n\n【6】*   **Donor sperm.** For women who need to use donor sperm to get pregnant, IUI is most commonly used to achieve pregnancy. Frozen donor sperm specimens are obtained from certified labs and thawed before the IUI procedure.\n*   **Unexplained infertility.** IUI is often performed as a first treatment for unexplained infertility along with ovulation-inducing medications.\n*   **Endometriosis-related infertility.** For infertility related to endometriosis, using medications to obtain a good-quality egg along with performing IUI is often the first treatment approach.\n*   **Mild male factor infertility (subfertility).** Your partner's semen analysis, one of the first steps in the medical assessment of infertility, may show below-average sperm concentration, weak movement (motility) of sperm, or abnormalities in sperm size and shape (morphology). IUI can overcome some of these problems because preparing sperm for the procedure helps separate highly motile, normal sperm from those of lower quality.\n*   **Cervical factor infertility.** Your cervix, at the lower end of the uterus, provides the opening between your vagina and uterus. Mucus produced by the cervix around the time of ovulation provides an ideal environment for sperm to travel from your vagina to the fallopian tubes. But, if your cervical mucus is too thick, it may impede the sperm's journey. The cervix itself may also prevent sperm from reaching the egg. Scarring, such as that caused by a biopsy or other procedures, can cause the cervix to thicken. IUI bypasses your cervix, depositing sperm directly into your uterus and increasing the number of sperm available to meet the awaiting egg.\n*   **Ovulatory factor infertility.** IUI may also be performed for women who have infertility caused by problems with ovulation, including an absence of ovulation or a reduced number of eggs.\n*   **Semen allergy.** Rarely, an allergy to proteins in semen can cause infertility. Ejaculation into the vagina causes redness, burning and swelling where the semen contacts the skin. A condom can protect you from the symptoms, but it also prevents pregnancy. If your sensitivity is severe, IUI can be effective, since many of the proteins in semen are removed before the sperm is inserted.\n\n【7】Risks\n-----\n\n【8】Intrauterine insemination is a relatively simple and safe procedure, and the risk of serious complications is low. Risks include:\n\n【9】*   **Infection.** There's a slight risk of developing an infection as a result of the procedure.\n*   **Spotting.** Sometimes the process of placing the catheter in the uterus causes a small amount of vaginal bleeding. This doesn't usually have an effect on the chance of pregnancy.\n*   **Multiple pregnancy.** IUI itself isn't associated with an increased risk of a multiple pregnancy — twins, triplets or more. But, when coordinated with ovulation-inducing medications, the risk of a multiple pregnancy increases significantly. A multiple pregnancy has higher risks than a single pregnancy does, including early labor and low birth weight.\n\n【10】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【11】Intrauterine insemination involves careful coordination before the actual procedure:\n\n【12】*   **Preparing the semen sample.** Your partner provides a semen sample at the doctor's office, or a vial of frozen donor sperm can be thawed and prepared. Because nonsperm elements in semen can cause reactions in the woman's body that interfere with fertilization, the sample will be washed in a way that separates the highly active, normal sperm from lower quality sperm and other elements. The likelihood of achieving pregnancy increases by using a small, highly concentrated sample of healthy sperm.\n*   **Monitoring for ovulation.** Because the timing of IUI is crucial, monitoring for signs of impending ovulation is critical. To do this, you might use an at-home urine ovulation predictor kit that detects when your body produces a surge or release of luteinizing hormone (LH). Or, an imaging method that lets your doctor visualize your ovaries and egg growth (transvaginal ultrasound) can be done. You also may be given an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) or medications to make you ovulate one or more eggs at the right time.\n*   **Determining optimal timing.** Most IUIs are done a day or two after detecting ovulation. Your doctor or other care provider will have a plan spelled out for the timing of your procedure and what to expect.\n\n【13】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【14】The visit for intrauterine insemination takes about 15 to 20 minutes and is usually done in a doctor's office or clinic. The IUI procedure itself takes just a minute or two and requires no medications or pain relievers. Your doctor or a specially trained nurse performs the procedure.\n\n【15】### During the procedure\n\n【16】While lying on an exam table, you put your legs into stirrups. Your care provider inserts a speculum into the vagina — similar to what you experience during a Pap test. During the procedure, the doctor or nurse:\n\n【17】*   Attaches a vial containing a sample of healthy sperm to the end of a long, thin, flexible tube (catheter)\n*   Inserts the catheter into the vagina, through the cervical opening and into the uterus\n*   Pushes the sperm sample through the tube into the uterus\n*   Removes the catheter, followed by the speculum\n\n【18】### After the procedure\n\n【19】After insemination, you lie on your back for a brief period. Once the procedure is over, you can get dressed and go about your usual daily activities. You may have some light spotting for a day or two after the procedure.\n\n【20】Results\n-------\n\n【21】Wait two weeks before taking an at-home pregnancy test. Testing too soon could produce a result that is:\n\n【22】*   **False-negative.** If pregnancy hormones aren't yet at measurable levels, the test result may be negative when, in fact, you really are pregnant.\n*   **False-positive.** If you're using ovulation-inducing medication such as HCG, the medication that's still circulating in your body could indicate a pregnancy when you really aren't pregnant.\n\n【23】Your doctor may instruct you to return about two weeks after your home kit results for a blood test, which is more sensitive in detecting pregnancy hormones after fertilization.\n\n【24】If you don't become pregnant, you might try IUI again before moving on to other fertility treatments. Often, the same therapy is used for three to six months to maximize chances of pregnancy.\n\n【25】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The presenting tumor stage, histopathologic factors, surgical margins, and adjuvant treatment extent were evaluated. Functional outcomes included gastrostomy tube dependence and tracheostomy dependence. Oncologic outcomes included local, regional, and distant control and disease-specific and recurrence-free survival.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 66 TORS patients were followed up for a minimum of 2 years. Most (97.0%; 64 of 66) were able to eat orally within 3 weeks after surgery before starting adjuvant therapy. Long-term gastrostomy tube use was required in 3 of the 66 (4.5%) and long-term tracheotomy in 1 (1.5%). Three-year estimated local control and regional control were 97.0% and 94.0%, respectively. Two-year disease-specific survival and recurrence-free survival were 95.1% and 92.4%, respectively.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】With appropriate adjuvant therapy, TORS achieves excellent functional results for patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Oncologic outcomes are equivalent or superior to results of other surgical and nonsurgical treatments.\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

The MPR was calculated by use of daily and weekly bisphosphonate doses in a longitudinal cohort of patients who received prescriptions from 14,000 US retail pharmacies. Patient prescription information was from a database accessed through NDCHealth in Atlanta, Ga. Adequate adherence was defined as sufficient medication supply to ensure antifracture efficacy (MPR, ≥80%). The effects of patients' age, method of prescription payment, and pattern of past osteoporosis medication use on medication adherence also were evaluated.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of 211,319 study patients, 177,552 (84%) were taking weekly bisphosphonates vs 33,767 (16%) taking the daily prescription. Although significantly more patients taking the weekly compared with the daily bisphosphonates had adequate medication adherence, only about one third of patients in the daily dosing group and fewer than one half in the weekly dosing group achieved adequate adherence. Patients new to bisphosphonates had the worst medication adherence over the year (25.2% for weekly vs 13.2% for daily dosing; P<.001). The highest proportion of adequately adherent patients was among those continuing to take their existing weekly bisphosphonates; however, even in this group, only about 48% exhibited adequate medication adherence.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】Once-weekly dosing of bisphosphonates for the treatment or prevention of osteoporosis was associated with better medication adherence than daily dosing during a 1-year observation period. However, even with weekly dosing, adherence remained inadequate in more than one half of patients. These findings indicate that ways to improve medication adherence in the treatment or prevention of osteoporosis are still needed.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Procedural complications included atrial fibrillation (n=2), vessel injury (n=3), profound sinus node dysfunction (n=1), and device embolization with successful retrieval (n=1). At 3 months, 7 of 95 monitored patients had trivial residual shunt; at 12 months, 2 of 28 monitored patients had trivial residual shunt. Three patients had recurrent events—2 transient ischemic attacks and 1 retinal artery occlusion—at a mean ± SD follow-up of 8.3±8.1 months (range, 1-34 months). None of these 3 patients had residual shunt or evidence of intracardiac thrombus. The average annual recurrence of all events was 3.6% at 23 months. The overall mean ± SD freedom from recurrence of all events was 98.9%±1.2% and 83.8%±10.2% at 12 and 29 months of follow-up, respectively.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Transcatheter device closure of PFO and/or ASD with use of APO/ASO in patients with presumed PE is effective and safe. Recurrent events may occur in the absence of a residual shunt.\n\n【8】AF ( atrial fibrillation ), APO ( Amplatzer PFO (patent foramen ovale) occluder ), ASA ( atrial septal aneurysm ), ASD ( atrial septal defect ), ASO ( Amplatzer septal occluder ), ICE ( intracardiac echocardiography ), PE ( paradoxical embolism ), PFO ( patent foramen ovale ), TEE ( transesophageal echocardiography ), TIA ( transient ischemic attack ), TTE ( transthoracic echocardiography )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "f5769d7a-c504-427a-aff8-014e9c580696", "title": "Abacavir (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Abacavir (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Ziagen\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Abacavir is used together with other medicines to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\n【6】Abacavir will not cure or prevent HIV infection or the symptoms of AIDS. It helps keep the HIV virus from reproducing, and appears to slow the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of serious health problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV infection. Abacavir will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems related to AIDS or HIV infection.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Tablet\n*   Solution\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of abacavir in children younger than 3 months of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of abacavir in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving abacavir.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【23】*   Cabotegravir\n*   Methotrexate\n*   Orlistat\n*   Ribavirin\n*   Tacrolimus\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【25】*   Methadone\n*   Tipranavir\n\n【26】### Other Interactions\n\n【27】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【28】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【29】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【30】*   Diabetes or\n*   Heart disease or\n*   Hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol or fats in the blood) or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【31】*   Genetic condition (eg, gene variation called HLA-B\\*5701)—This condition may increase the risk for serious and life-threatening side effects.\n\n【32】*   Liver disease, mild—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine to the body.\n\n【33】*   Liver disease, moderate or severe—Should not be used in patients with this condition.\n\n【34】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【35】Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop taking this medicine without checking first with your doctor.\n\n【36】This medicine will come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【37】It is important to take abacavir together with other HIV medicines. Take all of the medicines your doctor prescribed at the right time of day. These medicines work best when there is a constant amount in the blood. To help keep the amount constant, do not miss any doses. If you need help with planning the best times to take your medicines, check with your doctor.\n\n【38】When your supply of this medicine runs low, get more from your pharmacy or from your doctor. The amount of virus in your blood may increase if the medicine is stopped, even for a short time. The virus may develop resistance to this medicine and be harder to treat.\n\n【39】You may take this medicine with or without food.\n\n【40】Measure the oral liquid with a marked measuring spoon, oral syringe, or medicine cup.\n\n【41】### Dosing\n\n【42】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【43】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【44】*   For oral dosage forms (solution or tablets):\n    *   For HIV infection:\n        *   Adults—300 milligrams (mg) two times per day or 600 mg once per day.\n        *   Children 3 months of age and older—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your child's doctor. The dose is usually 8 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight two times per day, or 16 mg per kg of body weight once a day. Your doctor may increase your dose as needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 600 mg per day.\n        *   Children weighing 14 kilograms (kg) or more who can take tablets—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your child's doctor. The dose is usually 300 to 600 mg per day, taken as a single dose once a day or in divided doses two times a day.\n        *   Children younger than 3 months of age—Use and dose must be determined by your child's doctor.\n\n【45】### Missed Dose\n\n【46】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible.

This deficiency is even more striking when comparing our current intake with that of our ancestors, who consumed large amounts of dietary K  . K  deficiency has been implicated in many diseases including cardiovascular disease, kidney stones, and osteoporosis. Importantly, dietary supplementation of K  has favorable effects on reducing blood pressure, decreasing the risk of stroke, improving bone health, and reducing the risk of nephrolithiasis. For this comprehensive review, we scanned the literature using PubMed and MEDLINE using the following search terms: _potassium intake_ , _renal potassium excretion_ , and _prevention of hyperkalemia_ . Articles were selected for inclusion if they represented primary data or review articles published between 1980 and 2015 in high-impact journals. The normal kidney has the capacity to tightly regulate K  homoeostasis. We discuss new findings with respect to sensing mechanisms by which the kidney maintains K  homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract and distal tubule. There are widely prescribed hypertensive medications that cause hyperkalemia and thus require dietary K  restriction. We conclude by discussing newly approved drugs capable of binding K  in the gastrointestinal tract and speculate that this new pharmacology might allow diet liberalization in patients at risk for hyperkalemia, affording them the numerous benefits of a K  \\-rich diet.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ASDN ( aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), DCT ( distal convoluted tubule ), DCT1 ( proximal portion of the distal convoluted tubule ), DCT2 ( distal portion of the distal convoluted tubule ), ENaC ( epithelial Na+ channel ), KS ( kidney specific ), NCC ( NaCl cotransporter ), NHANES ( National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ), RAAS ( renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ), ROMK ( renal outer medullary K+ ), WNK ( with no lysine family of kinases ), WNK1 ( WNK lysine-deficient protein kinase 1 ), WNK4 ( WNK lysine-deficient protein kinase 4 )\n\n【4】**Article Highlights**\n\n【5】*   ▪\n\n【6】    Over several million years, physiology and metabolism of humans evolved to retain Na  and excrete K  in response to a diet that was low in Na  and high in K  . With the onset of agriculture and industrialization, there has been a precipitous drop in dietary K  consumption and an equal rise in dietary salt consumption, contributing to disease onset. This is further supported by the fact that the newest Dietary Guidelines for Americans have listed K  as a “nutrient of public health concern” because of its inadequate consumption. Low K  intake is then implicated in various chronic diseases including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and nephrolithiasis.\n\n【7】*   ▪\n\n【8】    The ability to maintain K  homeostasis in the setting of high dietary intake is regulated by the normal kidney. In addition to the well-recognized role of aldosterone in renal K  secretion, recent findings have identified the presence of an enteric K  sensing mechanism that can initiate the renal secretory process upon K  entry into the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the distal convoluted tubule has been identified as a K  sensor capable of initiating K  exertion independent of mineralocorticoid activity.\n\n【9】*   ▪\n\n【10】    Increased dietary K  intake has been linked to various health benefits including decreased blood pressure, reduced risk of stroke, improved bone health, and a reduction in the risk of renal stone disease. At the same time, drugs used to treat hypertension result in increased K  concentrations, requiring dietary restriction of K  \\-enriched foods.\n\n【11】*   ▪\n\n【12】    A plant-based (K  \\-enriched) diet offers benefits that include reduced phosphorus absorption and improvement in metabolic acidosis. A limitation of such a diet can be the development of hyperkalemia in patients with impaired renal K  excretion.\n\n【13】*   ▪\n\n【14】    New drugs designed to bind K  in the gastrointestinal tract are now available. These drugs have been shown to be effective in maintaining normokalemia in the setting of ongoing use of blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in patients previously intolerant of these drugs due to hyperkalemia. These drugs _may_ allow patients to liberalize their diets so as to receive the benefits of a K  \\-enriched diet without development of hyperkalemia.\n\n【15】Potassium is an extremely important mineral, as supported by the recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Food and Drug Administration designation that K  is a “nutrient of public health concern” because of its general underconsumption across the US population.\n\n【16】无关删除-2:<u>*   DeSalvo K.B.\n*   Olson R.\n*   Casavale K.O.</u>\n\n【17】Dietary Guidelines for Americans \\[published online ahead of print January 07, 2016\\].\n\n【18】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 2016; 315 : 457-458</u></u>\n\n【19】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (237)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【20】Underconsumption of K  is associated with hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, 2 common adverse diet-related health outcomes in the United States.\n\n【21】无关删除-2:<u>*   DeSalvo K.B.\n*   Olson R.\n*   Casavale K.O.</u>\n\n【22】Dietary Guidelines for Americans \\[published online ahead of print January 07, 2016\\].\n\n【23】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_JAMA._ 2016; 315 : 457-458</u></u>\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (237)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【25】In 2004, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine\n\n【26】Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine.

Reabsorption in the proximal tubule is primarily through the paracellular pathway and is in rough proportion to Na  and water. The apical membrane Na  \\-K  \\-2Cl  cotransporter mediates transcellular K  transport in the thick ascending limb of Henle. In the early distal convoluted tubule (DCT), K  secretion begins and progressively increases in magnitude into the cortical collecting duct. As recently reviewed, the secretory component of K  handling is that which varies and is regulated according to physiological needs.\n\n【63】无关删除-2:<u>*   Palmer B.F.</u>\n\n【64】Regulation of potassium homeostasis.\n\n【65】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin J Am Soc Nephrol._ 2015; 10 : 1050-1060</u></u>\n\n【66】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (283)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【67】The major K  secretory mechanism in the distal nephron is electrogenic secretion through the ROMK (renal outer medullary _K_  ) channel. A second channel (maxi-K  or BK channel) also mediates K  secretion under conditions of increased flow. In addition to stimulating maxi-K  channels, tubular flow augments electrogenic K  secretion by diluting luminal K  concentration and stimulating Na  reabsorption through the epithelial Na  channel (ENaC). In part, this stimulatory effect can be traced to a mechanosensitive property by which shear stress increases the open probability of the ENaC.\n\n【68】无关删除-2:<u>*   Morimoto T.\n*   Liu W.\n*   Woda C.\n\n【69】Mechanism underlying flow stimulation of sodium absorption in the mammalian collecting duct.\n\n【70】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Am J Physiol Renal Physiol._ 2006; 291 : F663-F669</u></u>\n\n【71】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (97)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【72】The biomechanical characteristics of Na  and K  transport in the distal nephron are ideally suited to buffer any increase in extracellular K  concentration following a K  \\-rich diet.

Changes in transport in the early DCT control the delivery of NaCl to the downstream connecting tubule and collecting duct in which the ENaC mediates electrogenic Na  reabsorption and in which K  is secreted. In this regard, cells of the early DCT play a substantial, albeit indirect, role in K  secretion.\n\n【122】Figure 1 Older studies suggest that high dietary K  intake inhibits Na  reabsorption in the proximal nephron and thick ascending limb of Henle, causing increased flow and delivery of Na  to the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron, resulting in increased K  excretion. More recent studies suggest that this process is more regionalized to the distal nephron and implicates the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) as a renal K  sensor. The proximal portion of the DCT (DCT1) reabsorbs NaCl in an electroneutral fashion via the Na  \\-Cl  cotransporter (NCC). High dietary intake achieved through changes in plasma K  concentration leads to an inhibitory effect on NCC activity. As a result, Na  delivery and flow are increased to the aldosterone-sensitive K  secretory segments located in the later portions of the DCT (DCT2) and collecting duct (CD). Increased plasma K  concentration stimulates aldosterone release from the adrenal gland, which, in turn, facilitates electrogenic K  secretion through the renal outer medullary K  (ROMK) channel. Both increased flow and aldosterone stimulate K  secretion through the maxi-K channel. Increased K  secretion may begin upon K  entry into the gastrointestinal tract before any change in plasma K  concentration through an enteric sensing mechanism, which leads to an inhibitory effect on NCC activity.

Thus, increased activity of long WNK1 leads to a net increase in NaCl reabsorption. Dietary K  loading increases the abundance of KS-WNK1, which has the effect to block the inhibitory effect of long WNK1 on WNK4. The net effect is inhibition of Na  \\-Cl  cotransport in the DCT and increased Na  delivery to more distal portions of the tubule. The increase in KS-WNK1 in response to high K  intake also antagonizes the effect of long WNK1 to stimulate endocytosis of ROMK. In addition, KS-WNK1 exerts a stimulatory effect on the ENaC. In total, increases in KS-WNK1 in response to dietary K  loading facilitates K  secretion through the combined effects of increased Na  delivery through the down-regulation of Na  \\-Cl  cotransport in the early DCT, increased electrogenic Na  reabsorption via the ENaC, and greater abundance of ROMK. These effects can occur independently of any change in mineralocorticoid activity, suggesting an intrinsic sensing capability of this segment to changes in dietary K  .\n\n【152】无关删除-2:<u>*   Ellison D.H.\n*   Terker A.S.</u>\n\n【153】Why your mother was right: how potassium intake reduces blood pressure.\n\n【154】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Trans Am Clin Climatol Assoc._ 2015; 126 : 46-55</u></u>\n\n【155】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【156】Recent studies\n\n【157】无关删除-2:<u>*   Terker A.S.\n*   Zhang C.\n*   Erspamer K.\n*   Gamba G.\n*   Yang C.L.\n*   Ellison D.H.</u>\n\n【158】Unique chloride-sensing properties of WNK4 permit the distal nephron to modulate potassium homeostasis.\n\n【159】删除3:<u>_Kidney Int._ 2015; ( doi:10.1038/ki.2015.289. )</u>\n\n【160】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【161】无关删除-2:<u>*   Terker A.S.\n*   Zhang C.\n*   McCormick J.A.\n\n【162】Potassium modulates electrolyte balance and blood pressure through effects on distal cell voltage and chloride.\n\n【163】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Cell Metab._ 2015; 21 : 39-50</u></u>\n\n【164】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (311)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【165】suggest that extracellular K  modulates the WNK axis by altering membrane voltage and changing intracellular chloride concentration.

This response can be viewed as physiological because long WNK1 increases retrieval of ROMK and therefore limits secretion under conditions of low K  intake.

Decreased dietary K  achieved through a decrease in plasma K  concentration hyperpolarizes cells in the proximal portion of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT1), leading to decreased intracellular Cl  concentration, which, in turn, activates WNK lysine-deficient protein kinase 4 (WNK4). K  deficiency is associated with increases in the ratio of long WNK lysine-deficient protein kinase 1 (WNK1) to kidney specific (KS)-WNK1. An increase in this ratio (L-WNK1/KS-WNK1) leads to an increased retrieval of renal outer medullary K  (ROMK) from the apical membrane, thereby minimizing K  secretion, which would be an appropriate response to the K  \\-deficient diet. Increased L-WNK1/KS-WNK1 also alters WNK4 activity such that activity of the thiazide-sensitive Na  \\-Cl  cotransporter (NCC) is increased. In addition, increased L-WNK1 leads to an increased activity of the epithelial Na  channel (ENaC).

The modern Western diet tends to be relatively low in sources of alkali (fruits and vegetables) and high in sources of acid (fish, meats, and cheeses). When the quantity of bicarbonate ions is insufficient to maintain normal pH, the body mobilizes alkaline calcium salts from the bone to neutralize the acids consumed in the diet and generated by metabolism. Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables reduces the net acid content of the diet and may preserve calcium in bones, which might otherwise be mobilized to maintain normal pH. In addition to providing a more alkaline diet, the larger amount of K  in fruits and vegetables may exert an anion-independent effect on bone metabolism.

This toxicity creates a therapeutic dilemma because a diet rich in fruits and vegetables may offer benefits that are unique to patients with CKD. These benefits are discussed below.\n\n【374】### Phosphorus Control\n\n【375】Two important aspects of nutritional management in patients with CKD are maintenance of adequate protein intake and prevention of phosphate overload and hyperphosphatemia. This can be problematic because organic phosphorus is bound to protein and the amount of protein eaten will predictably determine phosphorus intake. Organic phosphorus from plant protein has a lower absorption rate than does phosphorus from animal protein, ranging from 40% to 50%, because phosphorus from plants is in the form of phytates and mammals lack phytases. Phosphorus in animal protein is in the form of organic phosphate, which is readily hydrolyzed and absorbed.\n\n【376】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kalantar-Zadeh K.\n*   Gutekunst L.\n*   Mehrotra R.\n\n【377】Understanding sources of dietary phosphorus in the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease.\n\n【378】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Clin J Am Soc Nephrol._ 2010; 5 : 519-530</u></u>\n\n【379】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (354)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【380】In a model of progressive CKD, rats were fed either a casein-based or a grain-based protein diet, both of which had equivalent total phosphorus content.

Serum bicarbonate levels increased with the dietary intervention, although less than in the bicarbonate group, whose alkali dose would be expected to almost completely neutralize the dietary acid load. The aforementioned markers of kidney injury declined similarly in the 2 groups. These findings suggest that the alkali load afforded by a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can slow the progression of CKD through correction of metabolic acidosis. In addition to avoiding the salt load and potential volume overload that can complicate NaHCO <sub>3 </sub> therapy, the diet is associated with reduction in blood pressure, possibly related to increased K  intake.

Moreover, long-term administration is linked to serious adverse effects such as rare cases of intestinal necrosis, resulting in a blackbox warning by the Food and Drug Administration. Recently, there are new oral compounds—patiromer (Veltassa) and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate—that are K  \\-binding drugs shown to be effective in preventing development of hyperkalemia. Patiromer is approved for clinical use, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is pending approval. Both agents exhibit good tolerability and are not associated with serious adverse effects. Recently, clinical trials found that these compounds lower the risk of incident hyperkalemia associated with RAAS blockade in people with diabetes, those with heart failure, and/or those who have CKD. Patiromer is a nonabsorbed polymer that binds K  in the gastrointestinal tract, predominately in the colon.

Importantly, participants in this trial had normal baseline renal function. There are no long-term studies examining the benefits of a K  \\-enriched diet in patients with CKD because of the concern for development of life-threatening hyperkalemia. In addition to the potential benefits of better phosphate control and amelioration of metabolic acidosis discussed previously, one speculation arises whether liberalization of dietary K  in patients with CKD may provide long-term cardiovascular benefits. Management of patients with CKD typically involves some degree of K  restriction, which is further reinforced as patients transition to end-stage renal disease and ultimately dialysis. With the advent of novel K  \\-binding agents, it is interesting to speculate whether clinical trials focusing on liberalization of the diet to include sources of K  might provide cardiovascular benefits in this patient population. Although not specifically tested as an approach to prevent diet-induced hyperkalemia, these new compounds are well tolerated and could be used to study whether patients with CKD would benefit from liberalization of dietary K  , potentially contributing to a better quality of life.\n\n【465】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【466】There are abundant data suggesting that ingestion of K  \\-rich foods is beneficial and may reduce the incidence of stroke, hypertension, nephrolithiasis, and osteoporosis. The data on dietary consumption indicate that Western diets are high in processed foods, high in Na  content, and low in K  . The kidney is designed to handle significantly higher K  loads than are currently consumed in our diet. Furthermore, patients who could most benefit from increasing their intake of K  \\-rich foods are the very same patients who are unable to do so because of reductions in renal function. Specifically, cardiovascular disease is prevalent in patients with reduced renal function, and therefore one would argue that this patient population would benefit the most from ingesting diets enriched in K  . Currently, the standard treatment for hypertension in these patients is the use of RAAS blockers, pharmacology that results in hyperkalemia, necessitating the use of a low-K  diet. There are 2 new therapeutic options to chronically treat hyperkalemia, affording the speculation that these drugs may allow for liberalization of dietary K  so as to maximize cardiovascular benefits.\n\n【467】It is important to rethink the role of K  in the diet, especially when it is recognized that Western diets result in overconsumption of Na  and underconsumption of K  , leading to increased disease prevalence. People are actively seeking dietary changes and are embracing diets such as the Paleolithic diet that tout their benefits of reduced consumption of processed foods (and thereby Na  ) and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables (and thereby K  ). We conclude by restating that K  , an often underappreciated cation/mineral, may be directly related to health benefits.\n\n【468】无关删除-1:<u>Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------</u>\n\n【469】无关删除-1:<u>*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIwZjdlZmMwNjQxYjUwZjQ5Y2M1MWM3Y2QzMjlkNzQ1ZCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDIyNzc0fQ.sDStbsibI2Nv5i80b20Atf-1zFzs3D3WlE4afoKUAxqwWxxuSKEComLLltuRR0Xnn0s-zDiO60W2LVEzy8YyBJRzQ\\_6tIHTXpjZD2evAopGBm1fC7qlDZoPlpLfhoU0IQJwPbLttCjcjbXTdCDC9XZBBI4a13CuzRAOG-KkyLETWuKUqZvF33NTbnULyqTn1cOFJklh79mtyLSKdezOpuiiw2fgkCeXQIcEly9\\_Pv9O2nGUDejuQxUBvOjlKhNCl-k6ruqYL4gbecTxPQ62P1fLkDbSo9GYA7\\_Igv0uXdO\\_sLQsX6kDGkqdjqH7Rh3vkL9DTB-dm3XvbgfXsbEPHcQ\n\n【470】    Download .mp4 (354.28 MB)\n\n【471】    Help with .mp4 files\n\n【472】    Video 1</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

However, stepped care is often adjusted without regard to the mechanism of hyperglycemia or without long-term objectives. A more comprehensive definition of treatment success in patients with type 2 DM should include slowing or stopping disease progression and optimizing the reduction of all risk factors associated with microvascular and macrovascular disease complications. To achieve these broader goals, it is important to diagnose diabetes earlier in the disease course and to consider use of more aggressive combination therapy much earlier with agents that have the potential to slow or halt the progressive β-cell dysfunction and loss characteristic of type 2 DM. A new paradigm for managing patients with type 2 DM should address the concomitant risk factors and morbidities of obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia with equal or occasionally even greater aggressiveness than for hyperglycemia. The use of antidiabetes agents that may favorably address cardiovascular risk factors should be considered more strongly in treatment algorithms, although no pharmacological therapy is likely to be ultimately successful without concomitant synergistic lifestyle changes. Newer incretin-based therapies, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, which appear to have a favorable cardiovascular safety profile as well as the mechanistic possibility for a favorable cardiovascular risk impact, are suitable for earlier inclusion as part of combination regimens aimed at achieving comprehensive treatment success in patients with type 2 DM.\n\n【1】ACCORD ( Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ), ACT NOW ( ACTos NOW for the Prevention of Diabetes ), ADVANCE ( Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release and Controlled Evaluation ), BP ( blood pressure ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), DM ( diabetes mellitus ), DPP-4 ( dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ), DREAM ( Diabetes REduction Assessment with ramipril and rosiglitazone Medication ), GLP-1 ( glucagon-like peptide 1 ), HbA1c ( hemoglobin A1c ), IGT ( impaired glucose tolerance ), KORA ( Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), MONICA ( MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease ), NHANES ( National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ), PIPOD ( Pioglitazone In Prevention Of Diabetes ), PROactive 10 ( PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial in macro Vascular Events ), TRIPOD ( TRoglitazone In Prevention Of Diabetes ), UKPDS ( United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ), VADT ( Veterans Administration Diabetes Trial )\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Flow cytometric immunophenotyping histogram analysis was more informative than tabulated percentage antigen positivity; surface immunoglobulin and CD20 staining intensity, CD5 and CD23 positivity, CD10 positivity, and the coexpression of CD11c/CD22 and CD103 were the most pertinent markers. Using these FCIP parameters and strict immunophenotypic definitions for CLL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and hairy cell leukemia, we obtained greater than 95% specificity for each diagnosis. However, we encountered the following exceptions to standard paradigms of B-cell lymphoma-associated FCIP: (1) CD5 expression by disorders distinct from CLL and MCL, (2) lack of uniform CD5 positivity in some CLL and MCL cases, (3) absence of CD10 in approximately 50% of follicular lymphomas, and (4) expression of CD103 by occasional marginal zone lymphomas.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Stringent interpretation of PB and bone marrow FCIP results enables identification of certain B-cell lymphoma types. However, the observed exceptions to accepted immunophenotypic paradigms highlight the occasional phenotypic overlap among diseases and emphasize that a systematic approach to FCIP interpretations is key to providing clinically useful diagnostic information.\n\n【8】APC ( allophycocyanin ), BCLPD ( B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorder ), BL ( Burkitt lymphoma ), CLL ( chronic lymphocytic leukemia ), DLBCL ( diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ), ENMZL ( extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma ), FCIP ( flow cytometric immunophenotyping ), FISH ( fluorescent in situ hybridization ), FITC ( fluorescein isothiocyanate ), FL ( follicular lymphoma ), HCL ( hairy cell leukemia ), LPL ( lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma ), MCL ( mantle cell lymphoma ), PB ( peripheral blood ), PE ( phycoerythrin ), sIg ( surface immunoglobulin ), SLL ( small lymphocytic lymphoma ), SMZL ( splenic marginal zone lymphoma ), TRAP ( tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ), WHO ( World Health Organization )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

All patients underwent full evaluation in the autonomic laboratory, from which a CASS of autonomic deficits was derived. Patients also completed the 5-item self-report Orthostatic Grading Scale, which inquires about symptoms of orthostatic intolerance due to orthostatic hypotension (eg, severity, frequency, and interference with daily activities).\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of 145 patients, 97 (67%) had orthostatic hypotension. The 5-item scale demonstrated strong internal consistency (coefficient a=.91). Patients with orthostatic hypotension had significantly higher scores on each questionnaire item and CASS subscores than those without orthostatic hypotension. The scale items correlated significantly with each of the CASS subscores, maximally with the CASS adrenergic subscore.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】Orthostatic hypotension is not the only cause of reduced orthostatic tolerance, and some patients may have orthostatic hypotension but be asymptomatic. Results of this study indicate that this 5-item questionnaire is a reliable and valid measure of the severity of symptoms of orthostatic hypotension and that it can supplement laboratory-based measures to provide a rapid, more complete clinical assessment. This questionnaire would also be useful as a brief screening device for orthostatic intolerance to aid physicians in identifying patients who may have orthostatic hypotension.\n\n【8】ARS ( Autonomic Reflex Screen ), BP ( blood pressure ), CASS ( composite autonomic severity score ), OGS ( Orthostatic Grading Scale )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

The incidence rate (age and sex adjusted to the 2000 US white population) was 4.5 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 3.5-5.4). The incidence of LCV increased significantly with age at diagnosis ( _P_ <.001) and did not differ between female and male patients. Subtypes of LCV were cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis (CSVV), 38 patients (45%); IgA vasculitis, 25 (30%); urticarial vasculitis, 10 (12%); cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, 3 (4%); and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis, 8 (10%). LCV was idiopathic in 29 of 38 patients with CSVV (76%) and 24 of 25 patients with IgA vasculitis (96%). Thirty-nine of 84 patients (46%) had systemic involvement, with the renal system most commonly involved (17 of 39 \\[44%\\]). Twenty-four of 80 patients (30%) with follow-up data available had recurrent disease. Compared with the Minnesota white population, observed survival in the incident LCV cohort was significantly poorer than expected ( _P_ <.001), including the subset of patients with idiopathic CSVV ( _P_ \\=.03).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The incidence of LCV was higher than that reported in previously published studies. Idiopathic LCV was more common in our population-based cohort than that described previously. Overall survival was significantly poorer ( _P_ <.001) and should be explored further in future studies.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACTD ( autoimmune connective tissue disease ), ANCA ( antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ), CSVV ( cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis ), DIF ( direct immunofluorescence ), HSP ( Henoch-Schönlein purpura ), LCV ( leukocytoclastic vasculitis ), REP ( Rochester Epidemiology Project ), UV ( urticarial vasculitis )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Panto-250\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Vitamins are compounds that you must have for growth and health. They are needed in only small amounts and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Pantothenic acid (vitamin B 5) is needed for the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.\n\n【6】No problems have been found that are due to a lack of pantothenic acid alone. However, a lack of one B vitamin usually goes along with a lack of others, so pantothenic acid is often included in B complex products.\n\n【7】Claims that pantothenic acid is effective for treatment of nerve damage, breathing problems, itching and other skin problems, and poisoning with some other drugs; for getting rid of or preventing gray hair; for preventing arthritis, allergies, and birth defects; or for improving mental ability have not been proven.\n\n【8】This vitamin is available without a prescription.\n\n【9】### Importance of Diet\n\n【10】For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.\n\n【11】Pantothenic acid is found in various foods including peas and beans (except green beans), lean meat, poultry, fish, and whole-grain cereals. Little pantothenic acid is lost from foods with ordinary cooking.\n\n【12】Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food—protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat.\n\n【13】The daily amount of pantothenic acid needed is defined in several different ways.\n\n【14】#### For U.S.—\n\n【15】*   Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g. pregnancy).\n*   Daily Values (DVs) for nutrients are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DVs replace the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).\n\n【16】#### For Canada—\n\n【17】*   Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.\n\n【18】Because lack of pantothenic acid is so rare, there is no RDA or RNI for this vitamin. The following daily intakes are thought to be plenty for most individuals:\n\n【19】*   Infants and children—\n    *   Birth to 3 years of age: 2 to 3 milligrams (mg).\n    *   4 to 6 years of age: 3 to 4 mg.\n    *   7 to 10 years of age: 4 to 5 mg.\n*   Adolescents and adults—4 to 7 mg.\n\n【20】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【21】*   Tablet\n*   Capsule\n\n【22】Before Using\n------------\n\n【23】If you are taking this dietary supplement without a prescription, carefully read and follow any precautions on the label. For this supplement, the following should be considered:\n\n【24】### Allergies\n\n【25】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

These results are presented and discussed in our article.\n\n【33】Kyle and Stanford concluded that “the flaw in this article reflects a widely held and false bias that obesity is exclusively the result of lifestyle behaviors.” We disagree with their interpretation.

The obligation, or opportunity, to write such a closing piece became apparent in the early days of my EIC tenure, through meeting and joining in fellowship with other EICs who led significant journals and approached their jobs with dedication and dignity. Two elements impressed me about these editors: (1) they had an immense knowledge of their journals' history and values and (2) they all would write closing editorials when their terms had ended.\n\n【4】I initially thought that these closing editorials were primarily a tool for the EICs to say thank you to those with whom they had interacted over the years and secondarily a method to publicly review their successes one last time. However, this interpretation changed in late 1999 when the _Proceedings_ publisher suggested that I write an annual January editorial to explain the Journal's current status and mission for the upcoming year. I initially resisted, in part because I had published an introductory tone-setting editorial the previous January,\n\n【5】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【6】Leading _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ into the future.\n\n【7】删除3:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 1999; 74 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 104</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (5)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【9】and I feared that the time spent on writing an introspective editorial each year would be a distraction from the more meaningful ambition of enriching the lives of those served by the Journal—ie, the authors, readers, and ultimately patients.\n\n【10】Nevertheless, for the entirety of my 18 years, I indeed wrote January editorials and soon developed a great respect for their potential utility. (My 2000 editorial was entitled “The Evolution of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ ,”\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【12】The evolution of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ .\n\n【13】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2000; 75 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 8-9</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (12)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【15】and it set the course and tone of Journal actions for almost 2 decades.) I soon learned that the annual editorials were an opportunity to detail for readers how the Journal planned to make meaningful progress each upcoming year, and they would force Journal leadership to continually envision innovations to incrementally improve Journal operations and content. As so formulated, the January editorials also provided an accounting for the promises made 12 months previously. In brief, annually sharing aspirations for Journal improvements with others carried benefits that I never previously anticipated.\n\n【16】Throughout my term as EIC, my teammates (on the editorial board, staff, and elsewhere) and I have conducted _Proceedings_ operations as if the Journal were a _learning laboratory_ , and we have freely shared our challenges, successes, and failures with students who wished to learn along with us. It is in this spirit that I share with you a previously untold aspect of Journal life: the values and philosophy we used to bring about change. This is not a story of publicly shared metrics, even though we teammates knew we would be held accountable for our actions, and we knew how the accounting would be formulated: _There is only one proof of ability - results.

Accessed May 3, 2017.</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【19】I have always assumed that this quote applies equally to men and women, including those who serve as journal leaders.\n\n【20】Many have remarked that the most far-reaching changes at the _Proceedings_ during the period of 1999 to the present reflected a fundamental change in Journal culture. To address this interest, in my final communication as outgoing EIC, I will describe the philosophy behind those cultural changes and many specific actions taken.\n\n【21】### The Values and Motivations That Guided Our Mission\n\n【22】#### Priming the Pump\n\n【23】We sincerely wanted progressive change at the _Proceedings_ , but we needed some tangible asset to _prime the pump of success_ , and we needed to make sure that this asset was immediately visible to all with whom we interacted. We began by fine-tuning staff and editorial board interactions with authors and readers. Efforts were made to redouble, then redouble again, improvements in communications, response times, and many other factors that demonstrated to those we served, “We respect you, and we honor our relationship with you.”\n\n【24】Restated, we attempted to practice servant leadership, in which our sole raison d'être was to serve as a conduit between those authors who contributed manuscripts, the readers who read the articles we published, and eventually the patients served by the new knowledge we disseminated.\n\n【25】#### Restructuring and Redirecting the Staff\n\n【26】During my tenure as EIC, the in-house staff of the _Proceedings_ ranged from 3 to 8 individuals. The larger number coincided with a period during which the Journal was largely self-published: ie, the staff oversaw peer-review logistics, copyediting, layout, and transmission of print-ready articles to the printer. (The publishing company of record during these periods handled circulation, market research, advertising sales, and related matters.) The smaller numbers represent the current era in which the Journal is represented by a full-service publisher, and activities of the local staff members are augmented and complemented by a “virtual office staff” of many more.\n\n【27】One would assume that the larger staff size would provide more opportunity for brainstorming and planning innovations for the Journal's future, but this was not the case. Instead, we discovered, quite by accident, that the larger staff size correlated with a period in which single members or pairs of members of the staff were engaged in highly specialized activities—eg, copyediting, layout—that encouraged, if not demanded, the formation of activity silos within overall staff operations. It was only later—after engaging a full-service medical publisher and outsourcing much of the silo-affiliated activities previously addressed within the office—that we began to more fully engage the staff (functioning as a unit) in creative and operational planning for the future. This shift in staff functions and philosophy also was tremendously influenced by (1) the introduction of electronic manuscript processing and (2) the continuous feeding of accepted manuscripts to our publisher (who, in turn, handled final article preparation and continuous feeding of content to the electronic version of the Journal).\n\n【28】Yes, this new approach to staff functionality still demanded that every single important duty within the Journal must have a chief advocate; however, with time, the increased transparency of the new approach allowed others to help critique and contribute creativity and labor more broadly to all Journal operations.\n\n【29】Staff members were encouraged, and even expected, to represent the Journal outside the confines of the Journal offices, by serving on task forces and committees, interacting with think tanks of creative people, and attending and presenting at local and national meetings. As such, our staff members developed new, previously untapped, relationships with others—ie, authors, reviewers, editorial board members, and many more—who gained a better appreciation for the Journal's mission and brand than they might have otherwise.\n\n【30】#### A Welcoming Working Environment\n\n【31】With the support of Mayo Clinic, we collaborated with workplace designers to create a newsroom environment, and the person serving as primary contact to the outside world (serving as a receptionist in addition to other duties) was positioned in the center of the office, in direct line-of-sight of the entrance doorway. Surrounding this open central space were individual offices, such that a quick verbal request to the staff members could get input from all within seconds. Later, we added a library/conference room with the appropriate electronic gadgets needed to facilitate both local and worldwide teleconferencing. Across the interior hallway, we added a studio for taping podcasts and related video communications.\n\n【32】Since completion of the new office design, we have had a steady flow of authors, reviewers, staff members, board members, business consultants, creative consultants, and many more who have been invited into our space to discuss plans for manuscripts, collections of manuscripts, creative design, budgets, and so much more. Many of these gatherings (including weekly 9 AM Tuesday morning, “no-agenda” creative sessions involving the EIC, staff, some associate editors, and others) are scheduled well in advance, while many other short-notice or impromptu meetings are equally welcomed.\n\n【33】Throughout, we desire to make our workspace a welcoming environment where creative people can gather to share ideas, critique each other, and enhance the quality of the product the Journal produces.\n\n【34】#### The Editorial Board\n\n【35】For most of its life, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ had functioned as a multispecialty journal. During the mid-1990s—and through mutual agreement of the editorial board and publisher—the Journal was redirected toward a general/internal medicine theme; however, the transition was not yet complete by January 1999.\n\n【36】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【37】Celebrating _Mayo Clinic Proceedings'_ 90th anniversary: a story of longevity and progression of mission.\n\n【38】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2016; 91 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 3-9</u></u>\n\n【39】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (7)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【40】In order to recruit and retain an editorial board that was optimally supportive of this redirected mission, we introduced needs-assessment methodologies that began by envisioning the future of the Journal. We then worked backward to fill the editorial board with members who could best make that future possible.\n\n【41】We also added an appropriate mission statement and vision statement to codify our goals and aspirations. The mission statement would read: “ _To promote the best interests of patients by advancing the knowledge and professionalism of the physician community_ .” The vision statement (intended to be used internally to focus the energies and values of our team members) is: “ _Mayo Clinic Proceedings will be the most influential journal in clinical medicine, with editorial content respected for its integrity and its relevance to progressive healthcare_ .”\n\n【42】Individual editorial board members were chosen to help manage peer review and manuscript recruitment in a given area of operations and to embrace and promote the values within the mission and vision statements. Many board members had considerable expertise in more than one area and, as such, could serve the board in diverse ways. We wanted to recruit board members who were stellar in their individual accomplishments and were recognized for their creativity, energy, collegiality, and ability to work well in teams. In my 18 years as EIC, we never appointed a member to the editorial board solely on the basis of his or her name recognition. Instead, board members were valued to the extent that they contributed to the well-being of the Journal.\n\n【43】We quickly learned that the happiest board members were those who were most engaged in journal activities. As such, we tried to assign a challenging but fair amount of responsibilities to those who wished to engage, and we asked them to contribute predominantly in those domains in which they had the greatest expertise. As workloads increased, or journal growth areas became more diverse, we added additional board members to address the workloads.\n\n【44】Of note, we never demanded or contracted with members regarding submission of their own manuscripts, simply because the best board-member candidates often had areas of research that were not ideally suited to the needs of our readers. Such board members had many other ways they could contribute to the Journal, however.\n\n【45】Board member terms were nominally 3 years, but almost no one served for exactly 3 years, and members were informed of this likelihood at the time of their recruitment. The greatest contributors often lasted much longer, but some had abbreviated terms. I had initially envisioned that we would lose many board members well before their 3-year anniversary, and I informed the board accordingly. My reasoning was that in order to get the best board members and compete against others who were desirous of their contributions, it would be important to “discover” the great talents only “moments” before the rest of the world was fully aware of their promise. As such, we fully expected that—as a result of their own professional momentum, added opportunities provided by the _Proceedings_ , or the visibility of _Proceedings_ board membership—many of our appointees would be pulled away from us because of other professional opportunities. Indeed, over the many years, we lost many board members to impressive leadership, investigational, and other activities. On their departures, we always tried to instill in them our pride in their advancement and a sense that they remained, in our hearts if not literally, members of the _Proceedings_ leadership family.\n\n【46】As we focused the Journal on a general/internal medicine mission, there was vigorous discussion at the level of the editorial board as to whether it was wiser to teach superspecialist board members to think like generalists or generalist board members to think like superspecialists. We chose the former but were forever mindful that this approach did not give us permission to focus on a narrow audience (at the expense of our general medical audience).

The other 5 meetings involved meetings of local board members in Rochester, with nonlocal members participating through teleconferencing. During off months, the board's executive committee would meet 6 times per year, with executive committee membership consisting of the EIC, associate editors, staff, business manager, and consultants.\n\n【54】In each of the 12 meetings, the agenda was divided among 3 areas of discussion: (1) reports on actions taken, or progress made, since the last meeting, (2) new Journal initiatives, and (3) novel ideas for growth. The goal was broad input from multiple attendees, as well as the hearing of petitions from outside individuals or groups. The spirited discussions contributed to the sense of teamwork and helped reinforce a common standard for peer review adjudications.\n\n【55】#### Relationship With Authors\n\n【56】We tried our best to develop relationships with authors based on trust and open communications. This effort involved multiple forms of communication—through editorials, face-to-face conversations, phone calls, e-mail messages, presentations to groups, and other means—to inform authors of Journal rules and standards and the fact that all authors (regardless of their beliefs, geography, or institutional affiliation) are treated according to a common standard. These methods provided considerable utility over the 18 years, during which manuscript submissions—once originating primarily from authors affiliated with Mayo Clinic in Rochester—expanded to involve authors from more than 60 nations.\n\n【57】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【58】Celebrating _Mayo Clinic Proceedings'_ 90th anniversary: a story of longevity and progression of mission.\n\n【59】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2016; 91 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 3-9</u></u>\n\n【60】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (7)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【61】One challenge we faced when implementing this aforementioned approach was that the acceptance of individual manuscripts at the _Proceedings_ became progressively more competitive and selective. As such, we challenged authors to progressively increase the quality of their submissions if they desired to be published in our Journal. Many accepted this challenge, to the betterment of their contributions. Perhaps no groups had more impressive success over the years than academic general internal medicine physicians and researchers in education and professionalism. In these instances, it was possible to see meaningful year-to-year improvements in the quality of their scholarship, and their manuscript acceptance rates actually increased as the requirements of the Journal became more demanding. The Journal and its readers were the ultimate beneficiaries.\n\n【62】Yes, we had occasional experiences involving errors in published articles, as well as author misconduct during peer review, and we added discreet mechanisms by which any of these irregularities could be identified and addressed. Errors in Journal content were corrected promptly and without emotion. Fortunately, whether as a result of diligence or luck, we did not have a single article that needed retraction during these 18 years.\n\n【63】#### Changing the Economy of Manuscript Submission and Acceptance\n\n【64】The transition of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ ' focus to general medicine had implications for the Journal's relationship to Mayo Clinic authors. In aggregate, Mayo Clinic authors from Rochester, Jacksonville, Florida, and Phoenix, Arizona, represent the world's third largest contributor to the indexed biomedical literature (written communication, Dr Joseph G. Murphy, Director of the Mayo Clinic Section of Scientific Publications, April 5, 2017), and they have always been—and continue to be—the largest source of articles published in the _Proceedings_ . However, the migration of the _Proceedings_ in a general-medicine direction dictated that many Mayo Clinic–affiliated manuscripts that were once well targeted to publication in the _Proceedings_ would be less competitive under the new Journal focus. The change also meant that Mayo Clinic authors whose publication themes were now consonant with the new interests of the _Proceedings_ would become increasingly competitive at the Journal. The latter included subspecialist and superspecialist authors whose manuscript themes and writing style were targeted to a diverse readership.\n\n【65】With the long-term goal of serving an increasingly global audience and a desire to sample from advances in medicine globally, we introduced an open-market economy whereby manuscripts were recruited from throughout the United States and around the world, and manuscript acceptance was based primarily on priority.\n\n【66】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【67】Celebrating _Mayo Clinic Proceedings'_ 90th anniversary: a story of longevity and progression of mission.\n\n【68】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2016; 91 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 3-9</u></u>\n\n【69】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (7)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【70】Restated, those manuscripts that most closely helped the Journal achieve its stated mission were given priority for publication, regardless of authors' geography or institutional affiliation.\n\n【71】To augment the supply of articles that came from spontaneous submission by authors, the Journal also reorganized and operationalized its manuscript recruitment efforts. Specifically, we introduced a _recruitment grid_ whereby review articles representing the interests and needs of our readership would be recruited on a rotating cycle (eg, every 3-5 years). In addition, we daily sampled the world's scientific and nonscientific media to identify novel and relevant topics in clinical practice, research, humanities, and other areas that might be of interest to our readers.\n\n【72】These collective approaches, and the continuous stream of high-quality manuscripts they accumulated for subsequent peer-review evaluation, allowed us to have far greater issue-to-issue consistency in the quality and novelty of information we passed along to readers.\n\n【73】#### Constantly Updating Our Methods of Communications\n\n【74】It has become a truism at the _Proceedings_ that every single day is viewed as an opportunity to change and improve our methodologies for processing information and communicating with authors and readers. This was the philosophy behind ongoing improvements in our electronic processing of manuscripts, social media platforms, website, and print journal. The philosophy also was influential in our decision to create a new journal, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Innovations, Quality & Outcomes_ (MCP:IQO).\n\n【75】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.\n*   Gerber T.C.</u>\n\n【76】Expanding the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ mission: introducing _Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Innovations, Quality & Outcomes (MCP: IQO)_ .\n\n【77】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2017; 92 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 7-10</u></u>\n\n【78】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【79】We recognized that the world in which we live and work is constantly changing and the expectations of those we serve are constantly evolving, and we wanted to meet those expectations.

Let me close my story by sharing with you some of those earliest promises. Some of the most important promises I made vis-à-vis my time as EIC were made when interviewing in the fall of 1998 with a selection committee that would eventually choose me to lead the _Proceedings_ .\n\n【86】I closed my interview with the selection committee by telling them this: “I am going to share with you words that have never been spoken on the Mayo Clinic campus before: ‘If you select me as editor-in-chief of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , I will assume the role during the most productive, influential years of my professional life, and I will make this the No. 1 priority in my professional life, for as long as I hold the position’.” It is difficult to recreate my thought processes, but it is amusing that I was 43 years old at the time, had been on the Mayo Clinic staff for slightly more than 14 years, and understood that any EIC appointment would be for 5 years. I often wonder (when attempting to reproduce that 1998 mind-set) how I would react to knowing that by the time I ended my employment with the _Proceedings,_ I would be 62 years old and would have spent more than half of my professional life as the Journal's editor. Certainly I could never have envisioned that I would love the work for so very long. Perhaps my comments, which many might have perceived as hubris at the time, should, in hindsight, be considered insufficiently optimistic.\n\n【87】I told the selection committee that my long-term goal for the _Proceedings_ was “that it will someday be impossible to think of the world's elite general medical journals and not include _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ on that list.” It is difficult to know how far along this arc the Journal has advanced during these 18 years, but it is possible to conclude—based on data within my editorial on the 90th anniversary of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【88】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lanier W.L.</u>\n\n【89】The evolution of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ .\n\n【90】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2000; 75 ( \\[editorial\\] ) : 8-9</u></u>\n\n【91】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (12)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【92】—that the progress has been considerable.\n\n【93】Finally, when asked what metric I would use to best define Journal progress, I told the selection committee this: “I desire that, at the end of my term as editor-in-chief, candidates far more impressive and influential than I will compete to be my replacement, perceiving that becoming the leader of the _Proceedings_ will be the greatest professional opportunity of their lifetime.” When it was time to pick my replacement, the 2016 iteration of the selection committee was as professional and discreet in its activities as the committee that selected me. As such, I only know bits and pieces of the selection process story, and they were told to me largely by the applicants. By piecing together the facts, I will forever have joy and comfort in knowing that the candidates who applied to be my replacement were indeed “far more impressive and influential” than I am, and certainly more than I was during the fall of 1998. I am so very thankful that they allowed themselves to be vetted by the selection committee (and they engaged in the type self-reflection that goes hand-in-hand with the process), not only to fulfill my dreams but also in an attempt to help the Journal achieve new heights. And I am fully convinced, through his own admission, that my successor considers his selection as the new EIC to be the greatest professional opportunity of his lifetime (oral communication, Dr Karl A. Nath, incoming EIC of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings,_ April 14, 2017).\n\n【94】I have until this point intentionally not mentioned the names of specific individuals, in some measure because the list of individuals who have meaningfully contributed to the ongoing success of the Journal is immense. However, I would like to comment on those who currently contribute so much, and so selflessly, to contemporary Journal operations. By extension, readers can infer that there was a generation of contributors before many of these individuals who contributed in their own unique ways.\n\n【95】The current staff of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ consists of managing editor Terry Jopke, editorial processing specialist Kimberly D. Sankey, and editorial assistant Margaret R. (Peg) Wentz. They function seamlessly as a team and provide the first wave of Journal contact with authors, peer reviewers, and many others. Collectively, they daily infuse an aura of collegiality and optimism into all Journal operations. The associate editors are, alphabetically, Drs Thomas J. Beckman, Lori A. Erickson, Thomas C. Gerber, Carl J. (Chip) Lavie, S. Vincent Rajkumar, and Ayalew Tefferi. Each is assigned specific portions of Journal operations to oversee and lead. Collectively, they form the backbone of the Journal's executive committee. They supply the insights and ethical standards to help fuel the Journal's conscience and the energy to propel us forward. There would be no contemporary _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , as we know and love it, without their daily input. Business manager Debbie Eagle serves as our liaison to Mayo Clinic and the publisher. She provides the guidance one would seek in a wise sibling, publicly helping Journal leadership to work more effectively with others and privately counseling us on methods by which we can improve. Bruce A. F. Polsky was retained in 2010 as a part-time consultant to help the Journal locate a new publisher, and he has continued with the team to help us better manage publishing operations and set (and monitor) long-term Journal planning. His long-term value to the _Proceedings_ came as a surprise and has proved indispensible. Pamela Poppalardo, our publisher, has worked tirelessly to understand the mission and culture of the _Proceedings_ and its sponsor, Mayo Clinic, and use that knowledge to help us better become the Journal that we want to be. The ever-expanding international footprint of Journal operations is just one example of her stewardship and that of her colleagues at Elsevier. When the diverse contributions of these individuals are viewed in aggregate, it is impossible to honor or compensate them sufficiently for their professional and personal input. This team has truly functioned as a family, working together to optimally address the Journal's mission and future.\n\n【96】I also want to acknowledge incoming EIC Dr Karl Nath, an impressively accomplished physician, scientist, and scholar and a person who has great integrity and communication skills. It is already amply clear that—consistent with my aforementioned statement to the search committee that selected me—he is “far more impressive” than I was when I assumed the editorship of the Journal. Further, it is already abundantly clear that he possesses a vision, energy, and strategy for improving the Journal that will build on any progress the Journal has experienced during the past 18 years and take the Journal to new heights once unimaginable. And thankfully, the editorial board members, staff, and many others have expressed ongoing excitement about the progress of the Journal and enthusiasm in supporting Dr Nath (as they have so graciously supported me) to help his visions and aspirations become a reality.\n\n【97】And most importantly, I would like to thank my family for their unrelenting support during my tenure as EIC. Notable among them are my beloved wife, best friend, and wisest counselor, Mary Duckworth Lanier; my daughter, E. Brooke Lanier; and my son, Dr W. Hudson Lanier. Without them, this mission would not have been possible and certainly not as meaningful. Their statements of encouragement and coaching were preferred fuels during this fantastic journey. And, offering much-appreciated “counseling assists” were my mother, Dr Nancy J. Lanier, and my sister, Melodie Lanier Mobley, who had sufficient knowledge to keep me humble but practiced sufficient discretion to allow me to explore and grow.\n\n【98】In closing, I would like to reiterate my appreciation to so many who have made my journey with _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ a life-changing experience. I will dearly miss the support, encouragement, critiques, and, yes, friendship that they shared with me daily. I believe that as a team, we have metaphorically taken the Journal's quality and scope of mission through adolescence, but like all adolescences, there were periods in which growth and grace were not always tightly coupled. However, as a result of the transition, the Journal is now positioned to enter a new, exciting phase of adulthood growth—a phase in which the opportunities and potential know no bounds. I look forward to the opportunity to observe this ongoing growth and the stewardship provided by the new EIC, the staff, the editorial board, and others. It is my sincere hope and desire that the future accomplishments of the Journal will become so important and influential that the accomplishments of these past 18 years will become but a distant memory…although a pleasant distant memory.\n\n【99】Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this wonderful adventure, and Godspeed to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ and its stewards.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Exclusion criteria included human immunodeficiency virus infection, lung cancer, active tuberculosis, hospitalization within 7 days, length of stay (LOS) more than 14 days, and requirement of mechanical ventilation. All patients were cared for by either a full-time hospitalist or a primary care physician. Data collected included patient insurance status, variables to calculate each patient's Pneumonia Severity Index score, initial antibiotic selection, door-to-needle time, time to patient stability for switch to oral antibiotics, time to actual switch, unstable variables at discharge, and subspecialty consultation rate. Each patient's initial chest x-ray film was reviewed and classified as diagnostic of pneumonia, indeterminate, or clear. Outcomes measured via administrative database were mortality, LOS, costs, and readmission rate.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Primary care physicians cared for 270 patients, and hospitalists cared for 185. Primary care physician patients were older, and this group had a higher proportion of the highest-risk patients. The mean time to stability was 3.2 days for hospitalists and 3.3 days for primary care physicians, and the mean time from stability to actual switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics was 1.6 days and 2.3 days, respectively ( _P_ \\=.003). The mean adjusted LOS was 5.6 days for hospitalists and 6.5 days for primary care physicians. Similarly adjusted costs were $594 less per patient treated by hospitalists. A difference in door-to-needle time of 0.9 hour favoring primary care physicians did not contribute to LOS. No significant differences were noted in adjusted inpatient mortality or the appropriateness of initial antibiotics used. Primary care physicians were more likely to prescribe clindamycin and ceftazidime, and they requested infectious disease consultations more often. At discharge, 14% of hospitalist patients and 7% of primary care physician patients had at least 1 unstable variable. Differences in hospital readmission rates at 15 and 30 days were not statistically significant in combined or risk-stratified analyses.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia cared for by hospitalists had a shorter adjusted LOS than those seen by primary care physicians primarily because of earlier recognition of stability and more rapid conversion from intravenous to oral antibiotics. Adjusted costs were likewise reduced. However, patients seen by hospitalists were discharged with an unstable clinical variable more often. Other than earlier switch to oral antibiotics, less use of clindamycin and ceftazidime, and fewer infectious disease consultations, hospitalists' processes of care were similar to those of primary care physicians.\n\n【8】HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), LOS ( length of stay )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

However, few biosimilars are currently available in the US. To assess the role of testing requirements in this outcome, we investigated clinical development times for 40 biosimilars that initiated phase I testing between 2012 and 2015. We found that most biosimilars underwent phase III testing with an average trial length of 22 months. Of 20 biosimilars that had been approved by October 2019, the median time from initiation of phase I testing to approval was 69.9 months. These findings reveal a high testing bar for approval that likely contributed to limited market entry.\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Zevalin In-111\n2.  Zevalin Y-90\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Ibritumomab injection is a monoclonal antibody. It is used together with another monoclonal antibody (rituximab) and one radioactive medication (Y-90). Ibritumomab is used to treat a type of cancer called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in patients who have never received any treatment and for those who have received other cancer medicines.\n\n【6】This medicine is to be administered only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Solution\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【11】### Allergies\n\n【12】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【13】### Pediatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ibritumomab injection in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【15】### Geriatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ibritumomab injection in the elderly.\n\n【17】### Breastfeeding\n\n【18】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【21】### Other Interactions\n\n【22】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【23】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【24】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【25】*   Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or\n*   Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or\n*   Neutropenia (low white blood cells in the blood) or\n*   Thrombocytopenia (low platelets in the blood)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【26】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【27】You will receive this medicine while you are in a hospital or cancer treatment center. A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins.\n\n【28】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【29】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【30】Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. You should not become pregnant while you are receiving this medicine and for 12 months after stopping it. Tell your doctor right away if you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine.\n\n【31】This medicine may cause a serious side effect called an infusion reaction. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you have fever, chills, trouble with breathing, chest tightness, swelling in your face or hands, lightheadedness, or if you feel like fainting within a few hours after you receive it.\n\n【32】If you have a severe skin reaction with this medicine, you should seek medical attention right away. Symptoms may include blistering or loosening of the skin; red, swollen, irritated, or scaly skin; fever; chills; headache; or diarrhea.\n\n【33】While you are being treated with ibritumomab, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (live vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Ibritumomab may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent.\n\n【34】Ibritumomab can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【35】*   Avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in the urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【36】If ibritumomab accidentally seeps out of the vein where it is injected, it may damage the tissue and cause scarring. Tell the doctor or nurse right away if you notice redness, pain, or swelling at the place of injection.\n\n【37】While using this medicine, you may be exposed to radiation. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about this.\n\n【38】This medicine contains albumin, which is derived from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them. The risk of getting a virus from medicines made from human blood has been greatly reduced in recent years. This is the result of required testing of human donors for certain viruses, and testing during the making of these medicines. Although the risk is low, talk with your doctor if you have concerns.\n\n【39】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【40】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【41】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.

{"seq_id": "ae497456-a1df-4518-8602-01a207af008d", "title": "Levalbuterol (Inhalation Route)", "text": "【0】Levalbuterol (Inhalation Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Xopenex\n2.  Xopenex HFA\n3.  Xopenex Pediatric\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Levalbuterol is used to prevent or treat bronchospasm in patients with asthma and other lung diseases.\n\n【6】Levalbuterol belongs to the family of medicines known as adrenergic bronchodilators. Adrenergic bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Aerosol Powder\n*   Solution\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of levalbuterol solution and solution concentrate in children younger than 6 years of age, and levalbuterol aerosol in children younger than 4 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in these age groups.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of levalbuterol in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving levalbuterol.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【23】*   Acebutolol\n*   Albuterol\n*   Amineptine\n*   Amitriptyline\n*   Amitriptylinoxide\n*   Amoxapine\n*   Arotinolol\n*   Atenolol\n*   Befunolol\n*   Betaxolol\n*   Bevantolol\n*   Bisoprolol\n*   Bopindolol\n*   Bucindolol\n*   Bupranolol\n*   Butriptyline\n*   Carteolol\n*   Carvedilol\n*   Celiprolol\n*   Clomipramine\n*   Desipramine\n*   Dibenzepin\n*   Dilevalol\n*   Dothiepin\n*   Doxepin\n*   Epinephrine\n*   Esmolol\n*   Fenoterol\n*   Hexoprenaline\n*   Imipramine\n*   Iprindole\n*   Labetalol\n*   Landiolol\n*   Levobunolol\n*   Lofepramine\n*   Melitracen\n*   Mepindolol\n*   Methacholine\n*   Metipranolol\n*   Metoprolol\n*   Nadolol\n*   Nebivolol\n*   Nortriptyline\n*   Opipramol\n*   Oxprenolol\n*   Penbutolol\n*   Pindolol\n*   Practolol\n*   Propizepine\n*   Propranolol\n*   Protriptyline\n*   Sotalol\n*   Talinolol\n*   Tertatolol\n*   Tianeptine\n*   Timolol\n*   Trimipramine\n*   Tulobuterol\n\n【24】### Other Interactions\n\n【25】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【26】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【27】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【28】*   Diabetes or\n*   Heart disease or\n*   Heart rhythm problems (eg, arrhythmia, QT prolongation) or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) or\n*   Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) or\n*   Seizures, history of—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【29】*   Kidney disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【30】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【31】Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using this medicine or any other asthma medicine that you are taking without telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance for breathing problems.\n\n【32】The levalbuterol inhalation solution and inhalation solution concentrate should be used with a jet nebulizer that is connected to an air compressor with good air flow. The inhalation solution and nebulizer will come with patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【33】To use the inhalation solution or solution concentrate in the nebulizer:\n\n【34】*   Open the pouch and remove one vial.\n*   Check the liquid in the vial. It should be clear or colorless. Do not use it if is discolored.\n*   Open the vial and place the inhalation solution in the medicine reservoir or nebulizer cup on the machine. If you are using the solution concentrate, mix it first with sterile normal saline before placing it on the reservoir.\n*   Connect the nebulizer to the face mask or mouthpiece.\n*   Use the face mask or mouthpiece to breathe in the medicine.\n*   Use the nebulizer for about 5 to 15 minutes, or until the medicine in the nebulizer cup is gone.\n*   Clean all the parts of the nebulizer after each use.\n*   Do not use if solution becomes cloudy.\n*   Do not mix another inhalation medicine with levalbuterol in the nebulizer, unless told to do so by your doctor.\n\n【35】For patients using levalbuterol inhalation aerosol:\n\n【36】*   The levalbuterol aerosol canister provides about 200 inhalations, depending on the size of the canister your doctor ordered. You should try to keep a record of the number of inhalations you use so you will know when the canister is almost empty. This canister, unlike some other aerosol canisters, cannot be floated in water to test its fullness.\n*   When you use the inhaler for the first time, or if you have not used it in a while, the inhaler may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. Test or prime the inhaler before using it.\n*   Shake the inhaler well immediately before each use.\n*   Take the cap off the actuator (or mouthpiece). Inspect the actuator for the presence of foreign objects and make sure that the canister is seated in the actuator before each use.\n*   Prime the inhaler by releasing 4 test sprays in the air, away from your face. The inhaler will now be ready to provide the right amount of medicine when you use it.\n*   Breathe out fully through your mouth, expelling as much air from your lungs as possible. Place the mouthpiece fully into your mouth, holding the inhaler in the mouthpiece-down position and closing your lips around it.\n*   While breathing in deeply and slowly through your mouth, fully depress the top of the metal canister with your middle finger. Immediately after the puff is delivered, release your finger from the canister and remove the inhaler from your mouth.\n*   Hold your breath for 10 seconds, if possible.\n*   If your doctor has prescribed more than a single inhalation/puff, wait 1 minute between inhalations. Then, shake the inhaler well and repeat.\n*   Replace the cap on the mouthpiece after each use.\n*   Clean the actuator or mouthpiece at least once a week.\n*   Wash the actuator through the top and bottom with warm running water for 30 seconds at least once a week.\n\n【37】### Dosing\n\n【38】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【39】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【40】*   For preventing or treating bronchospasm:\n    *   For inhalation aerosol dosage form:\n        *   Adults and children 4 years of age and older—Two puffs every 4 to 6 hours. In some patients one puff every 4 hours may be enough.\n        *   Children younger than 4 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For inhalation solution dosage form (used with a nebulizer):\n        *   Adults and children 12 years of age and older—At first, 0.63 milligrams (mg) in the nebulizer 3 times a day, every 6 to 8 hours per day. Some patients may need to start at 1.25 mg in the nebulizer 3 times a day.\n        *   Children 6 to 11 years of age—0.31 mg in the nebulizer 3 times a day. Your doctor may increase your dose as needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 0.63 mg 3 times a day.\n        *   Children younger than 6 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【41】### Missed Dose\n\n【42】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【43】If your dosing schedule is different from all of the above and you miss a dose of this medicine, or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.\n\n【44】### Storage\n\n【45】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【46】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【47】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【48】Keep the medicine in the foil pouch until you are ready to use it. Store at room temperature, away from heat and direct light. Do not freeze.\n\n【49】Keep the inhalation solution in the foil pouch until you are ready to use it. The rest of the vials in the pouch should be used within 2 weeks after the foil pouch has been opened.\n\n【50】Use the inhalation solution concentrate vial right away after opening the foil pouch.\n\n【51】Throw away the canister after either 200 sprays have been used. Ask your pharmacist if you are not sure. Do not place the canister in water to see if the canister is full (float test).\n\n【52】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【53】If you will be using this medicine for a long time, it is important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to check for any unwanted effects.\n\n【54】This medicine should not be used together with other similar inhaled medicines, such as albuterol (Accuneb®), isoproterenol (Isuprel®), metaproterenol (Alupent®), pirbuterol (Maxair®), or terbutaline (Brethaire®).\n\n【55】This medicine may cause paradoxical bronchospasm, which means your breathing or wheezing will get worse. Paradoxical bronchospasm may be life-threatening. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have coughing, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, or wheezing after using this medicine.\n\n【56】Talk to your doctor or get medical help right away if:\n\n【57】*   Your or your child's symptoms do not improve or they become worse after using this medicine.\n*   Your inhaler does not seem to be working as well as usual and you need to use it more often.\n\n【58】You or your child may also be taking an antiinflammatory medicine, such as a steroid (cortisone-like medicine), together with this medicine. Do not stop taking the antiinflammatory medicine, even if your asthma seems better, unless you are told to do so by your doctor.\n\n【59】Levalbuterol may cause serious types of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child develop a skin rash, hives, itching, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.\n\n【60】Hypokalemia (low potassium in the blood) may occur while you are using this medicine.

In a randomized, double-blind design, 305 participants wore an ionized bracelet and 305 wore a placebo bracelet for 4 weeks. For each location where pain was present at baseline, participants rated the intensity of pain. Follow-up ratings were made after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of wearing the bracelet. Two primary end points were defined for evaluating efficacy. The first was the change at 4-week follow-up (day 28) in the pain score at the location with the highest baseline value (maximum pain score). The second was the change at 4-week follow-up in the sum of the pain scores for all locations.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Analysis of the data showed significant improvement in pain scores in both groups, but no differences were observed between the group wearing the placebo bracelet and the group wearing the ionized bracelet.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】The finding that subjective improvement in pain scores was equivalent with ionized and placebo bracelet use questions the benefit of using an ionized bracelet. New treatments in alternative medical therapy must be shown to be effective through vigorous, unbiased, objective testing before physicians acknowledge potential benefits or recommend these treatments to patients.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

He was the creator of a spectacularly popular series of crime-solving adventures involving the exploits of Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson. In the span of about 40 years, 4 novels and 56 related short stories featuring Holmes and Watson were published. They have sold in the many millions of copies, including various editions and translations. The central figures of these adventures have been metamorphosed from characters in stories into real persons. They were so well drawn by Doyle that they transcended the printed page and became living, breathing human beings to thousands of enthusiastic devotees. Enough books and articles have been published about these characters and their adventures to fill a sizable library. Bibliographic tools note at least 30,000 items such as biographies, postage stamps issued in their honor, directories, encyclopedias, periodicals, cards, cartoons, advertisements, memorabilia, more than 300 movies, more than 75 television productions, more than 70 plays, several musicals, 35 different series broadcast on the radio, and at least 1 ballet. Sherlock Holmes has even been awarded an Honorary Diploma in the Art and Science of Sleuthing from Colorado State University (Fort Collins).\n\n【2】Holmes and Watson are 2 of the most immediately recognizable figures in popular culture. Their images have been adapted countless times for innumerable purposes. Biographical data concerning them can be drawn from the research efforts of Holmesian authorities.\n\n【3】Sherlock Holmes, probably William Sherlock Holmes, was born on January 6, 1854, in the North Riding of Yorkshire (England). His father, a country squire, was probably named Sigerson, and his maternal grandmother was a sister of French painter Horace Vernet (1789-1863). Sherlock had 2 brothers, Mycroft and Sherrinford. Mycroft worked for the English government, and Sherrinford emigrated to the Territory of New Mexico, where he died of smallpox in 1885. Sherlock attended either the University of Cambridge or the University of Oxford. He went to London after about 2 years without obtaining his degree. Holmes never married because he believed it would bias his judgment. In many respects, he was a complicated character. Nothing could exceed his puissance when he was working, but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for hours on end he would lie on the sofa hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle. He sometimes turned to drugs for stimulation, and then an even blacker depression would overtake him, from which he could be rescued only by a case.\n\n【4】John Henry or Hamish Watson was born on July 7 or September 18, 1852, in Hampshire (England). He had 1 brother, Henry, who was “a drunkard.” After his mother's death when he was still quite young, Watson moved with his father to Australia. He returned to England, obtained his medical degree in 1878 at the University of London, practiced medicine (first at the St Bartholomew Hospital in London and then at the army surgical school at Netley near Southampton), and was subsequently sent to India, where he was attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as assistant surgeon. Watson was wounded on July 27, 1880, at the “fatal battle of Maiwand” (Afghanistan). After a long convalescence in a base hospital, he returned to England, where he was introduced to Holmes and began their “great partnership.” From 1903, he served as medical officer at a London asylum, took a teaching post in Birmingham, set up a general practice, did some surgery, retired, and finally settled in the Northwest. Watson was kind, sensible, genial, and composed. He enjoyed sports, tales of the sea, Turkish baths, and dogs. He was possessed of a kind of wild courage and tended to be romantic, easily deceived, occasionally rash, and sometimes headstrong.\n\n【5】Regarding the deaths of Holmes and Watson, we can borrow from a sonnet written by Vincent Starrett (1886-1974):\n\n【6】“Here dwell together still two men of note\n\n【7】Who never lived and so can never die….\n\n【8】Here, though the world explode, these two survive.\n\n【9】And it is always eighteen ninety-five.”\n\n【10】Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes, and Dr John Watson were honored on a set of 4 stamps showing scenes from the adventures of Sherlock Holmes. One of the stamps (Scott No. 632), issued by Turks and Caicos Islands in 1984, depicts Holmes introducing Dr Watson to Mycroft Holmes in _The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter_ .\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【13】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/80.6.722</u></u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>© 2005 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

We investigated the associations of CKD stage, hospitalizations with and without acute kidney injury (AKI), serum potassium, bicarbonate level, thiazide, and loop diuretic use with ACE-I/ARB discontinuation.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Among the 53,912 ACE-I/ARB users, the mean age was 59.9 years, and 50.6% were female. More than half of users discontinued ACE-I/ARB within 5 years of therapy initiation. The risk of ACE-I/ARB discontinuation increased with more advanced CKD stage. For example, patients who initiated ACE-I/ARB with CKD stage G4 (eGFR: 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m  ) were 2.09-fold (95% CI, 1.87-2.34) more likely to discontinue therapy than those with eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m  . Potassium level greater than 5.3 mEq/L, systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg, bicarbonate level < 22 mmol/L, and intervening hospitalization—particularly AKI-related–were also strong risk factors for ACE-I/ARB discontinuation. Thiazide diuretic use was associated with lower risk, whereas loop diuretic use was associated with higher risk of discontinuation.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In a real-world cohort, discontinuation of ACE-I/ARB was common, particularly in patients with lower eGFR. Hyperkalemia, hypotension, low bicarbonate level, and hospitalization (AKI-related, in particular) were associated with a higher risk of ACE-I/ARB discontinuation. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the risk–benefit balance of discontinuing ACE-I/ARB in the setting of CKD progression.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACE-I ( angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ), ACE-I/ARB ( angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or their combination ), AKI ( acute kidney injury ), ARB ( angiotensin receptor blocker ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), eGFR ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ), EHR ( electronic health record ), HR ( hazard ratio ), KDIGO ( Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ), OR ( odds ratio )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Twenty-five postgraduate year (PGY) 2 residents at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, were assigned to IJ-CVLP training in the cardiac catheterization laboratory from January 2001 to June 2001. Their experience, analyzed immediately after training and at completion of residency, was compared with that of 22 PGY-2 residents in the same class who were not assigned to IJ-CVLP training.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】The median Likert scores of the residents' self-reported perception of independence in IJ-CVLP increased from 3.0 (mean ± SD score, 2.8±1.4) before the intervention to 5.0 (4.4±0.9) after the intervention ( _P_ <.001, signed rank test). At graduation, trained residents had performed more IJ-CVLPs than the control residents (mean ± SD, 17.8±8.4 vs 9.8±6.3, respectively; _P_ <.001). Residents who received IJ-CVLP training, compared with those who did not, showed a significant increase in the mean percentage of IJ-CVLPs performed independently between PGY-1 (2.2%) and PGY-3 (31.2%) ( _P_ \\=.008).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】Training internal medicine residents to perform IJ-CVLP is feasible in the cardiac catheterization laboratory with supervision from an attending cardiologist.

Their bone mineral density was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and quantitative ultrasonometry (QUS), and their historical and clinical risk factors were assessed (January to June 2003). Logistic regression analysis was used to select significant predictors of bone mineral density, whereas receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the discriminatory performance of ORACLE.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】The final logistic regression model retained 4 biometric or historical variables and 1 ultrasonometric outcome. The ROC areas under the curves (AUCs) for ORACLE were 84% for the prediction of osteoporosis and 78% for low bone mass. A sensitivity of 90% corresponded to a specificity of 50% for identification of women at risk of developing osteoporosis. The corresponding positive and negative predictive values were 86% and 54%, respectively, in the development cohort. In the validation cohort, the AUCs for identification of osteoporosis and low bone mass were 81% and 76% for ORACLE, 69% and 64% for QUS T score, 71% and 68% for QUS ultrasonometric bone profile index, and 76% and 75% for Osteoporosis Self-assessment Tool, respectively. ORACLE had the best discriminatory performance in identifying osteoporosis compared with the other approaches ( _P_ <.05).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】ORACLE exhibited the highest discriminatory properties compared with ultrasonography alone or other previously validated risk indices.

{"seq_id": "7d055d3f-cb78-4c3b-a1a2-81a3cb549c38", "title": "Cholera", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Cholera is a bacterial disease usually spread through contaminated water. Cholera causes severe diarrhea and dehydration. Left untreated, cholera can be fatal within hours, even in previously healthy people.\n\n【2】Modern sewage and water treatment have virtually eliminated cholera in industrialized countries. But cholera still exists in Africa, Southeast Asia and Haiti. The risk of a cholera epidemic is highest when poverty, war or natural disasters force people to live in crowded conditions without adequate sanitation.\n\n【3】Cholera is easily treated. Death from severe dehydration can be prevented with a simple and inexpensive rehydration solution.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Most people exposed to the cholera bacterium (Vibrio cholerae) don't become ill and don't know they've been infected. But because they shed cholera bacteria in their stool for seven to 14 days, they can still infect others through contaminated water.\n\n【6】Most cases of cholera that cause symptoms cause mild or moderate diarrhea that's often hard to tell apart from diarrhea caused by other problems. Others develop more-serious signs and symptoms of cholera, usually within a few days of infection.\n\n【7】Symptoms of cholera infection can include:\n\n【8】*   **Diarrhea.** Cholera-related diarrhea comes on suddenly and can quickly cause dangerous fluid loss — as much as a quart (about 1 liter) an hour. Diarrhea due to cholera often has a pale, milky appearance that resembles water in which rice has been rinsed.\n*   **Nausea and vomiting.** Vomiting occurs especially in the early stages of cholera and can last for hours.\n*   **Dehydration.** Dehydration can develop within hours after cholera symptoms start and range from mild to severe. A loss of 10% or more of body weight indicates severe dehydration.\n\n【9】    Signs and symptoms of cholera dehydration include irritability, fatigue, sunken eyes, a dry mouth, extreme thirst, dry and shriveled skin that's slow to bounce back when pinched into a fold, little or no urinating, low blood pressure, and an irregular heartbeat.\n\n【10】Dehydration can lead to a rapid loss of minerals in your blood that maintain the balance of fluids in your body. This is called an electrolyte imbalance.\n\n【11】### Electrolyte imbalance\n\n【12】An electrolyte imbalance can lead to serious signs and symptoms such as:\n\n【13】*   **Muscle cramps.** These result from the rapid loss of salts such as sodium, chloride and potassium.\n*   **Shock.** This is one of the most serious complications of dehydration. It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body. If untreated, severe hypovolemic shock can cause death in minutes.\n\n【14】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【15】The risk of cholera is slight in industrialized nations. Even in areas where it exists you're not likely to become infected if you follow food safety recommendations. Still, cases of cholera occur throughout the world. If you develop severe diarrhea after visiting an area with active cholera, see your doctor.\n\n【16】If you have diarrhea, especially severe diarrhea, and think you might have been exposed to cholera, seek treatment right away. Severe dehydration is a medical emergency that requires immediate care.\n\n【17】Causes\n------\n\n【18】A bacterium called Vibrio cholerae causes cholera infection. The deadly effects of the disease are the result of a toxin the bacteria produces in the small intestine. The toxin causes the body to secrete enormous amounts of water, leading to diarrhea and a rapid loss of fluids and salts (electrolytes).\n\n【19】Cholera bacteria might not cause illness in all people who are exposed to them, but they still pass the bacteria in their stool, which can contaminate food and water supplies.\n\n【20】Contaminated water supplies are the main source of cholera infection. The bacterium can be found in:\n\n【21】*   **Surface or well water.** Contaminated public wells are frequent sources of large-scale cholera outbreaks. People living in crowded conditions without adequate sanitation are especially at risk.\n*   **Seafood.** Eating raw or undercooked seafood, especially shellfish, that comes from certain places can expose you to cholera bacteria. Most recent cases of cholera in the United States have been traced to seafood from the Gulf of Mexico.\n*   **Raw fruits and vegetables.** Raw, unpeeled fruits and vegetables are a frequent source of cholera infection in areas where there's cholera. In developing countries, uncomposted manure fertilizers or irrigation water containing raw sewage can contaminate produce in the field.\n*   **Grains.** In regions where cholera is widespread, grains such as rice and millet that are contaminated after cooking and kept at room temperature for several hours can grow cholera bacteria.\n\n【22】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【23】Everyone is susceptible to cholera, with the exception of infants who get immunity from nursing mothers who have previously had cholera. Still, certain factors can make you more vulnerable to the disease or more likely to have severe signs and symptoms.\n\n【24】Risk factors for cholera include:\n\n【25】*   **Poor sanitary conditions.** Cholera is more likely to flourish in situations where a sanitary environment — including a safe water supply — is difficult to maintain. Such conditions are common to refugee camps, impoverished countries, and areas afflicted by famine, war or natural disasters.\n*   **Reduced or nonexistent stomach acid.** Cholera bacteria can't survive in an acidic environment, and ordinary stomach acid often serves as a defense against infection. But people with low levels of stomach acid — such as children, older adults, and people who take antacids, H-2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors — lack this protection, so they're at greater risk of cholera.\n*   **Household exposure.** You're at increased risk of cholera if you live with someone who has the disease.\n*   **Type O blood.** For reasons that aren't entirely clear, people with type O blood are twice as likely to develop cholera compared with people with other blood types.\n*   **Raw or undercooked shellfish.** Although industrialized nations no longer have large-scale cholera outbreaks, eating shellfish from waters known to harbor the bacteria greatly increases your risk.\n\n【26】Complications\n-------------\n\n【27】Cholera can quickly become fatal. In the most severe cases, the rapid loss of large amounts of fluids and electrolytes can lead to death within hours. In less extreme situations, people who don't receive treatment can die of dehydration and shock hours to days after cholera symptoms first appear.\n\n【28】Although shock and severe dehydration are the worst complications of cholera, other problems can occur, such as:\n\n【29】*   **Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).** Dangerously low levels of blood sugar (glucose) — the body's main energy source — can occur when people become too ill to eat. Children are at greatest risk of this complication, which can cause seizures, unconsciousness and even death.\n*   **Low potassium levels.** People with cholera lose large quantities of minerals, including potassium, in their stools. Very low potassium levels interfere with heart and nerve function and are life-threatening.\n*   **Kidney failure.** When the kidneys lose their filtering ability, excess amounts of fluids, some electrolytes and wastes build up in the body — a potentially life-threatening condition. In people with cholera, kidney failure often accompanies shock.\n\n【30】Prevention\n----------\n\n【31】Cholera is rare in the United States with the few cases related to travel outside the U.S. or to contaminated and improperly cooked seafood from the Gulf Coast waters.\n\n【32】If you're traveling to areas known to have cholera, your risk of contracting the disease is extremely low if you follow these precautions:\n\n【33】*   **Wash your hands with soap and water frequently,** especially after using the toilet and before handling food. Rub soapy, wet hands together for at least 15 seconds before rinsing. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\n*   **Drink only safe water,** including bottled water or water you've boiled or disinfected yourself. Use bottled water even to brush your teeth.\n\n【34】    Hot beverages are generally safe, as are canned or bottled drinks, but wipe the outside before you open them. Don't add ice to your drinks unless you made it yourself using safe water.\n\n【35】*   **Eat food that's completely cooked and hot** and avoid street vendor food, if possible. If you do buy a meal from a street vendor, make sure it's cooked in your presence and served hot.\n*   **Avoid sushi,** as well as raw or improperly cooked fish and seafood of any kind.\n*   **Stick to fruits and vegetables that you can peel yourself,** such as bananas, oranges and avocados. Stay away from salads and fruits that can't be peeled, such as grapes and berries.\n\n【36】### Cholera vaccine\n\n【37】People traveling from the United States to areas affected by cholera can get a cholera vaccine called Vaxchora. It's suggested for people between ages 2 and 64 who plan to travel where cholera is being spread or regularly spreads. It is a liquid dose taken by mouth at least 10 days before travel.\n\n【38】Several other countries offer oral vaccines as well. Contact your doctor or local office of public health for more information about these vaccines. Even with the vaccine, it's important to take the above precautions to prevent cholera.\n\n【39】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which any drug had been evaluated vs placebo and sleep had been assessed. We collectively referred to insomnia-related outcomes as _sleep disturbance_ . We also searched the _PDR_ to identify any insomnia symptoms listed for drugs with RCT evidence available.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Seventy-four Cochrane systematic reviews corresponding to 274 RCTs assessed 88 drugs in 27 different conditions, providing evidence on 109 drug-condition pairs. Of these 88 drugs, 5 decreased sleep problems and 19 increased sleep problems; 64 drugs had no nominally statistically significant effect on sleep. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, dopamine agonists, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were the drug classes most importantly associated with sleep disturbance. Of 35 drugs that included disturbed sleep as an adverse effect in the _PDR_ , only 14 had RCT evidence supporting such effect, and 2 had evidence of increasing and decreasing sleep problems in RCTs, although this was not shown in the _PDR_ . We identified weak concordance between the _PDR_ and RCTs (weighted κ=0.31; _P_ <.001).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The RCTs offer substantial evidence about the common effects of drugs on the risk of sleep disturbance; currently, prescription information only partially agrees with the available randomized evidence.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AE ( adverse event ), CDSR ( Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews ), COMTI ( catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor ), DOPA ( dopamine ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), GABA ( γ-aminobutyric acid ), GnRH ( gonadotropin-releasing hormone ), IQR ( interquartile range ), MAOI ( monoamine oxidase inhibitor ), NA ( number of events is not applicable because the outcome is continuous ), NL ( drug is not listed in the PDR ), NMDA ( N-methyl-d-aspartic acid ), NSAID ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ), OR ( odds ratio ), PDR ( Physicians' Desk Reference ), RCT ( randomized controlled trial ), SNRI ( serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ), SSRI ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ), TCA ( tricyclic antidepressant )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Thromboembolism prevalence was not definitely associated with positive test results (LA only, aCL only, or LA plus aCL), nor was it strongly associated with aCL isotype or titer. Furthermore, thromboembolism prevalence was not increased when all LA assays were positive, although a history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism was nonsignificantly associated with positive results for all 4 LA tests. The likelihood of having both LA- and aCL-positive test results was higher among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (26 \\[19.0%\\] of 137 patients with positive results for one or both tests), but they had no more thrombotic events or fetal loss than other patients in our study group.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】The DRVVT identified more patients with LA than the other LA tests, but more than 1 LA test was required to identify all patients with LA. Positive results were much more common for aCL than for LA. No single LA test or anticardiolipin isotype correlated with thrombosis or systemic disease in this population.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】aCL ( anticardiolipin antibodies ), AI ( autoimmune disease ), APTT ( activated partial thromboplastin time ), CA ( cancer ), DRVVT ( dilute Russell viper venom time ), DVT ( deep venous thrombosis ), KCT ( kaolin clot time ), LA ( lupus anticoagulants ), PAE ( peripheral arterial event ), PCT ( plasma clot time ), PE ( pulmonary embolus ), PNP ( platelet neutralization procedure ), SLE ( systemic lupus erythematosus ), TIA ( transient ischemic attack )\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

In reviewing the preliminary DHHS rules for ACO formation, the Board did not feel that the organization could meet those requirements, so initial plans were to develop a clinically integrated delivery organization without formal Medicare Shared Savings ACO status. The BQA Board framed and committed the organization to the mission of achieving high-quality care while reducing the overall cost of care for our patients by clinically integrating independent physicians, employed physicians, hospitals, and other health care institutions into an effective alliance. An extensive physician-led committee structure was put into place, and the organization has begun to redesign care processes to benefit the community and achieve these goals. In the first 7 months, more than 750 physician committee hours have been logged to create policies, establish membership criteria, consider payer contracts, and begin the detailed process of creating disease-management, population-management care delivery protocols and pathways. The Table illustrates these committees and their basic functions. When the DHHS final regulations were received in October 2011, the leadership of both BQA and BHCS felt that the rules were manageable and that the opportunities to accomplish shared savings were within the capability of BQA. It was further felt that the CMS Pioneer model was not appropriate for BQA because of our limited prior experience in managing financial risk and the fact that our organization was new and lacked the experience, systems, and technology required for the population-management approach necessary for success under the Pioneer model requirements.\n\n【82】TABLE Baylor Quality Alliance Committee Structure\n\n| BQA committee | Committee function |\n| --- | --- |\n| Membership and Standards | Create standards of membership and manage performance of all participants; NCQA-accepted credentialing of physicians and other providers, such as post-acute care providers and facilities |\n| Best Care/Clinical Integration | Multidisciplinary creation and monitoring of quality and efficiency of care paths across continuum of care; chronic disease management; transitional care management |\n| Compliance | Organizational adherence to regulatory requirements; assurance of rights and ethical care for patients served |\n| Finance/Contracting | Monitor financial performance of organization; create and adjudicate reward distribution; approve managed care contracts |\n| Information Technology | Ensure electronic connectivity to support clinical integration and measure both quality and cost performance |\n| Population Management | Profiling of population segments and predictive modeling in order to match delivery and resources according to needs of patients.

Thus, attribution by tax ID would capture _all_ of that group's patients. Despite conversations with and appeals to the CMS, agency policy does not allow attribution by National Provider Identifier number (NPI) since, in their view, use of the NPI would hamper flexibility for physicians and other health care providers or suppliers to participate in multiple ACOs.\n\n【90】Department of Health and Human Services CfMaMS.

The BQA likewise does not currently hold any non-Medicare ACO contracts. We anticipate the first contract will be between the BHCS Employee Benefit Plan and BQA, starting in January 2013. We are also engaged in discussions with Medicare Advantage plans and several commercial plans, looking primarily at shared savings models and patient-centered medical home fees.\n\n【93】Proceeding with our clinical integrated network strategy, BQA leadership feels strongly that “accountability” for quality, cost, and access are core tenets of membership. Members must agree to pay an initial fee, submit quality and cost data, acquire an EHR, and log onto a secure website to view their quality and efficiency data no less than 8 of every 12 months. Moreover, they agree to integrate clinical care, with primary care and specialist physicians jointly treating patients, using agreed-on, evidence-based care paths and protocols created collaboratively by primary care and specialist physicians. The BQA leadership also believes it is essential that every patient have a patient-centered medical home; we will therefore have over 250 primary care physicians who have attained National Committee for Quality Assurance Level 3 Patient-Centered Medical Home status.\n\n【94】A significant challenge in creating coalitions like BQA is finding secure, feasible means to share and report the necessary clinical and performance data. While the BHCS employed–physician group is actively using a shared EHR, many of the independent physicians have different EHR systems. We are therefore linking all participating physicians to a Health Information Exchange, the deployment of which has begun.\n\n【95】Performance management within BQA will depend on good data, fed back to physicians and other health care professionals following analysis to identify gaps in care, unexplained variation, and substandard performance of any member. To complement this feedback in truly achieving high-quality care and cost reductions, we are developing a performance improvement and coaching program that we will use to help substandard performers reach target levels. The BQA physician leaders believe that we are truly reorganizing the way that care is delivered to the benefit of patients, while reducing the overall costs of care.\n\n【96】We began recruiting physicians to BQA in mid-December 2011, and our initial efforts have been successful. Of the 600 physicians in the BHCS employed-physician group, 90% have already joined BQA, individually signing participation agreements accepting accountability. More than 700 specialty physicians have already indicated a desire to join, and, at this writing, town hall meetings have been conducted with physicians throughout BHCS. Although BQA is open to willing physicians at this time, the Board recognizes that we may reach a membership level with adequate capacity to serve the population enrolled, in which case membership would close.\n\n【97】The future of accountable care is unclear. However, solutions to the cost, quality, and access problems must—and will—be found, and the ACO model deserves a fair trial with wholehearted commitment to creating a successful, clinically integrated organization that achieves the Triple Aim. We believe that the CMS should strongly reconsider the physician tax ID attribution method and offer an NPI attribution methodology. Until this flexibility is allowed, BQA (and likely many similar organizations) will be unable to apply for Medicare Shared Savings designation. Nonetheless, at BHCS, we are committed to pursuing our clinically integrated strategy and are organizing ourselves to improve care delivery for the patients we serve in north Texas.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), a marker of the presence and severity of OSA, was assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Linear mixed models evaluated the effect of weight change on the AHI and the effect of OSA (AHI ≥5) on subsequent weight loss. Secondary analyses evaluated the effect of OSA on intervention attendance, meeting daily calorie goals, and accelerometer-measured physical activity.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】At baseline, 51.8% of the sample (n=59) had OSA. Adults who achieved at least 5% weight loss had an AHI reduction that was 2.1±0.9 (adjusted mean ± SE) events/h greater than those with less than 5% weight loss ( _P_ <.05). Adults with OSA lost a mean ± SE of 2.2%±0.9% less weight during the subsequent 6-month interval compared with those without OSA ( _P_ \\=.02). Those with OSA were less adherent to daily calorie goals (mean ± SE: 25.2%±3.3% vs 34.8%±3.4% of days; _P_ \\=.006) and had a smaller increase in daily activity (mean ± SE: 378.3±353.7 vs 1060.1±377.8 steps/d; _P_ <.05) over 12 months than those without OSA.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Behaviorally induced weight loss in overweight/obese adults was associated with significant AHI reduction. However, the presence of OSA was associated with blunted weight loss, potentially via reduced adherence to behaviors supporting weight loss. These results suggest that OSA screening before attempting weight loss may be helpful to identify who may benefit from additional behavioral counseling.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】12M ( 12 months ), 6M ( 6 months ), AHI ( apnea-hypopnea index ), BL ( baseline ), BMI ( body mass index ), CPAP ( continuous positive airway pressure ), MVPA ( moderate-vigorous physical activity ), OSA ( obstructive sleep apnea )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins to treat rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis, PJIA, SJIA, or CRS. It must be given slowly, so the needle will have to remain in place for at least 1 hour.\n\n【36】Tocilizumab injection may also be given as a shot under your skin to treat rheumatoid arthritis, SSc-ILD, PJIA, SJIA, or giant cell arteritis. It may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital or clinic. If you are using this medicine at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand exactly how to use this.\n\n【37】This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\n【38】This medicine is available in 2 forms. You may use a prefilled syringe or an autoinjector.\n\n【39】If you use this medicine at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems. Do not inject into scars, moles, or skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, hard, or not intact.\n\n【40】Allow the prefilled syringe to warm to room temperature 30 minutes or the autoinjector for 45 minutes before using it.

Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【58】You or your child will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.\n\n【59】This medicine will lower the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed or get infections more easily. To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers. Tell your doctor if you have any kind of infection before you start using this medicine. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had an infection that would not go away or an infection that keeps coming back.\n\n【60】Call your doctor right away if you or your child start to have a cough that would not go away, weight loss, night sweats, fever, chills, or flu-like symptoms, such as a runny or stuffy nose, headache, blurred vision, or feeling generally ill. These may be signs that you have an infection.\n\n【61】This medicine may cause serious stomach and bowel problems, especially if you have a history of ulcers or diverticulosis. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child start having severe stomach cramps or pain, black, tarry stools, diarrhea, fever, or vomiting that is severe and sometimes bloody while being treated with this medicine.\n\n【62】Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.\n\n【63】Using this medicine may increase your risk of having certain cancers. Talk to your doctor if you have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, or unexplained weight loss. Also, check with your doctor right away if your skin has red, scaly patches, or raised bumps that are filled with pus.\n\n【64】Tocilizumab may cause headaches and skin reactions, such as a rash or itching, while you are receiving the injection or within 24 hours after you receive it. Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you or your child have any of these symptoms.\n\n【65】This medicine may cause serious types of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using this medicine.\n\n【66】While you or your child are being treated with tocilizumab, and after you stop treatment with it, it is important to see your doctor about the immunizations (vaccinations) you should receive. Do not get any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Tocilizumab may lower your body's resistance, and there is a chance you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance that they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.\n\n【67】This medicine may increase the amounts of cholesterol and fats in your blood. If this condition occurs, your doctor may give you some medicines that can lower their amounts. Talk to your doctor if you or your child have concerns.\n\n【68】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【69】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【70】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.

It is the linkage of information to a particular formulation of a compound that makes a drug a therapeutic agent. The remarkable gains made in producing safer and more effective drugs reflect great efforts to select one active and relatively nontoxic potential candidate from hundreds of other molecules. Even before a new chemical entity reaches the clinic, typically millions of dollars are spent in this process. As we become more sophisticated in understanding the physiology of diseases and of adverse events, the preclinical testing required to put a compound into clinical practice increases. Once a drug is approved, it is more usual than not that additional laboratory testing and clinical testing are required for a pharmaceutical company to maintain its license to keep a drug on the market. These efforts often involve scores of highly trained individuals who must remain focused on acquiring this information so that it can be best applied to patient care.\n\n【2】More than 10 years ago, Celgene recognized the potential of oral medications that affect the immune system via cytokine expression and embarked on a bold plan to try to understand the therapeutic potential of thalidomide and other molecules that shared its properties. Specifically, we studied thalidomide as a progenitor compound for an entirely new class of medical therapeutics and started a large discovery and development program to identify less toxic compounds that shared many of the biological properties that make thalidomide active. The result of this effort is that we have identified more than 40 disease states in which thalidomide may have meaningful activity, for many of which effective medical treatment is currently unavailable. Although modest clinical trials determined that thalidomide had impressive activity, the risk-to-benefit ratio was such that Celgene decided to develop its potentially less toxic congeners derived from its discovery program rather than to develop and ultimately promote the use of thalidomide for these conditions. An exception to this is multiple myeloma, a fatal disease that responds to the drug, especially in combination with other agents. Celgene is in the process of applying to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for regulatory approval for thalidomide use in the treatment of multiple myeloma.

However, the increased understanding of thalidomide's potential role in multiple myeloma would not have been accomplished if it were not for evaluating the results of literally dozens of small clinical experiences with the drug in combination with other agents and in a variety of disease settings.\n\n【24】无关删除-2:<u>*   Kyle RA\n*   Rajkumar SV</u>\n\n【25】Multiple myeloma.\n\n【26】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 2004; 351 : 1860-1873</u></u>\n\n【27】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1282)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【28】Furthermore, these clinical experiences were bolstered by an extensive laboratory effort both within Celgene and among a variety of academic medicine settings. Most of this research was and is funded by Celgene, with a small proportion supported by government and private foundations. It is clear that without Celgene coordinating and funding this preclinical and clinical effort, the impressive results obtained in 1 patient at the University of Arkansas Cancer Center would not have resulted in the recent efforts by Celgene to obtain regulatory approval of thalidomide for use in multiple myeloma.\n\n【29】The FDA allowed Celgene to market our brand of thalidomide (Thalomid) for the treatment of complications of erythema nodosum leprosum only after we had performed standard preclinical and clinical investigations to validate its chemical manufacturing controls, its preclinical toxicology including its lack of mutagenicity or cytoclastic effects, and its lack of carcinogenicity and other toxic effects. We also had to make every effort to understand the drug's potential for metabolic interactions with other commonly prescribed medications to which our target population of patients might be exposed. Moreover, we were required to review the entire clinical experience with the drug dating back to the 1950s and summarize the results of all studies with data regarding the drug's safety and evidence for its activity in treating a complication of a vasculitis associated with lepromatous leprosy. Furthermore, we had to conduct clinical research that demonstrated that our drug formulation was active in the population of patients described in the package insert.\n\n【30】Before the introduction of Thalomid in the United States as a marketed drug, we needed to address and manage the immense health, societal, and emotional burden this drug had created in previous decades. Specifically, the drug can cause a variety of severe adverse reactions, including potentially irreversible peripheral neuropathy, and it is a human teratogen—a single dose taken during pregnancy can result in malformations of the limbs (phocomelia) and of vital organs such as the brain, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. After consulting with thalidomide victims (people who had been exposed to the drug in utero and were affected), prescribers, pharmacists, and potential patients and in collaboration with the FDA, Celgene created a means to allow patients who might benefit from this drug to receive it while at the same time preventing potential thalidomide fetal exposures—the System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety (S.T.E.P.S.). S.T.E.P.S. is described in our package insert and represents an intensive undertaking. Every prescription for Thalomid filled in the United States must be done in a manner managed by S.T.E.P.S. All prescribers, pharmacists, and patients are educated to the potential severe adverse effects of this drug and directed to behave in a manner that will prevent fetal exposure. Depending on the type of patient (adult, child, women with childbearing potential), different monitoring activities are required. To implement S.T.E.P.S. Celgene uses a sophisticated Oracle database to coordinate information and employs a bank of customer care representatives and S.T.E.P.S. intervention specialists to query physicians about potential lack of compliance with the program. In addition, Celgene has a standing S.T.E.P.S. oversight committee consisting of specialists in drug safety, medical education and information, medical research, marketing, distribution, information technology, and quality who actively monitor the functioning of S.T.E.P.S. and recommend modifications if needed. Since initial FDA approval, through a process of continuous quality improvement, we have revised this S.T.E.P.S. system twice. Each revision required hundreds of man-hours to design, implement, and validate the process before launch. The intensive effort associated with S.T.E.P.S. has been worthwhile. Celgene has been marketing Thalomid using S.T.E.P.S. since 1998, and among the more than 100,000 Americans who have received the drug, no malformations have occurred. The entire cost of S.T.E.P.S. is borne by Celgene and is funded by Thalomid sales.\n\n【31】Concurrent with these activities related to the reintroduction of traditional preparations of thalidomide, we have also discovered families of molecules called immunomodulating drugs (IMiDs) that promise to be more potent than thalidomide, yet may have a better safety profile. Revlimid is currently under intensive development for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma, and other hematologic-oncologic conditions. We expect that over the next few years other IMiDs with properties that may make them beneficial for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory conditions will be introduced into clinical practice.\n\n【32】The pricing of a therapeutic agent is a complex issue. Scherer of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government recently reviewed this issue in _The New England Journal of Medicine_ .\n\n【33】无关删除-2:<u>*   Scherer FM</u>\n\n【34】The pharmaceutical industry—prices and progress.\n\n【35】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 2004; 351 : 927-932</u></u>\n\n【36】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (100)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【37】While it is correct that Thalomid prices have increased considerably, this has been offset to a great degree by an approximate 60% reduction in the average daily dose used for most medical conditions, including multiple myeloma. In addition, Celgene is sensitive to patients’ needs, having consistently provided one of the most generous free-goods programs in the industry (the Therapy Assistance Program). Approximately 18% of all Thalomid sales are provided free to uninsured or needy patients. Moreover, price increases to our government and public health service contracts may not, and do not, exceed inflation .\n\n【38】Celgene is a research-driven company, and competitive pricing has enabled us to increase our research and development spending by more than 8-fold in the past 5 years. Currently, $0.45 of every sales dollar is dedicated to research and development. Using these funds, Celgene has or is currently funding more than 200 clinical trials worldwide, with Thalomid and its innovative successor compounds as a new approach to treating a wide range of diseases, such as solid tumors, hematologic cancers, and inflammatory conditions. If Celgene did not fund this work, it would not be done, and a variety of clinical needs that might be addressed by our therapeutics would not be addressed. In addition, we have more than 100 full-time and part-time basic scientists working to discover and develop new molecules related to thalidomide (eg, the IMiDs) that are safer and more effective than currently available therapeutics.\n\n【39】Celgene has a corporate responsibility to our shareholders whose funding initially allowed Celgene to develop thalidomide and other drugs in our pipeline. Without competitive pricing, Celgene's financial base could be threatened, and, at a minimum, the company would not have the resources to conduct the current exhaustive research on thalidomide, the IMiDs, and other unrelated therapeutic agents.\n\n【40】In summary, Celgene remains fully committed to becoming a leader in oncology therapeutics, to investing in clinical research and drug development, and to providing broader patient access to our current and future products. Our experience with thalidomide and the IMiDs is just one part of this effort.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The main features include a red birthmark (port-wine stain), ranging in color from pink to reddish-purple, atypical vein or lymphatic development (malformations), and overgrowth of tissues and bones. These findings most often affect one leg but may occur in an arm or elsewhere.\n\n【2】Although there is no cure for KTS, treatment goals are to improve symptoms and prevent complications.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】People who have KTS may have the following features, which can range from mild to more extensive:\n\n【5】*   **Port-wine stain.** This pink to reddish-purple birthmark is caused by extra tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the top layer of skin. The birthmark often covers part of one leg but can involve any portion of the skin. It may get darker or lighter with age.\n*   **Vein malformations.** These include swollen, twisted veins (varicose veins), usually on the surface of the legs. Deeper malformed veins in the arms, legs, abdomen and pelvis also can occur. There may be spongy tissue filled with small veins in or under the skin. Malformed veins may become more prominent with age.\n*   **Overgrowth of bones and soft tissue.** This begins in infancy and may be limited to one leg, but it can occur in an arm or, rarely, in the trunk or face. This overgrowth of bone and tissue creates a larger and longer extremity. Rarely, there may be fusion of fingers or toes or extra fingers or toes.\n*   **Lymphatic system malformations.** The lymphatic system — part of the immune system that protects against infection and disease and transports lymphatic fluid — can be malformed. Extra lymphatic vessels can be present that don't work properly and can lead to fluid leakage into the tissues and swelling.\n*   **Other conditions.** KTS can also include cataracts, glaucoma, hip dislocation at birth, purple-red skin coloring when cold and blood-clotting problems.\n\n【6】### When to see a doctor\n\n【7】KTS is usually identified at birth. It's important to get a prompt, accurate diagnosis and appropriate care to treat symptoms and prevent complications.\n\n【8】Causes\n------\n\n【9】KTS is a genetic disorder. It involves genetic changes (mutations), most commonly in the _PIK3CA_ gene. This gene is responsible for the growth of cells and the development of tissues in the body. A change in this gene results in overgrowth of tissues.\n\n【10】KTS is not usually inherited. The gene changes occur randomly during cell division in early development before birth.\n\n【11】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【12】Family history doesn't seem to be a risk factor, so it's unlikely that parents of one child with KTS will have another child with the disorder, even if one of the parents has KTS.\n\n【13】Complications\n-------------\n\n【14】Complications of KTS can result from atypical development of blood vessels, soft tissues, bones and the lymphatic system. These can include:\n\n【15】*   **Port-wine stain complications.** Some areas of the port-wine stain may thicken over time and may form blisters (blebs) that are prone to bleeding and infections. Skin ulcers and poor wound healing also may occur.\n*   **Vein malformations.** Varicose veins can cause pain and skin ulcers due to poor circulation. Deeper malformed veins can increase the risk of blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) and cause a life-threatening condition called pulmonary embolism if the clots dislodge and travel to the lungs. Venous malformations in the pelvis and abdominal organs can cause internal bleeding. Superficial veins can develop less serious but painful clots and inflammation (superficial thrombophlebitis).\n*   **Overgrowth of bones and soft tissue.** Overgrowth of bone and tissue can cause pain, a feeling of heaviness, limb enlargement and problems with movement. Overgrowth that causes one leg to be longer than the other can result in problems with walking and may lead to hip and back problems.\n*   **Lymphatic system malformations.** Malformations in the lymphatic system can cause fluid buildup and swelling in the tissues of the arms or legs (lymphedema), skin breakdown and skin ulcers, leakage of lymphatic fluid, or infection of the layer under the skin (cellulitis).\n*   **Chronic pain.** Pain can be a common problem that results from complications such as infections, swelling, bone involvement or vein problems.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

This approach is important to manage the many potential surgical and medical comorbidities in patients who undergo bariatric surgery. Medical management programs require prompt and often frequent adjustment as the nutritional program changes and as weight loss occurs. Familiarity with the recommended nutritional program, monitoring and treatment of potential vitamin and mineral deficiencies, effects of weight loss on medical comorbid conditions, and common postoperative surgical issues should allow clinicians to provide excellent care. Patients must understand the importance of regularly scheduled medical follow-up to minimize potentially serious medical and surgical complications. Because the long-term success of bariatric surgery relies on patients' ability to make sustained lifestyle changes in nutrition and physical activity, we highlight the role of these 2 modalities in their overall care.

{"seq_id": "9e4ad2e6-7423-47cf-a96a-8ad09f974b74", "title": "Tension headache", "text": "【0】Tension headache\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】A tension-type headache (TTH) is generally a mild to moderate pain that's often described as feeling like a tight band around the head. A tension-type headache is the most common type of headache, yet its causes aren't well understood.\n\n【2】Treatments for tension-type headaches are available. Managing a tension-type headache is often a balance between practicing healthy habits, finding effective nondrug treatments and using medications appropriately.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Signs and symptoms of a tension-type headache include:\n\n【5】*   Dull, aching head pain\n*   Sensation of tightness or pressure across the forehead or on the sides and back of the head\n*   Tenderness in the scalp, neck and shoulder muscles\n\n【6】Tension-type headaches are divided into two main categories — episodic and chronic.\n\n【7】### Episodic tension-type headaches\n\n【8】Episodic tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to a week. Frequent episodic tension-type headaches occur less than 15 days a month for at least three months. Frequent episodic tension-type headaches may become chronic.\n\n【9】### Chronic tension-type headaches\n\n【10】This type of tension-type headache lasts hours and may be continuous. If your headaches occur 15 or more days a month for at least three months, they're considered chronic.\n\n【11】### Tension-type headaches versus migraines\n\n【12】Tension-type headaches can be difficult to distinguish from migraines. Plus, if you have frequent episodic tension-type headaches, you can also have migraines.\n\n【13】Unlike some forms of migraine, tension-type headaches usually aren't associated with visual disturbances, nausea or vomiting. Although physical activity typically aggravates migraine pain, it doesn't make tension-type headache pain worse. An increased sensitivity to either light or sound can occur with a tension-type headache, but this symptom isn't common.\n\n【14】### When to see a doctor\n\n【15】#### Make an appointment with your doctor\n\n【16】If tension-type headaches disrupt your life or you need to take medication for your headaches more than twice a week, see your doctor.\n\n【17】Even if you have a history of headaches, see your doctor if the pattern changes or your headaches suddenly feel different. Occasionally, headaches may indicate a serious medical condition, such as a brain tumor or rupture of a weakened blood vessel (aneurysm).\n\n【18】#### When to seek emergency help\n\n【19】If you have any of these signs or symptoms, seek emergency care:\n\n【20】*   Abrupt, severe headache\n*   Headache with a fever, stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, double vision, weakness, numbness or speaking difficulties\n*   Headache after a head injury, especially if the headache gets worse\n\n【21】Causes\n------\n\n【22】The cause of tension-type headaches is not known. Experts used to think tension-type headaches stemmed from muscle contractions in the face, neck and scalp, perhaps as a result of heightened emotions, tension or stress. But research suggests that muscle contraction isn't the cause.\n\n【23】The most common theory supports a heightened sensitivity to pain in people who have tension-type headaches. Increased muscle tenderness, a common symptom of tension-type headaches, may result from a sensitized pain system.\n\n【24】### Triggers\n\n【25】Stress is the most commonly reported trigger for tension-type headaches.\n\n【26】Complications\n-------------\n\n【27】Because tension-type headaches are so common, their effect on job productivity and overall quality of life is considerable, particularly if they're chronic. The frequent pain may render you unable to attend activities. You might need to stay home from work, or if you do go to your job, your ability to function may be impaired.\n\n【28】Prevention\n----------\n\n【29】In addition to regular exercise, techniques such as biofeedback training and relaxation therapy can help reduce stress.\n\n【30】*   **Biofeedback training.** This technique teaches you to control certain body responses that help reduce pain. During a biofeedback session, you're connected to devices that monitor and give you feedback on body functions such as muscle tension, heart rate and blood pressure. You then learn how to reduce muscle tension and slow your heart rate and breathing yourself.\n*   **Cognitive behavioral therapy.** This type of talk therapy may help you learn to manage stress and may help reduce the frequency and severity of your headaches.\n*   **Other relaxation techniques.** Anything that helps you relax, including deep breathing, yoga, meditation and progressive muscle relaxation, may help your headaches. You can learn relaxation techniques in classes or at home using books, videos or apps.\n\n【31】Using medications in conjunction with stress management techniques may be more effective than either treatment alone in reducing your tension-type headaches.\n\n【32】Additionally, living a healthy lifestyle may help prevent headaches:\n\n【33】*   Get enough, but not too much, sleep.\n*   Don't smoke.\n*   Exercise regularly.\n*   Eat regular, balanced meals.\n*   Drink plenty of water.\n*   Limit alcohol, caffeine and sugar.\n\n【34】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Regenerative approaches have recently attracted interest as an adjuvant to current standard of care. Adipose tissue–derived (AD) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a readily accessible cell source with high proliferative capacity. The CELLTOP study, an ongoing multidisciplinary phase 1 clinical trial conducted at Mayo Clinic ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03308565), is investigating the safety and efficacy of intrathecal autologous AD-MSCs in patients with blunt, traumatic SCI. In this initial report, we describe the outcome of the first treated patient, a 53-year-old survivor of a surfing accident who sustained a high cervical American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grade A SCI with subsequent neurologic improvement that plateaued within 6 months following injury. Although he improved to an American Spinal Injury Association grade C impairement classification, the individual continued to be wheelchair bound and severely debilitated. After study enrollment, an adipose tissue biopsy was performed and MSCs were isolated, expanded, and cryopreserved. Per protocol, the patient received an intrathecal injection of 100 million autologous AD-MSCs infused after a standard lumbar puncture at the L3-4 level 11 months after the injury. The patient tolerated the procedure well and did not experience any severe adverse events. Clinical signs of efficacy were observed at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months following the injection in both motor and sensory scores based on International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury. Thus, in this treated individual with SCI, intrathecal administration of AD-MSCs was feasible and safe and suggested meaningful signs of improved, rather than stabilized, neurologic status warranting further clinical evaluation.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AD ( adipose tissue–derived ), ASIA ( American Spinal Injury Association ), MSC ( mesenchymal stem cell ), SCI ( spinal cord injury )\n\n【4】More than 17,000 people in the United States sustain a spinal cord injury (SCI) each year with over 291,000 affected, translating into major personal and overall socioeconomic burden.\n\n【5】删除3:<u>National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center.

Neurologic examination at the time of the accident revealed complete loss of motor and sensory function below the level of injury along with loss of bowel and bladder sensation. Accordingly, the individual was diagnosed with an American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade A SCI, and underwent a C2-6 posterior cervical decompression and fusion. Postoperatively, improvement in motor and sensory function and bowel and bladder sensation were demonstrable. However, 6 months after the injury, gains in neurologic function plateaued, and he did not experience additional amelioration.\n\n【60】Following informed consent, the patient was enrolled into the multidisciplinary CELLTOP clinical trial 9 months after the injury . At the time of enrollment, his neurologic status was found to be ASIA grade C. Imaging revealed bilateral myelomalacia at the C3 level as well as the C2-6 decompression and fusion.\n\n【61】An open biopsy of abdominal wall adipose tissue was performed 8 weeks before the injection. Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from the adipose tissue biopsy specimen and were expanded and cryopreserved internally in the Mayo Clinic Immune, Progenitor, and Cell Therapeutics Laboratory. Per protocol, the patient received an intrathecal injection of 100 million AD-MSCs suspended in lactated Ringer solution and infused after a standard lumbar puncture at the L3-4 level, 11 months after the injury and 5 months after plateau of improvement. His neurologic status was assessed according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury at the baseline visit, at days 2 and 3, and weeks 1, 2, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72. The Capabilities of Upper Extremity questionnaire and Global Health Score questionnaire were also administered at the same time points.\n\n【62】Results\n-------\n\n【63】### Safety and Adverse Events\n\n【64】The patient tolerated the procedure well and did not experience any severe adverse events related to the injection. He reported a mild to moderate headache on day 2, which resolved with acetaminophen. Throughout the 18-month follow-up, no other safety issues or adverse events were reported.\n\n【65】### ASIA Motor Score\n\n【66】The total upper extremity motor score progressively improved from 35 at baseline to 44 at 18 months, with more marked improvement on the right (19 at baseline to 25 at 18 months) compared with the left side (16 at baseline to 19 at 18 months) 删除4:<u>( Figure 1 A and Table 1 )</u>.

One of the more challenging aspects of this life altering pathophysiology is the onset of secondary mechanisms of tissue insult in the subacute and chronic phase following the primary injury. Glial scarring limits axonal regeneration as a complex physicochemical barrier by secreting growth inhibitor molecules. These microenvironmental changes cause the chronically injured spinal cord to be in a refractory state.\n\n【91】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lis A.\n*   Szarek D.\n*   Laska J.</u>\n\n【92】Biomaterials engineering strategies for spinal cord regeneration: state of the art \\[in Polish\\].\n\n【93】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Polim Med._ 2013; 43 : 59-80</u></u>\n\n【94】无关删除-2:<u>*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【95】In addition to bridging the tissue gap that prevents regeneration in such a state, creating a permissive restorative environment also poses an important challenge.

Although a number of disorders may result in hyperthyroidism, Graves' disease is a common cause.\n\n【2】Thyroid hormones affect many body systems, so signs and symptoms of Graves' disease can be wide ranging. Although Graves' disease may affect anyone, it's more common among women and in people younger than age 40.\n\n【3】The primary treatment goals are to reduce the amount of thyroid hormones that the body produces and lessen the severity of symptoms.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Common signs and symptoms of Graves' disease include:\n\n【6】*   Anxiety and irritability\n*   A fine tremor of the hands or fingers\n*   Heat sensitivity and an increase in perspiration or warm, moist skin\n*   Weight loss, despite normal eating habits\n*   Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter)\n*   Change in menstrual cycles\n*   Erectile dysfunction or reduced libido\n*   Frequent bowel movements\n*   Bulging eyes (Graves' ophthalmopathy)\n*   Fatigue\n*   Thick, red skin usually on the shins or tops of the feet (Graves' dermopathy)\n*   Rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)\n*   Sleep disturbance\n\n【7】### Graves' ophthalmopathy\n\n【8】About 30% of people with Graves' disease show some signs and symptoms of Graves' ophthalmopathy. In Graves' ophthalmopathy, inflammation and other immune system events affect muscles and other tissues around your eyes. Signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【9】*   Bulging eyes\n*   Gritty sensation in the eyes\n*   Pressure or pain in the eyes\n*   Puffy or retracted eyelids\n*   Reddened or inflamed eyes\n*   Light sensitivity\n*   Double vision\n*   Vision loss\n\n【10】### Graves' dermopathy\n\n【11】An uncommon manifestation of Graves' disease, called Graves' dermopathy, is the reddening and thickening of the skin, most often on your shins or the tops of your feet.\n\n【12】### When to see a doctor\n\n【13】A number of medical conditions can cause the signs and symptoms associated with Graves' disease. See your doctor if you experience any potential problems related to Graves' disease to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis.\n\n【14】Seek emergency care if you're experiencing heart-related signs and symptoms, such as a rapid or irregular heartbeat, or if you develop vision loss.\n\n【15】Causes\n------\n\n【16】Graves' disease is caused by a malfunction in the body's disease-fighting immune system. It's unknown why this happens.\n\n【17】The immune system normally produces antibodies designed to target a specific virus, bacterium or other foreign substance. In Graves' disease — for reasons that aren't well understood — the immune system produces an antibody to one part of the cells in the hormone-producing gland in the neck (thyroid gland).\n\n【18】Normally, thyroid function is regulated by a hormone released by a tiny gland at the base of the brain (pituitary gland). The antibody associated with Graves' disease — thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) — acts like the regulatory pituitary hormone. That means that TRAb overrides the normal regulation of the thyroid, causing an overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism).\n\n【19】### Cause of Graves' ophthalmopathy\n\n【20】Graves' ophthalmopathy results from a buildup of certain carbohydrates in the muscles and tissues behind the eyes — the cause of which also isn't known. It appears that the same antibody that can cause thyroid dysfunction may also have an \"attraction\" to tissues surrounding the eyes.\n\n【21】Graves' ophthalmopathy often appears at the same time as hyperthyroidism or several months later. But signs and symptoms of ophthalmopathy may appear years before or after the onset of hyperthyroidism. Graves' ophthalmopathy can also occur even if there's no hyperthyroidism.\n\n【22】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【23】Although anyone can develop Graves' disease, many factors can increase the risk of disease, including:\n\n【24】*   **Family history.** Because a family history of Graves' disease is a known risk factor, there is likely a gene or genes that can make a person more susceptible to the disorder.\n*   **Sex.** Women are much more likely to develop Graves' disease than are men.\n*   **Age.** Graves' disease usually develops in people before age 40.\n*   **Other autoimmune disorders.** People with other disorders of the immune system, such as type 1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis, have an increased risk.\n*   **Emotional or physical stress.** Stressful life events or illness may act as a trigger for the onset of Graves' disease among people who have genes that increase their risk.\n*   **Pregnancy.** Pregnancy or recent childbirth may increase the risk of the disorder, particularly among women who have genes that increase their risk.\n*   **Smoking.** Cigarette smoking, which can affect the immune system, increases the risk of Graves' disease. Smokers who have Graves' disease are also at increased risk of developing Graves' ophthalmopathy.\n\n【25】Complications\n-------------\n\n【26】Complications of Graves' disease can include:\n\n【27】*   **Pregnancy issues.** Possible complications of Graves' disease during pregnancy include miscarriage, preterm birth, fetal thyroid dysfunction, poor fetal growth, maternal heart failure and preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a maternal condition that results in high blood pressure and other serious signs and symptoms.\n*   **Heart disorders.** If left untreated, Graves' disease can lead to heart rhythm disorders, changes in the structure and function of the heart muscles, and the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to the body (heart failure).\n*   **Thyroid storm.** A rare but life-threatening complication of Graves' disease is thyroid storm, also known as accelerated hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxic crisis. It's more likely when severe hyperthyroidism is untreated or treated inadequately.\n\n【28】    The sudden and drastic increase in thyroid hormones can produce many effects, including fever, sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, delirium, severe weakness, seizures, irregular heartbeat, yellow skin and eyes (jaundice), severe low blood pressure, and coma. Thyroid storm requires immediate emergency care.\n\n【29】*   **Brittle bones.** Untreated hyperthyroidism also can lead to weak, brittle bones (osteoporosis). The strength of your bones depends, in part, on the amount of calcium and other minerals they contain. Too much thyroid hormone interferes with your body's ability to incorporate calcium into your bones.\n\n【30】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Choledocholithiasis was initially suspected in 61 patients and rated before ERCP and MRCP as being of low, intermediate, or high probability based on clinical, laboratory, and/or imaging findings (Cotton criteria).\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】The sensitivity of choledocholithiasis diagnosis was 91%, with a global efficacy of 90%. The level of duct stone obstruction was visualized in all patients. Suprastenotic dilatation also showed a good correlation to ERCP. Choledocholithiasis was found in 32 patients (65%) and 3 patients (33%) in the high- and intermediate- probability groups, respectively. None of the low-probability patients had choledocholithiasis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed for only a diagnostic (not therapeutic) purpose in 3 patients (6%) and 2 patients (22%) of the high- and intermediate- probability cases, respectively.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography seems to be effective in diagnosing choledocholithiasis. It plays a fundamental role in patients with a low or intermediate risk of choledocholithiasis, contributing to the avoidance of purely diagnostic ERCP.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】CT ( computed tomography ), ERCP ( endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ), HASTE ( half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo ), MRCP ( magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography )\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

In childhood, extended absences from school, cyanosis, scars, and sports restrictions hindered friendships and conflicted with a sense of “normalcy”; teasing and low self-esteem were more notable in boys; girls more readily hid behind makeup, nail polish, and clothing. In adulthood most were concerned about shortened life expectancy, disability, and childbearing and child rearing. Virtually all were highly committed to both school and work performance. All but those with complete, uncomplicated early repair expressed unresolved frustration, anger, and fears of a future that might include further medical complications.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】Listening to this selected group of patients offers insight that may be helpful to the clinical care of patients with CHD and other patients with lifelong disease.\n\n【8】CHD ( congenital heart disease, DSM-III-R and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Revised Third Edition )\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "6d2710cd-da6c-4fff-b740-b1bbf38a94cf", "title": "Viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu)", "text": "【0】Viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu)\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】Viral gastroenteritis is an intestinal infection that includes signs and symptoms such as watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea or vomiting, and sometimes fever.\n\n【2】The most common way to develop viral gastroenteritis — often called stomach flu — is through contact with an infected person or by consuming contaminated food or water. If you're otherwise healthy, you'll likely recover without complications. But for infants, older adults and people with compromised immune systems, viral gastroenteritis can be deadly.\n\n【3】There's no effective treatment for viral gastroenteritis, so prevention is key. Avoid food and water that may be contaminated and wash your hands thoroughly and often.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Although it's commonly called stomach flu, gastroenteritis isn't the same as influenza. The flu (influenza) affects only your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs. Gastroenteritis, on the other hand, attacks your intestines, causing signs and symptoms such as:\n\n【6】*   Watery, usually nonbloody diarrhea — bloody diarrhea usually means you have a different, more severe infection\n*   Nausea, vomiting or both\n*   Stomach cramps and pain\n*   Occasional muscle aches or headache\n*   Low-grade fever\n\n【7】Depending on the cause, viral gastroenteritis symptoms may appear within 1-3 days after you're infected and can range from mild to severe. Symptoms usually last just a day or two, but occasionally they may last up to 14 days.\n\n【8】Because the symptoms are similar, it's easy to confuse viral diarrhea with diarrhea caused by bacteria, such as Clostridioides difficile, salmonella and Escherichia coli, or parasites, such as giardia.\n\n【9】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【10】If you're an adult, call your health care provider if:\n\n【11】*   You're not able to keep liquids down for 24 hours\n*   You've been vomiting or having diarrhea for more than two days\n*   You're vomiting blood\n*   You're dehydrated — signs of dehydration include excessive thirst, dry mouth, deep yellow urine or little or no urine, and severe weakness, dizziness or lightheadedness\n*   You notice blood in your bowel movements\n*   You have severe stomach pain\n*   You have a fever above 104 F (40 C)\n\n【12】### For infants and children\n\n【13】See your child's health care provider right away if your child:\n\n【14】*   Has a fever of 102 F (38.9 C) or higher\n*   Seems tired or very irritable\n*   Is in a lot of discomfort or pain\n*   Has bloody diarrhea\n*   Seems dehydrated — watch for signs of dehydration in sick infants and children by comparing how much they drink and urinate with how much is normal for them, and watching for signs such as a dry mouth, thirst and crying without tears\n\n【15】If you have an infant, remember that while spitting up may be an everyday occurrence for your baby, vomiting is not. Babies vomit for a variety of reasons, many of which may require medical attention.\n\n【16】Call your baby's doctor right away if your baby:\n\n【17】*   Has vomiting that is frequent\n*   Hasn't had a wet diaper in six hours\n*   Has bloody stools or severe diarrhea\n*   Has a sunken soft spot (fontanel) on the top of his or her head\n*   Has a dry mouth or cries without tears\n*   Is unusually sleepy, drowsy or unresponsive\n\n【18】Causes\n------\n\n【19】You're most likely to get viral gastroenteritis when you eat or drink contaminated food or water. You may also be likely to get gastroenteritis if you share utensils, towels or food with someone who has one of the viruses that cause the condition.\n\n【20】Many viruses can cause gastroenteritis, including:\n\n【21】*   **Noroviruses.** Both children and adults are affected by noroviruses, the most common cause of foodborne illness worldwide. Norovirus infection can sweep through families and communities. It's especially likely to spread among people in confined spaces.\n\n【22】    In most cases, you pick up the virus from contaminated food or water. But it can also spread between people who are in close contact or who share food. You can also get the virus by touching a surface that's been contaminated with norovirus and then touching your mouth.\n\n【23】*   **Rotavirus.** Worldwide, this is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children, who are usually infected when they put their fingers or other objects contaminated with the virus into their mouths. It can also spread through contaminated food. The infection is most severe in infants and young children.\n\n【24】    Adults infected with rotavirus may not have symptoms, but can still spread the illness. This is of particular concern in institutional settings such as nursing homes because adults with the virus unknowingly can pass the virus to others. A vaccine against viral gastroenteritis is available in some countries, including the United States, and appears to be effective in preventing the infection.\n\n【25】Some shellfish, especially raw or undercooked oysters, also can make you sick. Contaminated drinking water is a cause of viral diarrhea. But in many cases the virus is passed when someone with a virus handles food you eat without washing his or her hands after using the toilet.\n\n【26】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【27】Gastroenteritis occurs all over the world and can affect people of all ages.\n\n【28】People who may be more susceptible to gastroenteritis include:\n\n【29】*   **Young children.** Children in child care centers or elementary schools may be especially vulnerable because it takes time for a child's immune system to mature.\n*   **Older adults.** Adult immune systems tend to become less efficient later in life. Older adults in nursing homes are vulnerable because their immune systems weaken. They also live in close contact with others who may pass along germs.\n*   **Schoolchildren or dormitory residents.** Anywhere that groups of people come together in close quarters can be an environment for an intestinal infection to get passed.\n*   **Anyone with a weakened immune system.** If your resistance to infection is low — for instance, if your immune system is compromised by HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy or another medical condition — you may be especially at risk.\n\n【30】Each gastrointestinal virus has a season when it's most active. If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, for instance, you're more likely to have rotavirus or norovirus infections in the winter and spring.\n\n【31】Complications\n-------------\n\n【32】The main complication of viral gastroenteritis is dehydration — a severe loss of water and essential salts and minerals. If you're healthy and drink enough to replace fluids you lose from vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration shouldn't be a problem.\n\n【33】Infants, older adults and people with weakened immune systems may become severely dehydrated when they lose more fluids than they can replace. Hospitalization might be needed so that lost fluids can be replaced through an IV in their arms. Dehydration can rarely lead to death.\n\n【34】Prevention\n----------\n\n【35】The best way to prevent the spread of intestinal infections is to follow these precautions:\n\n【36】*   **Get your child vaccinated.** A vaccine against gastroenteritis caused by the rotavirus is available in some countries, including the United States. Given to children in the first year of life, the vaccine appears to be effective in preventing severe symptoms of this illness.\n*   **Wash your hands thoroughly.** And make sure your children do, too. If your children are older, teach them to wash their hands, especially after using the toilet.\n\n【37】    Wash your hands after changing diapers and before preparing or eating food, too. It's best to use warm water and soap and to rub hands well for at least 20 seconds. Wash around cuticles, beneath fingernails and in the creases of the hands. Then rinse thoroughly. Carry sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizer for times when soap and water aren't available.\n\n【38】*   **Use separate personal items around your home.** Avoid sharing eating utensils, drinking glasses and plates. Use separate towels in the bathroom.\n*   **Prepare food safely.** Wash all your fruits and vegetables before eating them. Clean kitchen surfaces before preparing food on them. Avoid preparing food if you're sick.\n*   **Keep your distance.** Avoid close contact with anyone who has the virus, if possible.\n*   **Disinfect hard surfaces.** If someone in your home has viral gastroenteritis, disinfect hard surfaces, such as counters, faucets and doorknobs, with a mixture of 5-25 tablespoons (73 to 369 milliliters) of household bleach to 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water.\n*   **Avoid touching laundry that may have been exposed to a virus.** If someone in your home has viral gastroenteritis, wear gloves while touching laundry. Wash clothing and bedding in hot water and dry them on the hottest setting. Wash your hands well after touching laundry.\n*   **Check out your child care center.** Make sure the center has separate rooms for changing diapers and preparing or serving food. The room with the diaper-changing table should have a sink as well as a sanitary way to dispose of diapers.\n\n【39】### Take precautions when traveling\n\n【40】When you're traveling in other countries, you can become sick from contaminated food or water. You may be able to reduce your risk by following these tips:\n\n【41】*   Drink only well-sealed bottled or carbonated water.\n*   Avoid ice cubes because they may be made from contaminated water.\n*   Use bottled water to brush your teeth.\n*   Avoid raw food — including peeled fruits, raw vegetables and salads — that has been touched by human hands.\n*   Avoid undercooked meat and fish.\n\n【42】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Afrezza\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Insulin human inhaled is a man-made insulin that is breathed in through your lungs and is used to control high blood sugar in patients with diabetes. Insulin is one of many hormones that help the body turn the food we eat into energy. This is done by using the glucose (sugar) in the blood as quick energy. Also, insulin helps us store energy that we can use later. When you have diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes), your body cannot make enough insulin or does not use insulin properly. So, you must take additional insulin to regulate your blood sugar and keep your body healthy. This is very important as too much sugar in the blood can be harmful to your health.\n\n【6】Insulin human starts to work faster than some other types of insulin, and its effects do not last as long. It should act more like the insulin your body would normally produce. Because the effects of insulin human are short-acting, your doctor may also prescribe a longer-acting insulin for you to use.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Aerosol Powder\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【28】Using this medicine with any of the following is usually not recommended, but may be unavoidable in some cases. If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use this medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】*   Ethanol\n\n【30】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【31】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【32】*   Asthma, severe or\n*   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【33】*   Emotional disturbances or\n*   Fever or\n*   Illness or\n*   Infection or\n*   Stress—These conditions increase blood sugar and may increase the amount of insulin you need.\n\n【34】*   Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)—Should not be used in patients with this condition. If you have low blood sugar and take insulin, your blood sugar may reach dangerously low levels.\n\n【35】*   Hypokalemia (low potassium in the blood)—May make this condition worse and increase your chance of having serious side effects.\n\n【36】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—The effects of insulin human inhaled may be increased because of the slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【37】*   Lung cancer, active or history of or at risk or\n*   Lung disease—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【38】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【39】Inhaled insulin human is used with Afrezza® inhaler that comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using this medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.\n\n【40】Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using this medicine without telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.\n\n【41】This medicine is available in 3 strengths: 4 unit (blue cartridge), 8 unit (green cartridge), and 12-unit (yellow cartridge) single use cartridges.\n\n【42】Afrezza® is a mealtime insulin. It should be taken at the beginning of a meal.\n\n【43】Follow carefully the special meal plan your doctor gave you. This is the most important part of controlling your condition, and is necessary if the medicine is to work properly. Also, exercise regularly and test for sugar in your blood or urine as directed.\n\n【44】In order for this medicine to help treat diabetes, it must be used every day in regularly spaced doses and be used at the same time each day, as ordered by your doctor.\n\n【45】To use the inhaler:\n\n【46】*   Use the dosage chart to determine the least number of cartridges you can use for your dose.\n*   Remove a blister card from the foil package.

Remove the right number of cartridges for your dose.\n*   Allow the cartridge to be at room temperature for 10 minutes before use.\n*   Use only 1 inhaler at a time. The same inhaler should be used for the 4 unit, 8 unit, or 12 unit cartridges.\n*   Hold the inhaler in one hand with the white mouthpiece on the top and the purple base on the bottom.\n*   Open the inhaler and place the cartridge into the inhaler. Make sure that the cartridge lies flat in the inhaler.\n*   Keep the inhaler level and white mouthpiece on top and purple base on the bottom after a cartridge has been inserted into the inhaler. Do not turn the inhaler upside down, held with the mouthpiece pointing down, shaken or dropped after the cartridge has been inserted. If these occur, throw away the cartridge and load a new one.\n*   Remove the mouthpiece cover and then breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible.\n*   Put the mouthpiece fully into your mouth and close your lips around it. Tilt the inhaler downward while keeping your head level.\n*   Inhale deeply through the inhaler and hold your breath for as long as comfortable and slowly remove the inhaler from your mouth.\n*   Replace the mouthpiece cover and remove and throw away the used cartridge.\n*   If your prescribed dose is more than 8 units, you will need to use more than 1 cartridge and repeat the same steps above.\n*   Wipe the inhaler with a clean, dry cloth. Do not wash the inhaler and keep it dry.\n*   Do not put cartridges in your mouth and do not swallow cartridges.\n*   Throw away the inhaler after 15 days and get a new one.\n\n【47】### Dosing\n\n【48】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【49】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【50】*   For inhalation dosage form (aerosol powder):\n    *   For diabetes:\n        *   Adults—\n            *   Patients who are not receiving insulin: At first, 4 units (one puff) at each meal. Your doctor may adjust your dose as needed.\n            *   Patients receiving mealtime (prandial) insulin injection: Your mealtime dose is determined by converting your injected dose to the number of 4, 8, or 12 unit cartridges needed. Your doctor may adjust your dose as needed.\n            *   Patients receiving pre-mixed insulin injection: Your mealtime dose is determined by dividing half of the total daily injected pre-mixed insulin dose equally among the 3 meals of the day. Your doctor may adjust your dose as needed.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【51】### Missed Dose\n\n【52】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【53】### Storage\n\n【54】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【55】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【56】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【57】Store sealed and unopened foil package in the refrigerator. Do not freeze.

The opened strips are stored at room temperature and must be used within 3 days. Do not put a blister card or strip back into the refrigerator after being stored at room temperature.\n\n【59】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【60】Your doctor will want to check your progress at regular visits, especially during the first few weeks you take this medicine. Blood and lung function tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【61】It is very important to follow carefully any instructions from your health care team about:\n\n【62】*   Alcohol—Drinking alcohol (including beer and wine) may cause severe low blood sugar. Discuss this with your health care team.\n*   Other medicines—Do not take other medicines during the time you are taking this medicine unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription medicines such as aspirin, and medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems.\n*   Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, patients with diabetes may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur in patients with diabetes during pregnancy.\n*   Travel—Keep a recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.\n\n【63】In case of emergency—There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to:\n\n【64】*   Wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says that you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.\n*   Keep an extra supply of insulin on hand in case high blood sugar occurs.\n*   Keep some kind of quick-acting sugar handy to treat low blood sugar.\n*   Have a glucagon kit and a syringe and needle available in case severe low blood sugar occurs. Check and replace any expired kits regularly.\n\n【65】Tell your doctor if you are smoking or have recently stopped smoking while using this medicine.\n\n【66】Too much insulin human inhaled can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Symptoms of low blood sugar include anxiety, behavior change similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, depression, difficulty in thinking, dizziness or lightheadedness, drowsiness, excessive hunger, fast heartbeat, headache, irritability or abnormal behavior, nervousness, nightmares, restless sleep, shakiness, slurred speech, and tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue.\n\n【67】If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel to relieve the symptoms. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Get to a doctor or a hospital right away if the symptoms do not improve. Someone should call for emergency help immediately if severe symptoms such as convulsions (seizures) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe and needle, and know how to use it. Members of your household also should know how to use it.\n\n【68】Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your antidiabetic medicine, overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual.\n\n【69】Symptoms of high blood sugar include blurred vision, drowsiness, dry mouth, flushed, dry skin, fruit-like breath odor, increased urination, ketones in the urine, loss of appetite, stomachache, nausea, or vomiting, tiredness, troubled breathing (rapid and deep), unconsciousness, or unusual thirst.\n\n【70】If symptoms of high blood sugar occur, check your blood sugar level and then call your doctor for instructions.\n\n【71】This medicine may make you dizzy or drowsy. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\n【72】Check with your doctor right away if you have a cough that keeps coming back or does not go away, shortness of breath, or trouble breathing.\n\n【73】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, swelling of the face, tongue, and throat, trouble breathing, or chest pain after you receive the medicine.\n\n【74】Using this medicine together with other diabetes medicine (such as pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, Actos®, Actoplus Met®, Avandia®) may cause serious heart problem or edema (fluid retention). Check with your doctor immediately if you are rapidly gaining weight, having shortness of breath, chest pain or discomfort, extreme tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, uneven heartbeat, or excessive swelling of the hands, wrist, ankles, or feet.\n\n【75】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【76】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【77】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【78】#### More common\n\n【79】1.  Anxiety\n2.  blurred vision\n3.  chills\n4.  cold sweats\n5.  coma\n6.  confusion\n7.  cool, pale skin\n8.  cough\n9.  depression\n10.  dizziness\n11.  fast heartbeat\n12.  headache\n13.  increased hunger\n14.  nausea\n15.  nightmares\n16.  seizures\n17.  shakiness\n18.  slurred speech\n19.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n\n【80】#### Incidence not known\n\n【81】1.  Difficulty breathing\n2.  difficulty swallowing\n3.  hives, itching, or skin rash\n4.  noisy breathing\n5.  puffiness or swelling of the eyelids or around the eyes, face, lips, or tongue\n6.  tightness in the chest\n\n【82】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention.

Among these, we also identified those that were procedure-related (associated with liver transplantation, hepatic resection, radiofrequency ablation, or transarterial chemoembolization). Multivariate regression was performed to identify the contribution of race to therapeutic interventions and outcomes.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 22,933 HCC-related hospitalizations were included, of which 10,285 were procedure related (45%). Blacks had a smaller proportion (35%) of procedure-related HCC hospitalizations than did whites (46%) (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49-0.86). Specifically, blacks had lower odds of liver transplantation (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.26-0.71), hepatic resection (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33-0.98), and ablation (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29-0.74) ( _P_ \\=.002) than did whites. Overall, 10.9% of HCC-related admissions resulted in death in blacks as compared with 6.4% in whites (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.12-2.24).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Among patients admitted for HCC-related hospitalizations, blacks were less likely to receive liver transplantation, hepatic resection, and ablation than whites and had higher inhospital mortality. Identifying racial disparities in health care is a necessary first step to appropriately address and eliminate them.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】HCC ( hepatocellular carcinoma ), ICD-9-CM ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ), NIS ( Nationwide Inpatient Sample ), OR ( odds ratio ), SEER ( Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ), TACE ( transarterial chemoembolization )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

All-cause mortality was the primary outcome. Patients were followed up until their last clinical visit as an Olmsted County resident, December 31, 2014, or death. Multivariate analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, month of measurement, and Charlson comorbidity index score.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 11,022 individuals had a 25(OH)D measurement between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2011, with a mean ± SD value of 30.0±12.9 ng/mL. Mean age was 54.3±17.2 years, and most were female (77.1%) and white (87.6%). There were 723 deaths after a median follow-up of 4.8 years (interquartile range, 3.4-6.2 years). Unadjusted all-cause mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for 25(OH)D values of less than 12, 12 to 19, and more than 50 ng/mL were 2.6 (95% CI, 2.0-3.2), 1.3 (95% CI, 1.0-1.6), and 1.0 (95% CI, 0.72-1.5), respectively, compared with the reference value of 20 to 50 ng/mL. In a multivariate model, the interaction between the effect of 25(OH)D and race/ethnicity on mortality was significant ( _P_ <.001). In white patients, adjusted HRs for 25(OH)D values of less than 12, 12 to 19, 20 to 50, and greater than 50 ng/mL were 2.5 (95% CI, 2.2-2.9), 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2-1.6), 1.0 (referent), and 1.0 (95% CI, 0.81-1.3), respectively. In patients of other race/ethnicity, adjusted HRs were 1.9 (95% CI, 1.5-2.3), 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1-2.6), 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0-2.0), and 2.1 (95% CI, 0.77-5.5).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】White patients with 25(OH)D values of less than 20 ng/mL had greater all-cause mortality than those with values of 20 to 50 ng/mL, and white patients had greater mortality associated with low 25(OH)D values than patients of other race/ethnicity.

Genetic testing can help determine which family members have the disorder and require sur-veillance endoscopy. Astute physicians may detect unsuspected FAP in patients with extraintestinal manifestations such as hard or soft cutaneous tumors. Colectomy will prevent cancer but is often necessary before the patient is 20 years old. Postoperative lifelong surveillance is indicated to screen for associated duodenal, thyroid, and rectal or ileal neoplasms. Attenuated FAP variants are less typical and may be confused with other types of familial colorectal neoplasia. Chemoprevention, regression, and other treatment strategies are being developed to improve the management of extracolonic neoplasms and desmoid tumors. A better understanding of the natural history of these FAP-associated AP-associated phenomena will facilitate the rational selection of interventions.

{"seq_id": "651dd63d-6637-4234-a62a-e996a2830305", "title": "Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) — or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) — are generally acquired by sexual contact. The bacteria, viruses or parasites that cause sexually transmitted diseases may pass from person to person in blood, semen, or vaginal and other bodily fluids.\n\n【2】Sometimes these infections can be transmitted nonsexually, such as from mothers to their infants during pregnancy or childbirth, or through blood transfusions or shared needles.\n\n【3】STIs don't always cause symptoms. It's possible to contract sexually transmitted infections from people who seem perfectly healthy and may not even know they have an infection.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】STDs or STIs can have a range of signs and symptoms, including no symptoms. That's why they may go unnoticed until complications occur or a partner is diagnosed.\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms that might indicate an STI include:\n\n【7】*   Sores or bumps on the genitals or in the oral or rectal area\n*   Painful or burning urination\n*   Discharge from the penis\n*   Unusual or odorous vaginal discharge\n*   Unusual vaginal bleeding\n*   Pain during sex\n*   Sore, swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the groin but sometimes more widespread\n*   Lower abdominal pain\n*   Fever\n*   Rash over the trunk, hands or feet\n\n【8】Signs and symptoms may appear a few days after exposure. However, it may take years before you have any noticeable problems, depending on the organism causing the STI.\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】See a doctor immediately if:\n\n【11】无关删除-2:<u>*   You are sexually active and may have been exposed to an STI\n*   You have signs and symptoms of an STI</u>\n\n【12】Make an appointment with a doctor:\n\n【13】*   When you're considering becoming sexually active or when you're 21 — whichever comes first\n*   Before you start having sex with a new partner\n\n【14】Causes\n------\n\n【15】STDs or STIs can be caused by:\n\n【16】*   **Bacteria.** Gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia are examples of STIs that are caused by bacteria.\n*   **Parasites.** Trichomoniasis is an STI caused by a parasite.\n*   **Viruses.** STIs caused by viruses include HPV, genital herpes and HIV.\n\n【17】Other kinds of infections — hepatitis A, B and C viruses, shigella infection and giardia infection — can be spread through sexual activity, but it's possible to be infected without sexual contact.\n\n【18】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【19】Anyone who is sexually active risks some degree of exposure to an STD or STI. Factors that may increase that risk include:\n\n【20】无关删除-2:<u>*   **Having unprotected sex.** Vaginal or anal penetration by an infected partner who isn't wearing a latex condom significantly increases the risk of getting an STI. Improper or inconsistent use of condoms can also increase risk.\n\n【21】    Oral sex may be less risky, but infections can still be transmitted without a latex condom or a dental dam — a thin, square piece of rubber made with latex or silicone.\n\n【22】*   **Having sexual contact with multiple partners.** The more people you have sexual contact with, the greater your risk.\n*   **Having a history of STIs.** Having one STI makes it much easier for another STI to take hold.\n*   **Being forced to engage in sexual activity.** Dealing with rape or assault is difficult, but it's important to see a doctor as soon as possible to receive screening, treatment and emotional support.\n*   **Misuse of alcohol or use of recreational drugs.** Substance misuse can inhibit your judgment, making you more willing to participate in risky behaviors.\n*   **Injecting drugs.** Needle sharing spreads many serious infections, including HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.\n*   **Being young.** Half the new STIs occur in people between the ages of 15 and 24.</u>\n\n【23】### Transmission from mothers to infants\n\n【24】Certain STIs — such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV and syphilis — can be passed from mothers to their infants during pregnancy or delivery. STIs in infants can cause serious problems or even death. All pregnant women should be screened for these infections and treated.\n\n【25】Complications\n-------------\n\n【26】Because many people in the early stages of an STD or STI experience no symptoms, screening for STIs is important to prevent complications.\n\n【27】Possible complications include:\n\n【28】*   Pelvic pain\n*   Pregnancy complications\n*   Eye inflammation\n*   Arthritis\n*   Pelvic inflammatory disease\n*   Infertility\n*   Heart disease\n*   Certain cancers, such as HPV\\-associated cervical and rectal cancers\n\n【29】Prevention\n----------\n\n【30】There are several ways to avoid or reduce your risk of STDs or STIs.\n\n【31】无关删除-2:<u>*   **Abstain.** The most effective way to avoid STIs is to not have (abstain from) sex.\n*   **Stay with one uninfected partner.** Another reliable way of avoiding STIs is to stay in a long-term relationship in which both people have sex only with each other and neither partner is infected.\n*   **Wait and test.** Avoid vaginal and anal intercourse with new partners until you have both been tested for STIs. Oral sex is less risky, but use a latex condom or dental dam to prevent skin-to-skin contact between the oral and genital mucous membranes.\n*   **Get vaccinated.** Getting vaccinated early, before sexual exposure, is also effective in preventing certain types of STIs. Vaccines are available to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis A and hepatitis B.\n\n【32】    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the HPV vaccine for girls and boys ages 11 and 12, although it can be given as early as age 9. If not fully vaccinated at ages 11 and 12, the CDC recommends getting the vaccine through age 26.\n\n【33】    The hepatitis B vaccine is usually given to newborns, and the hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for 1-year-olds. Both vaccines are recommended for people who aren't already immune to these diseases and for those who are at increased risk of infection, such as men who have sex with men and IV drug users.\n\n【34】*   **Use condoms and dental dams consistently and correctly.** Use a new latex condom or dental dam for each sex act, whether oral, vaginal or anal. Never use an oil-based lubricant, such as petroleum jelly, with a latex condom or dental dam.\n\n【35】    Condoms made from natural membranes are not recommended because they're not effective at preventing STIs. Also, keep in mind that while latex condoms reduce your risk of exposure to most STIs, they provide less protection for STIs involving exposed genital sores, such as HPV or herpes.\n\n【36】    Also, nonbarrier forms of contraception, such as birth control pills or intrauterine devices (IUDs), don't protect against STIs.\n\n【37】*   **Don't drink alcohol excessively or use drugs.** If you're under the influence, you're more likely to take sexual risks.\n*   **Communicate.** Before any serious sexual contact, communicate with your partner about practicing safer sex. Be sure you specifically agree on what activities will and won't be OK.\n*   **Consider male circumcision.** For men, there's evidence that circumcision can help reduce the risk of acquiring HIV from a woman with HIV by as much as 60%. Male circumcision may also help prevent transmission of genital HPV and genital herpes.\n*   **Consider using preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP).** The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of two combination drugs to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who are at very high risk. They're emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine plus tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy).\n\n【38】    Your doctor will prescribe these drugs for HIV prevention only if you don't already have HIV. You will need an HIV test before you start taking PrEP and then every three months as long as you're taking it.\n\n【39】    Your doctor will also test your kidney function before prescribing Truvada and continue to test it every six months. If you have hepatitis B, you should be evaluated by an infectious disease or liver specialist before beginning therapy.\n\n【40】    These drugs must be taken every day, exactly as prescribed. If you use Truvada daily, you can lower your risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% and from injection drug use by more than 74% percent, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Research suggests that Descovy is similarly effective in reducing the risk of getting HIV from sex. However, Descovy hasn't been studied in people who have receptive vaginal sex. Using additional prevention, such as condoms, can lower your risk even more and prevent other STIs.\n    </u>\n\n【41】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "2a910420-b32c-4475-b3a0-b4c98c8b32e8", "title": "Polio", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Polio is an illness caused by a virus that mainly affects nerves in the spinal cord or brain stem. In its most severe form, polio can lead to a person being unable to move certain limbs, also called paralysis. It can also lead to trouble breathing and sometimes death. The disease also is called poliomyelitis.\n\n【2】A vaccination effort throughout the world has led to only a small number of cases to occur around the world in recent years. But poliovirus still spreads within areas with low vaccination rates.\n\n【3】The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes travel notices of countries where there is a higher risk of polio. Countries at a higher risk of polio are generally in Africa, the Middle East, and southern and central Asia.\n\n【4】Vaccinated adults who plan to travel to an area where polio is spreading should get a booster dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Immunity after a booster lasts a lifetime.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Most people infected with the virus that causes polio, called poliovirus, don't get symptoms.\n\n【7】### Abortive polio\n\n【8】About 5% of people with the poliovirus get a mild version of the disease called abortive poliomyelitis. This leads to flu-like symptoms that last 2 to 3 days. These include:\n\n【9】*   Fever\n*   Headache\n*   Muscle aches\n*   Sore throat\n*   Stomachache\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n\n【10】### Nonparalytic polio\n\n【11】A more severe form of the disease, called nonparalytic polio, affects about 1% of those infected. While the illness lasts longer than a few days, it doesn't cause paralysis. Besides having more-severe flu-like symptoms, nonparalytic polio symptoms may include:\n\n【12】*   Neck pain or stiffness\n*   Aches or stiffness in the arms or legs\n*   Severe headache\n\n【13】A second phase of symptoms may follow, or a person may seem to be getting better for a few days before a second phase starts. These symptoms include:\n\n【14】*   Stiffness of the spine and neck\n*   Decreased reflexes\n*   Muscle weakness\n\n【15】### Paralytic polio\n\n【16】This most serious form of the disease is rare. The disease begins much like nonparalytic polio. But it progresses to more-severe signs and symptoms, including:\n\n【17】*   Intense pain\n*   Extreme sensitivity to touch\n*   Tingling or pricking sensations\n*   Muscles spasms or twitching\n*   Muscles weakness progressing to a limp paralysis\n\n【18】Any combination of limbs may experience paralysis. But paralysis of one leg is most common, followed by paralysis of one arm.\n\n【19】Depending on the severity of disease, other signs or symptoms may include:\n\n【20】*   Paralysis of muscles involved in breathing\n*   Difficulty swallowing\n\n【21】### Post-polio syndrome\n\n【22】Post-polio syndrome is the appearance of new signs or symptoms or the progression of problems. This usually happens decades after having polio. Common signs and symptoms include:\n\n【23】*   Progressive muscle or joint weakness and pain\n*   Fatigue\n*   Muscle wasting\n*   Breathing or swallowing problems\n*   Sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea\n*   Lowered tolerance of cold temperatures\n\n【24】### When to see a doctor\n\n【25】Signs and symptoms of polio are similar to other viral diseases that affect the nervous system. It's important to get a timely and accurate diagnosis.\n\n【26】If you had polio before, see your health care provider if you have new or worse signs or symptoms.\n\n【27】Causes\n------\n\n【28】Polio is caused by the poliovirus. It mainly targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain stem that control muscle movement. Nerve cells controlling sensation are generally not affected.\n\n【29】The naturally-occurring poliovirus, called the wild-type poliovirus, has been eliminated in most countries and causes few cases of polio. Another version of the virus, called the vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), is more widespread and now causes most infections worldwide. VDPV exists mainly in a few countries that use an oral vaccine with a weakened poliovirus.\n\n【30】The weakened virus in the oral vaccine doesn't itself cause polio, and vaccinated people rarely contract VDPV. Instead, VDPV is a new version of the virus that develops within a community or region where not enough people are vaccinated.\n\n【31】Even though the weakened virus in the oral vaccine doesn't cause illness, it can spread. If most people in a community are vaccinated, the spread of the weakened virus is controlled. If many people aren't vaccinated, the weakened virus can move through a community for a long time. This gives the virus the chance to change, or mutate, and behave like the wild-type virus that causes illness.\n\n【32】Infections from VDPV have been reported in the United States. In each case, the person was either not vaccinated or had a significantly weakened immune system. One case in New York in 2022 was in a county with a lower-than-average polio vaccination rate. Samples from wastewater showed that VDPV was spreading in some communities.\n\n【33】Since 2000, polio vaccination in the United States has used an injected vaccine with an inactivated poliovirus that doesn't create the risk for VDPV.\n\n【34】### How polio spreads\n\n【35】People carrying the poliovirus — even people who don't get sick — can pass along the virus in feces, also called stool, or droplets from sneezing or coughing. The virus enters another person through the mouth. The virus can spread easily. For example, the virus can spread if people haven't washed their hands after coughing, using the toilet or before eating.\n\n【36】The virus also may be in water contaminated with feces carrying the poliovirus.\n\n【37】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【38】Polio mainly affects children. But anyone who hasn't been vaccinated is at risk of getting the disease.\n\n【39】Complications\n-------------\n\n【40】Severe disease that affects the ability to breathe can cause death. Long-term complications for people who recover may include:\n\n【41】*   Permanent paralysis\n*   Muscle shortening that causes deformed bones or joints\n*   Chronic pain\n*   Post-polio syndrome\n\n【42】Prevention\n----------\n\n【43】The most effective way to prevent polio is vaccination.\n\n【44】### Polio vaccine\n\n【45】The CDC recommends four doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) at the following ages:\n\n【46】*   2 months\n*   4 months\n*   Between 6 and 18 months\n*   Between ages 4 and 6 when children are just entering school\n\n【47】If your child is missing a dose, talk to your health care provider about a catch-up schedule for vaccination.\n\n【48】### Adult vaccination\n\n【49】In the U.S. most adults have immunity to the poliovirus because of childhood vaccination. And U.S. adults have little chance of being exposed to the virus. But adults who are traveling to or living in a region with high rates of spreading poliovirus should receive more vaccinations.\n\n【50】If you had a complete course of vaccination, you should get a one-time IPV booster. You should get three IPV doses if you aren't vaccinated, didn't receive a complete vaccination or are unsure of your vaccination status.\n\n【51】The IPV schedule for adults is a second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose. Then the third dose is 6 to 12 months after the second dose. Talk to your health care provider if you know you have an incomplete vaccination history.\n\n【52】### Vaccine safety\n\n【53】IPV is safe for people with weakened immune systems, although it's not certain how protective the vaccine is in cases of severe immune deficiency. Common side effects are pain and redness at the injection site.\n\n【54】IPV can cause an allergic reaction in some people. Because the vaccine has trace amounts of the antibiotics streptomycin, polymyxin B and neomycin, it may cause a reaction in people allergic to one of these antibiotics. A person who has a severe reaction to a first dose of IPV won't get more doses.\n\n【55】Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction usually occur within minutes to a few hours after the shot. Watch for:\n\n【56】*   Skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin\n*   Low blood pressure (hypotension)\n*   Narrowing of the airways and a swollen tongue or throat, which can cause wheezing and trouble breathing\n*   A weak and fast pulse\n*   Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea\n*   Dizziness or fainting\n\n【57】If you or your child has an allergic reaction after any vaccination, get medical help right away.\n\n【58】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Before the program, 173 of 320 participants (54.1%) had never used the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommendations for COPD. After the program, clinician self-confidence improved in all areas measured. In addition, participant knowledge and comprehension significantly improved (mean score, 77.1%-94.7%; _P_ <.001). We implemented the commitment-to-change strategy in courses 6 through 20. A total of 271 of 313 participants (86.6%) completed 971 commitment-to-change statements, and 132 of 271 (48.7%) completed the follow-up survey. Of the follow-up survey respondents, 92 of 132 (69.7%) reported completely implementing at least one clinical practice change, and only 8 of 132 (6.1%) reported inability to make any clinical practice change after the program.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】A carefully designed, interactive, flexible, dynamic, and reproducible COPD CME/CE program tailored to clinicians' needs that involves diverse instructional strategies and media can have short-term and long-term improvements in clinician self-confidence, knowledge/comprehension, and clinical practice.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AANP ( American Academy of Nurse Practitioners ), ACCP ( American College of Chest Physicians ), ADDIE ( Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation ), APN ( advanced practice nurse ), CE ( continuing education ), CI ( confidence interval ), CME ( continuing medical education ), COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ), DO ( doctor of osteopathy ), GOLD ( Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ), MD ( medical doctor ), PA ( physician assistant ), SME ( subject matter expert )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

Strep throat and scarlet fever are caused by an infection with streptococcus (strep-toe-KOK-us) bacteria.\n\n【2】Rheumatic fever most often affects children ages 5 to 15. But it can develop in younger children and adults. Although strep throat is common, rheumatic fever is rare in the United States and other developed countries.\n\n【3】Rheumatic fever can cause permanent damage to the heart, including damaged heart valves and heart failure. Treatment can ease pain, reduce damage from inflammation and prevent a recurrence of rheumatic fever.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Rheumatic fever symptoms result from inflammation in the heart, joints, skin or central nervous system. There may be few symptoms or several. Symptoms can change during the course of the disease. The onset of rheumatic fever usually occurs about 2 to 4 weeks after a strep throat infection.\n\n【6】Rheumatic fever signs and symptoms can include:\n\n【7】*   Fever\n*   Painful and tender joints — most often in the knees, ankles, elbows and wrists\n*   Pain in one joint that migrates to another joint\n*   Red, hot or swollen joints\n*   Chest pain\n*   Fatigue\n*   Flat or slightly raised, painless rash with a ragged edge\n*   Heart murmur\n*   Jerky, uncontrollable body movements (Sydenham chorea) — most often in the hands, feet and face\n*   Outbursts of unusual behavior, such as crying or inappropriate laughing, that accompanies Sydenham chorea\n*   Small, painless bumps beneath the skin\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】Make an appointment with your child's health care provider if any of these signs or symptoms of strep throat occur:\n\n【10】*   Sore throat that comes on suddenly\n*   Pain when swallowing\n*   Fever\n*   Headache\n*   Stomach pain, nausea and vomiting\n\n【11】Proper treatment of strep throat can prevent rheumatic fever.\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】Rheumatic fever can occur after a throat infection from a bacteria called group A streptococcus. Group A streptococcus infections of the throat cause strep throat or, less commonly, scarlet fever.\n\n【14】Group A streptococcus infections of the skin or other parts of the body rarely trigger rheumatic fever.\n\n【15】The link between strep infection and rheumatic fever isn't clear. It appears that the bacteria trick the immune system into attacking otherwise healthy tissue.\n\n【16】The body's immune system typically targets infection-causing bacteria. In rheumatic fever, the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, particularly in the heart, joints, skin and central nervous system. This faulty immune system reaction results in swelling of the tissues (inflammation).\n\n【17】There's little chance of developing rheumatic fever when a strep throat infection is promptly treated with antibiotics and all the medication is taken as prescribed.\n\n【18】If a child has one or more episodes of strep throat or scarlet fever that aren't properly treated, rheumatic fever may occur.\n\n【19】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【20】Things that may increase the risk of rheumatic fever include:\n\n【21】*   **Genes.** Some people have one or more genes that might make them more likely to develop rheumatic fever.\n*   **Specific type of strep bacteria.** Certain strains of strep bacteria are more likely to contribute to rheumatic fever than are other strains.\n*   **Environmental factors.** A greater risk of rheumatic fever is associated with overcrowding, poor sanitation and other conditions that can cause strep bacteria to easily spread among many people.\n\n【22】Complications\n-------------\n\n【23】Inflammation caused by rheumatic fever can last a few weeks to several months. For some people, the inflammation causes long-term complications.\n\n【24】One complication of rheumatic fever is permanent damage to the heart (rheumatic heart disease). Rheumatic heart disease usually occurs years to decades after the original illness.\n\n【25】However, severe rheumatic fever can start to damage the heart valves while your child still has symptoms of the infection. Damage is most common with the valve between the two left chambers of the heart (mitral valve), but the other valves can be affected.\n\n【26】Rheumatic fever can cause the following types of heart damage:\n\n【27】*   **Narrowing of a heart valve (valve stenosis).** This decreases blood flow.\n*   **Leaky heart valve (valve regurgitation).** Blood flows backward across the valve.\n*   **Damage to heart muscle.** The inflammation associated with rheumatic fever can weaken the heart muscle, affecting its ability to pump.\n\n【28】Damage to the heart valves or other heart tissues can lead to irregular, chaotic heartbeats (atrial fibrillation) or heart failure later in life.\n\n【29】Prevention\n----------\n\n【30】The only way to prevent rheumatic fever is to treat strep throat infections or scarlet fever promptly and completely with a full course of appropriate antibiotics.\n\n【31】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "b343af1b-daed-42cd-bfc3-33e0a3bbf9e8", "title": "Aortic valve repair and aortic valve replacement", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Aortic valve repair and aortic valve replacement are procedures to treat a damaged or diseased aortic valve.\n\n【2】The aortic valve is one of four valves that control blood flow in the heart. It separates the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) and the body's main artery (aorta).\n\n【3】When the heart squeezes (contracts), the aortic valve opens and lets blood flow from the left ventricle into the aorta. When the heart relaxes, the aortic valve closes to prevent blood from moving backward.\n\n【4】A diseased or damaged aortic valve can interfere with blood flow and force the heart to work harder to send blood to the rest of the body.\n\n【5】Aortic valve repair or aortic valve replacement can improve blood flow, reduce symptoms of heart valve disease and prolong life.\n\n【6】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【7】Aortic valve repair and aortic valve replacement are done to treat aortic valve disease. Mild aortic valve disease without symptoms may only require frequent health checkups. But most aortic valve conditions are mechanical problems that eventually require surgery to reduce symptoms and the risk of complications, such as heart failure, heart attack, stroke or death due to sudden cardiac arrest.\n\n【8】Types of aortic valve disease that may require treatment with aortic valve repair or replacement include:\n\n【9】*   **Aortic valve regurgitation.** Blood flows backward through the aortic valve into the heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Aortic valve regurgitation may result from a leaky or dysfunctional valve. Any condition that damages the aortic valve can cause regurgitation. Sometimes, a baby is born with an irregularly shaped aortic valve (congenital heart defect) that leads to regurgitation.\n*   **Aortic valve stenosis.** The aortic valve is narrowed or blocked. It's hard for the valve to open properly. The heart must work harder to pump blood into the aorta. Aortic valve stenosis may be caused by a heart condition present at birth (congenital heart defect). An infection called rheumatic fever may lead to inflammation that damages the heart valve (rheumatic heart disease).\n*   **Other aortic valve problems present at birth (congenital heart defects).** Some babies may be born with an aortic valve that's missing a valve opening or that doesn't have enough tissue flaps (cusps). A congenital heart defect can also cause the valve to be the wrong size or shape.\n\n【10】The decision to repair or replace a damaged aortic valve depends on many things, including:\n\n【11】*   The severity (stage) of aortic valve disease\n*   Age and overall health\n*   Whether surgery is needed to correct another valve or heart condition\n\n【12】In general, surgeons recommend valve repair when possible, as it lowers the risk of infection, saves the heart valve and may improve heart function. The best option depends on the specific aortic valve problem, as well as the expertise and experience of the health care team.\n\n【13】Aortic valve repair and aortic valve replacement may be done through traditional open-heart surgery, which involves a cut (incision) in the chest, or by using minimally invasive methods, which involve smaller incisions in the chest or a catheter inserted in the leg or chest (transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR).\n\n【14】Minimally invasive heart surgery may involve a shorter hospital stay, quicker recovery and less pain than traditional open-heart surgery.\n\n【15】What type of valve surgery you have depends on your individual situation. For example, some people with aortic valve disease may not be candidates for traditional open-heart surgery due to other health problems, such as lung or kidney disease, that would make the procedure too risky. Your health care provider will explain the benefits and risks of each option.\n\n【16】Risks\n-----\n\n【17】All surgeries have risks. Risks of aortic valve repair and replacement depend on your health, the type of procedure, and the expertise of the surgeons and other health care providers.\n\n【18】To reduce potential risks, aortic valve surgery should generally be done at a center with a multidisciplinary heart team that is experienced in such procedures and does many aortic valve surgeries.\n\n【19】Potential risks associated with aortic valve repair and aortic valve replacement surgery may include:\n\n【20】*   Bleeding\n*   Blood clots\n*   Problem or failure of a replacement valve\n*   Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias)\n*   Infection\n*   Stroke\n*   Death\n\n【21】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【22】Before surgery to have your aortic valve repaired or replaced, your health care providers will explain to you what to expect before, during and after the surgery and the potential risks of the surgery.\n\n【23】Before being admitted to the hospital for your heart valve surgery, talk to your caregivers about your upcoming hospital stay. Discuss any help you may need when you return home.\n\n【24】Don't hesitate to ask your care providers any questions you may have about the procedure.\n\n【25】### Food and medications\n\n【26】Talk to your health care provider about:\n\n【27】*   When or if you can take your regular medications before surgery\n*   When or if you should stop eating or drinking the night before surgery\n\n【28】### Clothing and personal items\n\n【29】Your health care providers may recommend that you bring several items to the hospital including:\n\n【30】*   A copy of your advance directive or living will\n*   A list of your medications\n*   Eyeglasses, hearing aids or dentures\n*   Items that may help you relax, such as portable music players or books\n*   Loosefitting, comfortable clothing\n*   Personal care items, such as a brush, a comb, shaving equipment and a toothbrush\n\n【31】During surgery, avoid wearing:\n\n【32】*   Contact lenses\n*   Dentures\n*   Eyeglasses\n*   Jewelry\n*   Nail polish\n\n【33】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【34】### Before the procedure\n\n【35】When you arrive for surgery, a care provider will insert an IV into your forearm or hand. Fluids and medicines can be given through the IV. A care provider may shave off any hair at the location where the procedure will take place.\n\n【36】For most valve repair and replacement procedures, you'll receive medications that put you in a sleep-like state (general anesthesia) so you won't feel any pain during the surgery.\n\n【37】You may be connected to a heart-lung bypass machine. The machine keeps blood moving through the body during the heart valve surgery.\n\n【38】### During the procedure\n\n【39】#### Aortic valve repair\n\n【40】Aortic valve repair is usually done with open-heart surgery and by opening the chest bone (sternotomy). Surgeons wire the bone back together after the procedure to prevent movement and aid in healing.\n\n【41】Aortic valve repair procedures may involve several different types of repair, including:\n\n【42】*   Inserting tissue to patch holes or tears in the flaps (perforated cusps)\n*   Adding support at the base or roots of the valve\n*   Separating valve cusps that have fused\n*   Reshaping or removing tissue to allow the valve to close more tightly\n*   Tightening or reinforcing the ring around the valve (annulus) by implanting an artificial ring (annuloplasty)\n\n【43】#### Minimally invasive aortic valve repair\n\n【44】If the aortic valve can't fully open due to aortic valve stenosis, a less invasive procedure called balloon valvuloplasty may be used to repair the valve. Minimally invasive heart valve surgery typically involves smaller incisions and a shorter hospital stay than traditional open-heart surgery.\n\n【45】During balloon valvuloplasty, a surgeon inserts a thin, hollow tube (catheter) into a blood vessel, usually in the groin, and threads it to the heart. A balloon on the tip of the catheter is inflated, which widens the narrowed valve.\n\n【46】Balloon valvuloplasty is often used to treat infants and children with aortic valve stenosis. However, the valve tends to narrow again in adults who have had the procedure, so it's usually only done in adults who are too ill for surgery or who are waiting for a valve replacement. You may need additional procedures to treat the narrowed valve over time.\n\n【47】Some replacement heart valves may begin to leak or not work as well over time. Surgery or a catheter procedure may be done to repair or plug a leaking replacement heart valve.\n\n【48】#### Aortic valve replacement\n\n【49】If the aortic valve can't be repaired, surgery may be needed to replace the valve. In this procedure, a surgeon removes the aortic valve and replaces it with a mechanical valve or a valve made from cow, pig or human heart tissue (biological tissue valve). Another type of biological tissue valve replacement that uses your own lung (pulmonary) valve is sometimes possible.\n\n【50】If you have a mechanical valve, you'll need to take blood-thinning medications for life to prevent blood clots. Biological valves often eventually need to be replaced, as they break down (degenerate) over time. Together, you and your health care providers should discuss the risks and benefits of each type of valve to choose the one that's best for you.\n\n【51】Aortic valve replacement may be done using open-heart surgery or minimally invasive methods, which involve smaller incisions than those used in open-heart surgery. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a type of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement. It is also sometimes called transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).\n\n【52】When minimally invasive aortic valve replacement is done by experienced surgeons and centers, the results are like those with traditional open-heart surgery.\n\n【53】### After the procedure\n\n【54】After aortic valve repair or replacement, you'll may spend a day or more in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n【55】You'll be given fluids, nutrition and medications through intravenous (IV) lines. Other tubes will drain urine from your bladder and drain fluid and blood from your heart and chest. You may be given oxygen.\n\n【56】After your stay in the ICU, you'll be moved to a regular hospital room for several days. The time you spend in the ICU and hospital can vary, depending on your condition and procedure.\n\n【57】During your hospital stay, your care providers will:\n\n【58】*   Watch for signs of infection in your incision sites\n*   Periodically check your blood pressure, breathing and heart rate\n*   Work with you to manage any pain you have after surgery\n*   Encourage you to walk regularly to gradually increase your activity and do breathing exercises as you recover\n\n【59】Recovery time depends on your procedure, overall health before the procedure and any complications.\n\n【60】Your health care provider may tell you to avoid driving a car or lifting anything heavier than 10 pounds for several weeks.\n\n【61】Results\n-------\n\n【62】After aortic valve repair or replacement surgery, your health care provider can tell you when you can return to daily activities, such as working, driving and exercise.\n\n【63】You'll typically need regular health checkups to monitor your heart condition and to check for complications, such as valve failure. Imaging tests may be done to make sure the aortic valve is working correctly.\n\n【64】After heart valve surgery, it's important to follow a heart-healthy lifestyle. Your health care provider may recommend these lifestyle changes:\n\n【65】*   Getting regular exercise\n*   Controlling weight\n*   Eating a healthy diet\n*   Managing stress\n*   Not smoking\n\n【66】Your health care provider may also suggest enrolling in a program of education and exercise — called cardiac rehabilitation — to improve your overall health and help you recover after aortic valve surgery.\n\n【67】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The objectives of our research were to (1) estimate the summary association between EPA+DHA intake and CHD risk in prospective cohort studies and (2) examine the effects by dose, by specific CHD outcome, and among higher-risk populations (eg, individuals with elevated triglyceride levels). To this end, we evaluated the currently available and published data across the literature.\n\n【1】The authors raise 2 primary issues in their letter to the editor, both dealing with the design of individual RCTs, which is not the topic addressed in our meta-analysis but still is relevant for the discourse of the state of knowledge on this topic. The first is that there is an absence of discussion pertaining to the recruitment of control groups with low baseline levels of omega-3 EPA+DHA. However, the authors focus their attention on the National Heart Foundation of Australia review, not our meta-analysis. In fact, in our discussion section, we wrote that “most RCTs did not measure baseline intake of EPA+DHA from the diet nor track EPA+DHA intake from sources other than that supplemented during the course of study….” Therefore, it is not clear if the results from the individual trials have been impacted by background dietary EPA+DHA, particularly in the control group. If so, as the authors suggest, and as we indicated in our article, the effects of EPA+DHA on CHD risk may be more protective than what is reported in our meta-analysis. Although most studies undeniably include participants with varying baseline levels of EPA+DHA, the purpose of our meta-analysis was to evaluate the relative difference between individuals with EPA+DHA provision compared with those who did not receive supplemental EPA+DHA. Globally, levels of EPA+DHA in the general population have been considered low\n\n【2】无关删除-2:<u>*   Stark K.D.\n*   Van Elswyk M.E.\n*   Higgins M.R.\n*   Weatherford C.A.\n*   Salem Jr. N.</u>\n\n【3】Global survey of the omega-3 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid in the blood stream of healthy adults.\n\n【4】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Prog Lipid Res._ 2016; 63 : 132-152</u></u>\n\n【5】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (348)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【6】删除7:<u>;</u> however, it is unclear whether the participants in the RCTs we analyzed have been recruited from a “healthier” source population with higher baseline levels of EPA+DHA. If so, effects of EPA+DHA supplementation may be attenuated toward the null value. Appropriately, the summary results from our meta-analyses of RCTs should be viewed as conservative.\n\n【7】From a methodological standpoint, it may not be pragmatic to evaluate CHD risk among individuals receiving EPA+DHA compared with an “exposure-free” (ie, no baseline level of EPA+DHA) control population. McLennan and Pepe ask the question of whether an RCT of a β-blocker, or any novel active agent, allows the active drug to be present in the control group. Although we agree with the their position that in most _drug_ trials, the active agent may not—or should not—be present in the control group, EPA+DHA is a dietary factor, not an active drug.\n\n【8】Again, the aim of our meta-analysis was to estimate the _relative difference_ of the effect of EPA+DHA on CHD risk based on the evaluation of participants receiving supplemental EPA+DHA compared with participants not receiving supplemental EPA+DHA. We fully submit that the control groups across the volume of RCTs include participants with varying levels of EPA+DHA. The reality is that we are not evaluating a drug or prescription medication per se but rather a dietary and nutritional constituent present in commonly consumed foods. Thus, the inherent methodology in published studies is a reflection of this fact (as is the case with most RCTs of dietary factors), and the findings across the literature should be interpreted in light of the challenges when attempting to isolate the effects of a single dietary factor on a complex and multifaceted outcome, such as CHD. In other words, unless the exposure is rare and uncommon in the dietary practice of large segments of the population, the control groups in most RCTs of dietary factors typically include participants with a baseline level of exposure. Indeed, McLennan and Pepe indicate that in our analyses, the prospective cohort studies consistently reveal reductions in CHD risk between those eating fish regularly compared with those who consume fish infrequently, and the RCTs do not reproduce these strong findings. This is discussed extensively in our article in which we indicate that prospective cohort studies enable us to evaluate unrestricted populations who may not have modified their dietary habits and medications on entry into the cohort. Furthermore, most prospective cohort studies are longer in duration than RCTs, include a larger study population, and evaluate dietary intake data that may be representative of lifelong eating habits. However, RCTs offer the methodological advantage of control for confounding through random allocation of exposure and a potentially more stringent and regulated follow-up for the occurrence of a CHD event. Each study design provides insight into the relationship between EPA+DHA and CHD, which is why we conducted separate meta-analyses by RCT and prospective cohort designs. Although the statistical magnitude of results differed modestly by study design, results by study type should be considered as complementary, providing support for the role of EPA+DHA on CHD risk reduction.\n\n【9】The second issue that McLennan and Pepe raise is that background omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) dietary intake and baseline red blood cell membrane PUFA should be accounted for in each RCT recruitment. They suggest that if so, we would likely see more than a 6% reduction in CHD risk in our meta-analysis. Although RCT recruitment is beyond the scope of our meta-analysis, we agree that a stronger summary effect may be observed if the margin of difference in EPA+DHA levels between the treatment and control groups was greater. McLennan and Pepe recommend that future RCTs should include patients with verifiable baseline and follow-up measurements of omega-3 PUFA levels. We agree that such methodological rigor at the individual trial level may provide additional insight into the relationship between EPA+DHA and CHD risk.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Because of the abnormal placement of the mitral valve (Panel A, asterisk), we did not feel that we would be able to relieve the subvalvar stenosis even with myectomy.\n\n【12】An apicoaortic conduit (Panel C, arrow) was constructed between the left ventricular apex (LVA) and the descending thoracic aorta (DTA) via a left thoracotomy. Normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass was achieved by cannulation of the left common femoral artery and vein. The left ventricle was small and hypertrophied with a very small cavity. Two separate pieces of a 16-mm Dacron tube graft (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, MN) were anastomosed to the left ventricular apex (LVA) and the descending thoracic aorta (DTA) (Panel B, white arrows). A 20-mm Dacron graft was interposed between these 2 grafts (Panel B, gray arrow), and a 17-mm bileaflet mechanical valve (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) was interposed between these conduits. Hence, the combined effective orifice area index was 1.11 cm  /m  . The patient experienced marked symptomatic improvement at dismissal and was counseled regarding strict adherence to therapeutic anticoagulation, as he had 3 mechanical valves in situ.\n\n【13】We demonstrate that this procedure is useful for the management of patients with complex left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. It avoids the high risks involved in repeated median sternotomy approach.\n\n【14】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>We thank Lawrence Sinak, MD, and Nandan Anavekar, MB, BCh, for graciously providing us with the 3-dimensional reconstructed computed tomographic image.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "dc564308-955b-4d7d-9d5f-ecebcde41256", "title": "Folliculitis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Folliculitis is a common skin condition that happens when hair follicles become inflamed. It's often caused by an infection with bacteria. At first it may look like small pimples around the tiny pockets from where each hair grows (hair follicles).\n\n【2】The condition can be itchy, sore and embarrassing. The infection can spread and turn into crusty sores.\n\n【3】Mild folliculitis will likely heal without scarring in a few days with basic self-care. More-serious or repeat infections may need prescription medicine. Left untreated, severe infections can cause permanent hair loss and scarring.\n\n【4】Certain types of folliculitis are known as hot tub rash and barber's itch.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Folliculitis signs and symptoms include:\n\n【7】*   Clusters of small bumps or pimples around hair follicles\n*   Pus-filled blisters that break open and crust over\n*   Itchy, burning skin\n*   Painful, tender skin\n*   An inflamed bump\n\n【8】### Types of folliculitis\n\n【9】The two main types of folliculitis are superficial and deep. The superficial type involves part of the follicle, and the deep type involves the entire follicle and is usually more severe.\n\n【10】Types of folliculitis, with the most common listed first, include:\n\n【11】*   **Bacterial folliculitis.** This common type is a rash of itchy, pus-filled bumps. It occurs when hair follicles become infected with bacteria, usually Staphylococcus aureus (staph). Staph bacteria live on the skin all the time. And they can cause problems when they enter the body through a cut or other wound.\n*   **Hot tub rash (pseudomonas folliculitis).** This type is a rash of round, itchy bumps that can show up 1 to 2 days after exposure to the bacteria that causes it. Hot tub folliculitis is caused by pseudomonas bacteria, which can be found in hot tubs, water slides and heated pools in which the chlorine and pH levels aren't correct.\n*   **Razor bumps (pseudofolliculitis barbae).** This rash can look like folliculitis but it's caused by ingrown hairs, not infected follicles. It mainly affects people with curly hair who shave too close and is most noticeable on the face and neck. People who get bikini waxes may get razor bumps in the groin area.\n*   **Pityrosporum (pit-ih-ROS-puh-rum) folliculitis.** This type is a rash of itchy, pus-filled bumps, most often on the back and chest. It's caused by a yeast infection.\n*   **Gram-negative folliculitis.** This type causes pus-filled bumps around the nose and mouth. It sometimes develops in people who are receiving long-term antibiotic therapy for acne.\n*   **Eosinophilic (e-o-sin-o-FILL-ik) folliculitis.** This type causes intense itching and recurring patches of bumps and pimples that form near hair follicles of the face and upper body. It mainly affects people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The cause of this condition isn't fully understood.\n*   **Boils (furuncles) and carbuncles.** These occur when hair follicles become deeply infected with staph bacteria. A boil tends to appear suddenly as a painful inflamed bump. A carbuncle is a cluster of boils.\n*   **Sycosis barbae.** This type affects people who shave.\n\n【12】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【13】Make an appointment with your health care provider if your condition is widespread or the symptoms don't go away after a week or two of self-care measures. You may need a prescription-strength antibiotic or antifungal medication to help control the condition.\n\n【14】Seek immediate medical care if you experience signs of a spreading infection. These include a sudden increase in redness or pain, fever, chills, and a feeling of being unwell (malaise).\n\n【15】Causes\n------\n\n【16】Folliculitis is often caused when hair follicles are infected with bacteria, commonly Staphylococcus aureus (staph). It may also be caused by viruses, fungi, parasites, medications or physical injury. Sometimes the cause isn't known.\n\n【17】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【18】Anyone can develop folliculitis. Certain factors increase the risk of getting it, including:\n\n【19】*   Regularly wearing clothing that traps heat and sweat, such as rubber gloves or high boots\n*   Soaking in a hot tub, whirlpool or public pool that's not maintained well\n*   Causing damage to hair follicles through shaving, waxing, wearing tight clothes or hair styling practices such as traction, wigs and oils\n*   Using some medications, such as corticosteroid creams, prednisone, long-term antibiotic therapy for acne and certain chemotherapy drugs\n*   Having dermatitis or excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)\n*   Having diabetes, HIV/AIDS or another condition that lowers your resistance to infections\n\n【20】Complications\n-------------\n\n【21】Possible complications of folliculitis include:\n\n【22】*   Recurrent or spreading infection\n*   Permanent scarring\n*   Patches of skin that are darker (hyperpigmentation) or lighter (hypopigmentation) than before the condition occurred, usually temporary\n*   Destruction of hair follicles and permanent hair loss\n\n【23】Prevention\n----------\n\n【24】You can try to prevent folliculitis by using these tips:\n\n【25】*   **Wash your skin regularly.** Use a clean washcloth and towel each time and don't share your towels or washcloths.\n*   **Do laundry regularly.** Use hot, soapy water to wash towels, washcloths and any oil-soaked uniforms or other clothing.\n*   **Avoid friction or pressure on your skin.** Protect skin that's prone to folliculitis from the friction caused by backpacks, helmets and tight clothes.\n*   **Dry out your rubber gloves between uses.** If you wear rubber gloves regularly, after each use turn them inside out, wash with soap, rinse and dry well.\n*   **Avoid shaving, if possible.** For people with facial folliculitis, growing a beard may be a good option if you don't need a clean-shaven face.\n*   **Shave with care.** If you shave, adopt these habits to help control symptoms:\n    *   Shaving less often\n    *   Washing your skin with warm water and a mild facial cleanser (Cetaphil, CeraVe, others) before shaving\n    *   Using a washcloth or cleansing pad in a gentle circular motion to raise embedded hairs before shaving\n    *   Applying a good amount of shaving lotion before shaving\n    *   Shaving in the direction of hair growth\n    *   Avoiding shaving too close by using an electric razor or guarded blade and by not stretching the skin\n    *   Using a clean, sharp blade and rinsing it with warm water after each stroke\n    *   Avoiding shaving the same area more than twice\n    *   Applying moisturizing lotion after you shave\n    *   Avoiding the sharing of razors, towels and washcloths\n*   **Try hair-removing products (depilatories) or other methods of hair removal.** Though they, too, may irritate the skin.\n*   **Treat related conditions.** If you know that a condition other than folliculitis is triggering your symptoms, treat that condition. For example, excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) can cause folliculitis. You can try to prevent this by changing out of sweaty clothing, bathing daily and using antiperspirant.\n*   **Use only clean hot tubs and heated pools.** The Centers for Disease Control also suggests that after getting out of the water you remove your swimsuit and shower with soap. Then wash your swimsuit too. If you own a hot tub or a heated pool, clean it regularly and add chlorine as recommended.\n*   **Talk with your health care provider.** If your folliculitis often returns, your health care provider may suggest controlling bacterial growth in your nose. You might need a five-day course of a prescription antibacterial ointment. And you may need to use a body wash with chlorhexidine (Hibiclens, Hibistat, others).\n\n【26】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

But they might also appear on your face, arms and legs. Over time the patches may become firm, dry and smooth. Morphea tends to affect only the outer layers of your skin. But some forms of the condition also affect deeper tissues and may restrict movement in the joints.\n\n【3】Morphea usually improves on its own over time, though recurrences are common. In the meantime, medications and therapies are available to help treat the skin discoloration and other effects.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of morphea vary depending on the type and stage of the condition. They include:\n\n【6】*   Reddish or purplish oval patches of skin, often on the belly, chest or back\n*   Patches that gradually develop a lighter or whitish center\n*   Linear patches, especially on the arms or legs and possibly the forehead or scalp\n*   A gradual change in the affected skin, which becomes firm, thickened, dry and shiny\n\n【7】Morphea affects the skin and underlying tissue and sometimes bone. The condition generally lasts several years and then improves or at times disappears by itself. It may leave scars or areas of darkened or discolored skin. It is possible for morphea to recur.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】See your doctor if you notice reddish patches of hardening or thickening skin. Early diagnosis and treatment may help slow the development of new patches and allow your doctor to identify and treat complications before they worsen.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】The cause of morphea is unknown. It may be caused by an unusual reaction of your immune system. In people at increased risk of morphea, it could be triggered by injury to the affected area, medications, chemical toxins, an infection or radiation therapy.\n\n【12】The condition isn't contagious.\n\n【13】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【14】Certain factors may affect your risk of developing morphea, including:\n\n【15】*   **Being white and female.** Morphea is most common in white females.\n*   **Age.** The condition can affect people at any age. It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 14 or in the mid-40s.\n*   **A family history of morphea.** This condition can run in families. People with morphea are more likely to have a family history of morphea and other autoimmune diseases.\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】Morphea can cause a number of complications, including:\n\n【18】*   **Self-esteem issues.** Morphea can have a negative effect on your self-esteem and body image, particularly if discolored patches of skin appear on your arms, legs or face.\n*   **Movement problems.** Morphea that affects the arms or legs can impair joint mobility.\n*   **Widespread areas of hardened, discolored skin.** Numerous new patches of hardened, discolored skin may seem to join together, a condition known as generalized morphea.\n*   **Loss of hair and sweat glands.** Over time, you may lose hair and sweat glands in the affected area.\n*   **Eye damage.** Children with head and neck morphea may experience unnoticeable but permanent eye damage.\n\n【19】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Articles were classified on the basis of whether they tested a new or existing therapy and whether results were positive or negative. A reversal was defined as a negative RCT of an established practice. Further review and categorization were performed to confirm that reversals were supported by subsequent systematic review, as well as to identify the type of medical practice studied in each reversal. This study was conducted from October 2017 to June 17, 2019.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We reviewed 92 original articles, 76 of which could be conclusively categorized. Of these, 18 (24%) articles examined a new medical practice, whereas 58 (76%) tested an established practice. A total of 18 (24%) studies had positive findings, whereas 58 (76%) reached a negative conclusion. Of the 58 articles testing existing standard of care, 44 (76%) reversed that practice, whereas 14 (24%) reaffirmed it.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Reversal of cardiopulmonary resuscitation practices is widespread.

Solitary fibrous tumors of the thyroid are very rare and usually are manifested as a slow-growing mass. Solitary fibrous tumors have a variable appearance microscopically, some with more cellular features and some more hyalinized. The cells are round to fusiform and may be arranged around a vascular network, at times referred to as staghorn.

{"seq_id": "5979f91d-41b9-456b-827a-70df47344f17", "title": "Breast reduction surgery", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Breast reduction surgery, also known as reduction mammaplasty, removes fat, breast tissue and skin from the breasts. For those with large breasts, breast reduction surgery can ease discomfort and improve appearance.\n\n【2】Breast reduction surgery might also help improve self-image and the ability to take part in physical activities.\n\n【3】If you're thinking of breast reduction surgery, talk to a board-certified plastic surgeon. It's important to understand what's involved with breast reduction surgery, including possible risks and complications. It's also important to know what the surgery can and can't do.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Breast reduction surgery is meant for people who have large breasts that cause the following:\n\n【6】*   Chronic back, neck and shoulder pain\n*   Shoulder grooves from bra straps\n*   Chronic rash or skin irritation under the breasts\n*   Nerve pain\n*   Not being able to take part in some activities\n*   Poor self-image due to large breasts\n*   Trouble fitting into bras and clothing\n\n【7】Breast reduction surgery generally isn't recommended for people who:\n\n【8】*   Smoke\n*   Are very obese\n*   Don't want scars on the breasts\n\n【9】You can have breast reduction surgery at any age — sometimes even as a teenager. But breasts that aren't yet fully grown might need a second surgery later in life.\n\n【10】Reasons to postpone breast reduction surgery include:\n\n【11】*   **Planning to have children.** Breastfeeding might be challenging after breast reduction surgery. However, certain surgical techniques can help keep the ability to breastfeed.\n*   **Planning to lose weight.** Losing weight can often result in changes to breast size.\n\n【12】Risks\n-----\n\n【13】Breast reduction surgery has the same risks as other major surgeries — bleeding, infection and a bad reaction to the anesthesia. Other possible risks include:\n\n【14】*   Bruising, which is temporary\n*   Scarring\n*   Difficulty or inability to breastfeed\n*   Differences in the size, shape, and look of the left and right breasts\n*   Not being happy with the results\n*   Rarely, losing the nipples and skin around the nipples or the feeling in them\n\n【15】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【16】Your plastic surgeon will likely:\n\n【17】*   Look at your medical history and overall health\n*   Discuss what size you want your breasts to be and how you want them to look after the surgery\n*   Describe the surgery and its risks and benefits, including likely scarring and possible loss of feeling\n*   Examine and measure your breasts\n*   Take photographs of your breasts for your medical record\n*   Explain the type of medicine used to put you to sleep during surgery\n\n【18】Planning breast reduction surgery might require:\n\n【19】*   A mammogram\n*   Not smoking for at least six weeks before and after surgery\n*   Not taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements, to control bleeding during surgery\n\n【20】Usually, you can go home the day of the surgery. Arrange for someone to drive you home from the hospital.\n\n【21】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【22】Breast reduction surgery is usually done under general anesthesia, either in a hospital or outpatient surgical center.\n\n【23】### During the procedure\n\n【24】The method used to reduce the size of your breasts can vary. The process might include:\n\n【25】*   Surgery through incisions\n*   Liposuction to remove excess fat in the breasts\n\n【26】The surgeon usually:\n\n【27】*   Makes an incision around the nipple and areola and down each breast\n*   Removes excess breast tissue, fat and skin to reduce the size of each breast\n*   Reshapes the breast and resets the nipple and area around it, also known as the areola\n\n【28】The nipple and the area around it usually stay attached to the breast. For very large breasts, the surgeon might need to remove them and add on a new nipple.\n\n【29】Your surgeon will try to make your breasts look alike, but breast size and shape might vary somewhat. The size of the areola also might be smaller. The incision scars will fade over time, but they won't completely go away.\n\n【30】### After the procedure\n\n【31】Immediately after surgery:\n\n【32】*   The breasts are covered with bandages and a surgical bra to hold them in place\n*   A tube might be placed under each arm to drain any extra blood or fluid\n*   You may receive medicine for pain and medicine to decrease the risk of infection\n\n【33】For the first days or week after surgery:\n\n【34】*   The breasts will probably feel tender\n*   The breasts might be swollen and bruised\n*   A surgical bra that closes in front is worn to support the breasts\n\n【35】After that:\n\n【36】*   Limit physical activity for 4 to 6 weeks while the breasts heal\n*   Wear an approved surgical bra at all times to allow the breasts to heal and reduce swelling\n\n【37】Scarring fades over time. You will need a follow-up visit with your surgeon to check your recovery.\n\n【38】Results\n-------\n\n【39】Successful breast reduction surgery can relieve pain in the upper back, neck and shoulders. It might also increase the ability to take part in physical activities and promote a better self-image.\n\n【40】Results will show right away, but it can take months for the swelling to completely go down and the surgical scars to fade. The final result generally lasts a long time. But aging, changes in weight, pregnancy and other factors can change breast shape and size.\n\n【41】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Rates were stratified by level of WTC exposure (higher vs lower). Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), which are the ratios of the observed number of cases in the FDNY group to the expected number of cases based on REP rates, and 95% CIs were calculated.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We identified 97 SAID cases. Overall, FDNY rates were not significantly different from expected rates (SIR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.77-1.21). However, the lower WTC exposure group had 9.9 fewer cases than expected, whereas the higher WTC exposure group had 7.7 excess cases.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Most studies indicate that the healthy worker effect reduces the association between exposure and outcome by about 20%, which we observed in the lower WTC exposure group. Overall rates masked differences in incidence by level of WTC exposure, especially because the higher WTC exposure group was relatively small.

We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of 10 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent ECT at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, between January 1, 1995, and June 30, 2006. Of the 10 patients, 6 (60%) were women. The median age was 79.5 years (range, 65-93 years). All patients had an aortic valve area of 1.0 cm  or less (median, 0.9 cm  ). The median aortic transvalvular pressure gradient was 43.5 mm Hg (range, 32-58 mm Hg). The 10 patients underwent a total of 144 ECT sessions (range, 1-37 sessions per patient). Despite this large number of sessions, only 2 patients experienced single episodes of blood pressure perceived to be low 1 minute after an electroshock; these episodes were successfully treated. Hypertensive systolic blood pressure (>180 mm Hg) and tachycardia (>100 beats/min) in response to ECT prompted treatment in 7 patients during 70 ECT sessions (49%). None of the patients died within 24 hours after dismissal from the postanesthesia care unit (95% confidence interval for death rate per person, 0%-26%). Hence, ECT was safe in 10 patients with severe aortic stenosis treated at our institution. Our findings may be informative to clinicians who manage the care of patients with severe aortic stenosis who are undergoing ECT.\n\n【1】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

With these concepts as our compass, we embarked on a journey to improve the _Proceedings_ .\n\n【6】We recognized that the above-mentioned objectives demanded that we provide our readers the highest-quality material possible, targeted specifically to their needs. To make this happen, it was necessary to obtain more manuscripts and be more selective in those that we ultimately published. None of these changes would occur without first making the journal more appealing to authors. To accomplish this, we expanded and reorganized our staff and editorial board, improved communications technology, and made other changes to make our operation more responsive to authors, both during the evaluation of manuscripts and after manuscripts had been accepted for publication. I am pleased to report that these initiatives have resulted in the desired response from authors. During this 2-year restructuring period, we have experienced an overall 58% increase in the number of submissions, and the number of full-length, original manuscripts submitted has increased by 70%. Despite this increase in traffic (51% of which now originates from authors not affiliated with Mayo Clinic), we have reduced the time from initial receipt of manuscripts (here defined as any material other than letters or editorials) to issuance of a first decision to authors by 39%. Further, we have reduced the time from final acceptance of manuscripts to date of publication by 56%.\n\n【7】To ensure that we continue this practice of efficiently processing and publishing manuscripts in the face of an ever-growing number of submissions, the journal has fine-tuned the makeup of its editorial board. In our organizational structure, editorial board members are responsible for a variety of tasks, including providing initial manuscript review, selecting reviewers, assisting in the evaluation of critiques from those reviewers, and offering advice to both authors and the Editor-in-Chief. In 2000 and again in 2001, we have increased the total number of board members. We have used the additional positions to make sure that the board is better able to address manuscripts related to heart disease, cancer, and stroke (the 3 leading causes of mortality in the United States), as well as other high-interest, high-traffic areas. In some instances, we have added “redundant coverage” for given areas of research, to increase the likelihood that a specialty-related board member is always available to assist authors and reviewers. This change will also help ensure that our editorial board members will more optimally address major subspecialty areas. The philosophy behind the editorial board reorganization has also influenced the makeup of the board's leadership. Beginning this month, Dr William Tremaine will become Associate Editor, joining Drs Scott Litin and Lorraine Fitzpatrick in this role. Like them, he will have specific areas of responsibility and also will help provide Editor-in-Chief coverage during my absences.\n\n【8】The number of “editorial” (ie, nonadvertising) pages within each issue of the _Proceedings_ has not meaningfully changed during the past 2 years. When determining which manuscripts would and would not be published, we have used this period of growth to better select manuscripts of relevance to our general/internal medicine audience. Of the manuscripts selected for publication, we have asked authors to use the journal pages more efficiently than in the past. The net result of these changes is that each issue now contains a greater diversity of valuable information for our readers, and the acceptance rate for submitted manuscripts has not changed in exact inverse proportion to the increase in submissions. In the future, we will continue to be more selective in the materials we accept. However, if increases in the submission of high-quality manuscripts continue, so that we need to accept more material than can be accommodated in the existing journal's size, we have made arrangements to expand the size of the journal in 2001.\n\n【9】The growth of the journal in this era of electronic communications has forced us to rethink the makeup of our “audience.” In contrast to years past in which the audience was almost exclusively physicians and other health care professionals, our audience of 2001 includes large numbers of patients, their families, and others who do not deliver medical care. We have made changes to address their needs as well. On November 1, 2000, we introduced an improved Web site, reorganized to permit better access to information and accommodate future growth. Within the new Web site, we have continued our policy of displaying full-text versions of all featured articles and all editorials. These are available to interested readers on the same day they are available to the media, shortly after the journal arrives in subscribers’ mailboxes each month. This policy will continue into 2001. However, beginning in March 2001, we will release the remainder of each issue's content to our Web site, after a delay of some additional weeks following the release of featured articles and editorials. We will begin by posting the remainder of the January 2001 issue in March, the February issue in April, and so on, so that—after a brief delay—journal readers who are not subscribers will have access to the same content as subscribers. We hope these changes will benefit all portions of our audience, regardless of an interested reader's background or training.\n\n【10】In September 1999, the _Proceedings_ began working with Mayo Foundation Division of Communications to make reports from the journal more accessible to the lay media. In 2000, we estimated (using industry-recognized techniques) that the worldwide lay press coverage of our articles reached an audience of approximately one-half million every 24 hours, or well in excess of 150 million per year. Readers can expect to see continued growth in this area, in large measure because we plan to publish more high-quality, high-impact material, which subsequently will be available for lay press dissemination.\n\n【11】These past few months have indeed been a period of great excitement at the _Proceedings_ . Growth such as that described above would not be possible without the indefatigable support of our authors, readers, reviewers, staff, editorial board members, and other support personnel. To all, I offer a heartfelt thank-you for past acts, and I ask for understanding as we periodically experience growing pains related to the prosperity of the journal.\n\n【12】As we move forward, ever attempting to improve the _Proceedings_ , we encourage you, our authors and readers, to share with us your thoughts. Your cards, letters, and other messages have influenced the direction of the journal over the past 2 years, and I can assure you that they will have some bearing on our future course. The journal is here to serve you, and we eagerly anticipate input from you on how we can best accomplish this goal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "a2ec0681-2158-4db9-ba82-47c1068c80d6", "title": "Zolmitriptan (Nasal Route)", "text": "【0】Zolmitriptan (Nasal Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Zomig\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Zolmitriptan nasal spray is used to treat acute migraine headaches in adults and children 12 years of age and older. It is not used to prevent migraine headaches and is not used for cluster headaches. Zolmitriptan works in the brain to relieve the pain from migraine headaches. It belongs to the group of medicines called triptans.\n\n【6】Many people find that their headaches go away completely after they use zolmitriptan. Other people find that their headaches are much less painful, and that they are able to go back to their normal activities even though their headaches are not completely gone. Zolmitriptan often relieves other symptoms that occur together with a migraine headache, such as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to sound.\n\n【7】Zolmitriptan is not an ordinary pain reliever. It will not relieve any kind of pain other than migraine headaches. This medicine is usually used for people whose headaches are not relieved by acetaminophen, aspirin, or other pain relievers.\n\n【8】Zolmitriptan has caused serious side effects in some people, especially people who have heart or blood vessel disease. Be sure that you discuss with your doctor the risks of using this medicine as well as the benefits that it can have.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Spray\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Safety and efficacy of zolmitriptan nasal spray have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years\n\n【18】### Geriatric\n\n【19】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney, liver, or heart disease, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving zolmitriptan nasal spray.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【25】*   Almotriptan\n*   Bromocriptine\n*   Cisapride\n*   Dihydroergotamine\n*   Eletriptan\n*   Ergoloid Mesylates\n*   Ergonovine\n*   Ergotamine\n*   Frovatriptan\n*   Isocarboxazid\n*   Levomethadyl\n*   Linezolid\n*   Mesoridazine\n*   Methylene Blue\n*   Methylergonovine\n*   Methysergide\n*   Naratriptan\n*   Phenelzine\n*   Procarbazine\n*   Rizatriptan\n*   Sumatriptan\n*   Terfenadine\n*   Thioridazine\n*   Tranylcypromine\n\n【26】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【27】*   Acecainide\n*   Ajmaline\n*   Alfentanil\n*   Amiodarone\n*   Amitriptyline\n*   Amoxapine\n*   Amphetamine\n*   Aprindine\n*   Azimilide\n*   Benzhydrocodone\n*   Benzphetamine\n*   Bretylium\n*   Buprenorphine\n*   Chloroquine\n*   Citalopram\n*   Codeine\n*   Desipramine\n*   Desvenlafaxine\n*   Dextroamphetamine\n*   Dibenzepin\n*   Dihydrocodeine\n*   Disopyramide\n*   Dofetilide\n*   Dolasetron\n*   Doxepin\n*   Dronedarone\n*   Droperidol\n*   Duloxetine\n*   Erythromycin\n*   Escitalopram\n*   Fenfluramine\n*   Fentanyl\n*   Flecainide\n*   Fluconazole\n*   Fluoxetine\n*   Fluvoxamine\n*   Foscarnet\n*   Gemifloxacin\n*   Granisetron\n*   Halofantrine\n*   Hydrocodone\n*   Hydromorphone\n*   Hydroquinidine\n*   Hydroxyamphetamine\n*   Ibutilide\n*   Imipramine\n*   Isradipine\n*   Lasmiditan\n*   Levomilnacipran\n*   Levorphanol\n*   Lidoflazine\n*   Lisdexamfetamine\n*   Lithium\n*   Lorcainide\n*   Lorcaserin\n*   Mefloquine\n*   Meperidine\n*   Metaxalone\n*   Methadone\n*   Methamphetamine\n*   Milnacipran\n*   Mirtazapine\n*   Morphine\n*   Morphine Sulfate Liposome\n*   Nefazodone\n*   Nortriptyline\n*   Octreotide\n*   Ondansetron\n*   Oxycodone\n*   Oxymorphone\n*   Palonosetron\n*   Paroxetine\n*   Pentamidine\n*   Pirmenol\n*   Pixantrone\n*   Prajmaline\n*   Probucol\n*   Procainamide\n*   Prochlorperazine\n*   Propafenone\n*   Protriptyline\n*   Quinidine\n*   Reboxetine\n*   Remifentanil\n*   Sematilide\n*   Sertraline\n*   Sibutramine\n*   Sotalol\n*   Spiramycin\n*   St John's Wort\n*   Sufentanil\n*   Tapentadol\n*   Tedisamil\n*   Tramadol\n*   Trazodone\n*   Trifluoperazine\n*   Trimipramine\n*   Venlafaxine\n*   Vilazodone\n*   Vortioxetine\n*   Ziprasidone\n\n【28】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【29】*   Cimetidine\n\n【30】### Other Interactions\n\n【31】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【32】Using this medicine with any of the following is usually not recommended, but may be unavoidable in some cases. If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use this medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【33】*   Tobacco\n\n【34】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【35】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【36】*   Angina (chest pain) or\n*   Arrhythmia (heart rhythm problem) or\n*   Basilar migraine (migraine with vision and hearing problems), history of or\n*   Heart attack, history of or\n*   Hemiplegic migraine (migraine with some paralysis), history of or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure), uncontrolled or\n*   Ischemic bowel disease (bowels have low blood supply) or\n*   Peripheral vascular disease (clogged arteries) or\n*   Stroke, history of or\n*   Transient ischemic attack (TIA), history of or\n*   Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (heart rhythm problem)—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【37】*   Coronary artery disease, family history of or\n*   Diabetes or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) or\n*   Obesity or\n*   Raynaud's syndrome—Use with caution. May be at increased risk for certain side effects.\n\n【38】*   Heart rhythm problems (eg, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【39】*   Liver disease, moderate or severe—Use is not recommended in patients with this condition.\n\n【40】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【41】Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. Using too much zolmitriptan may increase the chance of side effects.\n\n【42】This medicine is for use only in the nose. Do not get any of it in your eyes or on your skin. If it does get on these areas, rinse it off right away.\n\n【43】Do not use zolmitriptan for a headache that is different from your usual migraines. Instead, check with your doctor.\n\n【44】To relieve your migraine as soon as possible, use zolmitriptan as soon as the headache pain begins. Even if you get warning signals of a coming migraine (an aura), you should wait until the headache pain starts before using zolmitriptan.\n\n【45】Ask your doctor ahead of time about any other medicine you might take if zolmitriptan does not work. After you take the other medicine, check with your doctor as soon as possible. Headaches that are not relieved by zolmitriptan are sometimes caused by conditions that need other treatment.\n\n【46】If you feel much better after a dose of zolmitriptan, but your headache comes back or gets worse after a while, you may use one additional dose of zolmitriptan 2 hours after the first dose. Do not use more than 3 doses in any 24-hour period.\n\n【47】This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet. It is very important that you read and understand this information. Be sure to ask your doctor about anything you do not understand.\n\n【48】To use the nasal spray:\n\n【49】*   Do not try to prime the nasal spray or you will lose your dose. The unit contains only 1 spray.\n*   Gently blow your nose before using the spray.\n*   Remove the gray protection cap and keep your head in an upright position.\n*   Close one nostril with your index finger and breathe out gently through your mouth. Either nostril can be used.\n*   Insert the tip of the nose piece into your nostril and tilt your head slightly. Breathe in gently through your nose and at the same time and slowly release one spray.\n*   Keep your head slightly tilted back and remove the tip from your nose, and then breathe gently through your mouth for 5 to 10 seconds. You may feel liquid in your nose or the back of your throat. This is normal.\n*   Throw away the used nasal spray. Do not reuse.\n\n【50】### Dosing\n\n【51】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【52】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【53】*   For nasal dosage form (nasal spray):\n    *   For migraine headaches:\n        *   Adults and children 12 years and older—At first, 2.5 milligrams (mg) (1 spray into one nostril). Another spray (2.5 mg or 5 mg) may be used for a migraine that occurs at a later time as long as it has been at least 2 hours since the last spray.\n        *   The maximum single dose is 5 mg. Do not use more than 10 mg in a 24-hour period (one day).\n\n【54】### Missed Dose\n\n【55】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【56】### Storage\n\n【57】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【58】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【59】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【60】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【61】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【62】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to use it.\n\n【63】Do not use this medicine if you have used other triptan or ergot-type migraine medicines within the past 24 hours. Some examples of triptan medicines are almotriptan (Axert®), eletriptan (Relpax®), frovatriptan (Frova®), naratriptan (Amerge®), or sumatriptan (Imitrex®, Treximet®). Some examples of ergot-type medicines are dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45®, Migranal®), ergotamine (Bellergal®, Cafergot®, Ergomar®, Wigraine®), or methysergide (Sansert®). Also, do not use this medicine if you have taken a MAO-A inhibitor (eg, Nardil®, Parnate®) in the past 14 days.\n\n【64】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.\n\n【65】Check with your doctor if you have used zolmitriptan and your migraine got worse or started occurring more often.\n\n【66】This medicine may increase your risk of having abnormal heart rhythm, heart attack, angina, or stroke. This is more likely to occur if you or a family member already has heart disease, if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or if you smoke. Call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of a heart problem, such as chest pain or discomfort, an uneven heartbeat, nausea or vomiting, pain or discomfort in the shoulders, arms, jaw, back, or neck, shortness of breath, or sweating. Call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of a stroke, such as confusion, difficulty with speaking, double vision, headaches, an inability to move the arms, legs, or facial muscles, an inability to speak, or slow speech.\n\n【67】This medicine may cause problems if you have heart disease. If your doctor thinks you might have a problem with this medicine, he or she may want you to take your first dose in the doctor’s office or clinic.\n\n【68】Check with your doctor right away if you have chest discomfort, jaw or neck tightness after using this medicine. Also, tell your doctor if you have sudden or severe abdominal or stomach pain or bloody diarrhea after using this medicine.\n\n【69】Check with your doctor right away if you have blurred vision, difficulty with reading, or any other change in vision while you are using this medicine. Your doctor may want you to have your eyes checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).\n\n【70】Using zolmitriptan alone or in combination with other migraine medicines for 10 or more days per month may lead to worsening of headache. You may keep a headache diary to record the headache frequency and drug use.\n\n【71】Make sure your doctor knows about all the other medicines you are using. Zolmitriptan may cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome when taken with some medicines. This includes medicines to treat depression, such as amitriptyline (Elavil®), citalopram (Celexa®), duloxetine (Cymbalta®), escitalopram (Lexapro®), fluoxetine (Prozac®, Sarafem®, Symbyax®), fluvoxamine (Luvox®), olanzapine (Zyprexa®), paroxetine (Paxil®), sertraline (Zoloft®), or venlafaxine (Effexor®). Check with your doctor right away if you have agitation, confusion, diarrhea, excitement while talking that is not normal, fever, overactive reflexes, poor coordination, restlessness, shivering, sweating, trembling or shaking that you cannot control, or twitching. These could be symptoms of serotonin syndrome.\n\n【72】Some people feel dizzy or drowsy during or after a migraine, or using zolmitriptan to relieve a migraine. As long as you are feeling dizzy or drowsy, do not drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or not alert.\n\n【73】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【74】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【75】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【76】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【77】#### Less common or rare\n\n【78】1.  Blurred vision\n2.  cough\n3.  difficulty with swallowing\n4.  dizziness\n5.  fainting\n6.  fast, slow, pounding, or irregular heartbeat or pulse\n7.  headache\n8.  nervousness\n9.  pounding in the ears\n10.  puffiness or swelling of the eyelids or around the eyes, face, lips, or tongue\n11.  shortness of breath\n12.  skin rash, hives, or itching\n13.  tightness in the chest\n14.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n\n【79】#### Rare\n\n【80】1.

These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【84】#### More common\n\n【85】1.  Bad, unusual, or unpleasant (after) taste\n2.  change in taste\n\n【86】#### Less common\n\n【87】1.

Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of vaginal azoles in the elderly with use in other age groups, they are not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than they do in younger adults.\n\n【19】### Pregnancy\n\n【20】Studies have not been done in humans for use of all azole antifungals during the first trimester of pregnancy. These medicines are safe and effective when used for at least 7 days during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. However, check with your doctor before using this medicine during the first trimester of pregnancy. Also, use of 1- and 3-day treatments may not be effective during pregnancy.\n\n【21】### Breastfeeding\n\n【22】It is not known whether vaginal azoles pass into the breast milk. However, these medicines have not been shown to cause problems in nursing babies.\n\n【23】### Drug Interactions\n\n【24】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【25】Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【26】*   Tacrolimus\n*   Warfarin\n\n【27】### Other Interactions\n\n【28】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【30】Vaginal azoles usually come with patient directions. Read them carefully before using this medicine.\n\n【31】Use this medicine at bedtime, unless otherwise directed by your doctor. The vaginal tampon form of miconazole should be left in the vagina overnight and removed the next morning.\n\n【32】This medicine is usually inserted into the vagina with an applicator. However, if you are pregnant, check with your doctor before using the applicator.\n\n【33】Some of the vaginal suppositories or tablets come packaged with a small tube of cream. This cream can be applied outside of the vagina in the genital area to treat itching. The packages are called combination, dual, or twin packs.\n\n【34】To help clear up your infection completely, it is very important that you keep using this medicine for the full time of treatment , even if your symptoms begin to clear up after a few days. If you stop using this medicine too soon, your symptoms may return. Do not miss any doses. Also, do not stop using this medicine if your menstrual period starts during the time of treatment.\n\n【35】### Dosing\n\n【36】The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【37】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【38】#### For butoconazole\n\n【39】*   For yeast infection:\n    *   For vaginal cream dosage form:\n        *   Adults and teenagers—\n            *   Women who are not pregnant: 100 milligrams (mg) (one full applicator) of 2% cream inserted into the vagina at bedtime for three nights in a row.\n            *   Pregnant women, after the third month: 100 mg (one full applicator) of 2% cream inserted into the vagina at bedtime for six nights in a row.\n        *   Children up to 12 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For vaginal suppository dosage form:\n        *   Adults and teenagers—\n            *   Women who are not pregnant: 100 mg (one suppository) inserted into the vagina at bedtime for three nights in a row.\n        *   Children up to 12 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【40】#### For clotrimazole\n\n【41】*   For yeast infection:\n    *   For vaginal cream dosage form:\n        *   Adults and teenagers—The dose depends on the strength of the cream.\n            *   1% cream: 50 milligrams (mg) (one full applicator) inserted into the vagina at bedtime for six to fourteen nights in a row.\n            *   2% cream: 100 mg (one full applicator) inserted into the vagina at bedtime for three nights in a row.\n            *   10% cream: 500 mg (one full applicator) inserted into the vagina at bedtime for one night only.\n        *   Children up to 12 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For vaginal tablet dosage form:\n        *   Adults and teenagers—The dose depends on the strength of the vaginal tablet.\n            *   Women who are not pregnant:\n                *   100-mg tablet: Insert one tablet into the vagina at bedtime for six or seven nights in a row.\n                *   200-mg tablet: Insert one tablet into the vagina at bedtime for three nights in a row.\n                *   500-mg tablet: Insert one tablet into the vagina at bedtime for one night only.\n            *   Pregnant women: 100 mg (one vaginal tablet) inserted into the vagina at bedtime for seven nights in a row.\n        *   Children up to 12 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【42】#### For econazole\n\n【43】*   For yeast infection:\n    *   For vaginal suppository dosage form:\n        *   Adults and teenagers—150 milligrams (mg) (one vaginal suppository) inserted into the vagina at bedtime for three nights in a row.\n        *   Children up to 12 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【44】#### For miconazole\n\n【45】*   For yeast infection:\n    *   For vaginal cream dosage form:\n        *   Adults and teenagers—20 milligrams (one full applicator) inserted into the vagina at bedtime for seven nights in a row.

Do not double doses.\n\n【52】### Storage\n\n【53】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【54】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【55】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【56】Keep the vaginal cream, ointment, and suppository forms of this medicine from freezing.\n\n【57】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【58】If your symptoms do not improve within 3 days or have not disappeared in 7 days, or if they become worse, check with your doctor. The 1- or 3-day treatments may take up to 7 days to completely clear up your infection. However, not all vaginal infections are caused by yeast. If symptoms occur again within 2 months, check with your doctor.\n\n【59】Vaginal medicines usually will come out of the vagina during treatment. To keep the medicine from getting on your clothing, wear a minipad or sanitary napkin. The use of nonmedicated tampons (like those used for menstrual periods) is not recommended since they may soak up the medicine.\n\n【60】To help clear up your infection completely and to help make sure it does not return, good health habits are also required.\n\n【61】*   Wear cotton panties (or panties or pantyhose with cotton crotches) instead of synthetic (for example, nylon or rayon) panties.\n*   Wear only clean panties.\n\n【62】If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.\n\n【63】Vaginal yeast infections are not usually spread by having sex and your sex partner does not need to be treated. However, if the sex partner has symptoms of local itching or skin irritation of the penis, he may benefit by being treated also.\n\n【64】If you use latex or rubber birth control devices (condoms, diaphragms, or cervical caps), you should wait 3 days after treatment with azole antifungal agents before using them again. Many brands of vaginal azoles contain oils in the product that can weaken these devices. This increases the chances of a condom breaking during sexual intercourse. The rubber in cervical caps or diaphragms may break down faster and wear out sooner. Check with your health care professional to make sure the vaginal azole product you are using can be used with latex rubber birth control devices.\n\n【65】Check with your doctor before douching to obtain advice about whether you may douche and, if allowed, the proper method.\n\n【66】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【67】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【68】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【69】#### Less common\n\n【70】1.  Vaginal burning, itching, discharge, or other irritation not present before use of this medicine\n\n【71】#### Rare\n\n【72】1.  Skin rash or hives\n\n【73】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【74】#### Less common or rare\n\n【75】1.  Abdominal or stomach cramps or pain\n2.  burning or irritation of penis of sexual partner\n3.  headache\n\n【76】无关删除-1:<u>Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients.

{"seq_id": "598589f4-9672-4666-aff4-6b2342b3b8ba", "title": "Scrotal masses", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Scrotal masses are lumps or swelling in the scrotum, the bag of skin that holds the testicles.\n\n【2】Scrotal masses might be:\n\n【3】*   A buildup of fluids.\n*   The growth of irregular tissue.\n*   Swollen, inflamed or hardened parts inside the scrotum.\n\n【4】It's key to get a scrotal mass checked by a health care professional, even if you don't have pain or other symptoms. Some masses could be cancer. Or they could be caused by another medical condition that affects the health of the testicles and how well they work.\n\n【5】Each month, check your scrotum for any changes. Also get the area checked during regular health checkups. This can help you spot masses early, when many treatments work better.\n\n【6】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【7】Symptoms of scrotal masses vary. Some cause pain and others don't. It depends on the cause. Symptoms of a scrotal mass might include:\n\n【8】*   An unusual lump.\n*   Sudden pain.\n*   Dull aching or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum.\n*   Pain that spreads all over the groin, stomach area or lower back.\n*   A tender, swollen or hardened testicle or epididymis (ep-ih-DID-uh-miss). The epididymis is the soft, comma-shaped tube above and behind the testicle that stores and transports sperm.\n*   Swelling in the scrotum.\n*   A change in color of the skin of the scrotum.\n*   Upset stomach or vomiting.\n\n【9】If an infection causes a scrotal mass, symptoms also might include:\n\n【10】*   Fever.\n*   Needing to pee often.\n*   Pus or blood in the urine.\n\n【11】### When to see a doctor\n\n【12】Get emergency medical care if you have sudden pain in your scrotum. Some problems need to be treated right away to help prevent permanent damage to a testicle.\n\n【13】See a health care professional if you notice a lump in your scrotum or other unusual changes. Get a checkup even if you have a mass that isn't painful or tender.\n\n【14】Some scrotal masses are more common in children. See your child's pediatrician or other health care professional if:\n\n【15】*   Your child has symptoms of a scrotal mass.\n*   You have any concerns about your child's genitals.\n*   A testicle is \"missing.\" Sometimes, a testicle doesn't move down from the stomach area into the scrotum before birth. This is called an undescended testicle. It might raise the risk of some scrotal masses later in life.\n\n【16】Causes\n------\n\n【17】Many health conditions can cause a scrotal mass or an unusual change in the scrotum. These include:\n\n【18】*   **Testicular cancer.** This is cancer that starts in the testicles. It often causes a painless lump or swelling in the scrotum. But some people with testicular cancer don't have any symptoms. See your doctor or other health care professional if you notice a new lump in your scrotum.\n*   **Spermatocele.** This fluid-filled sac in the scrotum is often above the testicle. It tends to be painless. And usually, it's not cancer. A spermatocele also is known as a spermatic cyst or epididymal cyst.\n*   **Epididymitis.** This is when the coiled tube at the back of the testicle, called the epididymis, becomes inflamed.\n\n【19】    Often, epididymitis is caused by an infection with bacteria. For instance, bacterial infections that spread through sex, such as chlamydia, can cause it. Less often, a virus can lead to epididymitis.\n\n【20】*   **Orchitis.** This is when inflammation, which can include pain and swelling, affects the testicle. Usually, it's due to an illness caused by a virus, most often mumps.\n*   **Hydrocele.** This is when extra fluid collects between the layers of a sac that surrounds each testicle. Most often, there's a small amount of fluid in this space. But the excess fluid of a hydrocele can lead to a painless swelling of the scrotum.\n\n【21】    In adults, a hydrocele can happen because of an imbalance in the amounts of fluid made or absorbed. Often, this is due to an injury or infection in the scrotum.\n\n【22】    In babies, a hydrocele tends to happen because an opening between the stomach area and the scrotum hasn't properly closed during development.\n\n【23】*   **Hematocele.** This is a buildup of blood between the layers of a sac that surrounds each testicle. An injury, such as a direct hit to the testicles, is the most likely cause.\n*   **Varicocele.** This happens when the veins inside the scrotum get bigger. Varicocele is more common on the left side of the scrotum due to differences in how blood flows from each side. A varicocele might cause infertility, which is when you can't get your partner pregnant after a year of unprotected sex.\n*   **Inguinal hernia.** This is when part of the small intestine pushes through an opening or weak spot in the tissue that separates the stomach area and groin. It might appear as a mass in the scrotum or higher in the groin.\n\n【24】    In infants, an inguinal hernia often happens before birth when the passageway from the stomach area to the scrotum doesn't close.\n\n【25】*   **Testicular torsion.** This is a painful problem that cuts off blood to the testicle. It happens due to a twisting of the spermatic cord. That's a bundle of blood vessels, nerves and the tube that carries semen from the testicle to the penis. Without prompt treatment, testicular torsion can lead to the loss of the testicle.\n\n【26】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【27】Things that can raise the risk of a scrotal mass include:\n\n【28】*   **Undescended testicle.** An undescended testicle doesn't leave the stomach area and move down into the scrotum before birth or in the months afterward.\n*   **Conditions present at birth.** Some people are born with irregular changes in the testicles, penis or kidneys. These might raise the risk of a scrotal mass and testicular cancer later in life.\n*   **History of testicular cancer.** If you've had cancer in one testicle, your risk of getting cancer in the other testicle is higher. Having a parent or a sibling who's had testicular cancer also raises your risk.\n\n【29】Complications\n-------------\n\n【30】Not all scrotal masses lead to long-term medical conditions. But any mass that affects the health or function of the testicle can result in:\n\n【31】*   Delayed or poor development during puberty.\n*   Infertility.\n\n【32】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Larger differences in satisfaction were reported in the areas of patient efforts with disease prevention and management of chronic diseases. Smaller differences in satisfaction were reported for issues related to communication and cultural beliefs and practices. These differences persisted after controlling for patient demographics, physician, and visit characteristics.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Patients' ethnicity affects physician satisfaction with clinical encounters, particularly in the delivery of preventive care and chronic disease management.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】PC ( principal component ), PCA ( PC analysis ), VAF ( visit assessment form )\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

However, the severity of a disease state and its rate of progression are typically overestimated simply because it is the most ill patients who present to a physician. Histoplasmosis was once regarded as a uniformly fatal infection; most patients with factor V Leiden were believed to be at high risk for venous thrombosis, and patients with Gaucher disease were expected to show relentless progression. The situation is no different with hereditary hemochromatosis. Because hereditary iron storage disease can present with cirrhosis, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy, many physicians have assumed that this end stage would ultimately occur in most patients with the homozygous hemochromatosis genotype if they were not so fortunate as to have a diagnosis made by an alert physician and early treatment with phlebotomy. Indeed, this concept is intrinsic to an often cited study\n\n【1】无关删除-2:<u>*   Niederau C\n*   Fischer R\n*   Sonnenberg A\n*   Stremmel W\n*   Trampisch HJ\n*   Strohmeyer G</u>\n\n【2】Survival and causes of death in cirrhotic and in noncirrhotic patients with primary hemochromatosis.\n\n【3】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_N Engl J Med._ 1985; 313 : 1256-1262</u></u>\n\n【4】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (981)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【5】that showed that noncirrhotic persons with hemochromatosis have a normal life span if they undergo phlebotomy. Such patients were characterized as being “precirrhotic,” as if one could assume that without intervention they would surely become cirrhotic. There is now ample evidence that homozygotes for hemochromatosis also have a normal life span even if they do not undergo phlebotomy.\n\n【6】无关删除-2:<u>*   Beutler E\n*   Felitti VJ\n*   Koziol JA\n*   Ho NJ\n*   Gelbart T</u>\n\n【7】Penetrance of the 845G→A (C282Y) _HFE_ hereditary haemochromatosis mutation in the USA.\n\n【8】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Lancet._ 2002; 359 : 211-218</u></u>\n\n【9】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (746)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-2:<u>*   Waalen J\n*   Felitti V\n*   Gelbart T\n*   Ho NJ\n*   Beutler E</u>\n\n【11】Prevalence of hemochromatosis-related symptoms among individuals with mutations in the _HFE_ gene.\n\n【12】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2002; 77 : 522-530</u></u>\n\n【13】无关删除-2:<u>*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (58)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【14】The misconception that these patients were saved by treatment was due to a lack of understanding of the natural history of the disease.\n\n【15】How does one define the clinical course in a disease such as hemochromatosis? It is essential that an unbiased sample of patients be studied. In hemochromatosis, this involves genotyping a large number of persons in the general population at a broad range of ages and comparing the health of “at-risk” individuals to that of well-matched controls. Of course, one must make certain that the sickest patients have not died or are so ill that they are not represented in the sample studied. This can be achieved by determining whether the number of identified hemochromatosis-susceptible homozygotes meets the Hardy-Weinberg expectation at all ages. In hemochromatosis this is the case. After one is certain that the study population is not biased, a “cross-sectional” assessment of the course of the disease is possible by stratifying the population by age.

{"seq_id": "f56be5ac-6be9-4fa4-9988-277c082e5510", "title": "Jet lag disorder", "text": "【0】Jet lag disorder\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】Jet lag, also called jet lag disorder, is a temporary sleep problem that can affect anyone who quickly travels across several time zones.\n\n【2】Your body has its own internal clock, called circadian rhythms. They signal to your body when to stay awake and when to sleep.\n\n【3】Jet lag occurs because your body's internal clock is synced to your original time zone. It hasn't changed to the time zone of where you've traveled. The more time zones crossed, the more likely you are to experience jet lag.\n\n【4】Jet lag can cause daytime fatigue, an unwell feeling, trouble staying alert and stomach problems. Although symptoms are temporary, they can affect your comfort while on vacation or during a business trip. But you can take steps to help prevent or lessen the effects of jet lag.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Symptoms of jet lag can vary. You may experience only one symptom or you may have many. Jet lag symptoms may include:\n\n【7】*   Sleep problems such as not being able to fall asleep or waking up early.\n*   Daytime fatigue.\n*   Not being able to focus or function at your usual level.\n*   Stomach problems such as constipation or diarrhea.\n*   A general feeling of not being well.\n*   Mood changes.\n\n【8】### Symptoms are worse the farther you travel\n\n【9】Jet lag symptoms usually occur within a day or two after traveling across at least two time zones. Symptoms are likely to be worse or last longer the farther you travel. This is especially true if you fly east. It usually takes about a day to recover for each time zone crossed.\n\n【10】### When to see a doctor\n\n【11】Jet lag is temporary. But if you travel often and experience jet lag, you may benefit from seeing a sleep specialist.\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】### A disruption to your circadian rhythms\n\n【14】Jet lag can occur anytime you cross two or more time zones. Crossing multiple time zones puts your internal clock out of sync with the time in your new locale. Your internal clock, also called circadian rhythms, regulates your sleep-wake cycle.\n\n【15】For example, if you leave New York on a flight at 4 p.m. on Tuesday and arrive in Paris at 7 a.m. Wednesday, your internal clock still thinks it's 1 a.m. That means you're ready for bed just as Parisians are waking up.\n\n【16】It takes a few days for your body to adjust. In the meantime, your sleep-wake cycle and other body functions such as hunger and bowel habits remain out of step with the rest of Paris.\n\n【17】### The effect of sunlight\n\n【18】A key influence on circadian rhythms is sunlight. Light affects the regulation of melatonin, a hormone that helps cells throughout the body work together.\n\n【19】Cells in the tissue at the back of the eye transmit light signals to an area of the brain called the hypothalamus. When the light is low at night, the hypothalamus signals to a small organ in the brain called the pineal gland to release melatonin. During daylight hours, the opposite occurs. The pineal gland releases very little melatonin.\n\n【20】Because light is so crucial to your internal clock, you may be able to ease your adjustment to a new time zone by exposing yourself to daylight. However, the timing of light needs to be done properly.\n\n【21】### Airline cabin pressure and atmosphere\n\n【22】Some research shows that changes in cabin pressure and high altitudes associated with air travel may contribute to some symptoms of jet lag, regardless of travel across time zones.\n\n【23】In addition, humidity levels are low in planes. If you don't drink enough water during your flight, you can get slightly dehydrated. Dehydration also may contribute to some symptoms of jet lag.\n\n【24】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【25】Factors that increase the likelihood you'll experience jet lag include:\n\n【26】*   **Number of time zones crossed.** The more time zones you cross, the more likely you are to feel jet lag.\n*   **Flying east.** You may find it harder to fly east, when you \"lose\" time, than to fly west, when you \"gain\" time.\n*   **Being a frequent flyer.** Pilots, flight attendants and business travelers are most likely to experience jet lag.\n*   **Being an older adult.** Older adults may need more time to recover from jet lag.\n\n【27】Complications\n-------------\n\n【28】Auto accidents caused by drowsy driving may be more likely in people who are jet-lagged.\n\n【29】Prevention\n----------\n\n【30】A few basic steps may help prevent jet lag or reduce its effects:\n\n【31】*   **Arrive early.** If you have an important meeting or other event that requires you to be in top form, try to arrive a few days early to give your body a chance to adjust.\n*   **Get plenty of rest before your trip.** Starting out sleep deprived makes jet lag worse.\n*   **Gradually adjust your schedule before you leave.** If you're traveling east, try going to bed one hour earlier each night for a few days before your trip. If you're flying west, go to bed one hour later for several nights before you fly. If possible, eat meals closer to the time you'll be eating them during your trip.\n*   **Properly time bright light exposure.** Light exposure is a prime influence on your body's circadian rhythms. After traveling west, expose yourself to light in the evening to help you adjust to a later than usual time zone. After traveling east, expose yourself to morning light to adapt to an earlier time zone.\n\n【32】    The one exception is if you've traveled across more than eight time zones. Your body might mistake early-morning light for evening dusk. It also might mistake evening light for early-morning light.\n\n【33】    So if you've traveled more than eight time zones to the east, wear sunglasses and avoid bright light in the morning. Then allow as much sunlight as possible in the late afternoon for the first few days in your new location.\n\n【34】    If you've traveled west by more than eight time zones, avoid sunlight a few hours before dark for the first few days to adjust to the local time.\n\n【35】*   **Stay on your new schedule.** Set your watch or phone to the new time before you leave. Once you reach your destination, try not to sleep until the local nighttime, no matter how tired you are. Try to time your meals with local mealtimes too.\n*   **Stay hydrated.** Drink plenty of water before, during and after your flight to counteract the effects of dry cabin air. Dehydration can make jet lag symptoms worse. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, as these can dehydrate you and affect your sleep.\n*   **Try to sleep on the plane if it's nighttime at your destination.** Earplugs, headphones and eye masks can help block noise and light. If it's daytime where you're going, resist the urge to sleep.\n\n【36】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

He attended school in nearby Kovno (Kaunas), the second-largest city in Lithuania after Vilnius, and subsequently entered the Gymnasium in the Prussian city of Königsberg after the family moved to that city in 1872 to escape Russian persecution. He then studied medicine in Königsberg, Freiburg, and Strassburg (Strasbourg), finishing his doctorate at the University of Königsberg in 1881. He spent the next 10 years in the department of Professor Bernhard Naunyn (1839-1925) and then followed him to Strassburg as Associate Professor of Medicine.</u>\n\n【4】Minkowski was well-known for his manual dexterity, and he became the first to remove a liver from a living animal in the late 1880s, demonstrating that the liver was critical for bile production. A chance meeting with Joseph von Mering (1849-1908) in the University library led to a discussion of pancreatic enzymes and ultimately a collaboration that showed that total pancreatectomy in dogs produced severe diabetes. Von Mering, echoing physiologist Claude Bernard, held the view that animals could not survive total pancreatectomy. He challenged Minkowski to prove him wrong, and on the following day Minkowski performed the first pancreatectomy with the assistance of von Mering. As the investigators had predicted, the dog developed severe diabetes manifested by glycosuria, polydipsia, polyuria, weakness, and weight loss. Minkowski then proceeded to perform total pancreatectomies on three more dogs, who also survived and developed diabetes. In 1889, Minkowski prepared a manuscript reporting their pancreatectomy results, emphasizing that no other organs were damaged during the surgical procedure; he put von Mering’s name first out of “courtesy” and also because von Mering was older than himself.\n\n【5】Although Minkowski had become a Prussian citizen and converted to Christianity, he was initially turned down for multiple professorships because he was of Jewish origin. Minkowski became chief physician at a community hospital in Köln and then in 1905 was named Professor of Medicine at Greifswald. B.A. Houssay, Nobel Prize winner from Argentina, sent a personal memorandum to the Prussian Minister of Education stating that “this man of great worth was continually being passed over for incomprehensible reasons.” Fortunately, in 1909 he became an “ordinarius” Professor in Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland) where he remained until retirement in 1926.\n\n【6】In 1923, Minkowski and a team of other eminent European physicians were called to Moscow to care for Vladimir Lenin following a suspected stroke. The physicians could not agree on a diagnosis, and Lenin died the following year after another stroke and a seizure. Following retirement, Minkowski lived in Wiesbaden and then the Schloss-Sanatorium in Fürstenberg, where he died from bronchial pneumonia and thrombosis in 1931. His widow subsequently had to leave Germany because of rising persecution of Jews. Her escape was made possible by financial assistance from Charles Best. Minkowski's brother Hermann (1864-1909) was a famed mathematician who studied the geometry of numbers, and his son Rudolph (1895-1976) was a noted astronomer who led the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey in the 1950s.\n\n【7】In 1900, Oscar Minkowski described a familial hemolytic anemia (Minkowski-Chauffard Syndrome), now known as hereditary spherocytosis. He also recognized Korsakoff’s syndrome (a neurological disorder caused by thiamine deficiency) before Sergei Korsakoff. In addition, he described a patient with acromegaly in 1887 who had defects in the visual fields of both eyes from the marked enlargement of the pituitary gland found at autopsy. Minkowski was honored with a stamp issued by Lithuania (Scott #984) in 2012 and by the defunct Transkei (Scott #237) in 1990. His name is also linked to a prize given annually for meritorious research by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Article info\n------------</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Identification</u>\n\n【10】删除3:<u>无关删除-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2014.06.026</u></u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>### Copyright</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>© 2015 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Values for the test performance characteristics and prevalence of malignancy in patients with SLN were obtained from the medical literature. The target population was adult patients known or suspected to have NSCLC with SLNs with a short axis length of at least 10 mm on thoracic computed tomography (CT).\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】The lowest-cost diagnostic work-up was by initial evaluation with endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS FNA) biopsy ($11,490 per patient) compared with mediastinoscopy (with biopsy) ($13,658), transbronchial FNA biopsy ($11,963), CT- guided FNA biopsy ($13,027), and positron emission tomography ($12,887). The results were sensitive to rate of SLN metastases and EUS FNA sensitivity. The EUS FNA biopsy remained least costly if the probability of SLN metastases exceeded 24% or EUS FNA sensitivity was higher than 76%. Primary mediastinoscopy was the most economical if not.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Which testing strategy is least costly for SLN evaluation in a modeled patient with NSCLC may be determined by the pretest probability of nodal metastases.

In our contemporary world, upward mobility in socioeconomic status is often a function of successful attainment of higher education. One may justifiably ask if all sociodemographic groups in the United States have equal access to higher education so they can gain knowledge and acquire skill sets often necessary to lead a productive life. Several biopsychosocial factors may determine as to whether those that see the “mountain” of higher education at a distance will eventually succeed at surmounting obstacles to rise to the highest peaks. In this article, our earlier experiences are analyzed with the goal of offering insights into novel approaches to train meritorious learners from all sociodemographic groups, including those who come from underserved communities. In addition, we highlight an apolitical and academically rigorous social cognition model that informs the contemporary academic agenda of diversity and inclusion, and we trace its root to the work of the founding father of experimental social psychology.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AAMC ( Association of American Medical Colleges ), GME ( graduate medical education ), HBCU ( Historically Black Colleges and Universities ), MCAT ( Medical College Admission Test ), MCCMS ( Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science ), NAS ( National Academy of Sciences ), NIH ( National Institutes of Health ), UPS ( Undergraduate Plummer Scholar ), VMS ( Visiting Medical Students )\n\n【4】It is an axiomatic truth that education—in particular, higher education—holds the key to better living.

Are all citizens of our country, irrespective of sociodemographic status, at the table of the “feast” of higher education to gain knowledge and acquire skill sets to lead a productive life?

Furthermore, the investigators examined tax forms filed by the parents of the 1978 to 1983 birth cohort to estimate parental income. This enabled the investigators to observe the differences in income mobility across generations of 5 racial and ethnic groups (persons of Hispanic origin, non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks, Asians, and American Indians). They concluded that, on average, Asians have the highest upward income mobility across generations. Hispanic Americans also have started to show an upward economic mobility, thus closing the gap between them and Whites. On the other hand, Blacks and American Indians show downward economic mobility across generations. In addition, the study investigated the differences by sex on intergenerational economic mobility. Overall, the Black–White income gap was primarily driven by the lower income earned by Black men but not women. This means, on average, that Black men in particular earn less than their parents. Furthermore, more germane to this manuscript, “innate” abilities, as measured by test scores, did not explain the Black–White income gap.\n\n【29】无关删除-2:<u>*   Chetty R.\n*   Hendren N.\n*   Jones M.R.\n*   Porter S.R.</u>\n\n【30】Race and Economic Opportunity in the United States: An Intergenerational Perspective.\n\n【31】National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper , 2018\n\n【32】删除3:<u>https://www.nber.org/papers/w24441.pdf</u>\n\n【33】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【34】Educational Disparities in Science and Medicine\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【35】The disproportionate challenge that Black men and American Indians face is not limited to downward income mobility.

Health care disparities are driven by numerous factors including discrimination. Academicians and clinicians from diverse backgrounds are vital as society as a whole strives to alleviate health care disparities in general, to dispel discrimination, and to ensure equal delivery of health care. In particular, biomedical academic centers need to strategize and develop robust programs to encourage and mentor those who are interested in health disparity and minority education, regardless of race or ethnicity. It is important to note that commitment to learners of diverse backgrounds is not only the “right and moral thing to do;” it is also indicated because such learners and practitioners contribute their own unique perspectives, understanding, and roles from which the medical community and society as a whole benefits. Furthermore, medical school, in particular, represents a proximate and critical portal in the entry of students in the stream of medical training and careers. Medical school is the necessary first step before residency, fellowship, other postdoctoral training, subspecialty clinical and research training, and—finally—junior and senior faculty positions in academic medicine and clinical careers. Because of the unique situation of medical schools as the critical first step in this career stream, medical schools may exert major and distant effects on the career steps that follow. Thus, any initiatives and objectives are especially important at the entry level of medical school and can have lasting beneficial effects on the stream of medical training and careers that follow.\n\n【73】Mayo Clinic’s Response to the National Call\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【74】Mayo Clinic is well known for its triple-shield motto of integrated excellence in patient care, research, and education. From its inception, education and mentorship have been foundational cornerstones of Mayo Clinic. The pioneering physician and founder, Dr William Worrall Mayo, was the father and mentor of his physician sons, William J. Mayo and Charles H. Mayo, who established the Mayo Foundation for Research and Education.\n\n【75】无关删除-2:<u>*   Clapesattle H.</u>\n\n【76】The Mayo Brothers.\n\n【77】Houghton Mifflin Company , Boston, MA 1962\n\n【78】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【79】Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science (MCCMS) strives to train meritorious learners from all sociodemographic groups, including men and women who come from communities that have endured centuries of profound health disparities. Approximately 2 years ago, a strategic initiative was taken to create pipeline programs to attract the most talented and highly meritorious students across all sociodemographic groups, including those learners who come from communities that have endured longstanding health disparities.\n\n【80】Simultaneously, it was also determined that the admissions process should elevate admission metrics (Medical College Admission Test \\[MCAT\\] and grade point average \\[GPA\\]), while increasing diversity. This approach challenged 2 prevailing pessimistic assumptions: (1) Because of a limited candidate pool, it is difficult to identify high metric scoring, under-represented minority students or learners who are interested in minority education, and (2) highly meritorious learners may be inclined to matriculate to prestigious East and West Coast schools. There is some merit to the first assumption, as the psychometric property of standardized tests is deeply rooted in the mainstream culture; thus, it would be difficult to identify minority learners who excel in standardized tests such as MCAT. However, these assumptions were challenged by launching the programs as described here.\n\n【81】New Initiatives to Attract Meritorious Learners at the MCCMS\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【82】### The William Worrall Scholars Program\n\n【83】删除3:<u>Major medical schools compete for highly meritorious learners who come from communities that have endured profound health disparities. Thus, in 2017, the Executive Dean of the MCCMS (F.B.M.) proposed to establish the William Worrall Scholars Program. It was named after Dr William Worrall, who was the father and mentor of his 2 sons, William J. Mayo and Charles Mayo. The name emphasizes the importance of mentorship in preparing the scholars for a competitive application that will reach or exceed the bar for Mayo Clinic. This mentorship program is designed to mentor premedical students who come from underserved communities and have very high MCAT and GPA scores. To maintain the integrity of the admission process, the William Worrall Scholars Program was established to be independent of the medical school admission process. Meritorious students are invited to visit the Mayo Clinic and the School of Medicine. A significant component of the program is to assign each interested student to a Mayo Clinic faculty member whose responsibility it is to help the student navigate through the medical school application process. We have encouraging preliminary results. The first cohort of 20 Worrall Scholars was recruited in 2017; of them, 4 (25%) matriculated to Mayo Clinic School of Medicine. One of the key roles of the Worrall Program is what we refer to as “catalytic role” in the recruitment of highly meritorious under-represented minority students in medicine. We believe that Worrall Scholars Program has provided insight as to the presence of the very high academic metrics of scholars who come from highly disadvantaged communities. Against all odds, the Worrall Scholars have demonstrated exceptional academic success. For example, in 2017, there was no African-American applicant who matriculated to the Arizona campus of Mayo Clinic School of Medicine, whereas, in 2018, there were 8 highly meritorious African-Americans who matriculated to the Arizona campus of Mayo Clinic School of Medicine. There could be several explanations for this. However, one of the leading explanations is the catalytic role of the Worrall Scholars Program in demonstrating that indeed there are highly meritorious underrepresented minority applicants. The key is making a concerted effort to identify a mentor and facilitate the recruitment to major academic centers.</u>\n\n【84】### The Wilson Scholars Program\n\n【85】This program was named after Dr Louis Wilson, who had a pioneering role in establishing the residency and fellowship programs at Mayo Clinic. The Wilson Program builds upon the diversity scholarship program of the Visiting Medical Students (VMS) program. The VMS program provides a diversity scholarship for meritorious medical students who come from underserved communities to support clerkship experiences at Mayo Clinic. Also, the scholars receive training in interview skills and other relevant skill sets that would make them more competitive in their application for graduate medical education (GME). The Wilson Scholars Program has established a steering committee that identifies Wilson Scholars and pairs them with GME mentors. The steering committee also defines the competitive criteria for the selection of Wilson Scholars. The design and conduct of the Wilson program is carefully designed to being cognizant of regulatory bodies of GME. Thus, the program prepares scholars to be competitive for residency and fellowship programs. However, of note, being a VMS or Wilson Scholar does not guarantee an interview, consideration for matching, or matriculation into GME.\n\n【86】### The Undergraduate Plummer Scholar Program\n\n【87】This program was named after the legendary Mayo Clinic internist Dr Henry Plummer, who, among his numerous accomplishments, discovered toxic nodular goiter, which was named after him as Plummer disease. Dr Henry Plummer was a “multitalented genius” in medicine and architecture, in the words of Dr Charles Mayo.\n\n【88】无关删除-2:<u>*   Clapesattle H.</u>\n\n【89】The Mayo Brothers.\n\n【90】Houghton Mifflin Company , Boston, MA 1962\n\n【91】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【92】The Undergraduate Plummer Scholar (UPS) Program identifies highly meritorious undergraduate students that have not yet taken MCAT. The UPS Program is designed to attract students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds and who could benefit from mentorship and opportunities to visit and observe the work of Mayo Clinic staff. The UPS acknowledges the limitations in test-taking skills that are observed among students who come from underserved communities. Therefore, it aims to mentor the UPS scholars in these critical test skills long before they apply to medical or graduate schools.\n\n【93】Existing Initiatives to Attract Meritorious Learners at the MCCMS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【94】### National Institutes of Health-Funded Program at Mayo Clinic\n\n【95】The prestige and recognition of a pipeline program is in part dependent upon successfully competing for extramural funding to ensure the longevity of the pipeline programs. The Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences is one of the first programs in the United States that had the vision and insight of training biomedical researchers of all sociodemographic groups including minority learners. Indeed, under the leadership of Dr Richard McGee and colleagues, the graduate school was the first to successfully apply for National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding as early as 1991 to train diverse learners in biomedical research. The R25 funding program is now in its 25th year and has supported the training of minority students for summer research, post-baccalaureate, medical school, PhD, and MD/PhD programs. The post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) and Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) consistently have been funded by an R25 funding mechanism of the NIH for more than 25 years. The detailed work and outcome of the R25 program is extensive and a topic for a detailed and separate publication.\n\n【96】### Career Immersion Program for High School Students\n\n【97】For nearly 4 years, Mayo Clinic School of Health Sciences has been running a yearly career immersion program for highly motivated high school students, including minority students who want to pursue a career in health sciences. This program has been highly successful in recruiting students who come from underserved communities to pursue training at Mayo Clinic. Within the past year, a new pipeline program was launched at Mayo Clinic in Arizona to identify and mentor highly meritorious high school students who come from underserved communities. However, our grassroots initiatives are not limited to highly meritorious learners. For example, Mayo Clinic also partners with a community education center in Rochester, Minnesota, known as the Hawthorne Education Center. Approximately 85% of learners in this community education center are at—or below—the poverty level. The center educates nontraditional students who need additional skills to lead productive lives. Thus, Mayo Clinic School of Health Sciences partners with the Hawthorne Education Center to assist learners to improve their skills in testmanship as well as in submitting competitive applications to educational institutions.\n\n【98】Establishing Collaborations With Institutions That Train Students of Diverse Backgrounds\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【99】The Office for Diversity, which was established at Mayo Medical School in 2008, launched initiatives to explore potential collaborations with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Mayo Clinic faculty members organized visits to HBCUs, and this has led to mutually beneficial activities for both Mayo Clinic and HBCUs. Highly talented and meritorious learners who are under-represented minorities have been recruited from HBCUs, and some of them subsequently have become faculty members at Mayo Clinic. Also, in 2018, we established a Dean’s scholar program, in which 6 medical students from Meharry Medical College come to Mayo Clinic for a summer research experience. In addition, there is an ongoing discussion between MCCMS and Morehouse School of Medicine to establish an education and training collaboration in residency and fellowship. Furthermore, Mayo Clinic has a collaboration with University of Mississippi in Jackson, Mississippi, to conduct cognitive research in addition to other studies. Also, Mayo Clinic has an ongoing presence among American Indians in Northern Minnesota, involving education and research relevant to the community.\n\n【100】The Challenge of Retaining and Supporting the Success of Learners\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【101】Recruiting meritorious learners is only half the solution. Mandatory in this process is the successful completion of training of future physicians and scientists of diverse backgrounds. The well-informed learner is grounded in a sound understanding of major historical events that shaped higher education 删除4:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Knowledge of this historical framework informs an accurate understanding of current events and contributes to the promotion of resiliency in the face of adversity among learners who come from underserved communities. The details of this and related psychological constructs that may inform the dialogue pertaining to health disparities in education are discussed as follows.\n\n【102】Figure 3 Milestones of the path to higher education for African-Americans. _Data from_ Duster T, The long path to higher education for African Americans.\n\n【103】_Thought & Action._ 2009:25:99-110;\n\n【104】无关删除-2:<u>*   Duster T.</u>\n\n【105】The long path to higher education for African Americans.\n\n【106】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Thought & Action._ 2009; 25 : 99-110</u></u>\n\n【107】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【108】with permission.\n\n【109】无关删除-2:<u>*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【110】Proposed Theoretical Frameworks to Inform the Academic Discourse on Diversity and Inclusion\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【111】In this section, we would like to identify and expand upon various theoretical frameworks that inform the academic discourse on diversity and inclusion.\n\n【112】### The Construct of Diversity and Inclusion\n\n【113】Social scientists and experts on group dynamics have identified 3 major defining attributes of a group: A group is formed by 2 or more persons who have a shared goal and are bound by social interactions.\n\n【114】无关删除-2:<u>*   Aronson E.\n*   Wilson T.D.\n*   Sommers S.R.</u>\n\n【115】Social Psychology.\n\n【116】9th ed.

The diversity brings about various perspectives that can move the group to a new frontier. An overemphasis of diversity may lead to fragmentation of a group; on the other hand, excessive emphasis on group cohesiveness may lead to what social psychologists refer to as “group think,” in which the group cohesiveness goes to the point of being oblivious or bluntly resistant to challenging and competing views and opinions.\n\n【119】无关删除-2:<u>*   Aronson E.\n*   Wilson T.D.\n*   Sommers S.R.</u>\n\n【120】Social Psychology.\n\n【121】9th ed.

It is with this in mind that we have assembled various activities to advance diversity and inclusion within MCCMS.\n\n【124】### Defining the Guiding Values of Diversity and Inclusion\n\n【125】The various pipeline programs have identified meritorious students who come from backgrounds of low socioeconomic status or are identified by national organizations to be under-represented in medicine and biomedical science. The pipeline programs and other activities of diversity and inclusion within the MCCMS are guided by 2 values: the time- honored values of academic freedom and integrity. It is commonly observed that conversations about diversity and inclusion can create discomfort. There can be many explanations for this. We hypothesize that fear of labeling others or being labeled as racist, homophobic, or sexist appears to intimidate people from holding frank conversations on this topic. Therefore, an explicit endorsement of academic freedom as the right to express dissenting voices freely without any real or imagined fear of retribution, on any topic—including on the construct of diversity and inclusion by learners and faculty members—will ensure a comfortable environment for all voices to be heard. The second guiding value is integrity: particularly ensuring the integrity of the admission process by taking deliberate steps to separate the recruitment initiatives from the admission process. For instance, the William Worrall Scholars Program has 3 phases out of which the screening phase and appointment phase take place before the recruitment season begins. In addition, in a memo sent out to the scholars, it is explicitly stated that being a scholar guarantees neither an interview nor appointment into the Mayo Clinic Medical School. This is also verbally emphasized to scholars when they visit Mayo Clinic campus.\n\n【126】### An Academic Model that Informs Diversity and Inclusion\n\n【127】Several disciplines are involved in the construct of diversity and inclusion. Policy makers, social activists, corporate leaders, academics, and others are invested in the construct of diversity and inclusion. The investigation of topics such as prejudice, attitude, group dynamics, and implicit bias can be traced back to Kurt Lewin, the founding father of the field of experimental social psychology.\n\n【128】无关删除-2:<u>*   Lewin K.</u>\n\n【129】A Dynamic Theory of Personality.\n\n【130】McGraw-Hill , New York, NY 1935\n\n【131】无关删除-2:<u>*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【132】He was a professor of psychology in Germany in the 1930s. He faced hostility and marginalization and was at risk of losing his life because of his Jewish identity. This experience of enduring and facing unprovoked aggression motivated him to investigate the etiology of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral components of prejudice. The field of experimental social psychology has made ground-breaking work in investigating social cognition, including implicit bias. The construct of implicit cognition was developed and pioneered by social psychologists. Subsequently, the implicit association test (IAT) was designed potentially to overcome social desirability bias, which is inherent in explicit self-report methods, and is now widely used in the field.\n\n【133】无关删除-2:<u>*   Greenwald A.G.\n*   McGhee D.E.\n*   Schwartz J.L.</u>\n\n【134】Measuring individual differences in implicit cognition: the implicit association test.\n\n【135】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_J Pers Soc Psychol._ 1998; 74 : 1464-1480</u></u>\n\n【136】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (7529)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【137】In addition, constructs such as attribution theory, social perception, social cognition, and theories about attitude and attitude change are of direct relevance to the academic discourse on diversity and inclusion.\n\n【138】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【139】The education strategy of Mayo Clinic is to train future leaders of health care from all sectors of society, including learners who come from communities that endured profound health care disparity. The MCCMS thus supports Mayo Clinic through excellence in education by purposeful mentoring and recruitment of persons from diverse backgrounds to advance superior patient care, biomedical discovery, and translational sciences. To this effect, here we report multiple initiatives to meet this challenge. The early experience is indeed encouraging, proving that there are many outstanding students of diverse backgrounds who will travel and explore new environments to advance their educations and career aspirations. Furthermore, having a specific and ongoing mentorship program, commencing at the time of matriculation, helps to ensure academic success. In addition, we propose that it is important to emphasize the necessity of using social psychological constructs to advance the dialogue pertaining to diversity and inclusion. We explicitly emphasize the time-honored approach of protecting academic freedom to nurture creative and fruitful conversations on this topic. Last, but not least, in addition to addressing the educational strategy of MCCMS, the initiatives are also responsive to the call made by the NAS and other reputable institutions to address the dwindling number of physicians and scientists who come from socioeconomic groups that had been burdened by decades of health disparity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

But the major contribution of the paper is in testing for nuance in this relationship by stratifying association by age, sex, race, and ethnicity.\n\n【26】The authors found that the impact of ADI on the prevalence of specific chronic conditions was often larger for younger adults than among those at least 70 years of age and was somewhat larger for women in half of the conditions studied. However, tests of differential effects of ADI by race and ethnicity were mostly inconclusive, hampered by a small sample of Black and Hispanic patients in the counties in the data set. Importantly, the paper controlled for individual education levels in all statistical tests, with the preponderance of results supporting the inference that ADI has an impact on chronic disease prevalence beyond the impacts of individual socioeconomic status. This demonstrates that community influences matter in addition to individual characteristics.\n\n【27】Whereas physicians and social workers have understood the connections between social conditions and health made by Virchow and others since the mid-19th century,\n\n【28】无关删除-2:<u>*   Raviglione M.\n*   Krech R.</u>\n\n【29】Tuberculosis: still a social disease.\n\n【30】删除3:<u>无关删除-2:<u>_Int J Tuberc Lung Dis._ 2011; 15 : S6-S8</u></u>\n\n【31】无关删除-2:<u>*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (26)\n*   Google Scholar</u>\n\n【32】including the Black Report of the United Kingdom,\n\n【33】无关删除-2:<u>*   Gray A.M.</u>\n\n【34】Inequalities in health.

But dying patients and their families still need healing, and clinicians can actively facilitate it. We explore the clinician's role in the healing journey through the lens of pediatric brain cancer. Specifically, we examine how clinicians can help affected families find their way from “focused hope” (which centers on cure) to “intrinsic hope,” which offers a more realistic and resilient emotional foundation as the child's death approaches and letting go becomes essential. Drawing on their clinical experience and medical knowledge, clinicians can help families comprehend the lessons that their seriously ill child's body has to teach, highlighting the importance of cherishing the present and creating new memories that outlast the disease. Clinicians can avoid the mindset of “nothing more can be done,” emphasizing that there is plenty to do in providing physical, emotional, and spiritual comfort. Clinicians can learn how to be “unconditionally present” for patients and families without immersing themselves in anguish and, eventually, how to help the family find freedom from despair and a full life that still honors the child's memory.\n\n【2】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【3】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【4】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【5】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【6】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【7】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

A total of 314 physicians within the Department of Medicine were asked to complete a Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) consisting of 22 questions regarding their primary physician leader (ie, division or department chair). The MLQ asked how frequently the physician leader exhibited specific behavior comprising 5 transformational leadership attributes (idealized attributes, idealized behavior, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration) and included 2 questions regarding satisfaction with that leader.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Leaders varied in how frequently their faculty perceived that they exhibited each behavior. Leaders were shown to exhibit the attributes “fairly often,” but not “frequently if not always.” Each of the leadership attributes highly correlated with each of the 2 satisfaction measures. However, the attributes most strongly correlated with satisfaction were among the least often displayed.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Physicians' satisfaction with their leaders is closely associated with the frequency with which leaders are perceived as exhibiting specific transformational leadership behavior. These results point to 5 specific behaviors that might be targeted to enhance both leadership skills and faculty members' satisfaction with their leaders.\n\n【8】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【9】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【10】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "69961494-15b1-41a0-8763-c90acfb8faf6", "title": "Saxagliptin (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Saxagliptin (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Onglyza\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Saxagliptin is used with proper diet and exercise to treat high blood sugar (glucose) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Saxagliptin helps to control blood sugar levels by making the pancreas gland release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar when there is too much sugar in the blood. This medicine does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes.\n\n【6】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Tablet\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【11】### Allergies\n\n【12】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【13】### Pediatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of saxagliptin in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【15】### Geriatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of saxagliptin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving saxagliptin.\n\n【17】### Breastfeeding\n\n【18】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

{"seq_id": "038e6754-bb66-4ac2-a985-c56c57c1c24b", "title": "Wrist pain", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Wrist pain is often caused by sprains or fractures from sudden injuries. But wrist pain also can result from long-term problems, such as repetitive stress, arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n【2】Because so many factors can lead to wrist pain, diagnosing the exact cause can be difficult. But an accurate diagnosis is essential for proper treatment and healing.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Wrist pain may vary, depending on the cause. For example, osteoarthritis pain often is described as being similar to a dull toothache. Carpal tunnel syndrome usually causes a pins-and-needles feeling. This tingling sensation usually occurs in the thumb and index and middle fingers, especially at night. The precise location of wrist pain also provides clues to what's behind the symptoms.\n\n【5】### When to see a doctor\n\n【6】Not all wrist pain requires medical care. Minor sprains and strains usually respond to ice, rest and pain medications you can buy without a prescription. But if pain and swelling last longer than a few days or become worse, see your health care provider. Delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to poor healing, reduced range of motion and long-term disability.\n\n【7】Causes\n------\n\n【8】Damage to any of the parts of your wrist can cause pain and affect your ability to use your wrist and hand. The damage may result from:\n\n【9】### Injuries\n\n【10】*   **Sudden impacts.** Wrist injuries often occur when you fall forward onto your outstretched hand. This can cause sprains, strains and even fractures. A scaphoid fracture involves a bone on the thumb side of the wrist. This type of fracture may not show up on X-rays immediately after the injury.\n*   **Repetitive stress.** Any activity that involves wrist motion that you do again and again can inflame the tissues around joints or cause stress fractures. Some examples include hitting a tennis ball, bowing a cello or driving cross-country. The risk of injury is increased when you perform the movement for hours on end without a break. De Quervain tenosynovitis is a repetitive stress injury that causes pain at the base of the thumb.\n\n【11】### Arthritis\n\n【12】*   **Osteoarthritis.** This type of arthritis occurs when the cartilage that cushions the ends of the bones deteriorates over time. Osteoarthritis in the wrist is uncommon and usually occurs only in people who have injured that wrist in the past.\n*   **Rheumatoid arthritis.** A disorder in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues, rheumatoid arthritis commonly involves the wrist. If one wrist is affected, the other one usually is too.\n\n【13】### Other diseases and conditions\n\n【14】*   **Carpal tunnel syndrome.** Carpal tunnel syndrome develops when there's increased pressure on the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel, a passageway in the palm side of the wrist.\n*   **Ganglion cysts.** These soft tissue cysts occur most often on the part of the wrist opposite the palm. Ganglion cysts may be painful, and pain may either worsen or improve with activity.\n*   **Kienbock disease.** This disorder typically affects young adults and involves the progressive collapse of one of the small bones in the wrist. Kienbock disease occurs when there is not enough blood supply to this bone.\n\n【15】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【16】Wrist pain can happen to anyone — whether you're very sedentary, very active or somewhere in between. But the risk may be increased by:\n\n【17】*   **Sports participation.** Wrist injuries are common in many sports, both those that involve impact and those that involve repetitive stress on the wrist. These can include football, bowling, golf, gymnastics, snowboarding and tennis.\n*   **Repetitive work.** Almost any activity that involves your hands and wrists, even knitting and cutting hair, if performed forcefully enough and often enough can lead to disabling wrist pain.\n*   **Certain diseases or conditions.** Pregnancy, diabetes, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis and gout may increase the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n【18】Prevention\n----------\n\n【19】It's impossible to prevent the unforeseen events that often cause wrist injuries, but these basic tips may offer some protection:\n\n【20】*   **Build bone strength.** Getting adequate amounts of calcium can help prevent fractures. For most adults, that means 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams a day.\n*   **Prevent falls.** Falling forward onto an outstretched hand is the main cause of most wrist injuries. To help prevent falls, wear sensible shoes. Remove home hazards. Light up your living space. And install grab bars in your bathroom and handrails on your stairways, if necessary.\n*   **Use protective gear for athletic activities.** Wear wrist guards for high-risk activities, such as football, snowboarding and rollerblading.\n*   **Pay attention to ergonomics.** If you spend long periods at a keyboard, take regular breaks. When you type, keep your wrists in a relaxed, neutral position. An ergonomic keyboard and a foam or gel wrist support may help.\n\n【21】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

A voice disorder is a change in how the voice sounds. Health care providers trained in ear, nose and throat illnesses and speech-language pathologists diagnose and treat voice issues.\n\n【2】Treatment depends on what's causing the voice change. Treatment can include voice therapy, drugs, shots or surgery.\n\n【3】Causes\n------\n\n【4】The voice box, also called the larynx, is made of a smooth covering, muscle and soft, moist areas. The voice box sits at the top of the windpipe, also known as the trachea, and the base of the tongue. The vocal cords vibrate to create sound.\n\n【5】Air moving through the voice box causes the vocal cords to vibrate and brings them closer together. The vocal cords also help close the voice box during swallowing to stop you from breathing in food or liquid.\n\n【6】If vocal cords become swollen, or inflamed, develop growths or can't move as they should, they can't work properly. Any of these might cause a voice disorder.\n\n【7】Some common voice disorders include:\n\n【8】*   Laryngitis\n*   Voice changes related to the brain and nervous system, known as spasmodic dysphonia (spaz-MOD-ki dis-FOE-nee-uh)\n*   Polyps, nodules or cysts on the vocal cords — growths that aren't cancer\n*   Precancerous and cancerous growths\n*   Vocal cord paralysis or weakness\n*   White patches, also known as leukoplakia (loo-koh-PLAY-key-uh)\n\n【9】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【10】Many factors can lead to a voice disorder, such as:\n\n【11】*   Aging\n*   Alcohol use\n*   Allergies\n*   Conditions related to the brain and nervous system, such as Parkinson's disease or a stroke\n*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n*   Illnesses, such as colds or upper respiratory infections\n*   Scarring from neck surgery or from trauma to the front of the neck\n*   Screaming\n*   Smoking\n*   Throat cancer\n*   Throat dehydration\n*   Thyroid problems\n*   Voice misuse or overuse\n\n【12】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "0e9bd957-25f2-4c2a-9e46-a350105f00d5", "title": "Hashimoto's disease", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune disorder affecting the thyroid gland. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck just below the Adam's apple. The thyroid produces hormones that help regulate many functions in the body.\n\n【2】An autoimmune disorder is an illness caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissues. In Hashimoto's disease, immune-system cells lead to the death of the thyroid's hormone-producing cells. The disease usually results in a decline in hormone production (hypothyroidism).\n\n【3】Although anyone can develop Hashimoto's disease, it's most common among middle-aged women. The primary treatment is thyroid hormone replacement.\n\n【4】Hashimoto's disease is also known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Hashimoto's disease progresses slowly over the years. You may not notice signs or symptoms of the disease. Eventually, the decline in thyroid hormone production can result in any of the following:\n\n【7】*   Fatigue and sluggishness\n*   Increased sensitivity to cold\n*   Increased sleepiness\n*   Dry skin\n*   Constipation\n*   Muscle weakness\n*   Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness\n*   Joint pain and stiffness\n*   Irregular or excessive menstrual bleeding\n*   Depression\n*   Problems with memory or concentration\n*   Swelling of the thyroid (goiter)\n*   A puffy face\n*   Brittle nails\n*   Hair loss\n*   Enlargement of the tongue\n\n【8】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【9】Signs and symptoms of Hashimoto's disease vary widely and are not specific to the disorder. Because these symptoms could result from any number of disorders, it's important to see your health care provider as soon as possible for a timely and accurate diagnosis.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune disorder. The immune system creates antibodies that attack thyroid cells as if they were bacteria, viruses or some other foreign body. The immune system wrongly enlists disease-fighting agents that damage cells and lead to cell death.\n\n【12】What causes the immune system to attack thyroid cells is not clear. The onset of disease may be related to:\n\n【13】*   Genetic factors\n*   Environmental triggers, such as infection, stress or radiation exposure\n*   Interactions between environmental and genetic factors\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】The following factors are associated with an increased risk of Hashimoto's disease:\n\n【16】*   **Sex.** Women are much more likely to get Hashimoto's disease.\n*   **Age.** Hashimoto's disease can occur at any age but more commonly occurs during middle age.\n*   **Other autoimmune disease.** Having another autoimmune disease — such as rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes or lupus — increases your risk of developing Hashimoto's disease.\n*   **Genetics and family history.** You're at higher risk for Hashimoto's disease if others in your family have thyroid disorders or other autoimmune diseases.\n*   **Pregnancy.** Typical changes in immune function during pregnancy may be a factor in Hashimoto's disease that begins after pregnancy.\n*   **Excessive iodine intake.** Too much iodine in the diet may function as a trigger among people already at risk for Hashimoto's disease.\n*   **Radiation exposure.** People exposed to excessive levels of environmental radiation are more prone to Hashimoto's disease.\n\n【17】Complications\n-------------\n\n【18】Thyroid hormones are essential for the healthy function of many body systems. Therefore, when Hashimoto's disease and hypothyroidism are left untreated, many complications can occur. These include:\n\n【19】*   **Goiter.** A goiter is enlargement of the thyroid. As thyroid hormone production declines due to Hashimoto's disease, the thyroid receives signals from the pituitary gland to make more. This cycle may result in a goiter. It's generally not uncomfortable, but a large goiter can affect your appearance and may interfere with swallowing or breathing.\n*   **Heart problems.** Hypothyroidism can result in poor heart function, an enlarged heart and irregular heartbeats. It can also result in high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the \"bad\" cholesterol — that is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and heart failure.\n*   **Mental health issues.** Depression or other mental health disorders may occur early in Hashimoto's disease and may become more severe over time.\n*   **Sexual and reproductive dysfunction.** In women, hypothyroidism can result in a reduced sexual desire (libido), an inability to ovulate, and irregular and excessive menstrual bleeding. Men with hypothyroidism may have a reduced libido, erectile dysfunction and a lowered sperm count.\n*   **Poor pregnancy outcomes.** Hypothyroidism during pregnancy may increase the risk of a miscarriage or preterm birth. Babies born to women with untreated hypothyroidism are at risk for decreased intellectual abilities, autism, speech delays and other developmental disorders.\n*   **Myxedema (miks-uh-DEE-muh).** This rare, life-threatening condition can develop due to long-term, severe, untreated hypothyroidism. Its signs and symptoms include drowsiness followed by profound lethargy and unconsciousness. A myxedema coma may be triggered by exposure to cold, sedatives, infection or other stress on your body. Myxedema requires immediate emergency medical treatment.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Eligible outpatients who had been fasting for at least 8 hours underwent venous phlebotomy at baseline, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes to measure plasma potassium levels in whole blood using a point-of-care device (i-STAT, Abbott Laboratories). We analyzed the results to assess their variability and frequency of pseudohyperkalemia and pseudonormokalemia.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 1170 patients were included in this study. Absolute differences between pairs of measurements from different time points ranged from 0 to 2.5 mmol/L, with a mean difference of 0.26 mmol/L. The mean percentage differences were approximately 5% with an SD of 5%. Approximately 12% of differences between repeated fasting potassium blood test results were above 0.5 mmol/L (33% of the normal range), and 20% of patients (234) had at least one difference greater than 0.5 mmol/L. In 44.0% of the patients with a hyperkalemic average value (true hyperkalemia) (302 of 686), at least one blood test result was in the normal range (pseudonormokalemia), and in 30.2% of the patients with a normal average value (146 of 484), at least one blood test result was elevated (pseudohyperkalemia).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Expected variability and errors exist with potassium blood tests, even when conditions are optimized. Pseudohyperkalemia and pseudonormokalemia are common, indicating a need for thoughtful clinical interpretation of unexpected test results.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CCC ( concordance correlation coefficient ), ECG ( electrocardiography )\n\n【11】无关删除-1:<u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment</u>\n\n【12】无关删除-1:<u>### Purchase one-time access:</u>\n\n【13】无关删除-1:<u>Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access</u>\n\n【14】无关删除-1:<u>One-time access price info</u>\n\n【15】无关删除-1:<u>*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'</u>\n\n【16】无关删除-1:<u>### Subscribe:</u>\n\n【17】无关删除-1:<u>Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_</u>\n\n【18】无关删除-1:<u>Already a print subscriber?
