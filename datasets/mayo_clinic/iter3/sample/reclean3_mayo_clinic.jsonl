However, we still believe that apo B has 2 major advantages compared with non–HDL-C. It is superior to non–HDL-C as a measure of cardiovascular risk and as a measure of the adequacy of lipid-lowering therapy. The first advantage we thoroughly discussed in our article but now further expand. Although a few studies may show that non–HDL-C is equivalent to apo B as a predictor of risk, most clearly demonstrate the superiority of apo B. In fact, we are not aware of any published studies to date that demonstrate the superiority of non–HDL-C compared with apo B. The Emerging Risk Factor Collaboration meta-analysis\n\n【3】Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration  \nMajor lipids, apolipoproteins, and risk of vascular disease.\n\n【4】quoted by Robinson has several methodological limitations because it arbitrarily excluded the 2 largest case-control studies in the literature that compared apo B to non–HDL-C. In addition, the study found the rather unexpected result that the measurement of non–HDL-C was no better than the measurement of directly measured LDL-C. Therefore, relying on the results of that study would also negate the use of non-HDL-C as an alternative marker of risk. This meta-analysis has several other important limitations as pointed out by others.\n\n【5】Either cholesterol or apolipoprotein levels can be used to determine risk for CVD; triglycerides are not useful.\n\n【6】Regarding the last point by Robinson that apo B is notas useful as non–HDL-C in predicting risk in statin-treated patients, we are not aware of any published literature that supports this statement. Several studies show the superiority of apo B vs LDL-C or non–HDL-C, including the AFCAPS/TexCaps (Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study),\n\n【7】Relation between baseline and on-treatment lipid parameters and first acute major coronary events in the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/Tex-CAPS).\n\n【8】LIPID (Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease),\n\n【9】Relationship between lipid levels and clinical outcomes in the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID) Trial: to what extent is the reduction in coronary events with pravastatin explained by on-study lipid levels?\n\n【10】IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points through Aggressive Lipid Lowering),\n\n【11】Lipoprotein predictors of cardiovascular events in statin-treated patients with coronary heart disease: insights from the Incremental Decrease In End-Points Through Aggressive Lipid-Lowering Trial (IDEAL).\n\n【12】and PROVE IT-TIMI 22 (Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22)\n\n【13】Prognostic utility of apoB/AI, total cholesterol/HDL, non-HDL cholesterol, or hs-CRP as predictors of clinical risk in patients receiving statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes: results from PROVE IT-TIMI 22.\n\n【14】studies. In the study by Kastelein et al\n\n【15】Lipids, apoliproteins, and their ratios in relation to cardiovascular events with statin treatment.\n\n【16】and cited by Robinson, both apo B and non–HDL-C were clearly superior to LDL-C in predicting risk in statin-treated patients. However, we believe that apo B is still better than non–HDL-C in identifying patients who continue to have moderately elevated levels of atherogenic particles and who might benefit from further therapy.\n\n【17】In their excellent commentary supporting the guidelines and non–HDL-C, Lavie et al discuss the recent JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin)\n\n【18】Reduction in C-reactive protein and LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular event rates after initiation of rosuvastatin: a prospective study of the JUPITER trial.\n\n【19】in primary prevention in patients with low LDL-C (<130 mg/dL) and elevated highly sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) (>2 mg/L) values and suggest that CRP should be considered a target of therapy. In fact, an alternative interpretation of JUPITER is that it may be more a trial of apo B than of inflammation. In JUPITER, the mean baseline LDL-C was low (108 mg/dL, ie, about the 20th percentile for the US population) and the mean non–HDL-C was also low (132 mg/dL; about the 30th percentile). However, the average apo B level (109 mg/dL) was moderately high at the 60th percentile in men and the 70th percentile in women.\n\n【20】Apo B versus non-HDLC: what to do when they disagree.\n\n【21】Thus, almost half the JUPITER patients had frankly elevated levels of apo B. Although the investigators attributed the benefits in JUPITER to finding patients at increased risk based on CRP level, an alternative viewpoint is that CRP identified those at increased risk due to elevated apo B levels despite normal baseline LDL-C and non–HDL-C levels. Thus, JUPITER may be the most important new evidence about the potential usefulness of apo B for both risk identification and treatment. Indeed, JUPITER may be more about targeting elevated apo B–containing lipoproteins than about targeting inflammation per se.\n\n【22】Another advantage of apo B is that it will simplify the management of dyslipidemia for busy clinicians. Non–HDL-C is not a new concept; it was defined and described decades ago and has been a secondary goal in the NCEP/ATP (National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment Panel) III guidelines for many years. However, non–HDL-C has not resonated with or been adopted by busy clinicians despite ample medical education and ongoing efforts to have it listed on all routine lipid laboratory reports.\n\n【23】The importance of non-HDL cholesterol reporting in lipid management.\n\n【24】Also, non–HDL-C is a concept that may not be as easily grasped as is apo B. Apo B is a simple concept because it is an integral part of each and every atherogenic particle and it is a direct measure of the total number of atherogenic particles present.\n\n【25】Acceptance of a new biomarker in coronary heart disease risk prediction is often difficult because it challenges the status quo. However, apo B meets most of the requirements for the acceptance of a new biomarker, particularly when using the criteria recently proposed by the American Heart Association.\n\n【26】Criteria for evaluation of novel markers of cardiovascular risk: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\n\n【27】In the Table , the properties of non-HDL-C are compared to those of apo B from the perspective of the requirements for a new biomarker and some of the practical considerations for its use (eg, availability, reliability, cost). Apo B performs as well as non-HDL-C in most measures, and it is clearly superior to non-HDL-C in cardiovascular disease risk prediction and probably superior in assessing the adequacy of therapy in statin-treated patients. The only evaluation that has not been completed for apo B, or for non–HDL-C, is whether the measurement of apo B (or non–HDL-C) in a clinical setting improves patient outcomes compared with patients managed in the conventional manner. Although this would be an important trial, it is unlikely that such a trial will be performed in the near future or before the release of the new NCEP/ATP IV guidelines.\n\n【28】TABLE Considerations for a New Biomarker: Non-HDL-C vs Apo B\n\n【29】Apo B = apolipoprotein B; CVD = cardiovascular disease; non–HDL-C = non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; XX = superior; ? = unknown.\n\n|  | Non–HDL-C | ApoB |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Biomarker performance |  |  |\n| Marker levels differ between those with and without disease (proof of concept) | X | X |\n| Causes disease (causality) | X | X |\n| Predicts CVD risk (prospective validation) | X | XX |\n| Provides incremental value over established risk factors (incremental value) | X | XX |\n| Treatment reduces CVD risk | X | X |\n| Predicts risk during therapy (with statins) | X | XX |\n| Results in changes in recommended therapy (clinical utility) | X | XX |\n| Improves clinical outcomes over traditional markers (clinical outcomes) | ? | ? |\n| Intensification of treatment based on measurement is cost-effective (cost-effectiveness) | ? | ? |\n| Practical considerations |  |  |\n| Consistency of evidence | X | X |\n| Easily available | X | X |\n| Measurement reliable | X | X |\n| Measurement inexpensive | xxbPart of routine lipid panel. | X |\n| May assist in diagnosis of familial apo B dyslipoproteinemias | ? | X |\n\n【31】a Apo B = apolipoprotein B; CVD = cardiovascular disease; non–HDL-C = non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; XX = superior; ? = unknown.\n\n【32】b Part of routine lipid panel.\n\n【33】Finally, a careful review of our commentary indicates that our recommendation is not to completely “supplant” non–HDL-C with apo B in the guidelines, but rather to use it in addition to non–HDL-C. Integrating apo B with the standard lipid profile may also allow conventional laboratories to assist with the diagnosis of the major atherogenic apo B dyslipoproteinemias, including familial combined hyperlipidemia and familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.\n\n【34】A diagnostic algorithm for the atherogenic apolipoprotein B dyslipoproteinemias.\n\n【35】We acknowledge that changing national guidelines is difficult, but it is time to confront the limitations of non–HDL-C and at the very least give physicians the option of incorporating apo B into their management strategies. The simplicity and elegance of apo B as a measurement of the total atherogenic lipoparticle burden cannot be overstated.

Neck pain causes include:\n\n【12】*   **Muscle strains.** Overuse, such as too many hours hunched over a computer or a smartphone, often triggers muscle strains. Even minor things, such as reading in bed, can strain neck muscles.\n*   **Worn joints.** As with other joints in the body, neck joints tend to wear with age. In response to this wear and tear, the body often forms bone spurs that can affect joint motion and cause pain.\n*   **Nerve compression.** Herniated disks or bone spurs in the vertebrae of the neck can press on the nerves branching out from the spinal cord.\n*   **Injuries.** Rear-end auto collisions often result in whiplash injury. This occurs when the head jerks backward and then forward, straining the soft tissues of the neck.\n*   **Diseases.** Certain diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, meningitis or cancer, can cause neck pain.\n\n【13】Prevention\n----------\n\n【14】Most neck pain is associated with poor posture combined with age-related wear and tear. To help prevent neck pain, keep your head centered over your spine. Some simple changes in your daily routine may help. Consider trying to:\n\n【15】*   **Use good posture.** When standing and sitting, be sure your shoulders are in a straight line over your hips and your ears are directly over your shoulders. When using cell phones, tablets and other small screens, keep your head up and hold the device straight out rather than bending your neck to look down at the device.\n*   **Take frequent breaks.** If you travel long distances or work long hours at your computer, get up, move around, and stretch your neck and shoulders.\n*   **Adjust your desk, chair and computer** so that the monitor is at eye level. Knees should be slightly lower than hips. Use your chair's armrests.\n*   **If you smoke, quit.** Smoking can increase the risk of developing neck pain.\n*   **Avoid carrying heavy bags with straps over your shoulder.** The weight can strain your neck.\n*   **Sleep in a healthy position.** Your head and neck should be aligned with your body. Use a small pillow under your neck. Try sleeping on your back with your thighs elevated on pillows, which will flatten your spinal muscles.\n*   **Stay active.** If you don't move much, increase your activity level.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:13:40", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:13:51", "cost": 10.387}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:43", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:13:50", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:13:39"}

The tongue is normally covered with tiny, pinkish-white bumps (papillae), which are actually short, fine, hairlike projections. With geographic tongue, patches on the surface of the tongue are missing papillae and appear as smooth, red \"islands,\" often with slightly raised borders.\n\n【2】These patches (lesions) give the tongue a maplike, or geographic, appearance. The lesions often heal in one area and then move (migrate) to a different part of your tongue. Geographic tongue is also known as benign migratory glossitis.\n\n【3】Although geographic tongue may look alarming, it doesn't cause health problems and isn't associated with infection or cancer. Geographic tongue can sometimes cause tongue discomfort and increased sensitivity to certain substances, such as spices, salt and even sweets.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of geographic tongue may include:\n\n【6】*   Smooth, red, irregularly shaped patches (lesions) on the top or side of your tongue\n*   Frequent changes in the location, size and shape of lesions\n*   Discomfort, pain or burning sensation in some cases, most often related to eating spicy or acidic foods\n\n【7】Many people with geographic tongue have no symptoms.\n\n【8】Geographic tongue can continue for days, months or years. The problem often resolves on its own but may appear again at a later time.\n\n【9】#### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】Geographic tongue is a minor — although sometimes uncomfortable — condition. However, lesions on the tongue may indicate other more-serious conditions of the tongue or diseases affecting the body in general. If you have lesions on the tongue that don't resolve within 10 days, see your doctor or dentist.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】The cause of geographic tongue is unknown, and there's no way to prevent the condition. There may be a link between geographic tongue and psoriasis and between geographic tongue and lichen planus. But more research is needed to better understand possible connections.\n\n【13】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【14】Studies of factors that may be associated with an increased risk of geographic tongue have produced mixed results. Factors that are likely associated with an increased risk include:\n\n【15】*   **Family history.** Some people with geographic tongue have a family history of the disorder, so inherited genetic factors may increase risk.\n*   **Fissured tongue.** People with geographic tongue often have another disorder called fissured tongue, which has the appearance of deep grooves (fissures) on the surface of the tongue.\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】Geographic tongue is a benign condition.

The pain radiated to her back, did not worsen with postural changes, and was associated with shortness of breath. Because of her recent diagnosis of PE, she sought further evaluation. She had been compliant with her medication regimen (twice daily apixaban, the only medication she was taking) for the past month. Her medical history was remarkable for hyperlipidemia and obstructive sleep apnea. She reported no history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes, hypertension, or tobacco use. On presentation, vital signs revealed a body mass index of 36 kg/m  , heart rate of 80 beats/min, blood pressure of 205/89 mm Hg, temperature of 36.8°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, and normal oxygen saturation while breathing room air. Physical examination findings were notable for normal heart sounds, clear lung auscultation, and symmetric peripheral pulses. Initial electrocardiography (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with no ST-segment changes. Laboratory evaluation revealed the following (reference ranges provided parenthetically): white blood cell count, 7.8 × 10  /L (3.4 to 9.6 × 10  /L); hemoglobin, 13.5 g/dL (11.6 to 15.0 g/dL); platelet count, 136 × 10  /L (157 to 371 × 10  /L); sodium, 143 mmol/L (135 to 145 mmol/L); potassium, 4.1 mmol/L (3.6 to 5.2 mmol/L); and creatinine, 0.88 mg/dL (0.59 to 1.04 mg/dL). Additionally, her N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level was 84 pg/mL (10 to 227 pg/mL), and her initial high-sensitivity troponin concentration was 340 ng/L (≤10 ng/L). Chest radiography revealed no acute abnormalities.\n\n【1】*   1.\n\n【2】    **Based on the available clinical data, which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ underlying etiology of this patient’s presenting symptoms?**\n\n【3】    *   a.\n\n【4】        Pneumonia\n\n【5】    *   b.\n\n【6】        Acute pericarditis\n\n【7】    *   c.\n\n【8】        Aortic dissection\n\n【9】    *   d.\n\n【10】        PE\n\n【11】    *   e.\n\n【12】        ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\n\n【13】Pneumonia is an unlikely diagnosis in the absence of fever, leukocytosis, cough, and infiltrates on chest radiography and would not typically present this acutely. Additionally, our patient did not have the typical pleuritic chest pain that improves with leaning forward and findings of diffuse ST-segment elevation on ECG to suggest acute pericarditis.\n\n【14】Aortic dissection is a medical emergency classically presenting as severe, tearing chest pain. The triad of abrupt, stabbing thoracic or abdominal pain, unequal pulses, and evidence of aortic or mediastinal widening on chest radiography is suggestive of aortic dissection.\n\n【15】Clinical prediction of acute aortic dissection.\n\n【16】With our patient’s symmetric peripheral pulses and unremarkable findings on chest radiography, her presenting symptoms are unlikely to be due to dissection.\n\n【17】Although PE is classically associated with tachycardia, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain, many patients with PE present with little to no symptoms. In these cases, determining the pretest probability is important. Our patient’s chest pressure and dyspnea could certainly be due to another PE, given her Wells score\n\n【18】Derivation of a simple clinical model to categorize patients probability of pulmonary embolism: increasing the models utility with the SimpliRED D-dimer.\n\n【19】of 2.5 for prior PE and likely presence of malignancy, placing her in the moderate risk category even without the 3 additional points for PE as most likely diagnosis. In addition, a large enough PE can result in right ventricular (RV) strain leading to troponinemia. Although our patient had reportedly been compliant with her apixaban, PE should still be considered in this moderate-risk patient with a PE just 1 month previously in the setting of likely undiagnosed ovarian malignancy.\n\n【20】The diagnosis of STEMI in females requires elevation in cardiac biomarkers along with greater than 1-mm ST elevation in contiguous leads (or >1.5 mm in V <sub>2 </sub> and V <sub>3 </sub> ) on ECG. Our patient had normal ECG findings, but with her increasing troponin levels, a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) remains a strong possibility, especially in the absence of right-sided heart failure and a normal N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, arguing against severe RV strain–associated troponinemia. Our patient was thus admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of PE vs acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n【21】*   2.\n\n【22】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ next step in management?**\n\n【23】    *   a.\n\n【24】        Low-intensity heparin infusion\n\n【25】    *   b.\n\n【26】        Moderate-intensity heparin infusion\n\n【27】    *   c.\n\n【28】        Aspirin plus clopidogrel plus moderate-intensity heparin infusion\n\n【29】    *   d.\n\n【30】        High-intensity heparin infusion\n\n【31】    *   e.\n\n【32】        Aspirin plus clopidogrel plus high-intensity heparin infusion\n\n【33】Given the fairly high concern for PE, anticoagulation with heparin must be initiated immediately. Deciding on the intensity of the heparin infusion initially rests on the suspected etiology of the patient’s symptoms along with the consideration of adverse effects. Low-intensity heparin infusion is rarely used, typically in patients at high risk of bleeding. Treatment for ACS requires a moderate-intensity heparin infusion plus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).\n\n【34】2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines .\n\n【35】Early DAPT with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor blocker (eg, clopidogrel) reduces platelet adhesion and aggregation, limiting progressive thrombotic occlusion. High-intensity heparin alone is preferred if PE is the only suspected diagnosis. Because of the suspicion of recurrent PE vs ACS, the patient was given a loading dose of aspirin, 324 mg, plus clopidogrel, 600 mg, and a high-intensity heparin infusion was initiated.\n\n【36】Overnight, the patient’s troponin level increased to 580 ng/L at 2 hours and 1051 ng/L at 6 hours. A repeat ECG revealed new subtle ST elevations in the inferior leads, and the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent evaluation for an evolving STEMI. Coronary angiography revealed a 100% obstruction by a discrete lesion with intracoronary thrombus present in the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery with no collateral circulation or evidence of surrounding atherosclerotic disease. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was not performed given the distal nature of the lesion.\n\n【37】*   3.\n\n【38】    **Based on the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings thus far, which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ diagnosis?**\n\n【39】    *   a.\n\n【40】        PE\n\n【41】    *   b.\n\n【42】        Coronary artery embolism\n\n【43】    *   c.\n\n【44】        Distal rupture of atherosclerotic plaque\n\n【45】    *   d.\n\n【46】        Spontaneous coronary artery dissection\n\n【47】    *   e.\n\n【48】        Vasospastic angina\n\n【49】Similar to an NSTEMI, a PE can also present with elevated troponin levels due to RV strain, which can be seen in 30% to 50% of patients with a moderate to large PE. Electrocardiography typically (70% of the time) will show sinus tachycardia and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes,\n\n【50】Clinical characteristics of patients with acute pulmonary embolism.\n\n【51】while the development of a new right bundle branch block or the classic S <sub>1 </sub> Q <sub>3 </sub> T <sub>3 </sub> pattern is less common. Although a PE is still possible in this setting, we now have angiographic findings of a distinct coronary lesion as the probable cause of the patient’s clinical presentation.\n\n【52】Coronary artery embolism can present with ACS, typically with elevated troponin levels and ischemic changes on ECG. It can be classified into 3 categories—direct, paradoxical, and iatrogenic.\n\n【53】Coronary embolus: an underappreciated cause of acute coronary syndromes.\n\n【54】The isolated occlusion of the distal LAD artery in the absence of background atherosclerotic disease strongly suggests an embolic phenomenon.\n\n【55】A distal atherosclerotic plaque rupture would most commonly be seen in patients with conventional risk factors for CAD (eg, older age, male gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, tobacco use). Such patients usually present with angiographic findings of a high-degree stenosis or occlusion in conjunction with multifocal atherosclerotic disease. Our patient had minimal CAD risk factors, and coronary angiography revealed an isolated 100% obstruction with no background atherosclerotic disease, favoring an embolic mechanism over an isolated plaque rupture.\n\n【56】On coronary angiography, spontaneous coronary artery dissection can manifest as contrast dye in multiple planes of the arterial wall with slow clearance of dye or, more commonly, intramural hematoma with abrupt or tapered luminal stenosis.\n\n【57】Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: acute findings on coronary computed tomography angiography.\n\n【58】Our patient’s angiogram did not show these findings and instead revealed an occlusion in the distal LAD artery.\n\n【59】Vasospastic angina is characterized by intermittent episodes of chest pain at rest, thought to be due to sporadic coronary vasospasm. Electrocardiography may reveal transient ST-segment changes, and angiography may show spasm if caught in real time. Our patient’s angiogram did not show spasm.\n\n【60】It was agreed that the patient had most likely suffered from a coronary embolism. Subsequent evaluation for the exact etiologic mechanism was initiated.\n\n【61】*   4.\n\n【62】    **Which _one_ of the following diagnostic imaging modalities is _most likely_ to determine the mechanism of this patient’s LAD occlusion?**\n\n【63】    *   a.\n\n【64】        Computed tomographic angiography of the pulmonary arteries\n\n【65】    *   b.\n\n【66】        Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)\n\n【67】    *   c.\n\n【68】        Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)\n\n【69】    *   d.\n\n【70】        Lower extremity venous ultrasonography\n\n【71】    *   e.\n\n【72】        Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\n【73】Computed tomographic angiography effectively visualizes filling defects in the larger main, lobar, or segmental pulmonary arteries. It is not as effective in visualizing the smaller and peripheral subsegmental vessels supplying blood to the lungs, although newer scanners with increased resolution that can do so are now available. This modality of imaging is more than 90% sensitive and specific for a PE and would be the best option if PE was the most likely diagnosis.\n\n【74】Transthoracic echocardiography is typically the initial cardiac imaging modality for assessing CAD. It allows for the evaluation of regional wall motion abnormalities, ejection fraction, and/or valvular disease. Additionally, it directly visualizes the 4 cardiac chambers, enabling the physician to look for intracardiac thrombi if there are concerns for an embolic event. Transthoracic echocardiography cannot visualize certain posterior structures such as the left atrial appendage or assess for a connection between the venous and arterial systems such as a patent foramen ovale (PFO), and therefore may miss potential etiologies of a coronary embolism.\n\n【75】Transesophageal echocardiography.\n\n【76】In contrast to TTE, TEE is performed with the ultrasound transducer visualizing the heart directly behind the esophagus. This view provides superior image quality of the posterior structures of the heart (ie, left atrium and left atrial appendage). It also allows for improved visualization of the interatrial septum to assess for the presence of an atrial septal defect (ASD) or PFO. Transesophageal echocardiography thus provides a more comprehensive assessment of potential etiologies of coronary embolism.\n\n【77】Lower extremity venous ultrasonography assesses for noncompressible veins due to thrombi. Proximal deep venous thromboses (DVTs) are associated with twice the risk of embolization as distal DVTs. Nevertheless, a patient with an isolated distal DVT and risk factors such as active malignancy or prior DVT/PE has an increased risk for proximal extension.\n\n【78】Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines .\n\n【79】Our patient should first undergo TEE to assess for a potential intracardiac thrombus, as well as a possible connection between the venous and arterial systems. If no right-to-left shunt is present, a lower extremity venous ultrasonography would not be helpful in understanding the embolic mechanism as there would be no pathway for a venous thrombus to travel into the arterial circulation.\n\n【80】Cardiac MRI is an expensive and sophisticated imaging modality that allows for high spatial resolution assessment of ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, and wall thickness. Its use in detecting intraventricular thrombi is not well studied and thus not favored over echocardiography in the work-up of suspected coronary embolism.\n\n【81】Transesophageal echocardiography revealed no intracardiac thrombus but did show new apical regional wall motion abnormalities and a PFO with a small bidirectional shunt at rest that increased with Valsalva maneuver. Subsequent lower extremity ultrasonography revealed a new acute thrombus in the right gastrocnemius vein. These findings suggested that the etiology of the patient’s symptoms was a myocardial infarction secondary to a paradoxical embolism (PDE) to the LAD artery in the setting of a preexisting right-to-left intracardiac shunt, despite therapeutic anticoagulation.\n\n【82】*   5.\n\n【83】    **Given the presumed recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) while the patient was taking apixaban, which _one_ of the following long-term management strategies is _most appropriate_ in preventing future VTE** **?**\n\n【84】    *   a.\n\n【85】        Stop daily aspirin plus clopidogrel; resume apixaban\n\n【86】    *   b.\n\n【87】        Stop daily aspirin plus clopidogrel; switch from apixaban to warfarin\n\n【88】    *   c.\n\n【89】        Stop daily aspirin plus clopidogrel; switch from apixaban to enoxaparin\n\n【90】    *   d.\n\n【91】        Continue daily aspirin plus clopidogrel; switch from apixaban to warfarin\n\n【92】    *   e.\n\n【93】        Continue daily aspirin plus clopidogrel; switch from apixaban to enoxaparin\n\n【94】In the absence of any angiographic evidence of atherosclerotic disease or planned PCI, there is no indication to continue DAPT.\n\n【95】Coronary embolus: an underappreciated cause of acute coronary syndromes.\n\n【96】It would not be wise to transition back to apixaban because our patient likely experienced breakthrough thrombus formation with subsequent embolism while taking this agent.\n\n【97】Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that has long been used as an anticoagulant in the setting of atrial fibrillation or VTE. Vitamin K antagonists have been found to be inferior to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in preventing recurrent VTE in patients with acute VTE and cancer and are thus not the best option for this patient with a probable malignant ovarian mass.\n\n【98】Randomized Comparison of Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin versus Oral Anticoagulant Therapy for the Prevention of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Cancer (CLOT) Investigators  \nLow-molecular-weight heparin versus a coumarin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.\n\n【99】Enoxaparin is a LMWH and would be preferred to prevent future VTE in this patient with a PDE in the setting of potential malignancy.\n\n【100】DAPT was administered empirically in this patient because of a possible NSTEMI, but now that the patient’s symptoms have been determined to be due to a PDE, only anticoagulation should be continued. Long-term DAPT _would_ be required if she experienced an atherosclerotic plaque rupture with subsequent thrombus formation or underwent PCI with stent placement in order to stabilize the plaque or prevent stent thrombosis, respectively.\n\n【101】As stated previously, enoxaparin is superior to warfarin in preventing/treating VTE in the setting of malignancy. However, DAPT should be discontinued because of the embolic mechanism of myocardial ischemia. Triple therapy would unnecessarily increase this patient’s risk for bleeding complications.\n\n【102】Aspirin and clopidogrel were discontinued, and the patient was subsequently transitioned from apixaban to enoxaparin. Days later, she underwent an exploratory laparotomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy. Histopathologic examination revealed a high-grade carcinoma of the right ovary with mixed serous, clear cell, and mucinous differentiation and peritoneal involvement. A follow-up appointment with a medical oncologist was scheduled for further staging and management.\n\n【103】Discussion\n----------\n\n【104】Coronary artery embolism is categorized as direct, paradoxical, and iatrogenic. A direct coronary embolism originates from the arterial circulation such as the left atrial appendage or left ventricle. A paradoxical coronary embolism originates from the venous circulation and travels to the arterial circulation through a PFO, ASD, arteriovenous malformation, or other right-to-left shunt. An iatrogenic coronary embolism occurs as a complication in the perioperative or intraoperative (eg, PCI) setting.\n\n【105】Coronary embolus: an underappreciated cause of acute coronary syndromes.\n\n【106】Major and minor criteria have been formulated to aid in the diagnosis of coronary embolism.\n\n【107】Prevalence, clinical features, and prognosis of acute myocardial infarction attributable to coronary artery embolism.\n\n【108】Major criteria include angiographic evidence of coronary embolus (eg, filling defect, abrupt occlusion in an artery without severe atherosclerosis), concomitant coronary emboli in multiple vascular territories, concomitant systemic embolization without left ventricular thrombus attributable to acute myocardial infarction, histologic evidence of a venous origin of coronary embolic material, and evidence of an embolic source on imaging. Minor criteria include less than 25% stenosis on angiography in nonculprit vessels, atrial fibrillation, and presence of embolic risk factors (cardiomyopathy, rheumatic valve disease, prosthetic heart valve, PFO, ASD, history of cardiac surgery, infective endocarditis, or hypercoagulable state). Definite coronary embolism is considered to have ≥ 2 or more major criteria, 1 major and 2 minor criteria, or 3 minor criteria. Probable coronary embolism is considered to have 1 major and 1 minor criterion or 2 minor criteria.\n\n【109】Coronary embolus: an underappreciated cause of acute coronary syndromes.\n\n【110】Coronary embolism should be considered in patients presenting with ACS in the setting of a recent VTE and minimal CAD risk factors. If suspected on coronary angiography, TEE should be performed to look for intracardiac thrombi and/or a right-to-left shunt to investigate the etiologic mechanism of the embolism. Aspiration thrombectomy can be considered if a large thrombus burden exists because a recent meta-analysis reported that such an intervention was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality.\n\n【111】Thrombus aspiration in ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction: an individual patient meta-analysis; Thrombectomy Trialists Collaboration.\n\n【112】Medical management of coronary embolism without atherosclerotic disease or PCI involves long-term anticoagulation without antiplatelet agents.

Fetal interventions, postnatal transcatheter interventions, and postnatal surgical resection have all been used, but the mortality risk continues to be high in this subgroup of patients. We describe a novel, sequential approach to manage HLHS-IAS and progressive fetal hydrops. A 28-year-old, gravida 4 para 2 mother was referred to Mayo Clinic for fetal HLHS. Fetal echocardiography at 28 weeks of gestation demonstrated HLHS-IAS with progressive fetal hydrops. The atrial septum was thick and muscular with no interatrial communication. Ultrasound-guided fetal atrial septostomy was performed with successful creation of a small atrial communication. However, fetal echocardiogram at 33 weeks of gestation showed recurrence of a pleural effusion and restriction of the atrial septum. We proceeded with an _Ex utero_ I ntrapartum T reatment (EXIT) delivery and open atrial septectomy. This was performed successfully, and the infant was stabilized in the intensive care unit. The infant required venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support on day of life 1. The patient later developed hemorrhagic complications, leading to his demise on day of life 9. This is the first reported case of an EXIT procedure and open atrial septectomy performed without cardiopulmonary bypass for an open-heart operation and provides a promising alternative strategy for the management of HLHS-IAS in select cases.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ECMO ( extracorporeal membrane oxygenator ), EXIT ( ex utero intrapartum treatment ), HLHS ( hypoplastic left heart syndrome ), HLHS-IAS ( hypoplastic left heart syndrome with intact septum ), ICU ( intensive care unit )\n\n【4】Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) with an intact or severely restrictive atrial septum (HLHS-IAS) carries a high risk of mortality and affects about 6% of all patients with HLHS.\n\n【5】The hypoplastic left heart syndrome with intact atrial septum: atrial morphology, pulmonary vascular histopathology and outcome.\n\n【6】Emergent relief of obstruction at the atrial level is needed for survival.

Fetal echocardiogram performed at 28 weeks of gestation demonstrated HLHS-IAS with mitral valve hypoplasia, aortic valve atresia, hypoplastic left ventricle, and hypoplastic ascending aorta. The left atrium was small with dilated pulmonary veins, and the atrial septum was thick and muscular with no interatrial communication or thin primum septum . Pulmonary venous Doppler showed to-and-fro flow with prominent flow reversal during atrial systole and absent early diastolic forward flow, consistent with severe left atrial hypertension . There was no decompressing vein or antegrade flow through the left heart. A new small right-sided pleural effusion and a pericardial effusion were seen on subsequent imaging. Because of the development of these early signs of fetal hydrops, percutaneous fetal intervention was proposed.\n\n【11】Figure 1 Ultrasound-guided intrauterine fetal atrial septostomy.

Fetal anesthesia was administered into the left arm of the fetus. An 18-gauge Cook blunt-tip needle was advanced percutaneously into the amniotic space and was directed through the fetal chest wall into the right atrium. The atrial septostomy was performed with the needle trocar, and the trocar was removed. A 3.75 mm diameter × 8 mm long Emerge coronary angioplasty balloon was advanced over a 0.014” Samurai coronary wire and inflated multiple times to dilate the atrial septostomy. Flow across the atrial septum was demonstrated by color Doppler. A small pericardial effusion was observed initially but remained stable over 20 minutes of monitoring and did not require additional intervention.\n\n【14】Follow-up fetal echocardiogram 1 week later demonstrated resolution of pericardial and pleural effusions. The septal defect was still patent, although somewhat restrictive (mean Doppler gradient, 2-3 mm Hg) with continuous blood flow across the septum noted . The patient was closely monitored by maternal fetal medicine and pediatric cardiology weekly. Fetal echocardiogram performed at 33 weeks of gestation showed persistent patency of the atrial communication, but reappearance of a right-sided pleural effusion. Percutaneous reintervention was not felt to be beneficial in this setting due to thick and muscular atrial septum. Due to evolving fetal hydrops, EXIT to open atrial septectomy with possible need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) support was offered. The added risks of the EXIT procedure and ECMO were discussed in detail with the parents. Alternative management options including compassionate comfort care and transcatheter atrial septal dilation were discussed. After extensive multidisciplinary discussion, the parents elected to proceed with the EXIT procedure and open septectomy. Pediatric Ethical Board reviewed the case, made recommendations, and agreed with proceeding.\n\n【15】EXIT to Surgical Atrial Septectomy\n----------------------------------\n\n【16】An EXIT delivery was performed at 34 weeks of gestation under maternal general anesthesia . The fetus was partially delivered, and the fetal-placental circulation was maintained. Fetal anesthesia was maintained by placental circulation and additional intramuscular anesthesia in the left thigh of the fetus. After transthoracic echocardiographic confirmation of the status of the atrial septum, a median sternotomy was performed with standby ECMO. The pericardium was opened, providing access to the heart and great vessels. External inspection of the heart confirmed the fetal diagnosis of HLHS with severely hypoplastic ascending aorta, large main pulmonary artery, and a large ductus arteriosus that supplied the descending aorta. At that time, a central line that was secured to the chest wall to enable medication administration and any potential transfusion was placed in the right atrium. A long purse string suture was placed in the right atrial free wall. Using bicaval inflow occlusion technique, the superior and inferior venae cavae were temporarily occluded with vascular clamps. The heart was allowed to empty, and the right atrium was entered through an incision within the purse string suture. The atrial septum consisted entirely of muscular wall, and no thin primum portion was identifiable. Part of this muscular atrial septum was resected, and the heart was deaired by removing the temporary clamps on the venae cavae. Finally, the purse string was pulled to control the bleeding. Epicardial echocardiogram confirmed that the septum was open, but still restrictive. The decision was made to repeat the procedure to ensure adequate decompression of the left side of the heart. After perfusing for a few minutes, the procedure was repeated in the same fashion by bicaval inflow occlusion. The septectomy was extended inferiorly and anteriorly. Epicardial echocardiogram confirmed that the septum was nonrestrictive . Acidosis and anemia were corrected. Attention was then directed to airway management and intubation. Laryngoscopy was performed, and minimal airway secretions were suctioned. The newborn was then intubated with a 3.0 cuffed endotracheal tube that was threaded over a 2.7 mm Hopkin's rod telescope. Visualization of normal airway structures was confirmed and the telescope was removed. After securing the endotracheal tube and suctioning, positive pressure ventilation was initiated by hand ventilation using room air with a sterile Mapleson circuit and surfactant was administered. Inspiratory pressures were limited by manometry, and the fetal response was determined by continuous pulse oximetry. The umbilical cord pulsations started dampening soon after the initiation of ventilation; however, oxygen saturation increased from 60% to 85% over several minutes. With improved oxygenation despite reduced placental support, decision was made to deliver the fetus rather than cannulate for ECMO. The fetus was then completely delivered, and the umbilical cord was clamped. The neonate was transferred to a separate operating room where umbilical arterial and venous catheters were placed and the chest was closed after placement of standard surgical drains. The oxygen saturation remained in high 80s, and the first arterial blood gas was pH 7.07, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 83, PaO <sub>2 </sub> 39, Base −6 while being ventilated in room air. The neonate was then transferred to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit (ICU). No intraoperative complications for either the mother or the neonate were encountered.\n\n【17】Figure 2 Postoperative subcostal echocardiographic image showing unrestrictive, surgically created interatrial communication between the left atrium (LA) and the right atrium (RA).

(8) Otorhinolaryngologist.\n\n【19】Follow-Up in the ICU\n--------------------\n\n【20】The newborn was admitted to the ICU intubated and mechanically ventilated with a primed ECMO circuit outside the patient's room. Hemodynamics were within age-dependent norms, supported by continuous infusions of epinephrine (0.05 μg/kg/min), dopamine (5 μg/kg/min), calcium chloride (8.3 mg/kg/h), and alprostadil (0.01 μg/kg/min). Routine blood and metabolic work were obtained. Initial room air, postductal arterial blood gas demonstrated a pH of 7.48, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 32, PaO <sub>2 </sub> 34, Base 0, and lactate 10 mmol/L. Overnight, hemodynamics stabilized on decreasing doses of epinephrine (nadir, 0.03 μg/kg/min) while blood lactate steadily decreased (nadir of 5) until an abrupt event induced by repositioning and endotracheal tube suctioning resulted in hypoxia followed by bradycardia and hypotension refractive to supplemental oxygen, analgesic administration, neuromuscular blockade, inhaled nitric oxide, fluid resuscitation, and titration of vasoactive medications. A bedside cardiac ultrasound demonstrated poor ventricular function, and subsequent diagnoses of low cardiac output syndrome and pulmonary hypertension were made and the decision was made to place the neonate on central VA ECMO for stabilization. Cannulation occurred at the bedside, with direct arterial cannulation of the pulmonary artery with advancement through the large ductus arteriosus into the proximal descending aorta. An additional cannula was placed into the common atrium for venous drainage. The metabolic derangements rapidly corrected on ECMO. Additional ICU measures included hydrocortisone administration for presumptive adrenal insufficiency, surfactant administration for respiratory distress syndrome, and phototherapy as well as a double-volume exchange transfusion for hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity. Oxygen saturation and perfusion status remained satisfactory on ECMO support. We were successful in achieving good expansion and aeration of both lungs with adequate respiratory system compliance. Repeat echocardiogram showed good ventricular function (ventricular ejection fraction, 55%-60%) with unrestrictive atrial septum.\n\n【21】Unfortunately, the neonate developed a grade I intraventricular hemorrhage that rapidly progressed to grade III on serial cranial ultrasounds. These findings, in the context of the neonate's underlying diagnoses, were discussed with the family and the decision was made to separate from ECMO and, in accordance with the parents' wishes, a do-not-resuscitate order was placed. Separation was successfully performed after a total of 5 days of ECMO support. The chest was left opened, and the neonate remained with adequate hemodynamics and with satisfactory arterial blood gases after separation. The ultimate plan was to postpone the Norwood stage I palliation and continue prostaglandin without ductal stenting due to prematurity. In the event of pulmonary overcirculation, we planned to proceed with bilateral branch pulmonary arteries banding and ductal stenting or simply continue the prostaglandin therapy.\n\n【22】On day of life 9, the neonate had a second acute decompensation with bradycardia and hypotension associated with increase in central venous pressure to 25 mm Hg. In accordance with the family's wishes, chest compressions were withheld, and the neonate was transitioned to comfort care and died in the presence of the family.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】Intact or severely restrictive atrial septum poses a high risk of mortality in patients with HLHS.\n\n【25】The hypoplastic left heart syndrome with intact atrial septum: atrial morphology, pulmonary vascular histopathology and outcome.\n\n【26】Preoperative management of pulmonary venous hypertension in hypoplastic left heart syndrome with restrictive atrial septal defect.\n\n【27】Development of hydrops commonly portends _in utero_ fetal demise. Many _in utero_ or postnatal interventions can be futile due to secondary abnormalities including the pulmonary vasculature (diffuse hypoplasia of pulmonary arteries, “arterialization” of pulmonary veins with muscular media, and severe pulmonary hypertension).\n\n【28】Fetal stenting of the atrial septum: technique and initial results in cardiac lesions with left atrial hypertension.\n\n【29】Ultrasound-guided fetal atrial septostomy was first described in 2004 to provide prenatal left atrial decompression in HLHS-IAS.\n\n【30】Creation of an atrial septal defect in utero for fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and intact or highly restrictive atrial septum.\n\n【31】Initial percutaneous intervention in this case allowed resolution of developing hydrops early on, avoiding fetal demise. The atrial septal communication had flow across it, but continued to be restrictive due to the muscular nature of the septum. Recurrence of hydrops required more definitive management because waiting until term would have likely led to _in utero_ fetal demise.\n\n【32】Previous reports have described the EXIT procedure for HLHS to facilitate transition to cardiopulmonary bypass and atrial septectomy.\n\n【33】Ex-utero intrapartum treatment as a novel bridging strategy to surgery in hypoplastic left heart syndrome with intact atrial septum-cross-circulation revisited.\n\n【34】As the neonate begins breathing and the lungs expand, there is an increase in pulmonary blood flow resulting in severe pulmonary congestion and pulmonary edema if the obstruction is not relieved. This would be the case with the previously proposed Immediate Post-partum Access to Cardiac Therapy procedure in which the infant is delivered in the operating room with immediate transition to cardiovascular surgery after initial intubation and stabilization. However, EXIT to surgical septectomy without cardiopulmonary bypass allowed for the relief of atrial level obstruction, before the neonate's first breath. The choice of EXIT to ECMO vs EXIT to septectomy is challenging. Although both options were offered to the family and could have been performed at the time of delivery, we did not see a clear indication for ECMO support for several reasons. First, the neonate was stable and was being ventilated in room air, with acceptable oxygen saturation indicating adequate pulmonary function, at least for the time being. Second, managing the neonate with single-ventricle physiology on ECMO with a large patent ductus arteriosus is very challenging, as was experienced in this case later. The goal was to simplify postoperative care and avoid all the morbidity and complications associated with ECMO in such a preterm neonate. Unfortunately, those complications still occurred in this neonate, but we hope that these can be avoided in future cases. We believe that the choice of ECMO should be reserved for cases that require active resuscitation and those who are better served with primary heart transplantation.\n\n【35】This is the first reported case of an EXIT procedure being used without cardiopulmonary bypass for an open-heart operation to provide a promising alternative strategy for the management of HLHS-IAS. Although the infant described in this case ultimately died, the primary cause of death was complication related to prematurity and ECMO support (ie, intracranial hemorrhage) rather than directly related to the EXIT procedure itself. We believe that the EXIT procedure to open fetal atrial septectomy may be an option for select candidates primarily as a second step if the atrial septum becomes restrictive after ultrasound-guided fetal cardiac intervention.\n\n【36】It is also important to recognize that this procedure required extensive coordination between multiple provider groups including obstetrics, pediatric cardiology, neonatology, cardiovascular surgery, otorhinolaryngologist, and anesthesia (both obstetric and cardiac). This procedure was performed in a children's hospital that resides with in a larger adult hospital; however, obstetrical care is typically not provided at this hospital. In that respect, this case still required a consciously coordinated effort between the participating groups. This would be vital for such a procedure to be performed at a free-standing children's hospital. Furthermore, this case reflects the importance of early fetal diagnosis to allow for coordinated care and delivery of these patients in a tertiary care setting that is able to provide for the unique and complex needs of both the neonate and the mother.\n\n【37】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【38】This is the first reported case of an EXIT procedure being used without cardiopulmonary bypass for the management of HLHS-IAS. This strategy may be an option for select candidates as a subsequent step if the atrial septum becomes restrictive after ultrasound-guided percutaneous fetal atrial septostomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:32:22", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:32:54", "cost": 32.608}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:43", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:32:53", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:32:20"}

A CT coronary angiogram uses a powerful X-ray machine to produce images of the heart and its blood vessels. The test is used to diagnose a variety of heart conditions.\n\n【2】The procedure is noninvasive and doesn't require recovery time.\n\n【3】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【4】A CT coronary angiogram is mainly used to check for narrowed or blocked arteries in the heart (coronary artery disease). However, it can check for other heart conditions.\n\n【5】A CT coronary angiogram differs from a standard coronary angiogram. The traditional procedure (non-CT angiogram) uses a flexible tube (catheter) threaded through the groin or arm to the heart or coronary arteries. For those with known coronary artery disease, the traditional approach can also be used as treatment.\n\n【6】Risks\n-----\n\n【7】A CT coronary angiogram involves exposure to radiation. The amount varies depending on the type of machine used. Women who are pregnant shouldn't have a CT angiogram because of possible harm to an unborn child.\n\n【8】The test may be done using dye (contrast) to help blood vessels show up more clearly on the images. Some people have an allergic reaction to the contrast dye. Talk to your health care provider if you're concerned about having an allergic reaction. If you have a contrast dye allergy, you might be asked to take steroid medication 12 hours before the procedure to reduce the risk of a reaction.\n\n【9】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【10】A health care provider likely will give instructions about how to prepare for a CT coronary angiogram. Driving yourself to and from the test should be OK.\n\n【11】### Food and medications\n\n【12】Usually, the test requires not eating anything for about four hours before the test. Drinking water is OK. Don't drink caffeinated beverages 12 hours before the test because they can increase the heart rate, making it difficult to get clear pictures of the heart.\n\n【13】Tell your health care provider about the medications that you take. You might be asked not to take a particular medication before the test.\n\n【14】### Clothing and personal items\n\n【15】The procedure requires removing jewelry, glasses and clothing above the waist. You'll be asked to change into a hospital gown.\n\n【16】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【17】A CT coronary angiogram is usually done in the radiology department of a hospital or an outpatient imaging facility.\n\n【18】### Before the procedure\n\n【19】Before a CT coronary angiogram, you may receive a medication called a beta blocker to slow your heart rate. Doing so provides clearer images on the CT scan. Let your health care provider know if you've had side effects from beta blockers in the past.\n\n【20】You might also be given nitroglycerin to widen (dilate) your coronary arteries.\n\n【21】### During the procedure\n\n【22】You'll receive numbing medication, and then a technician will insert an IV into the hand or arm. A dye (contrast) flows through this IV. The dye helps blood vessels show up better on the CT images. You'll also have sticky patches called electrodes placed on your chest to record your heart rate.\n\n【23】You'll lie on a long table that slides through a short, tunnel-like machine (CT scanner). If you're uncomfortable in closed spaces, ask your health care provider about medication to help you relax.\n\n【24】During the scan you need to stay still and hold your breath as directed. Movement can cause blurry images.\n\n【25】A care provider operates the CT machine from a room that's separated from your exam room by a glass window. An intercom system allows you and the provider to talk to each other.\n\n【26】Although the actual scanning portion of the test takes as few as five seconds, it may take up to an hour for the process to be completed.\n\n【27】### After the procedure\n\n【28】After your CT coronary angiogram is completed, you can return to your normal daily activities. You should be able to drive yourself home or to work. Drink plenty of water to help flush the dye from your body.\n\n【29】Results\n-------\n\n【30】The images from your CT coronary angiogram should be ready soon after your test. The health care provider who asked you to have the test likely will discuss the results of the test with you.\n\n【31】If your test suggests that you have or are at risk of heart disease, you and your provider can discuss treatment options.\n\n【32】Regardless of the results of a CT coronary angiogram, it's always a good idea to make lifestyle changes to help protect the heart. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include:\n\n【33】*   **Exercise regularly.** Exercise helps manage weight. It also helps control diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure — all risk factors for heart disease.\n\n【34】    With your health care provider's OK, get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. If necessary, break activity into several 10-minute sessions a day.\n\n【35】*   **Eat healthy foods.** A heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains — and low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium — can help control weight, blood pressure and cholesterol.\n*   **Stop smoking.** Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease, especially atherosclerosis. If you smoke, quitting is the best way to reduce your risk of heart disease and its complications. If you need help quitting, ask your health care provider about smoking cessation methods.\n*   **Manage health conditions.** For high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes, take medications as directed. Ask your provider how often you need follow-up visits.\n*   **Reduce stress.** Stress can cause blood vessels to tighten (constrict), increasing the risk of a heart attack. Getting more exercise, practicing mindfulness and connecting with others in support groups are some ways to tame stress.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:34:18", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:34:33", "cost": 14.595}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:43", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:34:32", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:34:18"}

Thyrel TRH\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Protirelin is used to test the response of the anterior pituitary gland in people who may have certain medical conditions involving the thyroid gland. Testing with this medicine may help to identify the problem or may ensure that the dose of medicine being used is correct.\n\n【4】Protirelin stimulates release of a hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH from the anterior pituitary gland. TSH then stimulates the thyroid gland. By measuring the amount of TSH in the blood after protirelin is given, the doctor can determine how well the anterior pituitary is working.\n\n【5】How test is done: First, a sample of your blood is taken. Then protirelin is given by injection by your doctor. The dose of protirelin may be different for different patients. Adults are usually given 500 micrograms (mcg) injected into a vein. The dose for children is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. A little while after the dose is given, one or more blood samples are taken. Then the results of the test are studied. You will be asked to lie down before, during, and for 15 minutes after the test. This is to prevent dizziness and possible fainting.\n\n【6】Protirelin is to be used only under the supervision of a doctor.\n\n【7】Before Using\n------------\n\n【8】In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. Also, other things may affect test results. For this test, the following should be considered:\n\n【9】### Allergies\n\n【10】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【11】### Pediatric\n\n【12】This medicine has been tested in children and, in effective doses, has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.\n\n【13】### Geriatric\n\n【14】This medicine has been tested and has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.\n\n【15】### Breastfeeding\n\n【16】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【17】### Drug Interactions\n\n【18】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this diagnostic test, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【19】Receiving this diagnostic test with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【20】*   Cyproheptadine\n*   Thioridazine\n\n【21】### Other Interactions\n\n【22】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【23】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【24】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this diagnostic test. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【25】*   Heart or blood vessel disease or\n*   High blood pressure or\n*   Stroke (history of)—Sudden changes in blood pressure caused by protirelin may put patients with these conditions at greater risk\n\n【26】*   Kidney disease—Test results may be affected if patient has kidney disease\n\n【27】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【28】### Dosing\n\n【29】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【30】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【31】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【32】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【33】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【34】#### Rare\n\n【35】1.

His family moved to the Minneapolis-St Paul area when he was an infant, and his formative years were spent there. After a 4-year tour of duty in the US Navy from 1942 to 1946 and subsequent employment as an auto mechanic, Huntington attended the Minneapolis School of Art (now known as the Minnesota College of Art and Design) for 1 year (1959-1960). For the next 3 years, he was an assistant to Paul Granlund (1925-2003), another well-known Minnesota sculptor who was an artist-in-residence at Gustavus Adolphus College in St Peter, Minn. Huntington honed his skills in sculpture under Granlund's tutelage, learning to build sculptures from found objects and by casting metal. He was invited to be an artist-in-residence for the Minneapolis Public School system and is the subject of a Minneapolis Public School teacher's guide on Native American art and artists.\n\n【1】Charles Huntington, Ojibwe Sculptor: With Teacher's Guide: Native Americans of the Twentieth Century.

Depending on the viewer's imagination, a variety of symbols can be perceived in the sculpture. The individual letters of the word hope can be divined from the curves and angles. A figure eight—the symbol for infinity, a component of the enduring nature of hope—can also be inferred. The bright orange color suggests the fire of life, and the silver of the metal edges could invoke a silver-lined cloud.

The flaps (leaflets) of the mitral valve are floppy. They bulge backward (prolapse) like a parachute into the heart's left upper chamber as the heart squeezes (contracts).\n\n【2】Mitral (MY-trul) valve prolapse sometimes causes blood to leak backward across the valve, a condition called mitral valve regurgitation.\n\n【3】Usually, mitral valve prolapse isn't life-threatening and doesn't require treatment or lifestyle changes. But some people may need medications or surgery, especially if the prolapse causes severe regurgitation.\n\n【4】Other names to describe mitral valve prolapse include:\n\n【5】*   Barlow syndrome\n*   Billowing mitral valve syndrome\n*   Click-murmur syndrome\n*   Floppy valve syndrome\n*   Mitral prolapse\n*   Myxomatous mitral valve disease\n\n【6】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【7】Signs and symptoms of mitral valve prolapse are due to the amount of blood leaking backward through the valve.\n\n【8】Mitral valve prolapse symptoms can vary widely from one person to another. Many people with mitral valve prolapse don't have noticeable symptoms. Other people may have mild symptoms that develop gradually.\n\n【9】Symptoms of mitral valve prolapse may include:\n\n【10】*   A racing or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\n*   Dizziness or lightheadedness\n*   Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, especially during exercise or when lying flat\n*   Fatigue\n\n【11】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【12】If you have symptoms of mitral valve prolapse, make an appointment with your health care provider. Many other conditions can cause similar symptoms.\n\n【13】If you're having sudden or unusual chest pain or think you're having a heart attack, seek emergency medical care immediately.\n\n【14】If you've been diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse, see your provider if your symptoms worsen.\n\n【15】Causes\n------\n\n【16】To understand the causes of mitral valve disease, it may be helpful to know how the heart works.\n\n【17】The mitral valve is one of four valves in the heart that keep blood flowing in the right direction. Each valve has flaps (leaflets) that open and close once during each heartbeat. If a valve doesn't open or close properly, blood flow through the heart to the body can be reduced.\n\n【18】In mitral valve prolapse, one or both of the mitral valve leaflets have extra tissue or stretch more than usual. The leaflets can bulge backward (prolapse) like a parachute into the left upper heart chamber (left atrium) each time the heart contracts to pump blood.\n\n【19】The bulging may keep the valve from closing tightly. If blood leaks backward through the valve, the condition is called mitral valve regurgitation.\n\n【20】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【21】Mitral valve prolapse can develop in any person at any age. Serious symptoms of mitral valve prolapse tend to occur most often in men older than 50.\n\n【22】Mitral valve prolapse can occur in families (be inherited) and may be linked to several other conditions, including:\n\n【23】*   Ebstein anomaly\n*   Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\n*   Graves' disease\n*   Marfan syndrome\n*   Muscular dystrophy\n*   Scoliosis\n\n【24】Complications\n-------------\n\n【25】Potential complications of mitral valve prolapse may include:\n\n【26】*   **Mitral valve regurgitation.** The mitral valve flaps don't close tightly. Blood flows backward when the valve is closed, making it harder for the heart to work properly. Being male or having high blood pressure increases the risk of mitral valve regurgitation.\n*   **Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias).** Irregular heartbeats may occur if mitral valve prolapse leads to severe regurgitation and swelling of the upper left heart chamber (atrium).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:02:03", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:02:40", "cost": 36.733}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:02:40", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:02:03"}

Any patient who has an isolated prolonged aPTT with no obvious explanation (ie, heparin or warfarin use or liver disease) should be evaluated for the presence of either a deficiency or an inhibitor of a coagulation factor. In male patients, the presence of hemophilia should be excluded with appropriate testing. Up to 20% of cases of hemophilia occur in families with no prior history of hemophilia, reflecting spontaneous mutations in the respective factor VIII and IX genes. In some patients, hemophilia does not manifest until a stressful situation like surgery occurs.\n\n【18】Lupus anticoagulants are antibodies (IgG and IgM) directed against phospholipids, crucial components of the aPTT assay system. Thus, the presence of lupus anticoagulants results in a prolongation of the aPTT. Lupus anticoagulants have been associated with thrombotic diathesis, spontaneous abortion, thrombocytopenia, neurologic disorders, and, less frequently, hemorrhage. Even though hemorrhagic diathesis is a rare phenomenon due to lupus anticoagulant, bleeding complications,\n\n【19】Bleeding in patients with lupus anticoagulant \\[letter\\].\n\n【20】including epistaxis, hematemesis, joint bleeding, and spontaneous hematoma, have been reported with this condition. Based on our patient's clinical presentation and laboratory test results, a lupus anticoagulant is in the differential diagnosis.\n\n【21】The most common congenital bleeding disorder is von Willebrand disease. This group of disorders is characterized by quantitative or qualitative defects in the von Willebrand factor (vWF), a protein that mediates platelet adhesion. The vWF has a separate function of binding to factor VIII coagulant activity (VIII:c) to protect against degradation. The aPTT is prolonged in von Willebrand disease when factor VIII :c is less than 25% because of decreased vWF to prevent the degradation of the factor VIII:c. In severe forms of von Willebrand disease, the bleeding manifestations can present as hemarthrosis, dissecting intramuscular hematomas, and serious hemorrhage due to traumatic injuries or after surgical procedures, as in our patient.\n\n【22】Acute DIC is a syndrome characterized by excessive protease activity in the blood, resulting in formation of soluble fibrin and fibrinolysis. In the acute setting, accelerated, extrinsic coagulation components (factors VII, X, V, and prothrombin) are consumed, and a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) is observed more commonly than a prolonged aPTT. Acute DIC is the least likely condition in our patient. He had a normal PT, normal fibrinogen levels, and negative soluble fibrin monomers, factors that exclude the diagnosis of DIC.\n\n【23】*   2.\n\n【24】    **_Which one of the foliowing would be most useful in the initial assessment of this patient?_**\n\n【25】    *   a.\n\n【26】        _History and physical examination_\n\n【27】    *   b.\n\n【28】        _Bleeding time_\n\n【29】    *   c.\n\n【30】        _Platelet count_\n\n【31】    *   d.\n\n【32】        _Prothrombin time_\n\n【33】    *   e.\n\n【34】        _Activated partial thromboplastin time_\n\n【35】In most cases, a thorough history and physical examination will yield vital diagnostic information that may indicate an underlying bleeding disorder. The characteristics of the bleeding event in relationship to its sites and its timing often reveal the general type of coagulopathy involved. Patients with defects of primary hemostasis (eg, thrombocytopenia or abnormal platelet function) tend to have superficial hemorrhage into the skin or mucous membranes that occurs either spontaneously or immediately after trauma. Petechia, ecchymosis, purpura, gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract bleeding, hemoptysis, or epistaxis is a typical manifestation of defective primary hemostasis. In contrast, patients with abnormalities of secondary hemostasis (eg, coagulation factor deficiency) characteristically develop extensive deep tissue hemorrhage such as hemarthrosis, hematomas, or retroperitoneal bleeding, which may be delayed in onset up to 24 to 48 hours after surgery or trauma. Of note, although a family history of bleeding problems is helpful in elucidating the nature of a suspected coagulopathy, no family history does not exclude the possibility of a hereditary bleeding disorder. Our patient underwent a partial nephrectomy due to a motor vehicle accident in 1954, which required 25 U of blood transfusions. After working with cattle, he has had multiple lower extremity bruises. From 1978 until 1992, he had 5 episodes of gross hematuria with clots, and cystoscopy showed no bleeding source. His aPTT was recorded at 39 seconds during one of those episodes of hematuria in 1992, when the standard upper limit for aPTT was 37 seconds. He underwent transurethral prostatic resection because of benign prostatic hyperplasia and developed gross hematuria; 4 U of blood was necessary because his hemoglobin concentration decreased from 12 to 8 g/dL. His family history is notable for a brother who died at the age of 22 because of a brain hemorrhage. The patient's daughter had severe bleeding for 2 days after tonsillectomy.\n\n【36】The bleeding time is fraught with potential technical artifact, and its results are susceptible to misinterpretations that must be recognized. The reproducibility of bleeding times is influenced by several variables, including the direction, size, and depth of the incision, as well as the skin temperature and vascularity at the wound site.\n\n【37】Bleeding time: a guide to its diagnostic and clinical utility.\n\n【38】No bleeding time was performed in our patient.\n\n【39】A low platelet count could be the first sign of an underlying defect in primary hemostasis. However, factors such as improper blood sampling, platelet satellitism, ex vivo platelet clumping, and cold agglutinins can produce spuriously low platelet counts, a phenomenon known as pseudothrombocylopenia. Ethylenediaminetetraacctic acid-induced platelet clumping is probably the most common cause of pseudothrombocytopenia, with reported incidences ranging from 1 in 50 to 1 in 1000 hospitalized patients.\n\n【40】Inherited giant platelet disorders.\n\n【41】Recognition and prevention of pseudothromhocytopenia and concomitant pseudoleukocytosis.\n\n【42】Therefore, if a patient has a low platelet count, a peripheral blood smear should be examined and a repeated complete blood cell count in citrate should be performed to prevent platelet clumping produced by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Our patient had normal platelet counts.\n\n【43】Even though the PT and aPTT are used as screening tests to assess primary bleeding disorders, many factors can produce false-positive test results, eg, drugs (heparin and warfarin), liver disease, and rare deficiencies such as factor XII, prekallikrein, and high-molecular-weight kininogen with no bleeding complications. Our patient had normal liver function test results, and he was taking no drugs that would affect his coagulation system.\n\n【44】*   3.\n\n【45】    **_Which one of the following special coagulation tests would be least helpful in determining the diagnosis in this patient?_**\n\n【46】    *   a.\n\n【47】        _Coagulation factor assays_\n\n【48】    *   b.\n\n【49】        _Ristocetin cofactor activity_\n\n【50】    *   c.\n\n【51】        _vWF antigen_\n\n【52】    *   d.\n\n【53】        _Dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT_ )\n\n【54】    *   e.\n\n【55】        _Platelet aggregation studies_\n\n【56】Coagulation factor assays are necessary to diagnose and to distinguish between hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Clinically, hemophilia B is indistinguishable from hemophilia A.\n\n【57】The recommended panel of tests to diagnose von Willebrand disease includes factor VIII activity; vWF antigen; vWF activity as determined by ristocetin cofactor, which measures the binding activity of vWF to platelet glycoprotein lb; bleeding time; and vWF multimer analysis, which helps to classify von Willebrand disease as type I (all proportionally decreased normal multimer distribution), type II (absent high and intermediate multimer), and type III (undetcctable multimer). Our patient's ristocetin cofactor and vWF antigen values were in the normal range.\n\n【58】The prolongation of aPTT by a lupus anticoagulant is due to binding of lupus anticoagulant antibodies to phospholipids in the FP and partial aPTT reagents, resulting in interference with the assembly of the prothrombinase complex in vitro. The dRVVT is based on the ability of the snake venom, Russell viper venom, to activate factor × to Xa.\n\n【59】The effect of phospholipid on the detection of lupus anticoagulants by the dilute Russell viper venom time.\n\n【60】Consequently, the dRVVT measures the rate of formation and activity of the prothrombinase complex in producing thrombin. The normal range for the dRVVT is 24 to 37 seconds. The dRVVT is prolonged in the presence of a lupus anticoagulant. In addition, on mixing with normal plasma, the dRVVT remains inhibited. Our patient had normal dRVVT test results.\n\n【61】Platelet aggregation studies are used to diagnose hereditary disorders of platelet function such Bernard-Soulier syndrome, Glanzmann thrombasthenia, and storage pool disease. These disorders present with the clinical manifestations of defects in primary hemostasis: petechiae, bruising, and epistaxis. The aPTT is normal in these conditions. Our patient had no clinical manifestations of primary hemostasis defects.\n\n【62】Coagulation factor assays in our patient were normal, except for the factor IX level of 23% (reference range, 65%-140%), confirming the diagnosis of hemophilia B.\n\n【63】*   4.\n\n【64】    **_Which one of the following treatment modalities would be the best choice in this patient?_**\n\n【65】    *   a.\n\n【66】        _Fresh frozen plasma_\n\n【67】    *   b.\n\n【68】        _Cryoprecipitate_\n\n【69】    *   c.\n\n【70】        _Prothrombin complex concentrates_\n\n【71】    *   d.\n\n【72】        _High purified factor IX concentrates_\n\n【73】    *   e.\n\n【74】        _Recombinant factor IX_\n\n【75】Plasma (fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate) contains, by definition, 1 U of factor IX per milliliter. The main disadvantage of plasma is the inability to increase the factor IX level to greater than 10% to 15% of normal because of volume constraints. Since 1969, the use of prothrombin complex concentrates and subsequently high purified factor IX concentrates has been the standard treatment of hemophilia B. However, these products have been associated with viral transmission (hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus), DIC, and thromboembolism.\n\n【76】Current management of hemophilia B.\n\n【77】The best treatment of hemophilia B is recombinant factor IX (rFIX).

Expansion may lead to compression or destruction of adjacent organs. The only reliable treatment is surgical removal of the entire mass; incomplete excision typically leads to a recurrence.\n\n【98】In approximately 1 % to 4% of patients with hemophilia B, inhibitor antibodies develop that inactivate infused factor IX,\n\n【99】Clinical efficacy of prothrombin complex concentrates and recombinant factor VIIa in the treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with factor VII and IX inhibitors.\n\n【100】making treatment of subsequent bleeding episodes more difficult.

Patients who have low titers and are low responders can be managed with normal or greater doses of factor IX, more frequent infusions, or both. Patients with high titers who are high responders usually cannot be treated with increased doses of clotting factor, and alternative therapy is necessary.\n\n【104】Approximately 90% of patients who received clotting factor before the availability of viral inactivation methods in the mid-1980s test positive for antibodies to hepatitis B and C In 15% to 20% of hemophilic patients infected with hepatitis C, the disease progresses to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, or hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n【105】Hepatitis C and haemophilia \\[editorial\\].\n\n【106】The introduction of rFIX has reduced the risk of hepatitis considerably.

Any sign or symptom suggestive of intracranial hemorrhage should be treated as a potential medical emergency.\n\n【110】Discussion\n----------\n\n【111】Hemophilia B (Christmas disease) is a hereditary hemorrhagic disorder characterized by genetic mutations leading to deficiency of factor IX coagulant activity. The incidence of hemophilia B is estimated at approximately 1 in 30,000 live male births.\n\n【112】Structure and function of factor IX: defects in haemophilia B.\n\n【113】It is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene is located in the telomeric end of the long arm of the × chromosome at Xq26-27. Males are clinically affected, and female carriers are usually asymptomatic. Female carriers can be symptomatic, however, and have a factor IX level that is less than 20% of normal in extreme lyonization or abnormalities of the × chromosome. In one third of all persons, hemophilia B arises by de novo mutations in the factor IX gene.\n\n【114】The clinical presentation of hemophilia B is indistinguishable from hemophilia A because factor VIII combines with factor IX, calcium, and phospholipid to convert factor × to Xa. Therefore, a deficiency in factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B) produces the same deficits in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, resulting in the same clinical presentation. Depending on the factor IX levels, hemophilia B is classified as severe (<1 %), moderate (1 %-5%), or mild (6%-25%). The severity of hemophilia B correlates with the risk of bleeding complications. The clinical manifestations of hemophilia B include hemarthrosis, pseudotumors, neurologic symptoms (intracranial hemorrhage, peripheral nerve compression by hematoma), soft tissue hemorrhage, and hematuria.\n\n【115】Hemophilia B must be distinguished from hemophilia A with use of the coagulation factor assay. Acquired deficiency of factor IX commonly occurs in hepatic disease, vitamin K deficiency, and after administration of warfarin therapy. Disease states that may be associated with acquired factor IX deficiency include amyloidosis, nephrotic syndrome, and Gaucher disease. In amyloidosis, factor IX and factor × are believed to bind to the amyloid fibrils in the spleen and liver, resulting in deficiency.\n\n【116】Coagulopathy in amyloidosis: combined deficiency of factors IX and X.\n\n【117】Persons with nephrotic syndrome lose factor IX protein in the urine. In Gaucher disease, the plasma half-life is shortened, presumably because of binding and clearance of the protein by cerebroside deposits.\n\n【118】Replacement therapy is dictated by the severity of the disease and the presence of bleeding. In minor hemorrhage (superficial hematoma), the recommended factor IX activity is 20% to 30%, and duration of treatment is 1 to 2 days. In moderate hemorrhage (hematuria), the factor IX activity is 25% to 50%, and duration of treatment is 3 to 7 days. The recommendation for major hemorrhage (surgery, dental extraction) is a factor IX level of 50% to 100%, and duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. The usual loading dose is 40 to 60 U and then a maintenance dose of 10 to 12 U. Replacement therapy should also be judiciously and cautiously given because of the cost of the available factor IX products. One vial of factor IX (1000 U) is $983.\n\n【119】The finding of an isolated aPTT requires prompt evaluation of the underlying cause. A history of bleeding forms the basis of the diagnosis and treatment of hemonhagic disorders. Since many of these disorders are inherited, the family history is crucial. A constellation of hemorrhagic symptoms, rather than any single symptom, is most helpful in suggesting the cause of the disorder. Thus, spontaneous hemarthrosis and muscle hemorrhages are highly suggestive of severe hemophilia, whereas epislaxis, gingival bleeding, and menorrhagia are more commonly found in patients with thrombocytopenia, platelet disorders, or von Willebrand disease.

Any patient who has an isolated prolonged aPTT with no obvious explanation (ie, heparin or warfarin use or liver disease) should be evaluated for the presence of either a deficiency or an inhibitor of a coagulation factor. In male patients, the presence of hemophilia should be excluded with appropriate testing. Up to 20% of cases of hemophilia occur in families with no prior history of hemophilia, reflecting spontaneous mutations in the respective factor VIII and IX genes. In some patients, hemophilia does not manifest until a stressful situation like surgery occurs.\n\n【18】Lupus anticoagulants are antibodies (IgG and IgM) directed against phospholipids, crucial components of the aPTT assay system. Thus, the presence of lupus anticoagulants results in a prolongation of the aPTT. Lupus anticoagulants have been associated with thrombotic diathesis, spontaneous abortion, thrombocytopenia, neurologic disorders, and, less frequently, hemorrhage. Even though hemorrhagic diathesis is a rare phenomenon due to lupus anticoagulant, bleeding complications,\n\n【19】Bleeding in patients with lupus anticoagulant \\[letter\\].\n\n【20】including epistaxis, hematemesis, joint bleeding, and spontaneous hematoma, have been reported with this condition. Based on our patient's clinical presentation and laboratory test results, a lupus anticoagulant is in the differential diagnosis.\n\n【21】The most common congenital bleeding disorder is von Willebrand disease. This group of disorders is characterized by quantitative or qualitative defects in the von Willebrand factor (vWF), a protein that mediates platelet adhesion. The vWF has a separate function of binding to factor VIII coagulant activity (VIII:c) to protect against degradation. The aPTT is prolonged in von Willebrand disease when factor VIII :c is less than 25% because of decreased vWF to prevent the degradation of the factor VIII:c. In severe forms of von Willebrand disease, the bleeding manifestations can present as hemarthrosis, dissecting intramuscular hematomas, and serious hemorrhage due to traumatic injuries or after surgical procedures, as in our patient.\n\n【22】Acute DIC is a syndrome characterized by excessive protease activity in the blood, resulting in formation of soluble fibrin and fibrinolysis. In the acute setting, accelerated, extrinsic coagulation components (factors VII, X, V, and prothrombin) are consumed, and a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) is observed more commonly than a prolonged aPTT. Acute DIC is the least likely condition in our patient.

The characteristics of the bleeding event in relationship to its sites and its timing often reveal the general type of coagulopathy involved. Patients with defects of primary hemostasis (eg, thrombocytopenia or abnormal platelet function) tend to have superficial hemorrhage into the skin or mucous membranes that occurs either spontaneously or immediately after trauma. Petechia, ecchymosis, purpura, gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract bleeding, hemoptysis, or epistaxis is a typical manifestation of defective primary hemostasis. In contrast, patients with abnormalities of secondary hemostasis (eg, coagulation factor deficiency) characteristically develop extensive deep tissue hemorrhage such as hemarthrosis, hematomas, or retroperitoneal bleeding, which may be delayed in onset up to 24 to 48 hours after surgery or trauma. Of note, although a family history of bleeding problems is helpful in elucidating the nature of a suspected coagulopathy, no family history does not exclude the possibility of a hereditary bleeding disorder. Our patient underwent a partial nephrectomy due to a motor vehicle accident in 1954, which required 25 U of blood transfusions. After working with cattle, he has had multiple lower extremity bruises. From 1978 until 1992, he had 5 episodes of gross hematuria with clots, and cystoscopy showed no bleeding source. His aPTT was recorded at 39 seconds during one of those episodes of hematuria in 1992, when the standard upper limit for aPTT was 37 seconds. He underwent transurethral prostatic resection because of benign prostatic hyperplasia and developed gross hematuria; 4 U of blood was necessary because his hemoglobin concentration decreased from 12 to 8 g/dL. His family history is notable for a brother who died at the age of 22 because of a brain hemorrhage. The patient's daughter had severe bleeding for 2 days after tonsillectomy.\n\n【36】The bleeding time is fraught with potential technical artifact, and its results are susceptible to misinterpretations that must be recognized. The reproducibility of bleeding times is influenced by several variables, including the direction, size, and depth of the incision, as well as the skin temperature and vascularity at the wound site.\n\n【37】Bleeding time: a guide to its diagnostic and clinical utility.\n\n【38】No bleeding time was performed in our patient.\n\n【39】A low platelet count could be the first sign of an underlying defect in primary hemostasis. However, factors such as improper blood sampling, platelet satellitism, ex vivo platelet clumping, and cold agglutinins can produce spuriously low platelet counts, a phenomenon known as pseudothrombocylopenia. Ethylenediaminetetraacctic acid-induced platelet clumping is probably the most common cause of pseudothrombocytopenia, with reported incidences ranging from 1 in 50 to 1 in 1000 hospitalized patients.\n\n【40】Inherited giant platelet disorders.\n\n【41】Recognition and prevention of pseudothromhocytopenia and concomitant pseudoleukocytosis.\n\n【42】Therefore, if a patient has a low platelet count, a peripheral blood smear should be examined and a repeated complete blood cell count in citrate should be performed to prevent platelet clumping produced by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Our patient had normal platelet counts.\n\n【43】Even though the PT and aPTT are used as screening tests to assess primary bleeding disorders, many factors can produce false-positive test results, eg, drugs (heparin and warfarin), liver disease, and rare deficiencies such as factor XII, prekallikrein, and high-molecular-weight kininogen with no bleeding complications. Our patient had normal liver function test results, and he was taking no drugs that would affect his coagulation system.\n\n【44】*   3.\n\n【45】    **_Which one of the following special coagulation tests would be least helpful in determining the diagnosis in this patient?_**\n\n【46】    *   a.\n\n【47】        _Coagulation factor assays_\n\n【48】    *   b.\n\n【49】        _Ristocetin cofactor activity_\n\n【50】    *   c.\n\n【51】        _vWF antigen_\n\n【52】    *   d.\n\n【53】        _Dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT_ )\n\n【54】    *   e.\n\n【55】        _Platelet aggregation studies_\n\n【56】Coagulation factor assays are necessary to diagnose and to distinguish between hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Clinically, hemophilia B is indistinguishable from hemophilia A.\n\n【57】The recommended panel of tests to diagnose von Willebrand disease includes factor VIII activity; vWF antigen; vWF activity as determined by ristocetin cofactor, which measures the binding activity of vWF to platelet glycoprotein lb; bleeding time; and vWF multimer analysis, which helps to classify von Willebrand disease as type I (all proportionally decreased normal multimer distribution), type II (absent high and intermediate multimer), and type III (undetcctable multimer). Our patient's ristocetin cofactor and vWF antigen values were in the normal range.\n\n【58】The prolongation of aPTT by a lupus anticoagulant is due to binding of lupus anticoagulant antibodies to phospholipids in the FP and partial aPTT reagents, resulting in interference with the assembly of the prothrombinase complex in vitro. The dRVVT is based on the ability of the snake venom, Russell viper venom, to activate factor × to Xa.\n\n【59】The effect of phospholipid on the detection of lupus anticoagulants by the dilute Russell viper venom time.\n\n【60】Consequently, the dRVVT measures the rate of formation and activity of the prothrombinase complex in producing thrombin. The normal range for the dRVVT is 24 to 37 seconds. The dRVVT is prolonged in the presence of a lupus anticoagulant. In addition, on mixing with normal plasma, the dRVVT remains inhibited. Our patient had normal dRVVT test results.\n\n【61】Platelet aggregation studies are used to diagnose hereditary disorders of platelet function such Bernard-Soulier syndrome, Glanzmann thrombasthenia, and storage pool disease. These disorders present with the clinical manifestations of defects in primary hemostasis: petechiae, bruising, and epistaxis. The aPTT is normal in these conditions. Our patient had no clinical manifestations of primary hemostasis defects.\n\n【62】Coagulation factor assays in our patient were normal, except for the factor IX level of 23% (reference range, 65%-140%), confirming the diagnosis of hemophilia B.\n\n【63】*   4.\n\n【64】    **_Which one of the following treatment modalities would be the best choice in this patient?_**\n\n【65】    *   a.\n\n【66】        _Fresh frozen plasma_\n\n【67】    *   b.\n\n【68】        _Cryoprecipitate_\n\n【69】    *   c.\n\n【70】        _Prothrombin complex concentrates_\n\n【71】    *   d.\n\n【72】        _High purified factor IX concentrates_\n\n【73】    *   e.\n\n【74】        _Recombinant factor IX_\n\n【75】Plasma (fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate) contains, by definition, 1 U of factor IX per milliliter. The main disadvantage of plasma is the inability to increase the factor IX level to greater than 10% to 15% of normal because of volume constraints. Since 1969, the use of prothrombin complex concentrates and subsequently high purified factor IX concentrates has been the standard treatment of hemophilia B. However, these products have been associated with viral transmission (hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus), DIC, and thromboembolism.\n\n【76】Current management of hemophilia B.\n\n【77】The best treatment of hemophilia B is recombinant factor IX (rFIX).

Expansion may lead to compression or destruction of adjacent organs.

Patients who have low titers and are low responders can be managed with normal or greater doses of factor IX, more frequent infusions, or both. Patients with high titers who are high responders usually cannot be treated with increased doses of clotting factor, and alternative therapy is necessary.\n\n【104】Approximately 90% of patients who received clotting factor before the availability of viral inactivation methods in the mid-1980s test positive for antibodies to hepatitis B and C In 15% to 20% of hemophilic patients infected with hepatitis C, the disease progresses to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, or hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n【105】Hepatitis C and haemophilia \\[editorial\\].\n\n【106】The introduction of rFIX has reduced the risk of hepatitis considerably.

Any sign or symptom suggestive of intracranial hemorrhage should be treated as a potential medical emergency.\n\n【110】Discussion\n----------\n\n【111】Hemophilia B (Christmas disease) is a hereditary hemorrhagic disorder characterized by genetic mutations leading to deficiency of factor IX coagulant activity. The incidence of hemophilia B is estimated at approximately 1 in 30,000 live male births.\n\n【112】Structure and function of factor IX: defects in haemophilia B.\n\n【113】It is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene is located in the telomeric end of the long arm of the × chromosome at Xq26-27. Males are clinically affected, and female carriers are usually asymptomatic. Female carriers can be symptomatic, however, and have a factor IX level that is less than 20% of normal in extreme lyonization or abnormalities of the × chromosome. In one third of all persons, hemophilia B arises by de novo mutations in the factor IX gene.\n\n【114】The clinical presentation of hemophilia B is indistinguishable from hemophilia A because factor VIII combines with factor IX, calcium, and phospholipid to convert factor × to Xa. Therefore, a deficiency in factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B) produces the same deficits in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, resulting in the same clinical presentation. Depending on the factor IX levels, hemophilia B is classified as severe (<1 %), moderate (1 %-5%), or mild (6%-25%). The severity of hemophilia B correlates with the risk of bleeding complications. The clinical manifestations of hemophilia B include hemarthrosis, pseudotumors, neurologic symptoms (intracranial hemorrhage, peripheral nerve compression by hematoma), soft tissue hemorrhage, and hematuria.\n\n【115】Hemophilia B must be distinguished from hemophilia A with use of the coagulation factor assay. Acquired deficiency of factor IX commonly occurs in hepatic disease, vitamin K deficiency, and after administration of warfarin therapy. Disease states that may be associated with acquired factor IX deficiency include amyloidosis, nephrotic syndrome, and Gaucher disease. In amyloidosis, factor IX and factor × are believed to bind to the amyloid fibrils in the spleen and liver, resulting in deficiency.\n\n【116】Coagulopathy in amyloidosis: combined deficiency of factors IX and X.\n\n【117】Persons with nephrotic syndrome lose factor IX protein in the urine. In Gaucher disease, the plasma half-life is shortened, presumably because of binding and clearance of the protein by cerebroside deposits.\n\n【118】Replacement therapy is dictated by the severity of the disease and the presence of bleeding. In minor hemorrhage (superficial hematoma), the recommended factor IX activity is 20% to 30%, and duration of treatment is 1 to 2 days. In moderate hemorrhage (hematuria), the factor IX activity is 25% to 50%, and duration of treatment is 3 to 7 days. The recommendation for major hemorrhage (surgery, dental extraction) is a factor IX level of 50% to 100%, and duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. The usual loading dose is 40 to 60 U and then a maintenance dose of 10 to 12 U. Replacement therapy should also be judiciously and cautiously given because of the cost of the available factor IX products. One vial of factor IX (1000 U) is $983.\n\n【119】The finding of an isolated aPTT requires prompt evaluation of the underlying cause. A history of bleeding forms the basis of the diagnosis and treatment of hemonhagic disorders. Since many of these disorders are inherited, the family history is crucial. A constellation of hemorrhagic symptoms, rather than any single symptom, is most helpful in suggesting the cause of the disorder. Thus, spontaneous hemarthrosis and muscle hemorrhages are highly suggestive of severe hemophilia, whereas epislaxis, gingival bleeding, and menorrhagia are more commonly found in patients with thrombocytopenia, platelet disorders, or von Willebrand disease.

The incidence of hemophilia B is estimated at approximately 1 in 30,000 live male births.\n\n【112】Structure and function of factor IX: defects in haemophilia B.\n\n【113】It is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene is located in the telomeric end of the long arm of the × chromosome at Xq26-27. Males are clinically affected, and female carriers are usually asymptomatic. Female carriers can be symptomatic, however, and have a factor IX level that is less than 20% of normal in extreme lyonization or abnormalities of the × chromosome. In one third of all persons, hemophilia B arises by de novo mutations in the factor IX gene.\n\n【114】The clinical presentation of hemophilia B is indistinguishable from hemophilia A because factor VIII combines with factor IX, calcium, and phospholipid to convert factor × to Xa. Therefore, a deficiency in factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B) produces the same deficits in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, resulting in the same clinical presentation. Depending on the factor IX levels, hemophilia B is classified as severe (<1 %), moderate (1 %-5%), or mild (6%-25%). The severity of hemophilia B correlates with the risk of bleeding complications. The clinical manifestations of hemophilia B include hemarthrosis, pseudotumors, neurologic symptoms (intracranial hemorrhage, peripheral nerve compression by hematoma), soft tissue hemorrhage, and hematuria.\n\n【115】Hemophilia B must be distinguished from hemophilia A with use of the coagulation factor assay. Acquired deficiency of factor IX commonly occurs in hepatic disease, vitamin K deficiency, and after administration of warfarin therapy. Disease states that may be associated with acquired factor IX deficiency include amyloidosis, nephrotic syndrome, and Gaucher disease. In amyloidosis, factor IX and factor × are believed to bind to the amyloid fibrils in the spleen and liver, resulting in deficiency.\n\n【116】Coagulopathy in amyloidosis: combined deficiency of factors IX and X.\n\n【117】Persons with nephrotic syndrome lose factor IX protein in the urine. In Gaucher disease, the plasma half-life is shortened, presumably because of binding and clearance of the protein by cerebroside deposits.\n\n【118】Replacement therapy is dictated by the severity of the disease and the presence of bleeding. In minor hemorrhage (superficial hematoma), the recommended factor IX activity is 20% to 30%, and duration of treatment is 1 to 2 days. In moderate hemorrhage (hematuria), the factor IX activity is 25% to 50%, and duration of treatment is 3 to 7 days. The recommendation for major hemorrhage (surgery, dental extraction) is a factor IX level of 50% to 100%, and duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. The usual loading dose is 40 to 60 U and then a maintenance dose of 10 to 12 U. Replacement therapy should also be judiciously and cautiously given because of the cost of the available factor IX products. One vial of factor IX (1000 U) is $983.\n\n【119】The finding of an isolated aPTT requires prompt evaluation of the underlying cause. A history of bleeding forms the basis of the diagnosis and treatment of hemonhagic disorders. Since many of these disorders are inherited, the family history is crucial. A constellation of hemorrhagic symptoms, rather than any single symptom, is most helpful in suggesting the cause of the disorder. Thus, spontaneous hemarthrosis and muscle hemorrhages are highly suggestive of severe hemophilia, whereas epislaxis, gingival bleeding, and menorrhagia are more commonly found in patients with thrombocytopenia, platelet disorders, or von Willebrand disease. After a thorough bleeding history is obtained, the next step is to proceed with a coagulation work-up, with mixing studies with clotting factor assay as indicated (if aPTT corrects), or work-up for lupus anticoagulant or factor inhibitor (if aPTT remains inhibited on the mixing study).

No hepatosplenomegaly was evident. Findings on lymphatic, cardiovascular, and respiratory examinations were normal.

Any patient who has an isolated prolonged aPTT with no obvious explanation (ie, heparin or warfarin use or liver disease) should be evaluated for the presence of either a deficiency or an inhibitor of a coagulation factor. In male patients, the presence of hemophilia should be excluded with appropriate testing. Up to 20% of cases of hemophilia occur in families with no prior history of hemophilia, reflecting spontaneous mutations in the respective factor VIII and IX genes. In some patients, hemophilia does not manifest until a stressful situation like surgery occurs.\n\n【18】Lupus anticoagulants are antibodies (IgG and IgM) directed against phospholipids, crucial components of the aPTT assay system. Thus, the presence of lupus anticoagulants results in a prolongation of the aPTT. Lupus anticoagulants have been associated with thrombotic diathesis, spontaneous abortion, thrombocytopenia, neurologic disorders, and, less frequently, hemorrhage. Even though hemorrhagic diathesis is a rare phenomenon due to lupus anticoagulant, bleeding complications,\n\n【19】Bleeding in patients with lupus anticoagulant \\[letter\\].\n\n【20】including epistaxis, hematemesis, joint bleeding, and spontaneous hematoma, have been reported with this condition. Based on our patient's clinical presentation and laboratory test results, a lupus anticoagulant is in the differential diagnosis.\n\n【21】The most common congenital bleeding disorder is von Willebrand disease. This group of disorders is characterized by quantitative or qualitative defects in the von Willebrand factor (vWF), a protein that mediates platelet adhesion. The vWF has a separate function of binding to factor VIII coagulant activity (VIII:c) to protect against degradation. The aPTT is prolonged in von Willebrand disease when factor VIII :c is less than 25% because of decreased vWF to prevent the degradation of the factor VIII:c. In severe forms of von Willebrand disease, the bleeding manifestations can present as hemarthrosis, dissecting intramuscular hematomas, and serious hemorrhage due to traumatic injuries or after surgical procedures, as in our patient.\n\n【22】Acute DIC is a syndrome characterized by excessive protease activity in the blood, resulting in formation of soluble fibrin and fibrinolysis. In the acute setting, accelerated, extrinsic coagulation components (factors VII, X, V, and prothrombin) are consumed, and a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) is observed more commonly than a prolonged aPTT. Acute DIC is the least likely condition in our patient. He had a normal PT, normal fibrinogen levels, and negative soluble fibrin monomers, factors that exclude the diagnosis of DIC.\n\n【23】*   2.\n\n【24】    **_Which one of the foliowing would be most useful in the initial assessment of this patient?_**\n\n【25】    *   a.\n\n【26】        _History and physical examination_\n\n【27】    *   b.\n\n【28】        _Bleeding time_\n\n【29】    *   c.\n\n【30】        _Platelet count_\n\n【31】    *   d.\n\n【32】        _Prothrombin time_\n\n【33】    *   e.\n\n【34】        _Activated partial thromboplastin time_\n\n【35】In most cases, a thorough history and physical examination will yield vital diagnostic information that may indicate an underlying bleeding disorder. The characteristics of the bleeding event in relationship to its sites and its timing often reveal the general type of coagulopathy involved. Patients with defects of primary hemostasis (eg, thrombocytopenia or abnormal platelet function) tend to have superficial hemorrhage into the skin or mucous membranes that occurs either spontaneously or immediately after trauma. Petechia, ecchymosis, purpura, gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract bleeding, hemoptysis, or epistaxis is a typical manifestation of defective primary hemostasis. In contrast, patients with abnormalities of secondary hemostasis (eg, coagulation factor deficiency) characteristically develop extensive deep tissue hemorrhage such as hemarthrosis, hematomas, or retroperitoneal bleeding, which may be delayed in onset up to 24 to 48 hours after surgery or trauma. Of note, although a family history of bleeding problems is helpful in elucidating the nature of a suspected coagulopathy, no family history does not exclude the possibility of a hereditary bleeding disorder. Our patient underwent a partial nephrectomy due to a motor vehicle accident in 1954, which required 25 U of blood transfusions. After working with cattle, he has had multiple lower extremity bruises. From 1978 until 1992, he had 5 episodes of gross hematuria with clots, and cystoscopy showed no bleeding source. His aPTT was recorded at 39 seconds during one of those episodes of hematuria in 1992, when the standard upper limit for aPTT was 37 seconds. He underwent transurethral prostatic resection because of benign prostatic hyperplasia and developed gross hematuria; 4 U of blood was necessary because his hemoglobin concentration decreased from 12 to 8 g/dL. His family history is notable for a brother who died at the age of 22 because of a brain hemorrhage. The patient's daughter had severe bleeding for 2 days after tonsillectomy.\n\n【36】The bleeding time is fraught with potential technical artifact, and its results are susceptible to misinterpretations that must be recognized. The reproducibility of bleeding times is influenced by several variables, including the direction, size, and depth of the incision, as well as the skin temperature and vascularity at the wound site.\n\n【37】Bleeding time: a guide to its diagnostic and clinical utility.\n\n【38】No bleeding time was performed in our patient.\n\n【39】A low platelet count could be the first sign of an underlying defect in primary hemostasis. However, factors such as improper blood sampling, platelet satellitism, ex vivo platelet clumping, and cold agglutinins can produce spuriously low platelet counts, a phenomenon known as pseudothrombocylopenia. Ethylenediaminetetraacctic acid-induced platelet clumping is probably the most common cause of pseudothrombocytopenia, with reported incidences ranging from 1 in 50 to 1 in 1000 hospitalized patients.\n\n【40】Inherited giant platelet disorders.\n\n【41】Recognition and prevention of pseudothromhocytopenia and concomitant pseudoleukocytosis.\n\n【42】Therefore, if a patient has a low platelet count, a peripheral blood smear should be examined and a repeated complete blood cell count in citrate should be performed to prevent platelet clumping produced by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid.

In one third of all persons, hemophilia B arises by de novo mutations in the factor IX gene.\n\n【114】The clinical presentation of hemophilia B is indistinguishable from hemophilia A because factor VIII combines with factor IX, calcium, and phospholipid to convert factor × to Xa. Therefore, a deficiency in factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B) produces the same deficits in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, resulting in the same clinical presentation. Depending on the factor IX levels, hemophilia B is classified as severe (<1 %), moderate (1 %-5%), or mild (6%-25%). The severity of hemophilia B correlates with the risk of bleeding complications. The clinical manifestations of hemophilia B include hemarthrosis, pseudotumors, neurologic symptoms (intracranial hemorrhage, peripheral nerve compression by hematoma), soft tissue hemorrhage, and hematuria.\n\n【115】Hemophilia B must be distinguished from hemophilia A with use of the coagulation factor assay. Acquired deficiency of factor IX commonly occurs in hepatic disease, vitamin K deficiency, and after administration of warfarin therapy. Disease states that may be associated with acquired factor IX deficiency include amyloidosis, nephrotic syndrome, and Gaucher disease. In amyloidosis, factor IX and factor × are believed to bind to the amyloid fibrils in the spleen and liver, resulting in deficiency.\n\n【116】Coagulopathy in amyloidosis: combined deficiency of factors IX and X.\n\n【117】Persons with nephrotic syndrome lose factor IX protein in the urine. In Gaucher disease, the plasma half-life is shortened, presumably because of binding and clearance of the protein by cerebroside deposits.\n\n【118】Replacement therapy is dictated by the severity of the disease and the presence of bleeding. In minor hemorrhage (superficial hematoma), the recommended factor IX activity is 20% to 30%, and duration of treatment is 1 to 2 days. In moderate hemorrhage (hematuria), the factor IX activity is 25% to 50%, and duration of treatment is 3 to 7 days. The recommendation for major hemorrhage (surgery, dental extraction) is a factor IX level of 50% to 100%, and duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. The usual loading dose is 40 to 60 U and then a maintenance dose of 10 to 12 U. Replacement therapy should also be judiciously and cautiously given because of the cost of the available factor IX products. One vial of factor IX (1000 U) is $983.\n\n【119】The finding of an isolated aPTT requires prompt evaluation of the underlying cause. A history of bleeding forms the basis of the diagnosis and treatment of hemonhagic disorders. Since many of these disorders are inherited, the family history is crucial. A constellation of hemorrhagic symptoms, rather than any single symptom, is most helpful in suggesting the cause of the disorder. Thus, spontaneous hemarthrosis and muscle hemorrhages are highly suggestive of severe hemophilia, whereas epislaxis, gingival bleeding, and menorrhagia are more commonly found in patients with thrombocytopenia, platelet disorders, or von Willebrand disease. After a thorough bleeding history is obtained, the next step is to proceed with a coagulation work-up, with mixing studies with clotting factor assay as indicated (if aPTT corrects), or work-up for lupus anticoagulant or factor inhibitor (if aPTT remains inhibited on the mixing study). Hemophilia should be considered in the differential diagnosis.", "index": 1255, "show": true, "start": 1255, "end": 1333, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:50:18", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:52:48", "cost": 150.076}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:52:47", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:50:16"}

Bone marrow scarring can also cause you to have a low number of blood-clotting cells called platelets, which increases the risk of bleeding. Myelofibrosis often causes an enlarged spleen.\n\n【3】Myelofibrosis is considered to be a chronic leukemia — a cancer that affects the blood-forming tissues in the body. Myelofibrosis belongs to a group of diseases called myeloproliferative disorders.\n\n【4】Myelofibrosis can happen on its own (primary myelofibrosis) or it can develop from another bone marrow disorder (secondary myelofibrosis).\n\n【5】Some people with myelofibrosis have no symptoms and might not need treatment right away. Others with more-serious forms of the disease might need aggressive treatments right away. Treatment for myelofibrosis, which focuses on relieving symptoms, can involve a variety of options.\n\n【6】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【7】Myelofibrosis usually develops slowly. In its very early stages, many people don't experience signs or symptoms.\n\n【8】As disruption of normal blood cell production increases, signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【9】*   Feeling tired, weak or short of breath, usually because of anemia\n*   Pain or fullness below your ribs on the left side, due to an enlarged spleen\n*   Easy bruising\n*   Easy bleeding\n*   Excessive sweating during sleep (night sweats)\n*   Fever\n*   Bone pain\n\n【10】### When to see a doctor\n\n【11】Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】Myelofibrosis occurs when bone marrow stem cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. The stem cells have the ability to replicate and divide into the multiple specialized cells that make up your blood — red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.\n\n【14】It's not clear what causes the genetic mutations in bone marrow stem cells.\n\n【15】As the mutated blood stem cells replicate and divide, they pass along the mutations to the new cells. As more and more of these mutated cells are created, they begin to have serious effects on blood production.\n\n【16】The end result is usually a lack of red blood cells — which causes the anemia characteristic of myelofibrosis — and an overabundance of white blood cells and varying levels of platelets. In people with myelofibrosis, the normally spongy bone marrow becomes scarred.\n\n【17】Several specific gene mutations have been identified in people with myelofibrosis. The most common is the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene mutation. Other less common mutations include CALR and MPL. Some people with myelofibrosis don't have any identifiable gene mutations. Knowing whether these gene mutations are associated with your myelofibrosis helps determine your prognosis and your treatment.\n\n【18】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【19】Although the cause of myelofibrosis often isn't known, certain factors are known to increase your risk:\n\n【20】*   **Age.** Myelofibrosis can affect anyone, but it's most often diagnosed in people older than 50.\n*   **Another blood cell disorder.** A small portion of people with myelofibrosis develop the condition as a complication of essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera.\n*   **Exposure to certain chemicals.** Myelofibrosis has been linked to exposure to industrial chemicals such as toluene and benzene.\n*   **Exposure to radiation.** People exposed to very high levels of radiation have an increased risk of myelofibrosis.\n\n【21】Complications\n-------------\n\n【22】Complications that may result from myelofibrosis include:\n\n【23】*   **Increased pressure on blood flowing into your liver.** Normally, blood flow from the spleen enters your liver through a large blood vessel called the portal vein. Increased blood flow from an enlarged spleen can lead to high blood pressure in the portal vein (portal hypertension). This in turn can force excess blood into smaller veins in your stomach and esophagus, potentially causing these veins to rupture and bleed.\n*   **Pain.** A severely enlarged spleen can cause abdominal pain and back pain.\n*   **Growths in other areas of your body.** Formation of blood cells outside the bone marrow (extramedullary hematopoiesis) may create clumps (tumors) of developing blood cells in other areas of your body. These tumors may cause problems such as bleeding in your gastrointestinal system, coughing or spitting up of blood, compression of your spinal cord, or seizures.\n*   **Bleeding complications.** As the disease progresses, your platelet count tends to drop below normal (thrombocytopenia) and platelet function becomes impaired. An insufficient number of platelets can lead to easy bleeding — an issue that you and your doctor will want to discuss if you're contemplating any type of surgical procedure.\n*   **Acute leukemia.** Some people with myelofibrosis eventually develop acute myelogenous leukemia, a type of blood and bone marrow cancer that progresses rapidly.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:43:35", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:43:58", "cost": 23.114}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:43:56", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:43:32"}

If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use this medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【30】*   Caffeine\n\n【31】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【32】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【33】*   Abnormal or unusual vaginal bleeding or\n*   Blood clots (eg, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), or history of or\n*   Breast cancer, or history of or\n*   Diabetes with kidney, eye, nerve, or blood vessel damage or\n*   Heart attack, history of or\n*   Heart or blood vessel disease (eg, coronary artery disease, heart valve problems), or history of or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure), uncontrolled or\n*   Jaundice during pregnancy or from using hormonal therapy in the past or\n*   Liver disease, including tumors or cancer or\n*   Major surgery in near future, with prolonged periods of immobilization or\n*   Migraine headache or\n*   Stroke, history of or\n*   Tumors (estrogen-dependent), known or suspected—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【34】*   Angioedema (swelling of the face, tongue, or throat), inherited or\n*   Chloasma gravidarum (skin disorder during pregnancy), history of or\n*   Cholestasis (bile problem) during pregnancy, history of or\n*   Cervical cancer or\n*   Depression, history of or\n*   Gallbladder disease or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) or\n*   Toxic shock syndrome, history of or\n*   Vaginal or cervical erosion or ulcers—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【35】*   Diabetes or\n*   Hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol or fats in the blood), or family history of or\n*   Kidney disease or\n*   Obesity, or history of—Use with caution. These conditions may increase the risk for more serious side effects.\n\n【36】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【37】It is very important that you use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may cause unwanted side effects.\n\n【38】This medicine is to be used only in the vagina. This combination medicine is contained in a ring that is placed into your vagina. The ring will slowly release small amounts of the medicine for your body to absorb.\n\n【39】This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\n【40】NuvaRing® is used in a 4 week cycle. You may start using the vaginal ring on the first day of your menstrual period or between the second and fifth day, keeping it in place for 3 weeks.\n\n【41】Once the ring is in place inside your vagina, you should not be able to feel it. If you feel uncomfortable, the ring may not be inserted far enough. Gently push the ring farther into your vagina. If you feel pain, talk to your doctor.\n\n【42】Check for the presence of the ring inside your vagina regularly (including before and after having sex).\n\n【43】The ring may move down into the lower part of your vagina accidently. This can happen if you strain to have a bowel movement. Use your finger to gently push the ring back into place. If the ring comes all the way out of your vagina, rinse it off with warm water and put it back in. Call your doctor if the ring comes out several times.\n\n【44】Remove the vaginal ring after 3 weeks on the same day of the week and time it was inserted. During the 1-week break, you will usually have your menstrual period. Another ring will be inserted after a week.\n\n【45】While using this medicine, you may need to use an additional form of birth control method (eg, condom, spermicide) during the first 7 days to prevent pregnancy. Do not use a vaginal diaphragm because the ring may affect how the diaphragm fits.\n\n【46】If you need to remove the ring, hook your finger through it and pull it out.\n\n【47】If you are switching from a combination hormonal method (eg, pills, patch) to NuvaRing®, start using this medicine on any day. Do not start using this medicine any later than the day you would start your next birth control pill or patch.\n\n【48】If you are switching from a progestin-only method (eg, progestin-only pill, implant, injection, intrauterine system) to NuvaRing®, start using it on the day after you used your last progestin-only pill, or on the day your implant or IUD is removed, or on the day you would have your next injection. You must also use an additional barrier method of birth control (eg, male condom with spermicide) for the first 7 days.\n\n【49】Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using this medicine. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may change the amount of this medicine that is absorbed in the body.\n\n【50】### Dosing\n\n【51】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【52】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【53】*   For vaginal dosage form (ring):\n    *   For contraception (to prevent pregnancy):\n        *   Adults—One ring inserted into the vagina for 3 weeks, followed by a 1 week ring-free interval. Then, a new ring is inserted 1 week after the last ring was removed.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【54】### Missed Dose\n\n【55】Call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions.\n\n【56】If NuvaRing® has slipped out of the vagina and it has been out less than 3 hours, you should still be protected from pregnancy. If NuvaRing® has been out of the vagina for more than 3 hours, you may not be adequately protected from pregnancy, and must use an extra method of birth control until NuvaRing® has been in place for 7 days in a row.\n\n【57】### Storage\n\n【58】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【59】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【60】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【61】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【62】Store this medicine for up to 4 months after you receive it.\n\n【63】Place the used NuvaRing® in the re-sealable foil pouch and throw it in the trash where children and pets cannot get to it. Do not flush the ring down the toilet.\n\n【64】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【65】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular annual visits to make sure this medicine is working properly and does not cause unwanted effects. Your doctor may also want to check your blood pressure while using this medicine.\n\n【66】Although you are using this medicine to prevent pregnancy, you should know that using this medicine while you are pregnant could harm your unborn baby. If you think you have become pregnant while using this medicine, tell your doctor right away.

PrandiMet\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Repaglinide and metformin combination is used to treat high blood sugar levels caused by a type of diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes) called type 2 diabetes. It is used together with a proper diet and exercise to help control blood sugar levels in patients who are already treated with meglitinide and metformin combination, or in patients who have been taking meglitinide or metformin but did not work well.\n\n【4】Repaglinide causes your pancreas to release more insulin into the blood stream. Metformin reduces the absorption of sugar from the stomach, reduces the release of stored sugar from the liver, and helps your body use sugar better.\n\n【5】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【6】Before Using\n------------\n\n【7】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【12】### Geriatric\n\n【13】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of repaglinide and metformin combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require an adjustment of in the dose for patients receiving repaglinide and metformin combination.\n\n【14】### Breastfeeding\n\n【15】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【16】### Drug Interactions\n\n【17】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

Also tell your doctor if you are using insulin to treat your diabetes.\n\n【50】It is very important to follow carefully any instructions from your health care team about:\n\n【51】*   Alcohol—Drinking alcohol may cause severe low blood sugar. Discuss this with your health care team.\n*   Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, patients with diabetes may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur in patients with diabetes during pregnancy.\n*   Travel—Keep your recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.\n*   In case of emergency—There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.\n\n【52】Under certain conditions, too much metformin and repaglinide can cause lactic acidosis. Symptoms of lactic acidosis are severe and quick to appear and usually occur when other health problems not related to the medicine are present and are very severe, such as a heart attack or kidney failure. Call your doctor right away if you have abdominal or stomach discomfort, decreased appetite, diarrhea, fast, shallow breathing, general feeling of discomfort, muscle pain or cramping, nausea, or unusual sleepiness, tiredness, or weakness.\n\n【53】Let your doctor or dentist know you are taking this medicine. Your doctor may advise you to stop taking this medicine before you have major surgery or diagnostic tests (eg, x-rays, CT scans, and MRIs), especially tests that use a contrast dye.\n\n【54】This medicine may cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This is more common when this medicine is taken together with certain medicines. Low blood sugar must be treated before it causes you to pass out (unconsciousness). People feel different symptoms of low blood sugar. It is important that you learn which symptoms you usually have so you can treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat low blood sugar.\n\n【55】Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your medicine, overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual. High blood sugar can be very serious and must be treated right away. It is important that you learn which symptoms you have in order to treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat high blood sugar.\n\n【56】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【57】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【58】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【59】#### More common\n\n【60】1.  Anxiety\n2.  blurred vision\n3.  body aches or pain\n4.  chills\n5.  cold sweats\n6.  coma\n7.  confusion\n8.  cool, pale skin\n9.  cough\n10.  depression\n11.  difficulty with breathing\n12.  dizziness\n13.  ear congestion\n14.  fast heartbeat\n15.  fever\n16.  headache\n17.  increased hunger\n18.  loss of voice\n19.  nasal congestion\n20.  nausea\n21.  nervousness\n22.  nightmares\n23.  runny nose\n24.  seizures\n25.  shakiness\n26.  slurred speech\n27.  sneezing\n28.  sore throat\n29.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n\n【61】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention.

The study used respondents who answered questions on 1 or more of 3 surveys (initial, 1990-1992; second, 2003-2004; and third, 2008-2009). The trends of prevalence of GI symptoms over time were analyzed in responders who completed 3 surveys, and the natural history or transition was evaluated.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The overall prevalence of major symptom groupings including gastroesophageal reflux disease was consistent among residents in a community on 3 survey time points (1990-1992, 2003-2004, and 2008-2009). The transitions of GI symptoms were common in 228 patients who responded to all 3 surveys; only 29% had the same symptom category in 3 surveys; otherwise, symptoms changed over time, resolving, recurring, or transitioning to another disorder. Observed proportions of symptom transitions were significantly different from expected during 20 years ( _P_ <.001). Higher non-GI somatic symptom scores were significantly associated with both symptom transitions (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.38 to 10.77) and having sustained symptoms (odds ratio, 12.7; 95% CI, 4.62 to 34.90).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The overall population prevalence of chronic unexplained GI symptoms is stable, but in individuals, transitions seem to be the rule.

Two categories of low vs high estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, dichotomized at 10 mL/min/1.73 m  ) and slow vs fast slope (dichotomized at −10 mL/min/1.73 m  /y) were combined into 4 groups.

The 30-day mortality rate was 6% (stroke, n=2; ventricular fibrillation, n=1). A mean ± SD follow-up of 14.9±9.3 years was feasible in 48 of 49 survivors; improvement in functional class was observed in 42 patients.

Among the 516 CCP units administered, only a handful of mild allergic transfusion reactions occurred without any reported cases of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). These data align with the previously reported safety profile of CCP under the Food and Drug Administration’s Expanded Access Program (EAP), in which 20,000 CCP transfusions had an overall serious transfusion reaction rate of less than 1% and a TRALI reaction rate of 0.1%.\n\n【4】Safety update: COVID-19 convalescent plasma in 20,000 hospitalized patients.\n\n【5】Ultimately, the occurrence of TRALI from donor HLA antibodies (HLA-Abs) requires alignment between the donor’s HLA-Ab specificities and the recipient’s HLA alleles as well as the donor’s HLA-Ab being of sufficient strength in that particular blood product to elicit such a reaction. As such, only a subset of donated units that contain HLA-Abs will actually trigger TRALI in the recipient, so blood product HLA-Ab rates will exceed actual TRALI reaction rates.\n\n【6】The restriction of plasma products from specific donor populations or selective screening of certain donors for HLA-Abs has certainly reduced but not eliminated TRALI reactions.\n\n【7】Ten years of TRALI mitigation: measuring our progress.\n\n【8】The current schema of screening previously pregnant female donors once since their last reported pregnancy is a balance between detecting HLA alloimmunization among those donors at highest risk and optimizing the product testing burden on blood collection centers. What matters ultimately, though, is whether sufficient HLA-Abs are present in a given transfusion product.\n\n【9】Our hospital-based blood collection facility’s decision to universally screen every single CCP donation for HLA-Abs (and thus detect the increased rate of HLA-Abs among our male CCP donors) was driven by both donor and recipient factors for this special blood product. On the donor side, all CCP donors have recently recovered from a viral infection. HLA-Abs are known to wax and wane over time, and infections stimulating HLA-Ab production have been reported.\n\n【10】Infectious pathogens may trigger specific allo-HLA reactivity via multiple mechanisms.\n\n【11】Pretransplant kinetics of anti-HLA in patients on the waiting list for kidney transplantation.\n\n【12】On the recipient side, CCP recipients under the EAP were required to have or to be at high risk for development of severe or life-threatening COVID-19 infection. Severe or life-threatening COVID-19 infection was largely defined under the EAP as having evidence of virus-induced lung injury. Given such a recipient population, there was concern that TRALI could be more easily missed compared with patient populations receiving routine plasma products.\n\n【13】We completely agree that larger studies are required to determine whether this male CCP donor HLA-Ab phenomenon is a more universal feature of recent recovery from SARS-CoV-2 viral infection or a local phenomenon at a single blood collection facility. To that end, we are currently completing a larger regional cross-sectional study of HLA-Ab positivity screening rates among male CCP EAP donors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:17:56", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:18:10", "cost": 13.977}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:18:09", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:17:55"}

Most of the time, Meniere's disease affects only one ear.\n\n【2】Meniere's disease can happen at any age. But it usually starts between the ages of 40 to 60. It's thought to be a lifelong condition. But some treatments can help ease symptoms and lessen how it affects your life long-term.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Symptoms of Meniere's disease include:\n\n【5】*   **Regular dizzy spells.** You have a spinning feeling that starts and stops suddenly. Vertigo may start without warning. It usually lasts 20 minutes to 12 hours, but not more than 24 hours. Serious vertigo can cause nausea.\n*   **Hearing loss.** Hearing loss in Meniere's disease may come and go, especially early on. Over time, hearing loss can be long-lasting and not get better.\n*   **Ringing in the ear.** Ringing in the ear is called tinnitus. Tinnitus is the term for when you have a ringing, buzzing, roaring, whistling or hissing sound in your ear.\n*   **Feeling of fullness in the ear.** People with Meniere's disease often feel pressure in the ear. This is called aural fullness.\n\n【6】After a vertigo attack, symptoms get better and might go away for a while. Over time, how many vertigo attacks you have may lessen.\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】See your health care provider if you have symptoms of Meniere's disease. Other illnesses can cause these problems. So, it's important to find out what's causing your symptoms as soon as possible.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】The cause of Meniere's disease isn't known. Symptoms of Meniere's disease may be due to extra fluid in the inner ear called endolymph. But it isn't clear what causes this fluid to build up in the inner ear.\n\n【11】Issues that affect the fluid, which might lead to Meniere's disease, include:\n\n【12】*   Poor fluid drainage. This may be due to a blockage or irregular ear shape.\n*   Autoimmune disorders.\n*   Viral infection.\n*   Genetics.\n\n【13】Because no single cause has been found, Meniere's disease likely has a combination of causes.\n\n【14】Complications\n-------------\n\n【15】The most difficult complications of Meniere's disease can be:\n\n【16】*   Unexpected vertigo attacks.\n*   Possibly losing your hearing long-term.\n\n【17】The disease can happen at any time. This can cause worry and stress.\n\n【18】Vertigo can cause you to lose balance. This can increase your risk of falls and accidents.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:42:00", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:42:22", "cost": 22.233}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:42:20", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:41:57"}

In one of the few studies examining the link between the EHR and physician satisfaction, certain aspects of the EHR, such as improved access to patient data, improvement in the general quality of care (ie, legibility of provider documentation), and an improved ability to view results longitudinally, were identified as positives.

Bryan  has documented the correlation of burnout with error rates that affect quality and safety, not to mention physicians’ connection to the mission. Patient satisfaction (which, in turn, affects clinical compliance, confidence in the caregiving system, and political support for the health care enterprise) correlates tightly with provider engagement. Similarly, the recruitment and retention of health care providers also depend, to a large extent, on the pride, esprit de corps, and engagement that does or does not exist within a given clinical environment.\n\n【23】US medical students are now choosing career paths that maximize lifestyle control, a factor responsible for much of the changing pattern of specialty choice as well as the difficulty in recruiting new graduates to primary care.\n\n【24】Influence of controllable lifestyle on recent trends in specialty choice by US medical students.\n\n【25】In a study of more than 13,500 physicians, almost 60% would not recommend a career in medicine to either their children or other young people, and more than one-third of physicians said they would not choose medicine as a career again.\n\n【26】Unless those of us who lead the clinical endeavor—in medicine, nursing, and our sibling professions—rally to deepen our understanding of this phenomenon and implement strategies to reduce its prevalence, the implications are dire.\n\n【27】Bujack\n\n【28】Healthcare leaders as agents of change.\n\n【29】suggests that we would be wise to consider the physician workforce as the driver of success in care delivery rather than as a mass of interchangeable parts. He encourages us to define institutional success as recruiting talented physicians, aligning institutional and physicians’ expectations, and investing in each health care provider as a precious resource. Given the current state of affairs, this type of orientation to the clinical workforce is essential if we are to not only create clinical environments designed for our patients but also engender satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment among our colleagues.\n\n【30】We believe that action is necessary on 3 levels.\n\n【31】First, our leading institutions, and the individuals who steer those institutions, need to “put a stake in the ground,” calling all health care providers to engage in our work that is creative on the one hand and deeply mission focused on the other. The Project Professionalism,\n\n【32】an undertaking of the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation, is an example, as it forcefully attempts to ground us all in the higher purpose of our work. The “competencies” recently selected and asserted by the Association of American Medical Colleges\n\n【33】provide another example.\n\n【34】Second, within academic medicine, we need a broad, but integrated, research agenda focusing on engagement. Warren et al\n\n【35】Does caring for trauma patients lead to psychological stress in surgeons?\n\n【36】provide an example with their work on resilience.\n\n【37】Resilience has been described as the capacity to “bounce back” after a traumatic event or an individual’s general ability to manage and flourish in the face of adversity.\n\n【38】Loss, trauma, and human resilience: have we underestimated the human capacity to thrive after extremely aversive events?\n\n【39】Although there is not yet consensus on whether resilience is an inherent trait or something that can be learned, better understanding an individual’s resilience may help identify those more at risk of burnout or other negative psychological consequences. For example, in a study of secondary traumatic stress in surgeons, resilience was the only factor that significantly correlated with whether surgeons experienced these symptoms.\n\n【40】Does caring for trauma patients lead to psychological stress in surgeons?\n\n【41】Furthermore, studies have shown that an intervention to improve resilience and reduce stress and anxiety was both feasible and effective.\n\n【42】Stress management and resilience training among department of medicine faculty: a pilot randomized clinical trial.\n\n【43】Increasingly, initiatives to reduce burnout and increase resilience are being adopted in medical school curricula to empower new physicians to better manage the challenges associated with the practice of medicine.\n\n【44】Physician resilience: what it means, why it matters, and how to promote it.\n\n【45】Physician resilience and burnout: can you make the switch?\n\n【46】We theorize that such strategies could be easily implemented for physician leaders as well. Thus, identifying and bolstering resilience may be an important key to helping reduce burnout as physicians navigate rapid changes in the organization of care delivery systems and implementation of patient-centered care.\n\n【47】Finally, leaders at the care delivery level need to commit to experimentation in the service of reconnecting clinicians with the core values of our professions. Institutional level support is important, but it is no substitute for local, work unit–based initiatives.

The HealthTexas Provider Network (a group practice within Baylor Scott & White Health) recently recognized that only 19% of their physicians were satisfied with the amount of time it took them to complete their daily work. As a result, the HealthTexas Provider Network has made the commitment to evaluate and redesign every aspect of outpatient clinical workflow, developing best practices through experimentation and physician empowerment. This process has changed the culture of the organization, with physician satisfaction now emerging as a top priority, not as an alternative to focusing on the patient but as a path toward patient-centered care.\n\n【51】The prevalence of burnout in all its manifestations—boredom, detachment, and disengagement—erodes our professions from the inside.

Camcevi\n2.  Eligard\n3.  Lupron\n4.  Lupron Depot\n5.  Lupron Depot-Ped\n6.  Viadur\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Leuprolide injection is a synthetic (man-made) hormone that is similar to a natural hormone that is produced in the brain. It is used to treat a number of medical problems including:\n\n【4】*   Anemia caused by bleeding from uterine leiomyomas (fibroid tumors in the uterus), or\n*   Cancer of the prostate that is advanced or late-stage, or\n*   Central precocious puberty, a condition which causes early puberty in boys (before 9 years of age) and girls (before 8 years of age), or\n*   Pain due to endometriosis.\n\n【5】Lupron Depot® 11.25 mg is used in combination with norethindrone acetate to initially relieve and manage the reoccurrence of the painful symptoms of endometriosis. It is also used together with iron to treat bleeding in women with anemia caused by uterine leiomyomas before a surgical procedure. It is given in women who need 3 months of hormonal suppression.\n\n【6】When given regularly to men, leuprolide decreases testosterone levels. Reducing the amount of testosterone in the body helps treat cancer of the prostate.\n\n【7】When given regularly to women, leuprolide decreases estrogen levels. Reducing the amount of estrogen in the body helps treat endometriosis. Leuprolide will also shrink tumors in the uterus, which decreases vaginal bleeding and helps prevent anemia.\n\n【8】When given regularly to boys and girls who have early puberty, leuprolide slows the development of the genital area for both sexes. Leuprolide will also slow breast development in girls. This medicine will delay puberty only as long as the child continues to receive it.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Emulsion\n*   Powder for Suspension, 4 Month\n*   Solution\n*   Powder for Suspension, 6 Month\n*   Powder for Suspension, 1 Month\n*   Powder for Suspension, 3 Month\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of leuprolide pediatric injection in children. However, use is not recommended in children younger than 2 years of age. Leuprolide pediatric injection will stop having an effect for central precocious puberty soon after the child stops using it, and puberty will advance normally.\n\n【18】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Camcevi™, Eligard®, Lupron®, Lupron Depot®, Lupron Depot®-3 month, Lupron Depot®-4 month, Lupron Depot®-6 month, or Lupron Depot® 11.25 mg in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【19】### Geriatric\n\n【20】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Camcevi™, Eligard®, Lupron®, Lupron Depot®, Lupron Depot®-3 month, Lupron Depot®-4 month, or Lupron Depot®-6 month in the elderly.\n\n【21】Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of Lupron Depot® 11.25 mg have not been performed in the geriatric population. This medicine is not indicated for use in elderly women.\n\n【22】No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of Fensolvi® or Lupron Depot-Ped® in the elderly.\n\n【23】### Breastfeeding\n\n【24】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【25】### Drug Interactions\n\n【26】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

A computed tomography scan revealed a 3 cm mass in the bladder . Cystoscopy confirmed a round lesion along the posterior base of the bladder with focal areas of hemorrhage and blue discoloration . The remainder of the bladder was normal. She underwent transurethral resection of the mass with pathological analysis and immunohistochemical staining confirming endometrial glands.

Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, chest pain, cough, dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting, fast heartbeat, pain, redness, or swelling in the arm or leg, pains in the chest, groin, or legs, especially calves of the legs, severe headaches, sudden loss of coordination, sudden onset of slurred speech, sudden vision changes, or trouble breathing.\n\n【58】Baricitinib can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection:\n\n【59】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor right away if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects, such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【60】While you are being treated with baricitinib, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Baricitinib may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.\n\n【61】This medicine can cause serious allergic reactions, including angioedema or urticaria. Tell your doctor right away if you start to have swelling of your face, lips, tongue, throat, arms, or legs, or if you are having trouble swallowing or breathing.\n\n【62】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【63】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【64】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【65】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【66】#### More common\n\n【67】1.

Phagocytes usually help your body fight infections. When they don't work as they should, phagocytes can't protect your body from bacterial and fungal infections.\n\n【2】People with chronic granulomatous disease may develop infections in their lungs, skin, lymph nodes, liver, stomach and intestines, or other areas. They also may develop clusters of white blood cells in infected areas. Most people are diagnosed with CGD during childhood, but some people may not be diagnosed until adulthood.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】People with chronic granulomatous disease experience serious bacterial or fungal infection every few years. An infection in the lungs, including pneumonia, is common. People with CGD may develop a serious type of fungal pneumonia after being exposed to dead leaves, mulch or hay.\n\n【5】It's also common for people with CGD to experience infections of the skin, liver, stomach and intestines, brain, and eyes. Symptoms associated with infections include:\n\n【6】*   Fever.\n*   Chest pain when inhaling or exhaling.\n*   Swollen and sore lymph glands.\n*   An ongoing runny nose.\n*   Skin irritation that may include a rash, swelling or redness.\n*   Swelling and redness in the mouth.\n*   Gastrointestinal problems that may include:\n    *   Vomiting.\n    *   Diarrhea.\n    *   Stomach pain.\n    *   Bloody stool.\n    *   A painful pocket of pus near the anus.\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】If you think you or your child has a type of fungal pneumonia from being around dead leaves, mulch or hay, get medical care right away. If you or your child has frequent infections and the symptoms listed above, talk to your health care provider.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】A change in one of five genes can cause CGD. People with CGD inherit the changed gene from a parent. These genes produce proteins that form an enzyme. This enzyme helps your immune system work properly. The enzyme is active in white blood cells, called phagocytes, that protect you from infections by destroying fungi and bacteria. The enzyme is also active in immune cells that help your body heal.\n\n【11】When there are changes to one of these genes, the protective proteins are not produced. Or they're produced, but they don't function properly.\n\n【12】Some people with CGD don't have one of these changed genes. In these cases, health care providers don't know what causes the condition.\n\n【13】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【14】Boys are more likely to have CGD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:51:22", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:52:43", "cost": 81.153}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:52:41", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:51:20"}

We thank them for providing information on their numerous publications generated from the TEMPiS study.\n\n【1】Effects of the implementation of a telemedical stroke network: the Telemedic Pilot Project for Integrative Stroke Care (TEMPiS) in Bavaria, Germany.\n\n【2】The network of hospitals in Bavaria that make up TEMPiS has demonstrated that telemedicine can be an effective way of delivering stroke expertise to hospitals that had previously lacked extensive experience with thrombolytic therapy. It is true that the nonrandomized, unblinded, open-intervention TEMPiS study showed that specialized stroke treatment in TEMPiS telemedicine network hospitals independently reduced the probability of a poor outcome. However, it is worth noting that the positive effects of being in-network were likely not simply the result of telemedicine. The intervention, and thus the systematic difference between in-network and out-of-network hospitals, included implementation of stroke wards, stroke teams, continuous medical education for the personnel of the participating network hospitals, collaboration with stroke neurologists, and the telemedical support. Interestingly, the overall rate of teleconsultation among the in-network hospitals was only 36%.\n\n【3】For large geographic regions, telemedicine provides an impetus for better organization and standardization of care for stroke. Recruitment rates for acute stroke trials are influenced by the organizational structure of the research team.\n\n【4】Recruiting subjects for acute stroke trials: a meta-analysis.\n\n【5】Advantages of TEMPiS and similarly structured regional telestroke networks could make phase 3 clinical stroke trials more cost- and time-efficient. For instance, hub hospitals engaged in acute stroke trials could use telemedicine to screen patients and obtain consent as well as to enroll, randomize, treat, and even follow up patients at remote spoke hospitals.\n\n【6】We agree that long-term stroke telemedicine patient outcome and safety data, beyond thrombolysis decision making, are needed from an increased number of international networks. Additional questions that require an answer are as follows: (1) Is stroke telemedicine cost-effective? (2) What is the most favorable stroke telemedicine network model: hub-and-spoke or third-party consult? (3) Must telemedicine-treated acute stroke patients be transferred from a rural spoke hospital to a primary stroke center to derive long-term benefit? (4) How can telestroke practitioners best overcome intrastate, interstate, and even international licensing, credentialing, privilege, marketplace, business, and malpractice insurance issues for a consultative modality that knows no geographic limits?\n\n【7】The stroke telemedicine review by Demaerschalk et al\n\n【8】Stroke telemedicine.\n\n【9】also highlighted that, despite the fact that many international centers are engaged in telestroke practice and research, the field is still missing common, standardized, and uniformly applied measures of telestroke quality of care and acceptable guidelines for telestroke practice.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": []}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:31:03", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:19:24"}

It's a treatment for kidney failure, a condition where the kidneys can't filter blood well enough any longer.\n\n【2】During peritoneal dialysis, a cleansing fluid flows through a tube into part of the stomach area, also called the abdomen. The inner lining of the abdomen, known as the peritoneum, acts as a filter and removes wastes from blood. After a set amount of time, the fluid with the filtered waste flows out of the abdomen and is thrown away.\n\n【3】Because peritoneal dialysis works inside the body, it's different from a more-common procedure to clean the blood called hemodialysis. That procedure filters blood outside the body in a machine.\n\n【4】Peritoneal dialysis treatments can be done at home, at work or while you travel. But it's not a treatment option for everyone with kidney failure. You need to be able to use your hands in a skillful way and care for yourself at home. Or you need a trusted caregiver to help you with this process.\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】You need dialysis if your kidneys no longer work well enough. Kidney damage often becomes worse over many years due to health issues such as:\n\n【7】*   Diabetes mellitus.\n*   High blood pressure.\n*   A group of diseases called glomerulonephritis, which damage the part of the kidneys that filter blood.\n*   Genetic diseases, including one called polycystic kidney disease that causes many cysts to form in the kidneys.\n*   Use of medicines that could damage the kidneys. This includes heavy or long-term use of pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve).\n\n【8】In hemodialysis, blood is removed from the body and filtered through a machine. Then the filtered blood is returned to the body. This procedure often is done in a health care setting, such as a dialysis center or hospital. Sometimes, it can be done at home.\n\n【9】Both types of dialysis can filter blood. But the benefits of peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis include:\n\n【10】*   **More independence and time for your daily routine.** Often, you can do peritoneal dialysis at home, work or in any other space that is clean and dry. This can be convenient if you have a job, travel or live far from a hemodialysis center.\n*   **A less restricted diet.** Peritoneal dialysis is done in a more continuous way than hemodialysis. Less potassium, sodium and fluid build up in the body as a result. This lets you have a more flexible diet than you could have on hemodialysis.\n*   **Longer-lasting kidney function.** With kidney failure, the kidneys lose most of their ability to function. But they still may be able to do a little bit of work for a time. People who use peritoneal dialysis might keep this leftover kidney function slightly longer than people who use hemodialysis.\n*   **No needles in a vein.** Before you start peritoneal dialysis, a catheter tube is placed in your belly with surgery. Cleansing dialysis fluid enters and exits your body through this tube once you begin treatment. But with hemodialysis, needles need to be placed in a vein at the start of each treatment so the blood can be cleaned outside the body.\n\n【11】Talk with your care team about which type of dialysis might be best for you. Factors to think about include your:\n\n【12】*   Kidney function.\n*   Overall health.\n*   Personal preferences.\n*   Home situation.\n*   Lifestyle.\n\n【13】Peritoneal dialysis may be the better choice if you:\n\n【14】*   Have trouble coping with side effects that may happen during hemodialysis. These include muscle cramps or a sudden drop in blood pressure.\n*   Want a treatment that's less likely to get in the way of your daily routine.\n*   Want to work or travel more easily.\n*   Have some leftover kidney function.\n\n【15】Peritoneal dialysis might not work if you have:\n\n【16】*   Scars in your abdomen from past surgeries.\n*   A large area of weakened muscle in the abdomen, called a hernia.\n*   Trouble caring for yourself, or a lack of caregiving support.\n*   Some conditions that affect the digestive tract, such as inflammatory bowel disease or frequent bouts of diverticulitis.\n\n【17】In time, it's also likely that people using peritoneal dialysis will lose enough kidney function to need hemodialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\n【18】Risks\n-----\n\n【19】Complications of peritoneal dialysis can include:\n\n【20】*   **Infections.** An infection of the abdomen's inner lining is called peritonitis. This is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis. An infection also can start at the site where the catheter is placed to carry the cleansing fluid, called dialysate, into and out of the abdomen. The risk of infection is greater if the person doing the dialysis isn't well trained.\n\n【21】    To lower the risk of an infection, wash your hands with soap and warm water before you touch your catheter. Each day, clean the area where the tube goes into your body — ask your health care provider which cleanser to use. Keep the catheter dry except during showers. Also, wear a surgical mask over your nose and mouth while you drain and refill the cleansing fluid.\n\n【22】*   **Weight gain.** Dialysate contains sugar called dextrose. If your body absorbs some of this fluid, it might cause you to take in hundreds of extra calories daily, leading to weight gain. The extra calories also can cause high blood sugar, especially if you have diabetes.\n*   **Hernia.** Holding fluid in the body for long amounts of time may strain the muscles of the abdomen.\n*   **Treatment becomes less effective.** Peritoneal dialysis can stop working after several years. You may need to switch to hemodialysis.\n\n【23】If you have peritoneal dialysis, you'll need to stay away from:\n\n【24】*   Certain medicines that can damage the kidneys, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n*   Soaking in a bath or hot tub. Or swimming in a pool without chlorine, a lake, pond or river. These things raise the risk of infection.\n\n【25】    It's fine to take a daily shower. It's also okay to swim in a pool with chlorine once the site where your catheter comes out of your skin is completely healed. Dry this area and change into dry clothes right after you swim.\n\n【26】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【27】You'll need surgery to get a catheter placed in your stomach area, often near the bellybutton. The catheter is the tube that carries cleansing fluid in and out of your abdomen. The surgery is done using medicine that keeps you from feeling pain, called anesthesia.\n\n【28】After the tube is placed, your health care provider will probably recommend that you wait at least two weeks before you start peritoneal dialysis treatments. This gives the catheter site time to heal.\n\n【29】You'll also receive training on how to use the peritoneal dialysis equipment.\n\n【30】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【31】During peritoneal dialysis:\n\n【32】*   The cleansing fluid called dialysate flows into the abdomen. It stays there for a certain amount of time, often 4 to 6 hours. This is called the dwell time. Your health care provider decides how long it lasts.\n*   Dextrose sugar in the dialysate helps filter waste, chemicals and extra fluid in the blood. It filters these from tiny blood vessels in the lining of the abdomen.\n*   When the dwell time is over, dialysate — along with waste products drawn from your blood — drains into a sterile bag.\n\n【33】The process of filling and then draining your abdomen is called an exchange. Different types of peritoneal dialysis have different schedules of exchange. The two main types are:\n\n【34】*   Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).\n*   Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD).\n\n【35】### Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)\n\n【36】You fill your abdomen with dialysate, let it remain there for the dwell time, then drain the fluid. Gravity moves the fluid through the catheter and into and out of your abdomen.\n\n【37】With CAPD:\n\n【38】*   You may need 3 to 5 exchanges during the day and one with a longer dwell time while you sleep.\n*   You can do the exchanges at home, work or another clean, dry place.\n*   You're free to do your regular activities while the cleansing fluid is inside your body.\n\n【39】### Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD)\n\n【40】Another name for this is automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). This method uses a machine called an automated cycler. The machine does the exchanges for you at night while you sleep. It fills your abdomen with dialysate and lets it dwell there. Then it drains the fluid into a sterile bag that you empty in the morning.\n\n【41】With CCPD:\n\n【42】*   You must stay attached to the machine while it does exchanges for you at night.\n*   You aren't connected to the machine during the day. But in the morning, you might start one exchange with a dwell time that lasts the entire day. Follow your care team's directions.\n*   You might have a lower risk of the infection peritonitis. This is because you connect and disconnect to the dialysis equipment less often than you do with CAPD.\n\n【43】Your care team helps you choose the method of exchange that's best for you. It depends on your health, lifestyle and personal choices. Your care team might suggest certain changes to tailor the procedure for you.\n\n【44】Results\n-------\n\n【45】Many things affect how well peritoneal dialysis works at removing wastes and extra fluid from the blood. These factors include:\n\n【46】*   Your size.\n*   How quickly the inner lining of your abdomen filters waste.\n*   How much dialysis solution you use.\n*   The number of daily exchanges.\n*   Length of dwell times.\n*   The concentration of sugar in the dialysis solution.\n\n【47】To find out if your dialysis is removing enough waste from your body, you might need certain tests:\n\n【48】*   **Peritoneal equilibration test (PET).** This compares samples of your blood and your dialysis solution during an exchange. The results show whether waste toxins pass quickly or slowly from your blood into the dialysate. That information helps determine whether your dialysis would work better if the cleansing fluid stayed in your abdomen for a shorter or longer time.\n*   **Clearance test.** This checks a blood sample and a sample of used dialysis fluid for levels of a waste product called urea. The test helps find out how much urea is being removed from your blood during dialysis. If your body still produces urine, your care team also may take a urine sample to measure how much urea is in it.\n\n【49】If the test results show that your dialysis routine is not removing enough wastes, your care team might:\n\n【50】*   Increase the number of exchanges.\n*   Increase the amount of dialysate you use for each exchange.\n*   Use a dialysate with a higher concentration of the sugar dextrose.\n\n【51】You can get better dialysis results and boost your overall health by eating the right foods. These include foods that are high in protein and low in sodium and phosphorus. A health professional called a dietitian can make a meal plan just for you. Your diet will likely be based on your weight, personal preferences and how much kidney function you have left. It's also based on any other health conditions you have, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.\n\n【52】Take your medicines exactly as prescribed. This helps you get the best possible results. While you receive peritoneal dialysis, you may need medicines that help:\n\n【53】*   Control blood pressure.\n*   Help the body make red blood cells.\n*   Control the levels of certain nutrients in the blood.\n*   Prevent phosphorus from building up in the blood.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:17:41", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:18:00", "cost": 19.052}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:18:00", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:17:41"}

Only patients with first-time FPE who had undergone BNP assessment and echocardiography within 24 hours of presentation were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those with reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) (<50%) and those with preserved LVEF (≥50%).\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Thirty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria (22 female, 15 male). Mean ± SD LVEF was 41%±13%. The LVEF was reduced in 73% (group 1, n=27; mean ± SD age, 75±8 years) and preserved in 27% (group 2, n=10; mean ± SD age, 75±13 years). Most frequent underlying causes for first-time FPE were coronary artery disease and hypertension. Patients with preserved LVEF had significantly lower BNP levels at presentation (535 pg/mL \\[interquartile range, 352-1210 pg/mL\\]) vs 1320 pg/mL (interquartile range, 768-2000 pg/mL; _P_ \\=.01), despite similar elevated LV filling pressures as measured by echocardiography. The mean ± SD ratio of early diastolic mitral valve inflow velocity to early diastolic mitral annulus velocity was 23±8 vs 22±10; _P_ \\=.78. Early diastolic mitral annulus velocity, a surrogate measurement for myocardial relaxation, was reduced in all patients with preserved LVEF and in 95% of patients with reduced LVEF.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Coronary artery disease and hypertension are the most common precipitating factors for first-time FPE. Reduced myocardial relaxation in almost all patients regardless of LVEF supports the notion that diastolic dysfunction is a prerequisite for FPE. Levels of BNP were elevated in every patient regardless of LVEF but were significantly lower in patients with preserved LVEF despite similarly elevated LV filling pressures.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】A ( late diastolic mitral valve inflow velocity ), BNP ( brain-type natriuretic peptide ), CAD ( coronary artery disease ), CHF ( chronic heart failure ), CI ( confidence interval ), cTnT ( cardiac troponin T ), E ( early diastolic mitral valve inflow velocity ), Ea ( early diastolic mitral annulus velocity ), ECG ( electrocardiography ), FPE ( flash pulmonary edema ), HF ( heart failure ), HTN ( hypertension ), LV ( left ventricular ), LVEF ( LV ejection fraction ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), WMIS ( wall motion index score )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:39:55", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:41:33", "cost": 97.618}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:41:32", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:39:54"}

Epzicom\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Abacavir and lamivudine combination is used together with other medicines to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\n【4】Abacavir and lamivudine combination will not cure or prevent HIV infection or the symptoms of AIDS. This medicine helps keep HIV from reproducing, and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of serious health problems usually related to AIDS or HIV infection. Abacavir and lamivudine combination will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV infection.\n\n【5】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【6】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【7】*   Tablet\n\n【8】Before Using\n------------\n\n【9】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【10】### Allergies\n\n【11】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【12】### Pediatric\n\n【13】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of abacavir and lamivudine combination in children.\n\n【14】### Geriatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of abacavir and lamivudine combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving abacavir and lamivudine combination.\n\n【16】### Breastfeeding\n\n【17】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【18】### Drug Interactions\n\n【19】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【20】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【21】*   Cabotegravir\n*   Horsetail\n*   Methotrexate\n*   Orlistat\n*   Ribavirin\n*   Sorbitol\n*   Tacrolimus\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【23】*   Methadone\n*   Tipranavir\n\n【24】### Other Interactions\n\n【25】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【26】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【27】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【28】*   Diabetes or\n*   Heart disease or\n*   Hepatitis B, history of or\n*   Hepatitis C, history of or\n*   Hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol or fats in the blood) or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【29】*   Genetic condition (eg, gene variation called HLA-B\\*5701)\n*   Kidney disease, severe or\n*   Liver disease, moderate or severe—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【30】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【31】Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. Also, do not start or stop using this medicine without checking first with your doctor.\n\n【32】This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【33】This medicine can be taken with or without food.\n\n【34】When your supply of this medicine runs low, get more from your pharmacy or from your doctor. The amount of virus in your blood may increase if the medicine is stopped, even for a short time. The virus may develop resistance to this medicine and be harder to treat.\n\n【35】This medicine is given together with other medicines for HIV infection. Take all of the medicines your doctor gives you at the right time of day. These medicines work best when there is a constant amount in the blood. To help keep the amount constant, do not miss any doses. If you need help in planning the best times to take your medicines, check with your doctor.\n\n【36】Abacavir and lamivudine combination contains a fixed amount of each medicine in the tablet.\n\n【37】### Dosing\n\n【38】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【39】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【40】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   For HIV infection:\n        *   Adults—One tablet once a day. Each tablet contains 600 milligrams (mg) of abacavir and 300 mg of lamivudine.\n        *   Children weighing at least 25 kilograms (kg)—One tablet once a day.\n        *   Children weighing less than 25 kg—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【41】### Missed Dose\n\n【42】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【43】### Storage\n\n【44】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【45】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【46】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【47】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【48】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【49】It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【50】This medicine may cause severe allergic reactions (including multi-organ failure) in some patients. This reaction usually occurs within 6 weeks after the medicine is started, but may occur at any time. If untreated, it can lead to severe low blood pressure and even death. Check with your doctor right away if you have sudden fever, skin rash, diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, or a feeling of unusual tiredness or illness, cough, trouble breathing, sore throat, lightheadedness, dizziness, or yellow skin or eyes.\n\n【51】When you begin using this medicine, you will be given a Warning Card which describes symptoms of severe allergic reactions that may be caused by abacavir and lamivudine combination. The warning card also provides information about how to treat these allergic reactions. For your safety, you should carry the warning card with you at all times.\n\n【52】If you must stop using abacavir because of an allergic reaction, you should never use the medicine again. Return the unused medicine to your doctor or pharmacist. A worse reaction, possibly even death, can occur if you use the medicine again. Tell your doctor right away if you have ever taken abacavir, especially if you have experienced an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n【53】Two rare but serious reactions to this medicine are lactic acidosis (too much acid in the blood) and liver toxicity, which includes an enlarged liver. These are more common if you are female, very overweight (obese), or have been taking anti-HIV medicines for a long time. Call your doctor right away if you have more than one of these symptoms: abdominal or stomach discomfort or cramping, dark urine, decreased appetite, diarrhea, general feeling of discomfort, light-colored stools, muscle cramping or pain, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin.\n\n【54】Your immune system may get stronger when you start using HIV medicines. Tell your doctor right away if you notice any changes in your health. Sometimes the immune system will start to fight infections that were hidden in your body, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis, or may result in a flare-up of a hidden autoimmune disorder such as Graves disease, polymyositis, or Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n\n【55】This medicine may cause you to have excess body fat. Tell your doctor if you notice changes in your body shape, such as an increased amount of fat in the upper back and neck, or around the chest and stomach area, or a loss of fat from the legs, arms, and face.\n\n【56】This medicine may increase your risk of having a heart attack. This is more likely to occur if you already have heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or fats in the blood, or if you smoke.\n\n【57】This medicine will not keep you from giving HIV to your partner during sex. Make sure you understand and practice safe sex such as using latex condoms, even if your partner also has HIV. Do not share needles, toothbrushes, and razor blades with anyone.\n\n【58】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【59】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【60】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【61】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【62】#### More common\n\n【63】1.  Cough\n2.  diarrhea\n3.  fever\n4.  headache\n5.  nausea\n6.  numbness or tingling of the face, feet, or hands\n7.  pain in the joints\n8.  pain in the muscles\n9.  skin rash\n10.  sore throat\n11.  stomach pain\n12.  swelling of the feet or lower legs\n13.  unusual feeling of discomfort or illness\n14.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n15.  vomiting\n\n【64】#### Incidence not known\n\n【65】1.

C. Lathrop was born in Illinois in 1868, the only child of schoolteachers who were originally from Granby, MA. Few details about her childhood are known. Lathrop was homeschooled for the first 16 years of her life, after which she attended an unidentified academy for approximately 2 years, which allowed her to obtain an Illinois teaching certificate. She taught elementary school for several years but was not successful, apparently because of chronic ill health. Lathrop eventually quit teaching and moved to a farm in Granby in 1900. She initially attempted to start a poultry business, which failed. Her focus then shifted to breeding “fancy” mice and rats, which she marketed to rodent hobbyists and keepers of exotic pets, and later began selling in large numbers to scientific researchers. She also raised guinea pigs, rabbits, and ferrets. Some of her guinea pigs were purchased by the US government and used to detect toxic gases in the trenches of World War I battlefields. Two of Lathrop's close friends, Ada Gray and Edith Chapin, assisted in her animal business, and the women also employed many neighborhood children to clean cages and feed oats and crackers to the animals. Lathrop kept careful breeding records, which proved helpful for researchers. At one point, her farm housed more than 11,000 mice.\n\n【1】Several years after Lathrop developed her mouse colonies, she noticed that some of the animals were developing unusual skin lesions. She sent samples to several prominent scientists asking for help. Renowned experimental pathologist Leo Loeb (1869-1959), then at the University of Pennsylvania, became interested in the problem and diagnosed the lesions as malignant. His correspondence with Lathrop developed into an ongoing research collaboration that continued until her death. Loeb suggested several experiments related to cancer that Lathrop then carefully performed at her farm. Their mutual work resulted in 10 coauthored articles in prominent journals, such as the _Journal of Experimental Medicine_ and the _Journal of Cancer Research_ . Among other important observations, Lathrop and Loeb established that susceptibility to mammary tumors varied between different strains of mice and that ovariectomy reduced the incidence of mammary tumors.\n\n【2】William Ernest Castle (1867-1962), a pioneer in mammalian genetics who was among the first to realize the potential power of mouse models for human disease, bought some of Lathrop's mice for his laboratory in 1902, a fertile time for genetic research immediately after the rediscovery of the now-famous pea experiments of the Moravian monk Gregor Mendel. Castle directed the Bussey Institute for Biological Research at Harvard University for more than 30 years, and he trained most of the leaders in the early mammalian genetics field, including Nobel Laureate George D. Snell (1903-1996) and Clarence Cook (“C.C.”) Little (1888-1971). Little, in turn, founded a facility in Bar Harbor, ME, now known as the Jackson Laboratory, which remains one of the world's most important sources of inbred strains of laboratory mice. The most frequently used laboratory mouse strain for the past 80 years, C57BL/6J (“Black 6”), is derived from one of Lathrop's animals—mouse number 57—bred by Little. The complete genomic sequence of the C57BL/6J mouse was reported in 2002.\n\n【3】Lathrop died of pernicious anemia in 1918 and was buried in West Cemetery in Granby, near her 2 close friends Gray and Chapin. Pernicious anemia became treatable with liver extracts in the 1920s through the work of George R. Minot (1885-1950), George R. Whipple (1878-1976), and William P. Murphy (1892-1987), who shared a Nobel prize for their discovery in 1934. Ironically, William Bosworth Castle (1897-1990), the son of William Ernest Castle and a protégé of Minot, showed no interest in his father's field of animal genetics; instead, he established his formidable reputation in the field of hematology in the 1920s when he discovered that patients with pernicious anemia lack a gastric intrinsic factor. Lack of intrinsic factor due to autoantibodies against the gastric parietal cells that secrete intrinsic factor is the proximate cause of the disease that resulted in Lathrop's death.\n\n【4】Although the cartoon characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse have been honored philatelically hundreds of times by many countries, only a few postage stamps have featured real mice or other rodents, probably because of the poor reputation that rodents have had among humans for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians, for example, revered cats because cats kept grain stores free of mice and other “vermin.” The US Postal Service included the deer mouse in a 1987 series of 50 stamps featuring North American wildlife (Scott No. 2324). However, the deer mouse (genus _Peromyscus_ )—the primary reservoir species for hantavirus and a vector for transmission of several other infections including Lyme disease, babesiosis, and bubonic plague—is used for laboratory experiments less frequently than strains of the common house mouse ( _Mus musculus)_ .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:33:16", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:33:22", "cost": 6.622}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:33:22", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:33:15"}

Students were also asked about the prevalence of significant personal life events in the previous 12 months and strategies used to cope with stress.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Although symptoms of depression and overall burnout were similar among minority and nonminority students, minority students were more likely to have a low sense of personal accomplishment ( _P_ \\=.02) and lower QOL in a number of domains (all _P_ ≤.05). These differences persisted on multivariate analysis that controlled for demographic characteristics and recent life events. Minority students were also more likely to have a child ( _P_ \\=.01), originate from outside Minnesota ( _P_ <.001), and experience a major personal illness in the last 12 months ( _P_ \\=.03).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】As a group, the minority medical students in this survey had a lower sense of personal accomplishment and QOL than nonminority students. Additional studies are needed to provide insight regarding the causes of these inequities and the unique challenges faced by minority medical students. Efforts to improve minority students' well-being, QOL, and learning experience may help prevent attrition among minority medical students and promote diversification in the physician workforce.\n\n【8】LASA ( Linear Analogue Self Assessment Well-being Survey ), QOL ( quality of life ), SF-8 ( Medical Outcomes Study 8-Item Short-Form Health Survey ), URM ( underrepresented minority )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:32:21", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:33:04", "cost": 43.422}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:33:02", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:32:18"}

For people who have cataracts, seeing through cloudy lenses is a bit like looking through a frosty or fogged-up window. Clouded vision caused by cataracts can make it more difficult to read, drive a car (especially at night) or see the expression on a friend's face.\n\n【2】Most cataracts develop slowly and don't disturb your eyesight early on. But with time, cataracts will eventually interfere with your vision.\n\n【3】At first, stronger lighting and eyeglasses can help you deal with cataracts. But if impaired vision interferes with your usual activities, you might need cataract surgery. Fortunately, cataract surgery is generally a safe, effective procedure.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of cataracts include:\n\n【6】*   Clouded, blurred or dim vision\n*   Increasing difficulty with vision at night\n*   Sensitivity to light and glare\n*   Need for brighter light for reading and other activities\n*   Seeing \"halos\" around lights\n*   Frequent changes in eyeglass or contact lens prescription\n*   Fading or yellowing of colors\n*   Double vision in a single eye\n\n【7】At first, the cloudiness in your vision caused by a cataract may affect only a small part of the eye's lens and you may be unaware of any vision loss. As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of your lens and distorts the light passing through the lens. This may lead to more-noticeable symptoms.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】Make an appointment for an eye exam if you notice any changes in your vision. If you develop sudden vision changes, such as double vision or flashes of light, sudden eye pain, or sudden headache, see your doctor right away.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Most cataracts develop when aging or injury changes the tissue that makes up the eye's lens. Proteins and fibers in the lens begin to break down, causing vision to become hazy or cloudy.\n\n【12】Some inherited genetic disorders that cause other health problems can increase your risk of cataracts. Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, past eye surgery or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medications, too, can cause cataracts to develop.\n\n【13】### How a cataract forms\n\n【14】A cataract is a cloudy lens. The lens is positioned behind the colored part of your eye (iris). The lens focuses light that passes into your eye, producing clear, sharp images on the retina — the light-sensitive membrane in the eye that functions like the film in a camera.\n\n【15】As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less transparent and thicker. Age-related and other medical conditions cause proteins and fibers within the lenses to break down and clump together, clouding the lenses.\n\n【16】As the cataract continues to develop, the clouding becomes denser. A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens, preventing a sharply defined image from reaching your retina. As a result, your vision becomes blurred.\n\n【17】Cataracts generally develop in both eyes, but not always at the same rate. The cataract in one eye may be more advanced than the other, causing a difference in vision between eyes.\n\n【18】### Types of cataracts\n\n【19】Cataract types include:\n\n【20】*   **Cataracts affecting the center of the lens (nuclear cataracts).** A nuclear cataract may at first cause more nearsightedness or even a temporary improvement in your reading vision. But with time, the lens gradually turns more densely yellow and further clouds your vision.\n\n【21】    As the cataract slowly progresses, the lens may even turn brown. Advanced yellowing or browning of the lens can lead to difficulty distinguishing between shades of color.\n\n【22】*   **Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens (cortical cataracts).** A cortical cataract begins as whitish, wedge-shaped opacities or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex. As it slowly progresses, the streaks extend to the center and interfere with light passing through the center of the lens.\n*   **Cataracts that affect the back of the lens (posterior subcapsular cataracts).** A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small, opaque area that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light. A posterior subcapsular cataract often interferes with your reading vision, reduces your vision in bright light, and causes glare or halos around lights at night. These types of cataracts tend to progress faster than other types do.\n*   **Cataracts you're born with (congenital cataracts).** Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood. These cataracts may be genetic, or associated with an intrauterine infection or trauma.\n\n【23】    These cataracts may also be due to certain conditions, such as myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type 2 or rubella. Congenital cataracts don't always affect vision, but if they do, they're usually removed soon after detection.\n\n【24】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【25】Factors that increase your risk of cataracts include:\n\n【26】*   Increasing age\n*   Diabetes\n*   Excessive exposure to sunlight\n*   Smoking\n*   Obesity\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Previous eye injury or inflammation\n*   Previous eye surgery\n*   Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications\n*   Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol\n\n【27】Prevention\n----------\n\n【28】No studies have proved how to prevent cataracts or slow the progression of cataracts. But doctors think several strategies may be helpful, including:\n\n【29】*   **Have regular eye examinations.** Eye examinations can help detect cataracts and other eye problems at their earliest stages. Ask your doctor how often you should have an eye examination.\n*   **Quit smoking.** Ask your doctor for suggestions about how to stop smoking. Medications, counseling and other strategies are available to help you.\n*   **Manage other health problems.** Follow your treatment plan if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that can increase your risk of cataracts.\n*   **Choose a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables.** Adding a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to your diet ensures that you're getting many vitamins and nutrients. Fruits and vegetables have many antioxidants, which help maintain the health of your eyes.\n\n【30】    Studies haven't proved that antioxidants in pill form can prevent cataracts. But a large population study recently showed that a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals was associated with a reduced risk of developing cataracts. Fruits and vegetables have many proven health benefits and are a safe way to increase the amount of minerals and vitamins in your diet.\n\n【31】*   **Wear sunglasses.** Ultraviolet light from the sun may contribute to the development of cataracts. Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet B (UVB) rays when you're outdoors.\n*   **Reduce alcohol use.** Excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of cataracts.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:07:14", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:07:24", "cost": 9.699}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:07:23", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:07:13"}

Also called osteonecrosis, it can lead to tiny breaks in the bone and cause the bone to collapse. The process usually takes months to years.\n\n【2】A broken bone or dislocated joint can stop the blood flow to a section of bone. Avascular necrosis is also associated with long-term use of high-dose steroid medications and too much alcohol.\n\n【3】Anyone can be affected. But the condition is most common in people between the ages of 30 and 50.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Some people have no symptoms in the early stages of avascular necrosis. As the condition worsens, affected joints might hurt only when putting weight on them. Eventually, you might feel the pain even when you're lying down.\n\n【6】Pain can be mild or severe. It usually develops gradually. Pain associated with avascular necrosis of the hip might center on the groin, thigh or buttock. Besides the hip, the shoulder, knee, hand and foot can be affected.\n\n【7】Some people develop avascular necrosis on both sides, such as in both hips or in both knees.\n\n【8】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【9】See your health care provider for ongoing pain in any joint. Seek immediate medical attention for a possible broken bone or dislocated joint.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Avascular necrosis occurs when blood flow to a bone is interrupted or reduced. Reduced blood supply can be caused by:\n\n【12】*   **Joint or bone trauma.** An injury, such as a dislocated joint, might damage nearby blood vessels. Cancer treatments involving radiation also can weaken bone and harm blood vessels.\n*   **Fatty deposits in blood vessels.** The fat (lipids) can block small blood vessels. This can reduce blood flow to bones.\n*   **Certain diseases.** Medical conditions, such as sickle cell anemia and Gaucher's disease, also can lessen blood flow to bone.\n\n【13】Sometimes the cause of avascular necrosis not brought on by trauma isn't fully understood. Genetics combined with overuse of alcohol, certain medications and other diseases likely play a role.\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】Risk factors for developing avascular necrosis include:\n\n【16】*   **Trauma.** Injuries, such as hip dislocation or fracture, can damage nearby blood vessels and reduce blood flow to bones.\n*   **Steroid use.** Use of high-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone, is a common cause of avascular necrosis. The reason is unknown, but some experts believe that corticosteroids can increase lipid levels in the blood, reducing blood flow.\n*   **Drinking too much alcohol.** Having several alcoholic drinks a day for several years also can cause fatty deposits to form in blood vessels.\n*   **Bisphosphonate use.** Long-term use of medications to increase bone density might contribute to developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. This rare complication has occurred in some people treated with high doses of these medications for cancers, such as multiple myeloma and metastatic breast cancer.\n*   **Certain medical treatments.** Radiation therapy for cancer can weaken bone. Organ transplants, especially kidney transplants, also are associated with avascular necrosis.\n\n【17】Medical conditions associated with avascular necrosis include:\n\n【18】*   Pancreatitis\n*   Gaucher's disease\n*   HIV/AIDS\n*   Systemic lupus erythematosus\n*   Sickle cell anemia\n*   Decompression sickness, also known as divers' disease or the bends\n*   Certain types of cancer, such as leukemia\n\n【19】Complications\n-------------\n\n【20】Untreated, avascular necrosis worsens.

Primary brain tumors begin when normal cells have errors (mutations) in their DNA. These mutations allow cells to grow and divide at increased rates and to continue living when healthy cells would die. The result is a mass of abnormal cells, which forms a tumor.\n\n【16】Many different types of brain tumors — which may or may not be cancerous — can occur in children.\n\n【17】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【18】In most children with primary brain tumors, the cause of the tumor isn't clear.

The likelihood of having both LA- and aCL-positive test results was higher among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (26 \\[19.0%\\] of 137 patients with positive results for one or both tests), but they had no more thrombotic events or fetal loss than other patients in our study group.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】The DRVVT identified more patients with LA than the other LA tests, but more than 1 LA test was required to identify all patients with LA. Positive results were much more common for aCL than for LA. No single LA test or anticardiolipin isotype correlated with thrombosis or systemic disease in this population.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】aCL ( anticardiolipin antibodies ), AI ( autoimmune disease ), APTT ( activated partial thromboplastin time ), CA ( cancer ), DRVVT ( dilute Russell viper venom time ), DVT ( deep venous thrombosis ), KCT ( kaolin clot time ), LA ( lupus anticoagulants ), PAE ( peripheral arterial event ), PCT ( plasma clot time ), PE ( pulmonary embolus ), PNP ( platelet neutralization procedure ), SLE ( systemic lupus erythematosus ), TIA ( transient ischemic attack )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:41:47", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:41:58", "cost": 11.088}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:41:56", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:41:34"}

Similarly, the face of medicine has changed over the past several decades and these demographic changes have been accompanied by changes in expectations. Although contemporary physicians readily acknowledge the importance of having both a career and a family, this is not necessarily consistent with older medical traditions in which physicians were expected to sacrifice family life for medicine.\n\n【2】As physicians, mentors, and investigators in academic medicine, we see medical students, resident physicians, and colleagues struggle to achieve fulfillment both at home and at work. Students and younger physicians are interested in how more senior physicians navigate the challenges of marriage, family, and career. Work-life balance and child care may have once been trivialized as “women’s issues.” However, currently men and women alike want to ensure that they devote time and energy to parenting—often at the same time that they are developing careers.\n\n【3】Staying human in the medical family: the unique role of doctor-parents.\n\n【4】Many physicians are, at least at some point during the continuum of their medical career, interested in gaining a better insight into their relationships and developing strategies for maintaining a balance between home and medicine.\n\n【5】At the University of Michigan, medical students are able to choose an elective examining “medical marriages.” This elective provides students with first-hand accounts of how their attending physicians—their teachers and mentors in medicine—manage their own work-life balance and addresses concerns about balancing family and career that extend beyond graduation. Although this is not typically addressed in the formal medical school curriculum, trainees and physicians are often interested in how they will navigate relationships, marriages, and families while pursuing a career. We see evidence of this concern in medical students when they organize panel lunchtime discussions as well as in our colleagues when they attend grand rounds on this topic. The _AAMC Reporter_\n\n【6】Mutual support, shared values key to success in medical marriages.\n\n【7】recently dedicated an article to highlighting perspectives of physicians managing careers and families.\n\n【8】Although medical marriages experience many of the same challenges of all relationships, there may be both unique stressors and protective factors. In a landmark study of 1248 graduates (1944-1960) from Johns Hopkins University Medical School, the mean age of first marriage was 26 years, the mean age at divorce was 42 years, and the incidence rate of divorce was 29% by 30 years after marriage.\n\n【9】Medical speciality and the incidence of divorce.\n\n【10】Although dated, this study also identified several key risk factors for divorce in these physicians, including marrying before graduation from medical school, difficulty with anger management, and less perceived closeness to one’s own parents. Contemporary physicians are more likely to marry and less likely to divorce than nonphysicians .\n\n【11】There may be a modern trend to perceive formal marriage as a luxury or a status item, with better educated and wealthier individuals more likely to marry.\n\n【12】The Reversal of the College Marriage Gap.\n\n【13】Pew Research Center , Washington, DC 2010\n\n【14】Marriage as a construct may also be an archaic simplification of contemporary relationships, underrepresenting long-term cohabitation and same-sex relationships. Although in our research\n\n【15】Understanding the medical marriage: physicians and their partners share strategies for success.\n\n【16】we define medical marriage as a long-term relationship in which at least one partner is a physician, it is unclear how the demographic characteristics of physicians’ intimate relationships are captured. In our review of the literature, we noted that legal marriage among physicians is most likely to occur around graduation from medical school. Physicians’ older age at the time of first marriage, advanced education, and higher-than-average income all help provide the resources and resilience to navigate some of the complications of balancing home and career.\n\n【17】Figure Comparison of marital status: US population and physicians.\n\n【18】Medical marriages have certain benefits, and individuals in dual-physician couples have reported increased levels of marital satisfaction and intimacy because their partner understands the unique stressors in their career. This understanding can lead to more equal splitting of household duties and childcare. In addition, physicians have much less financial hardship than does the general US population. However, medical marriages can also suffer as a result of insufficient time with partner owing to fatigue and demanding workloads. Many physicians consider being “overworked” as normative; fear of compromising one’s career can lead to putting medicine before marriage and family.\n\n【19】Exploring the dual-physician marriage.\n\n【20】In single-physician couples, number of minutes spent awake with the physician partner per day and number of nights the physician partner is on call per week also influenced the domestic partner relationship satisfaction.\n\n【21】The medical marriage: a national survey of the spouses/partners of US physicians.\n\n【22】Career demands can vary with medical specialty, and specialty choice may be a risk factor for divorce. In particular, surgeons and psychiatrists were found to have a higher risk of divorce than did other physicians.\n\n【23】Medical speciality and the incidence of divorce.\n\n【24】A 2010 study of surgeons found higher rates of career conflict in surgeons married or partnered to physicians than in surgeons married or partnered to working nonphysicians. Interestingly, this conflict was higher in dual-surgeon partnerships than in surgeons partnered with nonsurgeon physicians.\n\n【25】Physicians married or partnered to physicians: a comparative study in the American College of Surgeons.\n\n【26】Another study of 167 surgeons (current residents and program alumni) over a 30-year time span suggested a trend of increased rate of childbearing during residency.\n\n【27】The surgical residency baby boom: changing patterns of childbearing during residency over a 30-year span.\n\n【28】Because each couple has a different dynamic, it is difficult to understand what this risk means to an individual couple.\n\n【29】Our own research, based on semistructured interviews with 25 individuals in medical marriages, identifies several relationship “best practices,” including making the relationship a priority by working together to create daily routines, focusing on enhancing friendship and intimacy, and recognizing and addressing threats to the relationship.\n\n【30】The Reversal of the College Marriage Gap.\n\n【31】Pew Research Center , Washington, DC 2010\n\n【32】In addition to being willing to share their experiences, we found that physicians and their domestic partners are interested in having the opportunity to reflect on how they personally balance medicine with having a family.\n\n【33】Medical training has changed since the turn of the 21st century. Restrictions on resident duty hours has shifted the amount of time that training physicians can spend in the hospital. These restrictions were based on concerns about patient safety rather than on a desire to promote physician wellness; thus, it is unclear whether restricted work hours help physicians achieve increased work-life balance. Contemporary literature does not provide young physicians with enough information about how other physicians manage having a career and family, and more research is certainly needed. Acknowledging the importance of work-life balance and personal fulfillment can be an important part of physician wellness. Despite the protective factors noted above, physicians must consciously commit to making their intimate relationships a priority. Losing ourselves in work is a disservice to both our families and our patients, because it is unsustainable for physicians who also desire to actively engage with a spouse or raise a family.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:58:54", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:59:07", "cost": 12.708}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:42", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:59:06", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:58:53"}

Sublimaze\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Fentanyl injection is used to relieve severe pain during and after surgery. It is also used with other medicines just before or during an operation to help the anesthetic (numbing medicine) work better.\n\n【4】Fentanyl belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts in the central nervous system (CNS) or brain to relieve pain. Some of its side effects are also caused by actions in the CNS such as drowsiness or dizziness.\n\n【5】This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.\n\n【6】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【7】*   Solution\n\n【8】Before Using\n------------\n\n【9】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【10】### Allergies\n\n【11】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【12】### Pediatric\n\n【13】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of fentanyl injection in children younger than 2 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【14】### Geriatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fentanyl injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related lung, kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fentanyl injection.\n\n【16】### Breastfeeding\n\n【17】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【18】### Drug Interactions\n\n【19】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【20】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【26】Using this medicine with any of the following is usually not recommended, but may be unavoidable in some cases. If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use this medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【27】*   Ethanol\n*   Grapefruit Juice\n\n【28】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【29】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【30】*   Adrenal problems or\n*   Brain tumor, history of or\n*   Breathing or lung problems (eg, COPD, respiratory depression, sleep apnea) or\n*   Cor pulmonale (serious heart condition) or\n*   Drug dependence, especially with narcotics, or history of or\n*   Head injury, history of or\n*   Heart disease or\n*   Hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood) or\n*   Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels in the blood)—Use with caution. May increase risk for more serious side effects.\n\n【31】*   Bradycardia (slow heart rhythm) or\n*   Gallbladder problems or\n*   Heart rhythm problems (eg, QT prolongation) or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) or\n*   Hypotension (low blood pressure) or\n*   Pancreatitis (inflammation or swelling of the pancreas) or\n*   Seizures, history of—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【32】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【33】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【34】A doctor or other trained health professional will give you or your child this medicine in a hospital. This medicine is given as a shot into a muscle or vein.\n\n【35】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【36】It is very important that your doctor check you closely while you or your child are receiving this medicine. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it.\n\n【37】This medicine may cause a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you or your child have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.\n\n【38】Do not use too much of this medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to. This can be life-threatening. Symptoms of an overdose include: extreme dizziness or weakness, slow heartbeat or breathing, seizures, trouble breathing, and cold, clammy skin. Call your doctor right away if you notice these symptoms.\n\n【39】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur with this medicine, especially when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve the dizziness or lightheadedness.\n\n【40】This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. CNS depressants are medicines that slow down the nervous system, which may cause drowsiness or make you less alert. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping pills, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, barbiturates or seizure medicines, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics. This effect may last for a few days after you stop using this medicine. Check with your medical doctor or dentist before taking any of the above while you or your child are receiving this medicine.\n\n【41】This medicine may cause sleep-related breathing problems (eg, sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoxemia). Your doctor may decrease your dose if you have sleep apnea (stop breathing for short periods during sleep) while using this medicine.\n\n【42】This medicine may make you dizzy, drowsy, confused, or disoriented. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or not alert.\n\n【43】This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.\n\n【44】Using narcotics for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.\n\n【45】If you have been using this medicine regularly for several weeks or longer, do not change your dose or suddenly stop using it without checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, such as abdominal or stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, nausea, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble sleeping.\n\n【46】This medicine may increase risk for muscle rigidity and movement. Tell your doctor if you or your child have stiff or rigid muscles after using this medicine.\n\n【47】Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.\n\n【48】Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn babies. Tell your doctor right away if your baby has an abnormal sleep pattern, diarrhea, a high-pitched cry, irritability, shakiness or tremors, weight loss, vomiting, or fails to gain weight.\n\n【49】Using too much of this medicine may cause reduced infertility (unable to have children).

Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. If you think you have become pregnant while using this medicine, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【52】Do not use this medicine if you are also taking mercaptopurine (Purinethol®). Using these medicines together could cause serious unwanted effects.\n\n【53】If you are using azathioprine for arthritis, make sure your doctor knows if you had received chlorambucil (Leukeran®), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®, Neosar®), or melphalan (Alkeran®) to treat your arthritis in the past. Using azathioprine after these medicines may increase your risk for unwanted effects. Talk to your doctor if you have questions about this.\n\n【54】This medicine may increase your risk of getting certain types of cancer, especially of the skin, lymph system (lymphoma), or blood (leukemia). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.\n\n【55】Use sunscreen or sunblock lotions with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 on a regular basis when you are outdoors. Wear protective clothing and hats, and stay out of direct sunlight between the hours of 10 am and 3 pm Avoid sunlamps and tanning beds.\n\n【56】While you are being treated with azathioprine, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Azathioprine may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.\n\n【57】Azathioprine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【58】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor as soon as possible if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【59】This medicine may increase your risk of developing infections, including a serious brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections while you are using this medicine. Wash your hands often. Tell your doctor if you have any kind of infection before you start using this medicine. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had an infection that would not go away or an infection that kept coming back.\n\n【60】Check with your doctor right away if you have more than one of these symptoms while you are using this medicine: severe nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, fever, rash, a general feeling of discomfort or illness, muscle or joint pain, lightheadedness or dizziness, or unusual tiredness or weakness. These could be symptoms of a serious reaction to the medicine in your bowel.\n\n【61】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【62】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【63】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【64】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【65】#### More common\n\n【66】1.

A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. The changes turn the fat cells into cancer cells. The changes tell the cancer cells to grow quickly and make a lot of extra cells. The cancer cells keep living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural life cycle.\n\n【16】The cancer cells form a growth, called a tumor. In some types of liposarcoma, the cancer cells stay put. They continue making more cells, causing the tumor to get bigger. In other types of liposarcoma, the cancer cells might break away and spread to other parts of the body.

Patients were identified on the basis of clinical history and presence of cancer. Data were reviewed from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, electroencephalography (EEG), and paraneoplastic serologic studies.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Common manifestations were cognitive dysfunction (92%), seizures (58%), and psychiatric symptoms (50%); 13 patients had small cell lung carcinoma; 11 had other malignancies. Paraneoplastic neuronal autoantibodies were found in 14 (64%) of 22 patients tested. Electroencephalography showed focal or generalized slowing and/ or epileptiform activity, maximal in the temporal regions, in all 22 patients tested. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed increased T2 signal involving one or both temporal lobes in 15 (83%) of 18 patients. Cerebrospinal fluid test results were abnormal in 18 (78%) of 23 patients tested. Clinical or radiographic evidence of extralimbic involvement was documented in 12 (55%) of 22 patients. No abnormality on EEG, MRI, or CSF analysis correlated with a specific cancer type or with a specific paraneoplastic autoantibody.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】In patients with suspected PLE, EEG is invaluable for confirming cerebral dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging can show unequivocal involvement of temporolimbic structures and helps exclude other diagnoses. When EEG and cranial MRI are both normal, PLE is unlikely. Comprehensive testing for paraneoplastic neuronal nuclear, cytoplasmic, and ion channel autoantibodies is an important part of the evaluation, but negative results do not rule out PLE.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】ANNA ( antineuronal nuclear antibody ), CRMP ( collapsin response-mediator protein ), CSF ( cerebrospinal fluid ), EEG ( electroencephalogram ), FLAIR ( fluid-attenuated inversion recovery ), MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ), PCA ( Purkinje cell antibody ), PLE ( paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis ), PLEDs ( periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges ), SCLC ( small cell lung carcinoma )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:28:39", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:28:59", "cost": 20.218}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:28:57", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 02:06:58"}

If you're otherwise in good health, you may recover normal or nearly normal kidney function.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of acute kidney failure may include:\n\n【6】*   Decreased urine output, although occasionally urine output remains normal\n*   Fluid retention, causing swelling in your legs, ankles or feet\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Fatigue\n*   Confusion\n*   Nausea\n*   Weakness\n*   Irregular heartbeat\n*   Chest pain or pressure\n*   Seizures or coma in severe cases\n\n【7】Sometimes acute kidney failure causes no signs or symptoms and is detected through lab tests done for another reason.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】See your doctor immediately or seek emergency care if you have signs or symptoms of acute kidney failure.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Acute kidney failure can occur when:\n\n【12】*   You have a condition that slows blood flow to your kidneys\n*   You experience direct damage to your kidneys\n*   Your kidneys' urine drainage tubes (ureters) become blocked and wastes can't leave your body through your urine\n\n【13】### Impaired blood flow to the kidneys\n\n【14】Diseases and conditions that may slow blood flow to the kidneys and lead to kidney injury include:\n\n【15】*   Blood or fluid loss\n*   Blood pressure medications\n*   Heart attack\n*   Heart disease\n*   Infection\n*   Liver failure\n*   Use of aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) or related drugs\n*   Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)\n*   Severe burns\n*   Severe dehydration\n\n【16】### Damage to the kidneys\n\n【17】These diseases, conditions and agents may damage the kidneys and lead to acute kidney failure:\n\n【18】*   Blood clots in the veins and arteries in and around the kidneys\n*   Cholesterol deposits that block blood flow in the kidneys\n*   Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-loe-nuh-FRY-tis), inflammation of the tiny filters in the kidneys (glomeruli)\n*   Hemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition that results from premature destruction of red blood cells\n*   Infection, such as with the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n*   Lupus, an immune system disorder causing glomerulonephritis\n*   Medications, such as certain chemotherapy drugs, antibiotics and dyes used during imaging tests\n*   Scleroderma, a group of rare diseases affecting the skin and connective tissues\n*   Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a rare blood disorder\n*   Toxins, such as alcohol, heavy metals and cocaine\n*   Muscle tissue breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) that leads to kidney damage caused by toxins from muscle tissue destruction\n*   Breakdown of tumor cells (tumor lysis syndrome), which leads to the release of toxins that can cause kidney injury\n\n【19】### Urine blockage in the kidneys\n\n【20】Diseases and conditions that block the passage of urine out of the body (urinary obstructions) and can lead to acute kidney injury include:\n\n【21】*   Bladder cancer\n*   Blood clots in the urinary tract\n*   Cervical cancer\n*   Colon cancer\n*   Enlarged prostate\n*   Kidney stones\n*   Nerve damage involving the nerves that control the bladder\n*   Prostate cancer\n\n【22】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【23】Acute kidney failure almost always occurs in connection with another medical condition or event. Conditions that can increase your risk of acute kidney failure include:\n\n【24】*   Being hospitalized, especially for a serious condition that requires intensive care\n*   Advanced age\n*   Blockages in the blood vessels in your arms or legs (peripheral artery disease)\n*   Diabetes\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Heart failure\n*   Kidney diseases\n*   Liver diseases\n*   Certain cancers and their treatments\n\n【25】Complications\n-------------\n\n【26】Potential complications of acute kidney failure include:\n\n【27】*   **Fluid buildup.** Acute kidney failure may lead to a buildup of fluid in your lungs, which can cause shortness of breath.\n*   **Chest pain.** If the lining that covers your heart (pericardium) becomes inflamed, you may experience chest pain.\n*   **Muscle weakness.** When your body's fluids and electrolytes — your body's blood chemistry — are out of balance, muscle weakness can result.\n*   **Permanent kidney damage.** Occasionally, acute kidney failure causes permanent loss of kidney function, or end-stage renal disease. People with end-stage renal disease require either permanent dialysis — a mechanical filtration process used to remove toxins and wastes from the body — or a kidney transplant to survive.\n*   **Death.** Acute kidney failure can lead to loss of kidney function and, ultimately, death.\n\n【28】Prevention\n----------\n\n【29】Acute kidney failure is often difficult to predict or prevent. But you may reduce your risk by taking care of your kidneys. Try to:\n\n【30】*   **Pay attention to labels when taking over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications.** Follow the instructions for OTC pain medications, such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, others). Taking too much of these medications may increase your risk of kidney injury. This is especially true if you have pre-existing kidney disease, diabetes or high blood pressure.\n*   **Work with your doctor to manage kidney and other chronic conditions.** If you have kidney disease or another condition that increases your risk of acute kidney failure, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, stay on track with treatment goals and follow your doctor's recommendations to manage your condition.\n*   **Make a healthy lifestyle a priority.** Be active; eat a sensible, balanced diet; and drink alcohol only in moderation — if at all.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:42:25", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:43:01", "cost": 36.139}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:43:00", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:42:24"}

An arthropod-borne virus named after the Zika forest in Uganda, it was first discovered in 1947. The virus caused only sporadic cases of Zika infection in Africa and Southeast Asia until 2007, when the first large outbreak occurred in the Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia. Another outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013 was notable for being associated temporally with an increase in cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. In 2015, the virus was first reported in Brazil and since then has spread explosively through several additional countries in South and Central America and the Caribbean. Simultaneously, several of these countries have seen a dramatic increase in the incidence of infants born with microcephaly. The rapid spread of Zika virus through the Americas, together with the association of infection with microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, has resulted in the World Health Organization declaring a public health emergency. Zika virus has the potential to spread to new areas where the _Aedes_ mosquito vector is present and therefore presents a risk to the United States. This concise review describes the clinical features of Zika virus infection and provides advice for clinicians on counseling travelers and others about the disease.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ), GBS ( Guillain-Barré syndrome ), WHO ( World Health Organization )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .™\n\n【9】Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【10】**MOC Credit Statement** : Successful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1 MOC points in the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program.

In addition, sporadic cases were reported in Southeast Asia including Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Cambodia, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. In April 2007, an epidemic of rash, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia was reported from Yap State, Federated States of Micronesia.\n\n【18】Zika virus outbreak on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia.\n\n【19】This epidemic represented the first documented outbreak of Zika virus infection; it was estimated that 70% of the island's population was infected with Zika virus over a 13-week period. In 2013, another large outbreak was reported in French Polynesia. This outbreak was notable because although most clinical cases presented with mild disease, an association with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) was first noted.\n\n【20】Zika virus, French Polynesia, South Pacific, 2013.\n\n【21】Zika virus infection complicated by Guillain-Barré syndrome—case report, French Polynesia, December 2013.\n\n【22】The incidence of GBS cases during the outbreak was 20-fold higher than expected. There were subsequent small outbreaks in Oceania but relatively few cases until May 2015, when another outbreak was identified in Brazil.\n\n【23】Zika virus outbreak, Bahia, Brazil.\n\n【24】Since then, the virus has been detected at an increasing rate in several countries in South and Central America and the Caribbean .\n\n【25】In September 2015, reports of an increase in the number of infants born with microcephaly in Zika virus–affected areas began to emerge.\n\n【26】Brazilian Medical Genetics Society–Zika Embryopathy Task Force  \nPossible association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly – Brazil, 2015.\n\n【27】On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the Zika virus outbreak constituted an international public health emergency because of the possible link to microcephaly and other neurologic syndromes. The WHO declaration represents its highest level of alert and has only been invoked 3 other times so far—in 2009 during the H1N1 influenza epidemic, in May 2014 when poliomyelitis reemerged in Pakistan and Syria, and in August 2014 with Ebola virus.\n\n【28】Figure 1 Areas with active Zika virus transmission in the Americas and Africa as of February 23, 2016.\n\n【29】From the World Health Organization.\n\n【30】Transmission\n------------\n\n【31】Zika virus is primarily transmitted to humans through bites from _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Both _Aedes aegypti_ (confined to tropical and subtropical regions) and _Aedes albopictus_ (found in temperate regions in addition to tropical and subtropical areas) are capable of transmitting Zika virus and have been implicated in outbreaks of Zika virus. Both _Aedes_ species are present in the United States. _Aedes albopictus_ is of particular concern because it has a much wider range than _A aegypti_ . It was originally imported from Southeast Asia and has been remarkably adaptable to cooler climates. _Aedes albopictus_ is now firmly established in several states in the United States.\n\n【32】Climate change and range expansion of the Asian tiger mosquito ( _Aedes albopictus_ ) in Northeastern USA: implications for public health practitioners.\n\n【33】It is an aggressive daytime biter and thrives in densely populated urban environments. As the number of returning travelers with Zika virus disease increases, the presence of the _Aedes_ vector in the United States makes local spread a serious possibility .\n\n【34】Figure 2 Distribution of _Aedes_ mosquitoes in the United States. \\* = Maps were developed using information available at the time of publication. Mosquito populations may be detected in areas not shaded on this map, and may not be consistently found in all shaded areas.\n\n【35】From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n【36】Other modes of transmission are possible, but it is unclear how much of a role they play in propagating outbreaks. Sexual transmission of Zika virus was first reported in 2011.\n\n【37】Probable non-vector-borne transmission of Zika virus, Colorado, USA.\n\n【38】An American researcher acquired Zika virus in Senegal, became ill after returning home to Colorado, and transmitted the infection to his wife who had not traveled outside the United States. There have been 2 lab-confirmed cases of sexual transmission of Zika virus in the US during the current Zika outbreak; several additional cases are under investigation.\n\n【39】The virus was first isolated from sperm during the Polynesian outbreak.\n\n【40】Potential sexual transmission of Zika virus.\n\n【41】It is not known how long the virus persists in sperm or whether asymptomatic persons infected with Zika virus can transmit infection to sexual partners. The disease is associated with viremia, so not surprisingly, transfusion-related transmission has been reported.\n\n【42】The virus is detectable in breast milk,\n\n【43】Evidence of perinatal transmission of Zika virus, French Polynesia, December 2013 and February 2014.\n\n【44】but breastfeeding-associated transmission has not been reported so far.\n\n【45】Pathogenesis\n------------\n\n【46】Zika virus is an RNA virus that is closely related to other flaviviruses including yellow fever, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile virus. Little is known about its pathogenesis; however, it is thought that viral replication occurs in local dendritic cells after inoculation from a mosquito with subsequent spread to lymph nodes and the bloodstream. Viremia is generally seen within 3 to 4 days of symptom onset.\n\n【47】Zika virus outside Africa.\n\n【48】Virus is detectable in blood as early as the day of illness onset and as late as 11 days after onset.\n\n【49】Genetic and serologic properties of Zika virus associated with an epidemic, Yap State, Micronesia, 2007.\n\n【50】The virus has also been detected in urine, sperm, and saliva of infected individuals.\n\n【51】Potential sexual transmission of Zika virus.\n\n【52】Detection of Zika virus in saliva.\n\n【53】Detection of Zika virus in urine.\n\n【54】Clinical Manifestations\n-----------------------\n\n【55】Evidence from case reports and experience from related flavivirus infections indicate that the incubation period of Zika virus is likely 3 days to 2 weeks.\n\n【56】Incubation periods of mosquito-borne viral infections: a systematic review.\n\n【57】Approximately 80% of individuals infected with Zika virus have no symptoms. When they occur, the symptoms of Zika infection are typically mild. Most commonly seen are fever, itchy maculopapular rash , nonpurulent conjunctivitis, and arthralgia involving the small joints of the hands and feet. Myalgias and headache, including retro-orbital pain, can also be present. Symptoms generally resolve in a few days. Unlike yellow fever and dengue infections, death, hemorrhagic complications, or severe illness requiring hospitalization are very rare. Zika virus infection does not have features that clearly distinguish it from mild cases of other arboviral diseases, although rash is more common with Zika virus.\n\n【58】Zika virus outbreak, Bahia, Brazil.\n\n【59】Guillain-Barré syndrome was first reported in association with Zika virus in the French Polynesian outbreak in 2013.\n\n【60】Zika virus infection complicated by Guillain-Barré syndrome—case report, French Polynesia, December 2013.\n\n【61】In July 2015, Brazil reported neurologic syndromes in patients with a recent history of Zika virus infection.\n\n【62】Of 42 patients with confirmed GBS, 26 (62%) had a history of symptoms consistent with Zika virus infection. In 2015, a total of 1708 cases of GBS were registered nationwide, representing a 19% average increase from the previous year. Colombia, El Salvador, Suriname, and Venezuela have also reported an observed increase of GBS.\n\n【63】Figure 3 Maculopapular rash in a patient infected with Zika virus.\n\n【64】From _Emerg Infect Dis_ ,\n\n【65】Probable non-vector-borne transmission of Zika virus, Colorado, USA.\n\n【66】with permission.\n\n【67】Most notably, Zika virus has been in the press because of an association with microcephaly in newborns (head circumference ≥2 SD below the mean for sex and gestational age at birth). Between 2010 and 2014, approximately 150 to 200 children per year were born with microcephaly. In October 2015, the Brazil Ministry of Health reported a 20-fold increase in cases of microcephaly—mostly in northeast Brazil, which also had a high prevalence of suspected cases of Zika virus infection. Although causation has not been established, several investigations have suggested a link between maternal infection and microcephaly in infants. Zika virus RNA has been identified by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction in the amniotic fluid of women whose fetuses had microcephaly and in tissues of infants with microcephaly.\n\n【68】Notes from the field: evidence of Zika virus infection in brain and placental tissues from two congenitally infected newborns and two fetal losses – Brazil, 2015.\n\n【69】It has also been found in tissue from fetal losses from 4 women who were infected during pregnancy.\n\n【70】Brazilian Medical Genetics Society–Zika Embryopathy Task Force  \nPossible association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly – Brazil, 2015.\n\n【71】In another study, all mothers of a Brazilian cohort of 35 infants born with microcephaly had lived in or visited an area affected with Zika virus during their pregnancy. Abnormalities in the infants consisted of widespread brain calcifications and ventricular enlargement secondary to cerebral atrophy. All tested negative for other infections including syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus infections. A recent report provided information on a European woman who had a clinical syndrome compatible with Zika virus infection at 13 weeks of gestation while living in Brazil.\n\n【72】Ultrasonography at 14 and 20 weeks of gestation detected no abnormalities but revealed microcephaly at 29 weeks of gestation. The mother underwent termination of the pregnancy. At fetal autopsy, microcephaly with multifocal calcifications in the cortex and subcortical white matter, severe hydrocephalus, and hypoplasia of the brain stem and spinal cord were noted. The entire Zika virus genome was recovered from fetal brain tissue. No other genetic abnormalities or other pathogens were found. These reports strongly support a link between maternal Zika infection and microcephaly. A case-control study is under way in Brazil to examine this association further and to determine whether other infections or environmental factors may be playing a role in the increased incidence of microcephaly.\n\n【73】A group of researchers have shown that, in vitro, the Zika virus is capable of infecting human neural progenitor cells. Infection resulted in disruption of cell cycle, increased cell death and attenuated neuron growth. Although this work is preliminary, the creation of this experimental model may pave the way for additional studies to determine the pathogenesis of microcephaly and other neurologic and ocular defects associated with Zika.\n\n【74】Further studies are also needed to determine the prognosis for infants with congenital Zika virus infection. For infants with microcephaly from other causes, a spectrum of neurologic deficits ranging from mild to severe are seen and are usually lifelong.\n\n【75】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【76】Zika virus infection is generally diagnosed clinically with subsequent confirmatory testing. Testing for Zika virus should be performed in patients who experience symptoms while traveling in an area where Zika virus transmission has been reported or within 2 weeks of return. Because dengue and chikungunya virus infections have similar symptoms and geographic distribution, patients with suspected Zika virus infection should also be evaluated for these infections. Zika virus testing is currently performed only at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Arbovirus Diagnostic Laboratory and at some state public health departments. It is not commercially available. Clinicians should contact their state or local health department to facilitate testing.\n\n【77】Available tests include (1) reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction on serum if within a week of symptom onset and (2) testing for Zika virus–specific IgM antibodies in serum for infection after 1 week of symptom onset. Cross-reaction with other flaviviruses (eg, dengue virus and yellow fever) is common, and test results should be interpreted with the assistance of an infectious disease specialist and the performing laboratory. The CDC has specific instructions for sending diagnostic specimens and completing the specimen submission form.\n\n【78】Zika Virus and Pregnancy\n------------------------\n\n【79】Women who are pregnant should avoid travel to areas where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. Updated information regarding areas with active transmission can be found on the CDC website.\n\n【80】If a pregnant woman cannot postpone travel, she should be advised to follow mosquito avoidance precautions. All pregnant women should be asked about travel history. Women who experience symptoms while traveling in an area where Zika transmission has been reported or within 2 weeks of return should be tested for Zika virus infection as soon as possible. Asymptomatic women who report travel to such areas while pregnant should be offered serologic testing for Zika virus between 2 and 12 weeks after return and should also undergo fetal ultrasonography . Guidance in this area is evolving rapidly as more data become available, and readers should refer to the CDC website for the latest recommendations. The CDC recently recommended that pregnant women should avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has a history of travel to a Zika infection risk area for the duration of the pregnancy.\n\n【81】Interim guidelines for prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus – United States, 2016.\n\n【82】Figure 4 Testing algorithm for pregnant woman with history of travel to an area with ongoing. Zika virus transmission.\n\n【83】From _MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep_ .\n\n【84】Update: interim guidelines for health care providers caring for pregnant women and women of reproductive age with possible Zika virus exposure–United States, 2016.\n\n【85】Infants should be tested for Zika virus if they are born to women who traveled to an area with ongoing Zika virus transmission and have microcephaly or intracranial calcifications or if the mother has positive or inconclusive Zika virus test results.\n\n【86】Women of childbearing age who are planning travel to Zika-endemic areas should be counseled on ways to prevent unintended pregnancy. Although a causal link between Zika virus and microcephaly has not been established, public health agencies in several countries where Zika virus outbreaks are occurring have taken the unprecedented step of recommending that women living in these countries delay pregnancy for the next several months to years.\n\n【87】Treatment\n---------\n\n【88】There is no specific antiviral treatment available for Zika virus. Treatment is focused on symptomatic relief including rest and hydration. Fever may be treated with acetaminophen. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used after dengue virus has been ruled out to reduce the risk for hemorrhage but should be avoided in pregnant women. Antihistamines may be helpful to control itching in patients with a rash. Patients with suspected Zika virus infection should be protected from further mosquito exposure during the first few days of illness to prevent other mosquitoes from becoming infected and thus reduce the risk of local transmission.\n\n【89】Prevention\n----------\n\n【90】There is no vaccine available to prevent Zika virus infection. The mainstay of prevention is minimizing exposure by controlling mosquito populations and avoiding bites. Mosquito control efforts have been hampered recently by a report from Argentina\n\n【91】blaming pyriproxyfen (a pesticide used to kill mosquito larvae in standing water) rather than Zika for the increase in fetal loss and microcephaly in Brazil. Investigators from the WHO, US Environmental Protection Agency, and European Union have found no evidence that the larvicide affects the course of pregnancy or the development of a fetus. The product has been used in Brazil since the late 1990s without being linked to microcephaly.\n\n【92】For personal protection against mosquito bites, residents of or travelers to Zika transmission areas should be counseled to:\n\n【93】*   •\n\n【94】    Wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, and hats\n\n【95】*   •\n\n【96】    Apply insect repellent to exposed skin, especially during the day when _Aedes_ mosquitoes are most active. The most effective insect repellent in the United States is diethyltoluamide at the recommended concentration of 20% to 50%. Other options include icaridin (concentration of at least 20%) and lemon eucalyptus extract (concentration of at least 30%). Diethyltoluamide- and icaridin-containing insect repellants are safe for use in pregnancy when used as directed on the product label.\n\n【97】*   •\n\n【98】    Treat clothing with permethrin\n\n【99】*   •\n\n【100】    Sleep under mosquito nets or in air-conditioned rooms with windows closed\n\n【101】The Table provides additional practical advice for persons considering travel to areas where Zika virus transmission has occurred.\n\n【102】Table Advice for Individuals Considering Travel to an Area Where Zika Virus Infection Is Circulating\n\n| Before travel |\n| --- |\n| Recommend personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites |\n| Consider referral to a travel medicine professional |\n| Counsel on ways to avoid unintended pregnancy during travel |\n| Recommend against travel if pregnant |\n| After travel |\n| Remind travelers to report symptoms compatible with Zika virus infection that occur within 3 weeks of return |\n| Recommend that travelers avoid donating blood for 28 days after return |\n| Recommend that men avoid unprotected sex with a pregnant partner for the duration of pregnancy |\n| Recommend that pregnant women report travel that has occurred during pregnancy to their antenatal care professional so that appropriate monitoring can occur |\n\n【104】Zika Virus Infection and Public Health Implications\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【105】Genetic studies indicate that the virus spreading through the Americas is closely related to the Asian strains of Zika virus that caused the outbreaks in Polynesia. The virus was possibly imported to Brazil by travelers attending the FIFA World Cup or alternatively by participants at the August 2014 International Va'a World Sprints canoe championship in which many Pacific island nations participated.\n\n【106】Zika virus transmission from French Polynesia to Brazil.\n\n【107】This news comes just as Brazil is preparing to host another enormous sporting event—the Olympic Games in August 2016. An estimated 500,000 visitors including 200,000 from the United States are expected to travel to Brazil to attend the games.\n\n【108】Researchers weigh risks of Zika spreading at Rio Olympics.\n\n【109】If the Zika virus outbreak is not contained by then, some of these visitors could become infected and carry Zika virus infection back to their home country and, given the right mosquito vector, set off additional outbreaks.\n\n【110】The _Aedes_ mosquito is well established across the Americas except for Canada and Chile and therefore all these areas are potentially at risk. Experts have stated that because of extensive mosquito control activities in the United States, the risk of Zika virus spread is low. Chikungunya and dengue viruses, other _Aedes_ \\-borne infections, have not spread in the continental United States despite major outbreaks in the Caribbean. In contrast, West Nile virus, another mosquito-borne illness spread by the _Culex_ mosquito, first appeared in the United States in 1999\n\n【111】West Nile virus: epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prevention.\n\n【112】and by 2014 was well established in all 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia.\n\n【113】West Nile virus and other nationally notifiable arboviral diseases – United States, 2014.\n\n【114】Climactic conditions may have played a role in the recent explosive spread of Zika virus in South America. Southern Brazil and Uruguay had an unusually wet winter followed by a warm summer.\n\n【115】 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00256-7 .\n\n【116】Standing water on the ground in winter serves as mosquito breeding grounds and may have spurred growth of mosquito populations. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are most active in warm weather. Individuals tend to spend more time outdoors in warmer weather, which facilitates transmission of Zika virus. Drought conditions are associated with storage of water in containers around households, which can further promote mosquito breeding.\n\n【117】Zika virus disease is relatively mild. The biggest threat to public health from Zika virus comes from the association with neurologic syndromes including microcephaly and GBS. Managing these conditions is resource intensive and can place considerable strain on the medical system. Like Ebola virus, the disease has exposed vulnerabilities in the ability of resource-limited countries to handle infectious disease emergencies. Finally, Zika virus infection has raised ethical/moral/legal questions in Latin American countries, where health officials have suggested that women postpone pregnancies but women have limited access to birth control.\n\n【118】A scoping review on determinants of unmet need for family planning among women of reproductive age in low and middle income countries.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【20】Zika virus, French Polynesia, South Pacific, 2013.", "content": "【0】Zika Virus in the Americas: A Review for Clinicians\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【1】Zika virus has recently emerged as a new public health threat.

In 2015, the virus was first reported in Brazil and since then has spread explosively through several additional countries in South and Central America and the Caribbean. Simultaneously, several of these countries have seen a dramatic increase in the incidence of infants born with microcephaly. The rapid spread of Zika virus through the Americas, together with the association of infection with microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, has resulted in the World Health Organization declaring a public health emergency. Zika virus has the potential to spread to new areas where the _Aedes_ mosquito vector is present and therefore presents a risk to the United States. This concise review describes the clinical features of Zika virus infection and provides advice for clinicians on counseling travelers and others about the disease.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ), GBS ( Guillain-Barré syndrome ), WHO ( World Health Organization )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .™\n\n【9】Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【10】**MOC Credit Statement** : Successful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1 MOC points in the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program.

In April 2007, an epidemic of rash, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia was reported from Yap State, Federated States of Micronesia.\n\n【18】Zika virus outbreak on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia.\n\n【19】This epidemic represented the first documented outbreak of Zika virus infection; it was estimated that 70% of the island's population was infected with Zika virus over a 13-week period. In 2013, another large outbreak was reported in French Polynesia.

The WHO declaration represents its highest level of alert and has only been invoked 3 other times so far—in 2009 during the H1N1 influenza epidemic, in May 2014 when poliomyelitis reemerged in Pakistan and Syria, and in August 2014 with Ebola virus.\n\n【28】Figure 1 Areas with active Zika virus transmission in the Americas and Africa as of February 23, 2016.\n\n【29】From the World Health Organization.\n\n【30】Transmission\n------------\n\n【31】Zika virus is primarily transmitted to humans through bites from _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Both _Aedes aegypti_ (confined to tropical and subtropical regions) and _Aedes albopictus_ (found in temperate regions in addition to tropical and subtropical areas) are capable of transmitting Zika virus and have been implicated in outbreaks of Zika virus. Both _Aedes_ species are present in the United States. _Aedes albopictus_ is of particular concern because it has a much wider range than _A aegypti_ . It was originally imported from Southeast Asia and has been remarkably adaptable to cooler climates. _Aedes albopictus_ is now firmly established in several states in the United States.\n\n【32】Climate change and range expansion of the Asian tiger mosquito ( _Aedes albopictus_ ) in Northeastern USA: implications for public health practitioners.\n\n【33】It is an aggressive daytime biter and thrives in densely populated urban environments.

Mosquito populations may be detected in areas not shaded on this map, and may not be consistently found in all shaded areas.\n\n【35】From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n【36】Other modes of transmission are possible, but it is unclear how much of a role they play in propagating outbreaks. Sexual transmission of Zika virus was first reported in 2011.\n\n【37】Probable non-vector-borne transmission of Zika virus, Colorado, USA.\n\n【38】An American researcher acquired Zika virus in Senegal, became ill after returning home to Colorado, and transmitted the infection to his wife who had not traveled outside the United States. There have been 2 lab-confirmed cases of sexual transmission of Zika virus in the US during the current Zika outbreak; several additional cases are under investigation.\n\n【39】The virus was first isolated from sperm during the Polynesian outbreak.\n\n【40】Potential sexual transmission of Zika virus.\n\n【41】It is not known how long the virus persists in sperm or whether asymptomatic persons infected with Zika virus can transmit infection to sexual partners. The disease is associated with viremia, so not surprisingly, transfusion-related transmission has been reported.\n\n【42】The virus is detectable in breast milk,\n\n【43】Evidence of perinatal transmission of Zika virus, French Polynesia, December 2013 and February 2014.\n\n【44】but breastfeeding-associated transmission has not been reported so far.\n\n【45】Pathogenesis\n------------\n\n【46】Zika virus is an RNA virus that is closely related to other flaviviruses including yellow fever, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile virus. Little is known about its pathogenesis; however, it is thought that viral replication occurs in local dendritic cells after inoculation from a mosquito with subsequent spread to lymph nodes and the bloodstream. Viremia is generally seen within 3 to 4 days of symptom onset.\n\n【47】Zika virus outside Africa.\n\n【48】Virus is detectable in blood as early as the day of illness onset and as late as 11 days after onset.\n\n【49】Genetic and serologic properties of Zika virus associated with an epidemic, Yap State, Micronesia, 2007.\n\n【50】The virus has also been detected in urine, sperm, and saliva of infected individuals.\n\n【51】Potential sexual transmission of Zika virus.\n\n【52】Detection of Zika virus in saliva.\n\n【53】Detection of Zika virus in urine.\n\n【54】Clinical Manifestations\n-----------------------\n\n【55】Evidence from case reports and experience from related flavivirus infections indicate that the incubation period of Zika virus is likely 3 days to 2 weeks.\n\n【56】Incubation periods of mosquito-borne viral infections: a systematic review.\n\n【57】Approximately 80% of individuals infected with Zika virus have no symptoms. When they occur, the symptoms of Zika infection are typically mild. Most commonly seen are fever, itchy maculopapular rash , nonpurulent conjunctivitis, and arthralgia involving the small joints of the hands and feet. Myalgias and headache, including retro-orbital pain, can also be present. Symptoms generally resolve in a few days. Unlike yellow fever and dengue infections, death, hemorrhagic complications, or severe illness requiring hospitalization are very rare. Zika virus infection does not have features that clearly distinguish it from mild cases of other arboviral diseases, although rash is more common with Zika virus.\n\n【58】Zika virus outbreak, Bahia, Brazil.\n\n【59】Guillain-Barré syndrome was first reported in association with Zika virus in the French Polynesian outbreak in 2013.\n\n【60】Zika virus infection complicated by Guillain-Barré syndrome—case report, French Polynesia, December 2013.\n\n【61】In July 2015, Brazil reported neurologic syndromes in patients with a recent history of Zika virus infection.\n\n【62】Of 42 patients with confirmed GBS, 26 (62%) had a history of symptoms consistent with Zika virus infection. In 2015, a total of 1708 cases of GBS were registered nationwide, representing a 19% average increase from the previous year. Colombia, El Salvador, Suriname, and Venezuela have also reported an observed increase of GBS.\n\n【63】Figure 3 Maculopapular rash in a patient infected with Zika virus.\n\n【64】From _Emerg Infect Dis_ ,\n\n【65】Probable non-vector-borne transmission of Zika virus, Colorado, USA.\n\n【66】with permission.\n\n【67】Most notably, Zika virus has been in the press because of an association with microcephaly in newborns (head circumference ≥2 SD below the mean for sex and gestational age at birth). Between 2010 and 2014, approximately 150 to 200 children per year were born with microcephaly. In October 2015, the Brazil Ministry of Health reported a 20-fold increase in cases of microcephaly—mostly in northeast Brazil, which also had a high prevalence of suspected cases of Zika virus infection. Although causation has not been established, several investigations have suggested a link between maternal infection and microcephaly in infants. Zika virus RNA has been identified by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction in the amniotic fluid of women whose fetuses had microcephaly and in tissues of infants with microcephaly.\n\n【68】Notes from the field: evidence of Zika virus infection in brain and placental tissues from two congenitally infected newborns and two fetal losses – Brazil, 2015.\n\n【69】It has also been found in tissue from fetal losses from 4 women who were infected during pregnancy.\n\n【70】Brazilian Medical Genetics Society–Zika Embryopathy Task Force  \nPossible association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly – Brazil, 2015.\n\n【71】In another study, all mothers of a Brazilian cohort of 35 infants born with microcephaly had lived in or visited an area affected with Zika virus during their pregnancy. Abnormalities in the infants consisted of widespread brain calcifications and ventricular enlargement secondary to cerebral atrophy. All tested negative for other infections including syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus infections. A recent report provided information on a European woman who had a clinical syndrome compatible with Zika virus infection at 13 weeks of gestation while living in Brazil.\n\n【72】Ultrasonography at 14 and 20 weeks of gestation detected no abnormalities but revealed microcephaly at 29 weeks of gestation. The mother underwent termination of the pregnancy. At fetal autopsy, microcephaly with multifocal calcifications in the cortex and subcortical white matter, severe hydrocephalus, and hypoplasia of the brain stem and spinal cord were noted. The entire Zika virus genome was recovered from fetal brain tissue. No other genetic abnormalities or other pathogens were found. These reports strongly support a link between maternal Zika infection and microcephaly. A case-control study is under way in Brazil to examine this association further and to determine whether other infections or environmental factors may be playing a role in the increased incidence of microcephaly.\n\n【73】A group of researchers have shown that, in vitro, the Zika virus is capable of infecting human neural progenitor cells. Infection resulted in disruption of cell cycle, increased cell death and attenuated neuron growth. Although this work is preliminary, the creation of this experimental model may pave the way for additional studies to determine the pathogenesis of microcephaly and other neurologic and ocular defects associated with Zika.\n\n【74】Further studies are also needed to determine the prognosis for infants with congenital Zika virus infection. For infants with microcephaly from other causes, a spectrum of neurologic deficits ranging from mild to severe are seen and are usually lifelong.\n\n【75】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【76】Zika virus infection is generally diagnosed clinically with subsequent confirmatory testing. Testing for Zika virus should be performed in patients who experience symptoms while traveling in an area where Zika virus transmission has been reported or within 2 weeks of return. Because dengue and chikungunya virus infections have similar symptoms and geographic distribution, patients with suspected Zika virus infection should also be evaluated for these infections. Zika virus testing is currently performed only at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Arbovirus Diagnostic Laboratory and at some state public health departments. It is not commercially available. Clinicians should contact their state or local health department to facilitate testing.\n\n【77】Available tests include (1) reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction on serum if within a week of symptom onset and (2) testing for Zika virus–specific IgM antibodies in serum for infection after 1 week of symptom onset. Cross-reaction with other flaviviruses (eg, dengue virus and yellow fever) is common, and test results should be interpreted with the assistance of an infectious disease specialist and the performing laboratory. The CDC has specific instructions for sending diagnostic specimens and completing the specimen submission form.\n\n【78】Zika Virus and Pregnancy\n------------------------\n\n【79】Women who are pregnant should avoid travel to areas where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. Updated information regarding areas with active transmission can be found on the CDC website.\n\n【80】If a pregnant woman cannot postpone travel, she should be advised to follow mosquito avoidance precautions. All pregnant women should be asked about travel history. Women who experience symptoms while traveling in an area where Zika transmission has been reported or within 2 weeks of return should be tested for Zika virus infection as soon as possible. Asymptomatic women who report travel to such areas while pregnant should be offered serologic testing for Zika virus between 2 and 12 weeks after return and should also undergo fetal ultrasonography . Guidance in this area is evolving rapidly as more data become available, and readers should refer to the CDC website for the latest recommendations. The CDC recently recommended that pregnant women should avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has a history of travel to a Zika infection risk area for the duration of the pregnancy.\n\n【81】Interim guidelines for prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus – United States, 2016.\n\n【82】Figure 4 Testing algorithm for pregnant woman with history of travel to an area with ongoing. Zika virus transmission.\n\n【83】From _MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep_ .\n\n【84】Update: interim guidelines for health care providers caring for pregnant women and women of reproductive age with possible Zika virus exposure–United States, 2016.\n\n【85】Infants should be tested for Zika virus if they are born to women who traveled to an area with ongoing Zika virus transmission and have microcephaly or intracranial calcifications or if the mother has positive or inconclusive Zika virus test results.\n\n【86】Women of childbearing age who are planning travel to Zika-endemic areas should be counseled on ways to prevent unintended pregnancy. Although a causal link between Zika virus and microcephaly has not been established, public health agencies in several countries where Zika virus outbreaks are occurring have taken the unprecedented step of recommending that women living in these countries delay pregnancy for the next several months to years.\n\n【87】Treatment\n---------\n\n【88】There is no specific antiviral treatment available for Zika virus. Treatment is focused on symptomatic relief including rest and hydration. Fever may be treated with acetaminophen. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used after dengue virus has been ruled out to reduce the risk for hemorrhage but should be avoided in pregnant women. Antihistamines may be helpful to control itching in patients with a rash. Patients with suspected Zika virus infection should be protected from further mosquito exposure during the first few days of illness to prevent other mosquitoes from becoming infected and thus reduce the risk of local transmission.\n\n【89】Prevention\n----------\n\n【90】There is no vaccine available to prevent Zika virus infection. The mainstay of prevention is minimizing exposure by controlling mosquito populations and avoiding bites. Mosquito control efforts have been hampered recently by a report from Argentina\n\n【91】blaming pyriproxyfen (a pesticide used to kill mosquito larvae in standing water) rather than Zika for the increase in fetal loss and microcephaly in Brazil. Investigators from the WHO, US Environmental Protection Agency, and European Union have found no evidence that the larvicide affects the course of pregnancy or the development of a fetus. The product has been used in Brazil since the late 1990s without being linked to microcephaly.\n\n【92】For personal protection against mosquito bites, residents of or travelers to Zika transmission areas should be counseled to:\n\n【93】*   •\n\n【94】    Wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, and hats\n\n【95】*   •\n\n【96】    Apply insect repellent to exposed skin, especially during the day when _Aedes_ mosquitoes are most active. The most effective insect repellent in the United States is diethyltoluamide at the recommended concentration of 20% to 50%. Other options include icaridin (concentration of at least 20%) and lemon eucalyptus extract (concentration of at least 30%). Diethyltoluamide- and icaridin-containing insect repellants are safe for use in pregnancy when used as directed on the product label.\n\n【97】*   •\n\n【98】    Treat clothing with permethrin\n\n【99】*   •\n\n【100】    Sleep under mosquito nets or in air-conditioned rooms with windows closed\n\n【101】The Table provides additional practical advice for persons considering travel to areas where Zika virus transmission has occurred.\n\n【102】Table Advice for Individuals Considering Travel to an Area Where Zika Virus Infection Is Circulating\n\n| Before travel |\n| --- |\n| Recommend personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites |\n| Consider referral to a travel medicine professional |\n| Counsel on ways to avoid unintended pregnancy during travel |\n| Recommend against travel if pregnant |\n| After travel |\n| Remind travelers to report symptoms compatible with Zika virus infection that occur within 3 weeks of return |\n| Recommend that travelers avoid donating blood for 28 days after return |\n| Recommend that men avoid unprotected sex with a pregnant partner for the duration of pregnancy |\n| Recommend that pregnant women report travel that has occurred during pregnancy to their antenatal care professional so that appropriate monitoring can occur |\n\n【104】Zika Virus Infection and Public Health Implications\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【105】Genetic studies indicate that the virus spreading through the Americas is closely related to the Asian strains of Zika virus that caused the outbreaks in Polynesia. The virus was possibly imported to Brazil by travelers attending the FIFA World Cup or alternatively by participants at the August 2014 International Va'a World Sprints canoe championship in which many Pacific island nations participated.\n\n【106】Zika virus transmission from French Polynesia to Brazil.\n\n【107】This news comes just as Brazil is preparing to host another enormous sporting event—the Olympic Games in August 2016. An estimated 500,000 visitors including 200,000 from the United States are expected to travel to Brazil to attend the games.\n\n【108】Researchers weigh risks of Zika spreading at Rio Olympics.\n\n【109】If the Zika virus outbreak is not contained by then, some of these visitors could become infected and carry Zika virus infection back to their home country and, given the right mosquito vector, set off additional outbreaks.\n\n【110】The _Aedes_ mosquito is well established across the Americas except for Canada and Chile and therefore all these areas are potentially at risk. Experts have stated that because of extensive mosquito control activities in the United States, the risk of Zika virus spread is low. Chikungunya and dengue viruses, other _Aedes_ \\-borne infections, have not spread in the continental United States despite major outbreaks in the Caribbean. In contrast, West Nile virus, another mosquito-borne illness spread by the _Culex_ mosquito, first appeared in the United States in 1999\n\n【111】West Nile virus: epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prevention.\n\n【112】and by 2014 was well established in all 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia.\n\n【113】West Nile virus and other nationally notifiable arboviral diseases – United States, 2014.\n\n【114】Climactic conditions may have played a role in the recent explosive spread of Zika virus in South America. Southern Brazil and Uruguay had an unusually wet winter followed by a warm summer.\n\n【115】 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00256-7 .\n\n【116】Standing water on the ground in winter serves as mosquito breeding grounds and may have spurred growth of mosquito populations. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are most active in warm weather. Individuals tend to spend more time outdoors in warmer weather, which facilitates transmission of Zika virus. Drought conditions are associated with storage of water in containers around households, which can further promote mosquito breeding.\n\n【117】Zika virus disease is relatively mild. The biggest threat to public health from Zika virus comes from the association with neurologic syndromes including microcephaly and GBS. Managing these conditions is resource intensive and can place considerable strain on the medical system. Like Ebola virus, the disease has exposed vulnerabilities in the ability of resource-limited countries to handle infectious disease emergencies. Finally, Zika virus infection has raised ethical/moral/legal questions in Latin American countries, where health officials have suggested that women postpone pregnancies but women have limited access to birth control.\n\n【118】A scoping review on determinants of unmet need for family planning among women of reproductive age in low and middle income countries.", "index": 5702, "show": true, "start": 5702, "end": 5756, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【115】 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00256-7 .", "content": "【0】Zika Virus in the Americas: A Review for Clinicians\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【1】Zika virus has recently emerged as a new public health threat.

Sexual transmission of Zika virus was first reported in 2011.\n\n【37】Probable non-vector-borne transmission of Zika virus, Colorado, USA.\n\n【38】An American researcher acquired Zika virus in Senegal, became ill after returning home to Colorado, and transmitted the infection to his wife who had not traveled outside the United States. There have been 2 lab-confirmed cases of sexual transmission of Zika virus in the US during the current Zika outbreak; several additional cases are under investigation.\n\n【39】The virus was first isolated from sperm during the Polynesian outbreak.\n\n【40】Potential sexual transmission of Zika virus.\n\n【41】It is not known how long the virus persists in sperm or whether asymptomatic persons infected with Zika virus can transmit infection to sexual partners. The disease is associated with viremia, so not surprisingly, transfusion-related transmission has been reported.\n\n【42】The virus is detectable in breast milk,\n\n【43】Evidence of perinatal transmission of Zika virus, French Polynesia, December 2013 and February 2014.\n\n【44】but breastfeeding-associated transmission has not been reported so far.\n\n【45】Pathogenesis\n------------\n\n【46】Zika virus is an RNA virus that is closely related to other flaviviruses including yellow fever, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile virus. Little is known about its pathogenesis; however, it is thought that viral replication occurs in local dendritic cells after inoculation from a mosquito with subsequent spread to lymph nodes and the bloodstream. Viremia is generally seen within 3 to 4 days of symptom onset.\n\n【47】Zika virus outside Africa.\n\n【48】Virus is detectable in blood as early as the day of illness onset and as late as 11 days after onset.\n\n【49】Genetic and serologic properties of Zika virus associated with an epidemic, Yap State, Micronesia, 2007.\n\n【50】The virus has also been detected in urine, sperm, and saliva of infected individuals.\n\n【51】Potential sexual transmission of Zika virus.\n\n【52】Detection of Zika virus in saliva.\n\n【53】Detection of Zika virus in urine.\n\n【54】Clinical Manifestations\n-----------------------\n\n【55】Evidence from case reports and experience from related flavivirus infections indicate that the incubation period of Zika virus is likely 3 days to 2 weeks.\n\n【56】Incubation periods of mosquito-borne viral infections: a systematic review.\n\n【57】Approximately 80% of individuals infected with Zika virus have no symptoms. When they occur, the symptoms of Zika infection are typically mild. Most commonly seen are fever, itchy maculopapular rash , nonpurulent conjunctivitis, and arthralgia involving the small joints of the hands and feet. Myalgias and headache, including retro-orbital pain, can also be present. Symptoms generally resolve in a few days. Unlike yellow fever and dengue infections, death, hemorrhagic complications, or severe illness requiring hospitalization are very rare. Zika virus infection does not have features that clearly distinguish it from mild cases of other arboviral diseases, although rash is more common with Zika virus.\n\n【58】Zika virus outbreak, Bahia, Brazil.\n\n【59】Guillain-Barré syndrome was first reported in association with Zika virus in the French Polynesian outbreak in 2013.\n\n【60】Zika virus infection complicated by Guillain-Barré syndrome—case report, French Polynesia, December 2013.\n\n【61】In July 2015, Brazil reported neurologic syndromes in patients with a recent history of Zika virus infection.\n\n【62】Of 42 patients with confirmed GBS, 26 (62%) had a history of symptoms consistent with Zika virus infection. In 2015, a total of 1708 cases of GBS were registered nationwide, representing a 19% average increase from the previous year. Colombia, El Salvador, Suriname, and Venezuela have also reported an observed increase of GBS.\n\n【63】Figure 3 Maculopapular rash in a patient infected with Zika virus.\n\n【64】From _Emerg Infect Dis_ ,\n\n【65】Probable non-vector-borne transmission of Zika virus, Colorado, USA.\n\n【66】with permission.\n\n【67】Most notably, Zika virus has been in the press because of an association with microcephaly in newborns (head circumference ≥2 SD below the mean for sex and gestational age at birth). Between 2010 and 2014, approximately 150 to 200 children per year were born with microcephaly. In October 2015, the Brazil Ministry of Health reported a 20-fold increase in cases of microcephaly—mostly in northeast Brazil, which also had a high prevalence of suspected cases of Zika virus infection. Although causation has not been established, several investigations have suggested a link between maternal infection and microcephaly in infants. Zika virus RNA has been identified by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction in the amniotic fluid of women whose fetuses had microcephaly and in tissues of infants with microcephaly.\n\n【68】Notes from the field: evidence of Zika virus infection in brain and placental tissues from two congenitally infected newborns and two fetal losses – Brazil, 2015.\n\n【69】It has also been found in tissue from fetal losses from 4 women who were infected during pregnancy.\n\n【70】Brazilian Medical Genetics Society–Zika Embryopathy Task Force  \nPossible association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly – Brazil, 2015.\n\n【71】In another study, all mothers of a Brazilian cohort of 35 infants born with microcephaly had lived in or visited an area affected with Zika virus during their pregnancy. Abnormalities in the infants consisted of widespread brain calcifications and ventricular enlargement secondary to cerebral atrophy. All tested negative for other infections including syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus infections. A recent report provided information on a European woman who had a clinical syndrome compatible with Zika virus infection at 13 weeks of gestation while living in Brazil.\n\n【72】Ultrasonography at 14 and 20 weeks of gestation detected no abnormalities but revealed microcephaly at 29 weeks of gestation. The mother underwent termination of the pregnancy. At fetal autopsy, microcephaly with multifocal calcifications in the cortex and subcortical white matter, severe hydrocephalus, and hypoplasia of the brain stem and spinal cord were noted. The entire Zika virus genome was recovered from fetal brain tissue. No other genetic abnormalities or other pathogens were found. These reports strongly support a link between maternal Zika infection and microcephaly. A case-control study is under way in Brazil to examine this association further and to determine whether other infections or environmental factors may be playing a role in the increased incidence of microcephaly.\n\n【73】A group of researchers have shown that, in vitro, the Zika virus is capable of infecting human neural progenitor cells. Infection resulted in disruption of cell cycle, increased cell death and attenuated neuron growth. Although this work is preliminary, the creation of this experimental model may pave the way for additional studies to determine the pathogenesis of microcephaly and other neurologic and ocular defects associated with Zika.\n\n【74】Further studies are also needed to determine the prognosis for infants with congenital Zika virus infection. For infants with microcephaly from other causes, a spectrum of neurologic deficits ranging from mild to severe are seen and are usually lifelong.\n\n【75】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【76】Zika virus infection is generally diagnosed clinically with subsequent confirmatory testing. Testing for Zika virus should be performed in patients who experience symptoms while traveling in an area where Zika virus transmission has been reported or within 2 weeks of return. Because dengue and chikungunya virus infections have similar symptoms and geographic distribution, patients with suspected Zika virus infection should also be evaluated for these infections. Zika virus testing is currently performed only at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Arbovirus Diagnostic Laboratory and at some state public health departments. It is not commercially available. Clinicians should contact their state or local health department to facilitate testing.\n\n【77】Available tests include (1) reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction on serum if within a week of symptom onset and (2) testing for Zika virus–specific IgM antibodies in serum for infection after 1 week of symptom onset. Cross-reaction with other flaviviruses (eg, dengue virus and yellow fever) is common, and test results should be interpreted with the assistance of an infectious disease specialist and the performing laboratory. The CDC has specific instructions for sending diagnostic specimens and completing the specimen submission form.\n\n【78】Zika Virus and Pregnancy\n------------------------\n\n【79】Women who are pregnant should avoid travel to areas where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. Updated information regarding areas with active transmission can be found on the CDC website.\n\n【80】If a pregnant woman cannot postpone travel, she should be advised to follow mosquito avoidance precautions. All pregnant women should be asked about travel history. Women who experience symptoms while traveling in an area where Zika transmission has been reported or within 2 weeks of return should be tested for Zika virus infection as soon as possible. Asymptomatic women who report travel to such areas while pregnant should be offered serologic testing for Zika virus between 2 and 12 weeks after return and should also undergo fetal ultrasonography . Guidance in this area is evolving rapidly as more data become available, and readers should refer to the CDC website for the latest recommendations. The CDC recently recommended that pregnant women should avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has a history of travel to a Zika infection risk area for the duration of the pregnancy.\n\n【81】Interim guidelines for prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus – United States, 2016.\n\n【82】Figure 4 Testing algorithm for pregnant woman with history of travel to an area with ongoing. Zika virus transmission.\n\n【83】From _MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep_ .\n\n【84】Update: interim guidelines for health care providers caring for pregnant women and women of reproductive age with possible Zika virus exposure–United States, 2016.\n\n【85】Infants should be tested for Zika virus if they are born to women who traveled to an area with ongoing Zika virus transmission and have microcephaly or intracranial calcifications or if the mother has positive or inconclusive Zika virus test results.\n\n【86】Women of childbearing age who are planning travel to Zika-endemic areas should be counseled on ways to prevent unintended pregnancy. Although a causal link between Zika virus and microcephaly has not been established, public health agencies in several countries where Zika virus outbreaks are occurring have taken the unprecedented step of recommending that women living in these countries delay pregnancy for the next several months to years.\n\n【87】Treatment\n---------\n\n【88】There is no specific antiviral treatment available for Zika virus. Treatment is focused on symptomatic relief including rest and hydration. Fever may be treated with acetaminophen. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used after dengue virus has been ruled out to reduce the risk for hemorrhage but should be avoided in pregnant women. Antihistamines may be helpful to control itching in patients with a rash. Patients with suspected Zika virus infection should be protected from further mosquito exposure during the first few days of illness to prevent other mosquitoes from becoming infected and thus reduce the risk of local transmission.\n\n【89】Prevention\n----------\n\n【90】There is no vaccine available to prevent Zika virus infection. The mainstay of prevention is minimizing exposure by controlling mosquito populations and avoiding bites. Mosquito control efforts have been hampered recently by a report from Argentina\n\n【91】blaming pyriproxyfen (a pesticide used to kill mosquito larvae in standing water) rather than Zika for the increase in fetal loss and microcephaly in Brazil. Investigators from the WHO, US Environmental Protection Agency, and European Union have found no evidence that the larvicide affects the course of pregnancy or the development of a fetus. The product has been used in Brazil since the late 1990s without being linked to microcephaly.\n\n【92】For personal protection against mosquito bites, residents of or travelers to Zika transmission areas should be counseled to:\n\n【93】*   •\n\n【94】    Wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, and hats\n\n【95】*   •\n\n【96】    Apply insect repellent to exposed skin, especially during the day when _Aedes_ mosquitoes are most active. The most effective insect repellent in the United States is diethyltoluamide at the recommended concentration of 20% to 50%. Other options include icaridin (concentration of at least 20%) and lemon eucalyptus extract (concentration of at least 30%). Diethyltoluamide- and icaridin-containing insect repellants are safe for use in pregnancy when used as directed on the product label.\n\n【97】*   •\n\n【98】    Treat clothing with permethrin\n\n【99】*   •\n\n【100】    Sleep under mosquito nets or in air-conditioned rooms with windows closed\n\n【101】The Table provides additional practical advice for persons considering travel to areas where Zika virus transmission has occurred.\n\n【102】Table Advice for Individuals Considering Travel to an Area Where Zika Virus Infection Is Circulating\n\n| Before travel |\n| --- |\n| Recommend personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites |\n| Consider referral to a travel medicine professional |\n| Counsel on ways to avoid unintended pregnancy during travel |\n| Recommend against travel if pregnant |\n| After travel |\n| Remind travelers to report symptoms compatible with Zika virus infection that occur within 3 weeks of return |\n| Recommend that travelers avoid donating blood for 28 days after return |\n| Recommend that men avoid unprotected sex with a pregnant partner for the duration of pregnancy |\n| Recommend that pregnant women report travel that has occurred during pregnancy to their antenatal care professional so that appropriate monitoring can occur |\n\n【104】Zika Virus Infection and Public Health Implications\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【105】Genetic studies indicate that the virus spreading through the Americas is closely related to the Asian strains of Zika virus that caused the outbreaks in Polynesia. The virus was possibly imported to Brazil by travelers attending the FIFA World Cup or alternatively by participants at the August 2014 International Va'a World Sprints canoe championship in which many Pacific island nations participated.\n\n【106】Zika virus transmission from French Polynesia to Brazil.\n\n【107】This news comes just as Brazil is preparing to host another enormous sporting event—the Olympic Games in August 2016. An estimated 500,000 visitors including 200,000 from the United States are expected to travel to Brazil to attend the games.\n\n【108】Researchers weigh risks of Zika spreading at Rio Olympics.\n\n【109】If the Zika virus outbreak is not contained by then, some of these visitors could become infected and carry Zika virus infection back to their home country and, given the right mosquito vector, set off additional outbreaks.\n\n【110】The _Aedes_ mosquito is well established across the Americas except for Canada and Chile and therefore all these areas are potentially at risk. Experts have stated that because of extensive mosquito control activities in the United States, the risk of Zika virus spread is low. Chikungunya and dengue viruses, other _Aedes_ \\-borne infections, have not spread in the continental United States despite major outbreaks in the Caribbean. In contrast, West Nile virus, another mosquito-borne illness spread by the _Culex_ mosquito, first appeared in the United States in 1999\n\n【111】West Nile virus: epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prevention.\n\n【112】and by 2014 was well established in all 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia.\n\n【113】West Nile virus and other nationally notifiable arboviral diseases – United States, 2014.\n\n【114】Climactic conditions may have played a role in the recent explosive spread of Zika virus in South America. Southern Brazil and Uruguay had an unusually wet winter followed by a warm summer.\n\n【115】 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00256-7 .\n\n【116】Standing water on the ground in winter serves as mosquito breeding grounds and may have spurred growth of mosquito populations. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are most active in warm weather. Individuals tend to spend more time outdoors in warmer weather, which facilitates transmission of Zika virus. Drought conditions are associated with storage of water in containers around households, which can further promote mosquito breeding.\n\n【117】Zika virus disease is relatively mild. The biggest threat to public health from Zika virus comes from the association with neurologic syndromes including microcephaly and GBS. Managing these conditions is resource intensive and can place considerable strain on the medical system. Like Ebola virus, the disease has exposed vulnerabilities in the ability of resource-limited countries to handle infectious disease emergencies. Finally, Zika virus infection has raised ethical/moral/legal questions in Latin American countries, where health officials have suggested that women postpone pregnancies but women have limited access to birth control.\n\n【118】A scoping review on determinants of unmet need for family planning among women of reproductive age in low and middle income countries.", "index": 25228, "show": true, "start": 25215, "end": 25252, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:21:59", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:23:52", "cost": 113.22}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:23:52", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:21:59"}

Abstral\n2.  Actiq\n3.  Fentora\n4.  Onsolis\n5.  Subsys\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Fentanyl is used to treat severe pain in cancer patients. It is used for breakthrough cancer pain, which are flares of pain that “break through” after a routine pain medicine has been used. Fentanyl belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics. It is only used in patients who are already taking narcotic analgesics.\n\n【4】Fentanyl acts in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. Some of its side effects are also caused by actions in the CNS. When a narcotic is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming or cause mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuous pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. Withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before the medicine is stopped completely. Talk to your doctor about the benefits of this medicine and how to prevent withdrawal side effects.\n\n【5】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription. The Abstral®, Actiq®, Fentora®, Onsolis®, and Subsys® products are only available under a restricted distribution program. You will have to read and sign papers that explain how the medicine is used when you pick up your prescription.\n\n【6】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【7】*   Spray\n*   Tablet\n*   Lozenge/Troche\n\n【8】Before Using\n------------\n\n【9】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【10】### Allergies\n\n【11】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【12】### Pediatric\n\n【13】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of fentanyl in children younger than 18 years of age for the Abstral®, Fentora®, Onsolis®, and Subsys® brands, and in children younger than 16 years of age for the Actiq® brand. Safety and efficacy have not been established in these age groups.\n\n【14】### Geriatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fentanyl in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of narcotic analgesics than younger adults and are more likely to have age-related lung or kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fentanyl in order to avoid serious side effects.\n\n【16】### Breastfeeding\n\n【17】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【18】### Drug Interactions\n\n【19】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【20】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Sex-specific result reporting was defined as presenting primary outcomes for women in a format to allow the data to be abstracted for use in a meta-analysis.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of the 645 studies reviewed, 17 were excluded because they were appropriately single-sex trials. Of the remaining 628 studies, only 153 (24%) provided SSRs. The percentage of studies reporting SSRs was 37% (23/62) for general medical journals and 23% (130/566) for cardiovascular journals ( _P_ \\=.10). Among National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored research, 31 (51%) of 61 trials analyzed outcomes by sex compared with 125 (22%) of 567 trials not sponsored by the NIH ( _P_ <.001).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Only a few current cardiovascular trials provide sex-specific data. Sex differences remain poorly understood, and this deficiency limits our ability to optimize medical care for both sexes. The stipulation that SSRs be investigated has led to significantly more SSR reporting in NIH-funded research. A parallel mandate by journal editors that requires authors to provide sex-specific data and analysis may help to bridge this knowledge gap.\n\n【8】NIH ( National Institutes of Health ), SSR ( sex-specific result )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:36:51", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:37:00", "cost": 9.472}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:36:59", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:36:50"}

The C statistic was derived to compare MELD with MELDNa in patients with and without ascites.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】MELD (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 1.22; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.05-1.47; _P_ \\=.007; C statistic, 0.81) and MELDNa (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05-1.56; _P_ \\=.008; C statistic, 0.78) were significant predictors of 180-day mortality in patients with AH. A MELD score of 27.0 and a MELDNa score of 28.0 had sensitivity of 76.5% and 87.5% and specificity of 64.9% and 52.5%, respectively. In patients with AH and ascites, MELDNa (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.22-36.68; _P_ \\=.008; C statistic, 0.97) was a better predictor of 180-day mortality than MELD (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07-2.12; _P_ \\=.006; C statistic, 0.90). A MELD score of 29.0 and a MELDNa score of 34.0 had sensitivity of 85.7% and 83.3% and specificity of 31.0% and 16.7%, respectively.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】MELD and MELDNa were similar predictors of 180-day mortality; however, MELDNa was a better predictor of mortality than MELD in patients with ascites. Hyponatremia in patients with AH without ascites is not a predictor of mortality because it may have a dilutional basis secondary to excessive intake of low-osmolar alcohol.\n\n【8】AH ( alcoholic hepatitis ), ALD ( alcoholic liver disease ), CI ( confidence interval ), MELD ( Model for End-Stage Liver Disease ), Na ( sodium ), OR ( odds ratio )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:09:56", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:10:01", "cost": 4.802}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:10:00", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:09:55"}

ZyPREXA\n2.  ZyPREXA Zydis\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Olanzapine is used to treat schizophrenia. It may also be used alone or with other medicines (eg, lithium or valproate) to treat mania or mixed episodes that is part of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness). Olanzapine may also be used together with fluoxetine to treat depression that is a part of bipolar disorder, and depression in patients who received other antidepressants that did not work well. This medicine should not be used to treat behavioral problems in older adult patients who have dementia or Alzheimer's disease.\n\n【4】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【5】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【6】*   Tablet, Disintegrating\n*   Tablet\n\n【7】Before Using\n------------\n\n【8】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【9】### Allergies\n\n【10】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【11】### Pediatric\n\n【12】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of olanzapine in children. However, safety and efficacy of olanzapine alone in children younger than 13 years of age and olanzapine and fluoxetine combination in children younger than 10 years of age have not been established.\n\n【13】### Geriatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of olanzapine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have dementia or age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution or an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving olanzapine.\n\n【15】### Breastfeeding\n\n【16】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding.

All patients underwent transplants between March 19, 1998, and May 7, 2004. Information was collected on patient characteristics, comorbid conditions, laboratory results, donor and operative variables, medical and surgical complications, and mortality and graft loss.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Preoperative characteristics were similar across age groups, except for creatinine ( _P_ \\=.01) and serum albumin ( _P_ \\=.03) values, which were higher in older patients, and an earlier year of transplant in younger patients ( _P_ <.001). Intraoperatively, older patients required more erythrocyte transfusions ( _P_ \\=.04) and more intraoperative fluids ( _P_ \\=.001) than did younger patients. Postoperatively, bilirubin level ( _P_ \\=.007) and international normalized ratios ( _P_ \\=.01) were lower in older patients, whereas albumin level was higher ( _P_ <.001). The median follow-up was 5.1 years (range, 0.1-8.5 years). Compared with younger patients, older patients were not at an increased risk of death (relative risk, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-2.31; _P_ \\>.99) or graft loss (relative risk, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-2.52; _P_ \\=.70). The frequency of other complications did not differ significantly between age groups, although older patients had more cardiovascular complications.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Five-year mortality and graft loss in older recipients were comparable with those in younger recipients, suggesting that age alone should not exclude older patients from liver transplant.\n\n【8】CI ( confidence interval ), LT ( liver transplant ), MELD ( model for end-stage liver disease ), RR ( relative risk )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:48:34", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:48:42", "cost": 8.081}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:48:42", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:48:34"}

The pain might spread into your forearm and wrist.\n\n【2】Golfer's elbow is similar to tennis elbow, which occurs on the outside of the elbow. It's not limited to golfers. Tennis players and others who repeatedly use their wrists or clench their fingers also can develop golfer's elbow.\n\n【3】The pain of golfer's elbow doesn't have to keep you off the course or away from your favorite activities. Rest and appropriate treatment can get you back into the swing of things.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Golfer's elbow is characterized by:\n\n【6】*   **Pain and tenderness.** Usually felt on the inner side of your elbow, the pain sometimes extends along the inner side of your forearm. Pain typically worsens with certain movements.\n*   **Stiffness.** Your elbow may feel stiff, and making a fist might hurt.\n*   **Weakness.** You may have weakness in your hands and wrists.\n*   **Numbness or tingling.** These sensations might radiate into one or more fingers — usually the ring and little fingers.\n\n【7】The pain of golfer's elbow can come on suddenly or gradually. The pain might worsen with certain movements, such as swinging a golf club.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】Consult your doctor if rest, ice and over-the-counter pain relievers don't ease your elbow pain and tenderness. Seek immediate care if:\n\n【10】*   Your elbow is hot and inflamed, and you have a fever\n*   You can't bend your elbow\n*   Your elbow looks deformed\n*   You suspect you've broken a bone\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】Golfer's elbow, also known as medial epicondylitis, is caused by damage to the muscles and tendons that control your wrist and fingers. The damage is typically related to excess or repeated stress — especially forceful wrist and finger motions. Improper lifting, throwing or hitting, as well as too little warmup or poor conditioning, also can contribute to golfer's elbow.\n\n【13】Besides golf, many activities and occupations can lead to golfer's elbow, including:\n\n【14】*   **Racket sports.** Improper technique with tennis strokes, especially the backhand, can cause injury to the tendon. Excessive use of topspin and using a racket that's too small or heavy also can lead to injury.\n*   **Throwing sports.** Improper pitching technique in baseball or softball can be another culprit. Football, archery and javelin throwing also can cause golfer's elbow.\n*   **Weight training.** Lifting weights using improper technique, such as curling the wrists during a biceps exercise, can overload the elbow muscles and tendons.\n*   **Forceful, repetitive occupational movements.** These occur in fields such as construction, plumbing and carpentry\n\n【15】To cause golfer's elbow, the activity generally needs to be done for more than an hour a day on many days.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】You could be at higher risk of developing golfer's elbow if you're:\n\n【18】*   Age 40 or older\n*   Performing repetitive activity at least two hours a day\n*   Obese\n*   A smoker\n\n【19】Prevention\n----------\n\n【20】You can take steps to prevent golfer's elbow:\n\n【21】*   **Strengthen your forearm muscles.** Use light weights or squeeze a tennis ball. Even simple exercises can help your muscles absorb the energy of sudden physical stress.\n*   **Stretch before your activity.** Walk or jog for a few minutes to warm up your muscles. Then do gentle stretches before you begin your game.\n*   **Fix your form.** Whatever your sport, ask an instructor to check your form to avoid overload on muscles.\n*   **Use the right equipment.** If you're using older golfing irons, consider upgrading to lighter graphite clubs. If you play tennis, make sure your racket fits you. A racket with a small grip or a heavy head may increase the risk of elbow problems.\n*   **Lift properly.** When lifting anything — including free weights — keep your wrist rigid and stable to reduce the force to your elbow.\n*   **Know when to rest.** Try not to overuse your elbow.

In addition, there was no evidence of an increased PCA risk at a level more than 5 times the recommended minimum (hazard ratio, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.1). These associations were consistent regardless of age, sex, body mass index, comorbid conditions, and estimated 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The beneficial effect of physical activity on PCA started at two-thirds of the recommended minimum and continued to 5 times the recommended minimum. No excess risk for PCA was present among individuals with activity levels more than 5 times the recommended minimum regardless of cardiovascular disease or lifestyle risk factor presence.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BMI ( body mass index ), HR ( hazard ratio ), ICD-10 ( International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision ), MET ( metabolic equivalent task ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), NHIS ( National Health Insurance Service ), NSC ( National Sample Cohort ), PCA ( primary cardiac arrest ), SCA ( sudden cardiac arrest ), WHO ( World Health Organization )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:33:16", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:33:38", "cost": 21.449}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:33:36", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:33:14"}

Though breast cancer is most commonly thought of as a disease that affects women, breast cancer does occur in men.\n\n【2】Male breast cancer is most common in older men, though it can occur at any age.\n\n【3】Men diagnosed with male breast cancer at an early stage have a good chance for a cure. Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the breast tissue. Other treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, may be recommended based on your particular situation.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of male breast cancer can include:\n\n【6】*   A painless lump or thickening in your breast tissue\n*   Changes to the skin covering your breast, such as dimpling, puckering, redness or scaling\n*   Changes to your nipple, such as redness or scaling, or a nipple that begins to turn inward\n*   Discharge from your nipple\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】It's not clear what causes male breast cancer.\n\n【11】Doctors know that male breast cancer occurs when some breast cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do. The accumulating cells form a tumor that may spread (metastasize) to nearby tissue, to the lymph nodes or to other parts of the body.\n\n【12】### Where breast cancer begins in men\n\n【13】Everyone is born with a small amount of breast tissue. Breast tissue consists of milk-producing glands (lobules), ducts that carry milk to the nipples, and fat.\n\n【14】During puberty, women begin developing more breast tissue, and men do not. But because men are born with a small amount of breast tissue, they can develop breast cancer.\n\n【15】Types of breast cancer diagnosed in men include:\n\n【16】*   **Cancer that begins in the milk ducts (ductal carcinoma).** Nearly all male breast cancer is ductal carcinoma.\n*   **Cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands (lobular carcinoma).** This type is rare in men because they have few lobules in their breast tissue.\n*   **Other types of cancer.** Other, rarer types of breast cancer that can occur in men include Paget's disease of the nipple and inflammatory breast cancer.\n\n【17】### Inherited genes that increase breast cancer risk\n\n【18】Some men inherit abnormal (mutated) genes from their parents that increase the risk of breast cancer. Mutations in one of several genes, especially a gene called _BRCA2_, put you at greater risk of developing breast and prostate cancers.\n\n【19】If you have a strong family history of cancer, discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor may recommend that you meet with a genetic counselor in order to consider genetic testing to see if you carry genes that increase your risk of cancer.\n\n【20】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【21】Factors that increase the risk of male breast cancer include:\n\n【22】*   **Older age.** The risk of breast cancer increases as you age. Male breast cancer is most often diagnosed in men in their 60s.\n*   **Exposure to estrogen.** If you take estrogen-related drugs, such as those used for hormone therapy for prostate cancer, your risk of breast cancer is increased.\n*   **Family history of breast cancer.** If you have a close family member with breast cancer, you have a greater chance of developing the disease.\n*   **Klinefelter's syndrome.** This genetic syndrome occurs when boys are born with more than one copy of the X chromosome. Klinefelter's syndrome causes abnormal development of the testicles. As a result, men with this syndrome produce lower levels of certain male hormones (androgens) and more female hormones (estrogens).\n*   **Liver disease.** Certain conditions, such as cirrhosis of the liver, can reduce male hormones and increase female hormones, increasing your risk of breast cancer.\n*   **Obesity.** Obesity is associated with higher levels of estrogen in the body, which increases the risk of male breast cancer.\n*   **Testicle disease or surgery.** Having inflamed testicles (orchitis) or surgery to remove a testicle (orchiectomy) can increase your risk of male breast cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:31:39", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:31:55", "cost": 16.141}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:31:53", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:31:37"}

Keep from freezing.\n\n【38】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【39】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【40】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【41】Nabilone will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (medicines that make you feel drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds; sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine; prescription pain medicines, including other narcotics; barbiturates; medicine for seizures; muscle relaxants; or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are taking this medicine.\n\n【42】If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose, get emergency help at once. Taking an overdose of this medicine or taking alcohol or CNS depressants with this medicine may cause severe mental effects. Symptoms of overdose include changes in mood; confusion; difficulty in breathing; hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there); nervousness or anxiety (severe); and fast or pounding heartbeat.\n\n【43】This medicine may cause some people to become drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded, or to feel a false sense of well-being. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or are not alert and clearheaded.\n\n【44】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem.\n\n【45】Nabilone may cause dryness of the mouth. For temporary relief, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your medical doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.\n\n【46】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【47】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【48】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【49】#### Symptoms of overdose\n\n【50】1.  Difficulty in breathing\n2.  hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there)\n3.  mental changes (severe)\n4.  nervousness or anxiety (severe)\n\n【51】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention.

In the few days before admission she fell several times due to generalized weakness. She reported not being able to consume food in the last couple of weeks other than liquids as she felt that solid foods were not passing through well — leading to postprandial fullness. She had lost 15 pounds in the last 3 months.\n\n【1】She had limited health care exposure and often declined preventative screening, thus had no known medical history. She took no chronic medications but reported occasionally using ibuprofen for joint pain later on in the hospitalization. She was an active smoker with a 51-pack-year history and consumed 2 alcoholic drinks daily. She had no history of acid reflux, no significant travel history, and no known exposure to _Helicobacter pylori_ . Electrolyte evaluation was only significant for mild hypokalemia. Creatinine and lipase was found to be normal. She denied abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.

Functional dyspepsia would only be considered after a negative workup including normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). She did not have any abdominal pain and had a normal lipase. According to the International Association of Pancreatology and the American Pancreatic Association, two of three criteria must be met for diagnosing acute pancreatitis: upper abdominal pain; lipase more than 3 times upper limit of normal; and imaging criteria with either computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound.\n\n【15】*   Working Group IAP/APA Acute Pancreatitis Guidelines\n\n【16】IAP/APA evidence-based guidelines for the management of acute pancreatitis.\n\n【17】She already does not meet two of the above criteria and thus pancreatitis is unlikely to be contributing to her symptoms. Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is typically defined by epigastric abdominal pain and postprandial vomiting. Although she does not have pain or emesis, exam findings including succussion splash is highly suspicious for GOO and should be investigated further. Signs and symptoms of gastroparesis, which is a delay in gastric emptying, include nausea, early satiety, and vomiting of undigested food. There should be no evidence of GOO to consider this diagnosis. Finally, she may have gallstones but with lack of pain and nausea/vomiting, it is unlikely she has symptomatic gallstone disease. Given lack of medical history and severe cachexia, imaging was considered as there was concern for malignancy or GOO.\n\n【18】*   2.\n\n【19】    **Which _one_ of the following would be the next best appropriate diagnostic step in terms of radiologic imaging if suspecting gastric outlet obstruction?**\n\n【20】    *   a.\n\n【21】        Obtain abdominal ultrasound\n\n【22】    *   b.\n\n【23】        Obtain CT of the abdomen\n\n【24】    *   c.\n\n【25】        Obtain abdominal MRI study\n\n【26】    *   d.\n\n【27】        Obtain abdominal x-ray\n\n【28】    *   e.\n\n【29】        Obtain inpatient positron-emission tomography scan\n\n【30】Abdominal ultrasound would minimize radiation exposure and is a reasonable starting point but would not give enough detail for diagnostic purposes. Given progressive weight loss and anorexia, further imaging is warranted and CT would provide high resolution images of possible intra-abdominal pathologies leading to her symptoms. CT of the abdomen would be the next best appropriate diagnostic step in radiologic imaging for this patient. It can reveal gastric distention and sometimes reveal a cause for GOO. Abdominal MRI would minimize radiation and produce high-resolution images but is more expensive and takes longer to perform than CT. Abdominal x-ray would also be reasonable but again may not give enough diagnostic detail, especially if looking for malignancy. In patients with GOO, it can show an enlarged gastric bubble and a dilated proximal duodenum. If a calcified mass is seen in the right upper quadrant, this can suggest Bouveret syndrome, which is GOO secondary to gallstone impaction in the pylorus or proximal duodenum. A positron-emission tomography scan would be helpful as malignancy was suspected but is also less detailed and more expensive than CT and is less likely to be available as an inpatient option.\n\n【31】CT of her abdomen and pelvis was pursued but no diagnostic abnormalities were reported that could explain her anorexia. Because of her continued inability to tolerate oral intake, EGD was performed, which revealed antral deformity with contraction, scarring, and pinhole opening. The endoscope could not pass through to the duodenum, but mucosal biopsy samples were able to be obtained from the pyloric channel. A second endoscopy was performed under anesthesia support. Endoscopic ultrasound was used and core biopsy samples of the pyloric stricture were obtained. Mucosal biopsy samples of the pyloric channel stricture revealed reactive gastropathy and foveolar hyperplasia without inflammation. Core biopsy samples of the pyloric stricture were negative for malignancy and showed benign smooth muscle with mild chronic inflammation.\n\n【32】*   3.\n\n【33】    **Given her history, which _one_ of the following is likely to be a cause of this patient’s abnormal EGD and pathology findings?**\n\n【34】    *   a.\n\n【35】        Peptic ulcer disease\n\n【36】    *   b.\n\n【37】        Ibuprofen use\n\n【38】    *   c.\n\n【39】        _H. pylori_ infection\n\n【40】    *   d.\n\n【41】        Gastric hypersecretion\n\n【42】    *   e.\n\n【43】        Acetaminophen use\n\n【44】EGD and pathology findings were consistent with pyloric stenosis. Secondary pyloric stenosis can be caused by inflammation in the gastric outlet, which could be caused by peptic ulcerations and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n\n【45】Pyloric stenosis in adults: a clinical and radiological study of 100 consecutive patients.\n\n【46】such as ibuprofen, which was used by the patient and likely the cause of her pyloric stenosis. _H. pylori_ infection may also cause ulcerations in the stomach and first portion of the duodenum — increasing the risk for pyloric stenosis. Other conditions that increase acidity in the stomach, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, may also lead to the development of pyloric stenosis.\n\n【47】Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Clinical presentation in 261 patients.\n\n【48】Acetaminophen use has not been associated with gastric ulcerations and would likely not be a cause of this patient’s pyloric stenosis.\n\n【49】With the gastric obstruction caused by pyloric stenosis, different management options were discussed while taking into account her significantly malnourished state.\n\n【50】*   4.\n\n【51】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ next step in management of this patient?**\n\n【52】    *   a.\n\n【53】        Consult surgery for urgent myotomy\n\n【54】    *   b.\n\n【55】        Place a nasogastric tube for supplemental nutrition\n\n【56】    *   c.\n\n【57】        Place a nasojejunal tube for supplemental nutrition\n\n【58】    *   d.\n\n【59】        Initiate parenteral nutrition\n\n【60】    *   e.\n\n【61】        Endoscopic dilation of pyloric sphincter\n\n【62】Given her severe malnutrition and anorexia, surgery would likely be deferred. A nasogastric tube would not be beneficial as the tube end would be pre-pyloric and with severe GOO, tube feedings can be difficult. It would be reasonable to place a nasojejunal tube for supplemental nutrition as treatment options for her pyloric stenosis are considered; this was performed endoscopically in our patient. Parenteral nutrition could be considered if the patient is not able to tolerate the tube feedings but ideally feeding through the gastrointestinal tract would be preferred. Dilation of the pyloric sphincter could be considered as a treatment option, but first it would be important to start supplemental nutrition for this patient in case dilation is not able to be performed promptly.\n\n【63】To place a nasojejunal tube in the patient, a guidewire was inserted into the jejunum and a 12-French nasojejunal tube was advanced over the wire. Placement was confirmed with fluoroscopy. A pediatric scope was used to traverse the pyloric channel stricture. After plans for nutrition optimization with nasojejunal tube feedings were placed, treatment options for her pyloric stenosis were considered.\n\n【64】*   5.\n\n【65】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most_ preferred treatment of pyloric stenosis in this patient at this point?**\n\n【66】    *   a.\n\n【67】        Gastrectomy\n\n【68】    *   b.\n\n【69】        Pyloromyotomy\n\n【70】    *   c.\n\n【71】        Pyloroplasty\n\n【72】    *   d.\n\n【73】        Endoscopic dilation\n\n【74】    *   e.\n\n【75】        Total parenteral nutrition\n\n【76】At this point, the patient’s severely malnourished state made her a poor surgical candidate for surgical options including gastrectomy, pyloromyotomy, and pyloroplasty. Pyloromyotomy uses an incision in the wall of the pylorus and the lining of the pylorus bulges through the incision making an opening from the stomach to the duodenum; this procedure is used to treat hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in infancy. Pyloroplasty is a surgical procedure used to widen the pylorus so that gastric contents can empty in the duodenum and would be the most favorable treatment option if the patient was not so malnourished. The thickened pylorus muscle is cut so that it widens and is closed by a technique that keeps the pylorus open. Pyloroplasty has a more favorable risk profile and is often preferred over pyloromyotomy.\n\n【77】Laparoscopic pyloroplasty in idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in an adult.\n\n【78】One study showed that endoscopic dilation, removal of risk factors, and gastric acid suppression led to long-term remission with average follow-up being 43 months.\n\n【79】Long-term follow-up of patients with gastric outlet obstruction related to peptic ulcer disease treated with endoscopic balloon dilatation and drug therapy.\n\n【80】It can be associated with high recurrence rate of stenosis and eventually some patients may need surgical intervention. Dilation was preferred for our patient as surgical options were limited due to her nutritional state. Total parenteral nutrition could be pursued if nasogastric or nasojejunal feeding were not possible before other management options.\n\n【81】Because of the nature of her pin-hole-sized pyloric channel and malnourishment, fluoroscopy-assisted balloon dilation was used. After the procedure, she was instructed to avoid all NSAID use. We were able to use nasojejunal feedings and eventually transitioned her to oral nutrition; therefore, total parenteral nutrition was not pursued. At her 3-month follow-up visit, she was tolerating a general diet and was slowly gaining weight.\n\n【82】Discussion\n----------\n\n【83】Pyloric stenosis is a benign disorder that results from hypertrophy of the circular muscle fibers of the pylorus sphincter. Acquired pyloric stenosis is uncommon and can be associated with malignancy, peptic or duodenal ulcer disease, bezoars, and intra-abdominal adhesions.\n\n【84】Adult hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.\n\n【85】Adult hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and gastric carcinoma.\n\n【86】Post-operative extrinsic pyloric stenosis.\n\n【87】Pyloric stenosis in adults.\n\n【88】Historically, pyloric stenosis was most commonly attributed to excess gastric acid, but with the advent of proton pump inhibitors, malignancy should be strongly suspected in adult pyloric stenosis. Our patient had no history of peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, and biopsy specimens were negative for _H. pylori_ . Endoscopic biopsy samples also did not reveal malignancy. She did have a history of ibuprofen use, which would be consistent with her biopsy findings of reactive gastropathy and foveolar hyperplasia; these findings can also be seen in duodenogastric bile reflux. With prolonged use of NSAIDs, her pyloric stenosis likely formed a GOO over time leading to limited oral intake and resultant severe malnutrition.\n\n【89】Abdominal imaging can sometimes detect distal gastric thickening, but it is important to evaluate with endoscopy as biopsy samples are needed to rule out malignancy as well as detect _H. pylori_ infection. Our patient’s history was fairly benign and was lacking history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, travel history outside of United States, and peptic ulcer disease. We were highly concerned for underlying malignant process and biopsy samples were essential in our evaluation. She initially had underreported her use of ibuprofen for pain and was elicited later in her course. The pathogenesis of pyloric stenosis in the setting of NSAID use was likely due to the caustic effect on these agents, leading to fibrosis.\n\n【90】NSAID-induced pyloric stenosis leading to oesophageal intramucosal dissection.\n\n【91】There are multiple treatment options for adult-onset pyloric stenosis including endoscopic dilation, pyloromyotomy, pyloroplasty, or gastrectomy. Pyloroplasty performed laparoscopically has a favorable risk profile but is a more invasive option than endoscopic dilation.\n\n【92】Long-term follow-up of patients with gastric outlet obstruction related to peptic ulcer disease treated with endoscopic balloon dilatation and drug therapy.\n\n【93】If patients are high-risk surgical candidates or prefer to attempt nonsurgical management first, then endoscopic dilations would be a preferred route of therapy.\n\n【94】Long-term follow-up of patients with gastric outlet obstruction related to peptic ulcer disease treated with endoscopic balloon dilatation and drug therapy.\n\n【95】Unfortunately, the long-term success of endoscopic dilation has been reported to be poor but can be used while optimizing the patient for surgical options.\n\n【96】Dilation therapy for gastric outlet obstruction.

Allergic reactions can be caused by eating wheat and also, in some cases, by inhaling wheat flour.\n\n【2】Avoiding wheat is the primary treatment for wheat allergy, but that isn't always as easy as it sounds. Wheat is found in many foods, including some you might not suspect, such as soy sauce, ice cream and hot dogs. Medications may be necessary to manage allergic reactions if you accidentally eat wheat.\n\n【3】Wheat allergy sometimes is confused with celiac disease, but these conditions differ. Wheat allergy occurs when your body produces antibodies to proteins found in wheat. In celiac disease, a specific protein in wheat — gluten — causes a different kind of abnormal immune system reaction.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】A child or adult with wheat allergy is likely to develop signs and symptoms within minutes to hours after eating something containing wheat. Wheat allergy signs and symptoms include:\n\n【6】*   Swelling, itching or irritation of the mouth or throat\n*   Hives, itchy rash or swelling of the skin\n*   Nasal congestion\n*   Headache\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Cramps, nausea or vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Anaphylaxis\n\n【7】### Anaphylaxis\n\n【8】For some people, wheat allergy may cause a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. In addition to other signs and symptoms of wheat allergy, anaphylaxis may cause:\n\n【9】*   Swelling or tightness of the throat\n*   Chest pain or tightness\n*   Severe difficulty breathing\n*   Trouble swallowing\n*   Pale, blue skin color\n*   Dizziness or fainting\n\n【10】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【11】If someone shows signs of anaphylaxis, call 911 or your local emergency number. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires immediate care.\n\n【12】If you suspect that you or your child is allergic to wheat or another food, see your doctor.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】If you have wheat allergy, exposure to a wheat protein primes your immune system for an allergic reaction. You can develop an allergy to any of the four classes of wheat proteins — albumin, globulin, gliadin and gluten.\n\n【15】### Sources of wheat proteins\n\n【16】Some sources of wheat proteins are obvious, such as bread, but all wheat proteins — and gluten in particular — can be found in many prepared foods and even in some cosmetics, bath products and play dough. Foods that may include wheat proteins include:\n\n【17】*   Breads and bread crumbs\n*   Cakes, muffins and cookies\n*   Breakfast cereals\n*   Pasta\n*   Couscous\n*   Farina\n*   Semolina\n*   Spelt\n*   Crackers\n*   Hydrolyzed vegetable protein\n*   Soy sauce\n*   Meat products, such as hot dogs\n*   Dairy products, such as ice cream\n*   Natural flavorings\n*   Gelatinized starch\n*   Modified food starch\n*   Vegetable gum\n\n【18】If you have wheat allergy, it's possible you might also be allergic to barley, oats and rye. Unless you're allergic to grains other than wheat, though, the recommended wheat-free diet is less restrictive than a gluten-free diet.\n\n【19】### Wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis\n\n【20】Some people with wheat allergy develop symptoms only if they exercise within a few hours after eating wheat. Exercise-induced changes in your body either trigger an allergic reaction or worsen an immune system response to a wheat protein. This condition usually results in life-threatening anaphylaxis.\n\n【21】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【22】Certain factors may put you at greater risk of developing wheat allergy:\n\n【23】*   **Family history.** You're at increased risk of allergy to wheat or other foods if your parents have food allergies or other allergies, such as asthma.\n*   **Age.** Wheat allergy is most common in babies and toddlers, who have immature immune and digestive systems. Most children outgrow wheat allergy by 16, but adults can develop it, often as a cross-sensitivity to grass pollen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:40:33", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:40:43", "cost": 9.737}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:40:43", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:40:32"}

Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), angina, stroke, heart failure, revascularization, and new-onset diabetes.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Our search yielded 106 randomized trials that enrolled 254,301 patients. Compared with placebo, ACEis but not ARBs reduced the outcomes of all-cause mortality (ACEis vs placebo: relative risk \\[RR\\], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80-1.00; ARBs vs placebo: RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.96-1.06; _P_ <sub>interaction </sub> \\=.04), cardiovascular death (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.99 and RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.92-1.14; _P_ <sub>interaction </sub> \\=.05), and MI (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78-0.90 and RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.85-1.03; _P_ <sub>interaction </sub> \\=.06). The meta-regression analysis revealed that the difference between ACEis and ARBs compared with placebo was due to a higher placebo event rate in the ACEis trials (most of these trials were conducted a decade earlier than the ARB trials) for the outcome of all-cause mortality ( _P_ \\=.001), cardiovascular death ( _P_ <.001), and MI ( _P_ \\=.02). Sensitivity analyses restricted to trials published after 2000 revealed similar outcomes with ACEis vs placebo and ARBs vs placebo ( _P_ <sub>interaction </sub> \\>.05). Head-to-head comparison trials of ARBs vs ACEis exhibited no difference in outcomes except for a lower risk of drug withdrawal due to adverse effects with ARBs (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.81).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In patients without heart failure, evidence from placebo-controlled trials (restricted to trials after 2000), active controlled trials, and head-to-head randomized trials all suggest ARBs to be as efficacious and safe as ACEis, with the added advantage of better tolerability.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACEi ( angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ), ARB ( angiotensin receptor blocker ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), ESRD ( end-stage renal disease ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), RAS ( renin-angiotensin system ), RR ( relative risk )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:32:08", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:32:18", "cost": 10.336}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:32:17", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:32:06"}

Cells in the choroid plexus produce the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid, also known as CSF. As the cancer grows, it can cause too much CSF in the brain. This can lead to symptoms such as irritability, nausea or vomiting, and headaches.\n\n【3】Treatment and chance of recovery depend on many factors. These include the tumor's size, location, whether it has spread, and your child's age and general health.\n\n【4】### Diagnosis\n\n【5】Choroid plexus carcinoma happens the most in children under 2 years old. Tests and procedures used to diagnose choroid plexus carcinoma include:\n\n【6】*   **Neurological exam.** During this exam, your child's vision, hearing, balance, coordination and reflexes are tested. This can help show which part of the brain might be affected by the tumor.\n*   **Brain imaging tests.** Tests to create images of your child's brain may include MRI and CT. An MRI also helps your child's health care team to plan the surgery.\n*   **Genetic tests.** Some choroid plexus carcinomas are linked to certain genetic changes passed down in families. Tests to identify certain genes are available. Ask your child's health care provider about genetic testing and counseling.\n\n【7】Treatment in children usually differs from treatment in adults. If your child receives a diagnosis of choroid plexus carcinoma, ask your health care provider to refer you to a specialist who cares for children with brain tumors. The management of this cancer is complex. Seek out a medical center that has experience with this cancer and can offer the latest treatment options for your child.\n\n【8】### Treatment\n\n【9】Treatment of a choroid plexus carcinoma is often surgery followed by chemotherapy, radiation therapy or both.\n\n【10】*   **Surgery.** The goal of surgery is to remove all of the cancer, when possible. But because delicate and important structures may be nearby, surgeons sometimes can't get all the cancer cells. Other treatments are often needed after surgery.\n\n【11】    Surgery can help relieve the symptoms of having too much fluid in the brain, which is also called hydrocephalus. Sometimes a temporary drain is put in during surgery to drain more fluid.\n\n【12】*   **Chemotherapy.** Chemotherapy uses medicines to kill cancer cells. It may be used in addition to surgery and radiation therapy to help control the cancer. Sometimes chemotherapy is done at the same time as radiation therapy.\n*   **Radiation therapy.** Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams to kill tumor cells. The energy can come from X-rays, protons and other sources. Advanced technologies help treat the cancer effectively while sparing healthy tissues. Radiation may be used after surgery, even if the entire tumor was successfully removed. Radiation also may be used later if the tumor grows back.\n*   **Clinical trials.** Clinical trials are studies of new treatments. These studies provide a chance to try the latest treatments. The risk of side effects might not be known. Each trial has strict requirements that each person must meet in order to be in the trial.

Pooling such reports is widely considered a promising research strategy and the subject of several ongoing investigations, including the National Cancer Institute's Exceptional Responders Initiative. All articles were read in full, including relevant references. We extracted clinical characteristics of exceptional or super responders, including age, tumor type, drug, genetic mutations, depth of response, duration of response, number of previous lines of therapy, duration of response to a previous line of therapy, and the number of patients treated similarly to identify the exceptional case.

Cardiac catheterization gives doctors important information about the heart muscle, heart valves and blood vessels in the heart.\n\n【2】During cardiac catheterization, doctors can do different heart tests, deliver treatments, or remove a piece of heart tissue for examination. Some heart disease treatments — such as coronary angioplasty and coronary stenting — are done using cardiac catheterization.\n\n【3】Usually, you'll be awake during cardiac catheterization but be given medications to help you relax. Recovery time for a cardiac catheterization is quick, and there's a low risk of complications.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Cardiac catheterization is a common procedure done to diagnose or treat a variety of heart problems. For example, your doctor may recommend this procedure if you have irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), chest pain (angina) or heart valve problems, among other things.\n\n【6】Cardiac catheterization may be done during the diagnosis or treatment of:\n\n【7】*   Coronary artery disease\n*   Congenital heart disease\n*   Heart failure\n*   Heart valve disease\n*   Microvascular heart disease\n\n【8】During a cardiac catheterization, a doctor can:\n\n【9】*   Locate narrowing or blockages in the blood vessels that could cause chest pain (angiogram)\n*   Measure pressure and oxygen levels in different parts of the heart (hemodynamic assessment)\n*   See how well the heart pumps blood (right or left ventriculogram)\n*   Take a sample of tissue from your heart (biopsy)\n*   Diagnose heart problems present from birth (congenital heart defects)\n*   Diagnose heart valve disease\n*   Examine the blood vessels for blood clots\n\n【10】Cardiac catherization may be done at the same time as other heart procedures, such as:\n\n【11】*   Widening a narrowed artery (angioplasty) with or without stent placement\n*   Treating irregular heart rhythms with cold or heat energy (cardiac ablation)\n*   Closing holes in the heart and repairing other congenital heart defects\n*   Opening narrowed heart valves (balloon valvuloplasty)\n*   Repairing or replacing heart valves (heart valve surgery)\n\n【12】Risks\n-----\n\n【13】As with most procedures done on the heart and blood vessels, cardiac catheterization has some risks. Major complications are rare, though.\n\n【14】Possible risks of cardiac catheterization are:\n\n【15】*   Bleeding\n*   Blood clots\n*   Bruising\n*   Damage to the artery, heart or the area where the catheter was inserted\n*   Heart attack\n*   Infection\n*   Irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\n*   Kidney damage\n*   Stroke\n*   Allergic reactions to the contrast dye or medication\n\n【16】If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, tell your doctor before having a cardiac catheterization.\n\n【17】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【18】If your doctor recommended a cardiac catheterization, you'll need to follow some steps to prepare for the procedure.\n\n【19】*   **Don't eat or drink anything for at least six hours before your test, or as directed by your doctor.** Having food or liquids in your stomach can increase the risk of complications from anesthesia. Ask the doctor or nurse if you should take your medications with a small amount of water. If you have diabetes, ask for instructions about diabetes medications and insulin. You'll usually be able to have something to eat and drink soon after the procedure.\n*   **Tell your doctor if you take blood thinners.** Your doctor may recommend that you stop medications that may thin your blood, such as warfarin (Jantoven), aspirin, apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto).\n*   **Tell your doctor if you take diabetes medications.** Certain dyes used during some cardiac catheterization procedures can increase the risk of side effects of some diabetes medications, including metformin.\n*   **Take all your medications and supplements with you to the test.** It's best if you take the original bottles so that your doctor will know the exact dose you take.\n\n【20】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【21】### Before the procedure\n\n【22】Before a cardiac catheterization, you will likely have your blood pressure and pulse checked. You may be asked to use the toilet to empty your bladder.\n\n【23】You may be asked to remove dentures and any jewelry, especially necklaces that could interfere with pictures of the heart.\n\n【24】Sticky patches (electrodes) will be placed on your chest to monitor your heartbeat before, during and after the procedure.\n\n【25】A nurse or technician may shave the hair from the site where the catheter will be inserted.\n\n【26】### During the procedure\n\n【27】Cardiac catheterization is usually done in the hospital in a room with special X-ray and imaging machines. Like an operating room, the cardiac catheterization lab is a sterile area.\n\n【28】A specialist will insert an IV into your forearm or hand and give you a medication called a sedative to help you relax. The amount of sedation needed for the procedure depends on your health conditions and why you're having the procedure. You may be fully awake or lightly sedated, or you may be given general anesthesia (fully asleep).\n\n【29】During cardiac catheterization, one or more catheters are passed through a blood vessel in the groin, wrist or neck, depending on the reason for the procedure, and guided to the heart.\n\n【30】The area where the catheter will be inserted is numbed, and then a small cut is made to access the blood vessel. A plastic sheath is passed into this opening to allow your doctor to insert the catheter.\n\n【31】What happens next depends on why you're having a cardiac catheterization. These are some of the common uses for cardiac catheterization:\n\n【32】*   **Coronary angiogram.** During this test to check for blockages in the arteries leading to the heart, a dye is injected through the catheter, and X-ray images of the heart arteries are taken. The dye helps blood vessels show up more clearly on the X-ray images. In a coronary angiogram, the catheter is usually first placed in the artery in the groin or wrist.\n*   **Cardiac ablation.** In this procedure, a doctor uses heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in your heart to block abnormal electrical signals and restore a normal heartbeat.\n*   **Right heart catheterization.** This procedure checks the pressure and blood flow in the right side of the heart. A catheter is inserted in the vein in the neck or groin. The catheter has special sensors in it to measure the pressure and blood flow in your heart.\n*   **Balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting.** This procedure is used to open a narrowed artery in or near the heart. The catheter can be inserted in either the wrist or groin for this procedure.\n\n【33】    The catheter is guided to the narrowed artery. Then, a smaller balloon catheter is inserted through the flexible catheter and inflated at the narrowed area to open it. Often, the doctor will also place a mesh coil called a stent at the narrowed part to help keep the artery open.\n\n【34】*   **Heart biopsy.** If the doctor is taking a sample of heart tissue (biopsy), the catheter will usually be placed in the vein in the neck. Less often, it may be placed in the groin. A catheter with a small, jaw-like tip is used to obtain a small piece of tissue from the heart.\n*   **Repair of congenital heart defects.** If the doctor is closing a hole in the heart, such as an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale, catheters may be inserted in both the arteries and veins of the groin and neck. A device is then inserted into the heart to close the hole.\n*   **Balloon valvuloplasty.** This procedure is done to widen a narrowed heart valve. The placement of the catheters depends on the specific type of heart valve problem. A catheter is threaded across the valve. A balloon is then inflated to make the valve open more easily.\n*   **Heart valve replacement.** A catheter is used to implant an artificial valve in the heart to replace a narrowed heart valve. For example, a procedure called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) uses a catheter to replace a faulty aortic heart valve.\n\n【35】If you're awake during a cardiac catherization procedure, you may be asked to take deep breaths, hold your breath, cough or place your arms in various positions throughout the procedure. The table may be tilted at times, but you'll have a safety strap on to keep you on the table.\n\n【36】Threading the catheter shouldn't be painful, and you shouldn't feel it moving through your body. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any discomfort.\n\n【37】### After the procedure\n\n【38】You'll likely spend several hours in a recovery room after the procedure while the sedation wears off.\n\n【39】After you leave the recovery room, you'll usually be moved to a regular hospital or outpatient room. After your catheter is removed, a technician or nurse will apply pressure to the insertion sites. If the catheter was placed in the groin area, you may need to lie flat for several hours after the procedure to avoid serious bleeding and to allow the artery to heal.\n\n【40】How long you need to stay in the hospital depends on your overall health and the reason for the catheterization.\n\n【41】The area where the catheter was inserted may feel sore for a few days. Tell your doctor if you have any bleeding or new or increased swelling or pain at or near the access site.\n\n【42】Results\n-------\n\n【43】If cardiac catheterization was done to diagnose a heart condition, your doctor should explain the results to you.\n\n【44】If your doctor finds a blockage during cardiac catheterization, he or she may treat the blockage with or without a stent placement right away so that you won't need to have another catheterization procedure. Your doctor should discuss whether this is a possibility before the procedure begins.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:11:24", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:11:39", "cost": 14.679}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:11:38", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:11:23"}

Inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, diagnosis of CAD, referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program, and available baseline exercise test results. Primary outcome was death from any cause. Feature selection was performed using supervised and unsupervised ML techniques. The final prognostic model used the survival tree (ST) algorithm.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】From the cohort of 13,362 patients (60±11 years; 2400 \\[18%\\] women), 1577 died during a median follow-up of 8 years (interquartile range, 4 to 13 years), with an estimated survival of 67% up to 21 years. Feature selection revealed age and peak metabolic equivalents (METs) as the features with the greatest importance for mortality prediction. Using these 2 features, the ST generated a long-term prediction with a C-index of 0.729 by splitting patients in 8 clusters with different survival probabilities ( _P_ <.001). The ST root node was split by peak METs of 6.15 or less or more than 6.15, and each patient’s subgroup was further split by age or other peak METs cut points.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Applying ML techniques, age and maximal exercise capacity accurately predict mortality in patients with CAD and outperform variables commonly used for decision-making in clinical practice. A novel and simple prognostic model was established, and maximal exercise capacity was further suggested to be one of the most powerful predictors of mortality in CAD.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AUC ( area under the curve ), CAD ( coronary artery disease ), CR ( cardiac rehabilitation ), GXT ( graded exercise test ), HR ( heart rate ), LH ( logistic hazard ), LVEF ( left ventricular ejection fraction ), MET ( metabolic equivalent ), ML ( machine learning ), RSF ( random survival forest ), SFS ( sequential forward selection ), ST ( survival tree )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:33:10", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:33:14", "cost": 4.357}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:33:12", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:33:04"}

But vaccination is the best way to prevent rotavirus infection.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】A rotavirus infection usually starts within two days of exposure to the virus. Early symptoms are a fever and vomiting, followed by three to seven days of watery diarrhea. The infection can cause abdominal pain as well.\n\n【6】In healthy adults, a rotavirus infection may cause only mild signs and symptoms or none at all.\n\n【7】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【8】Call your child's doctor if your child:\n\n【9】*   Has diarrhea for more than 24 hours\n*   Vomits frequently\n*   Has black or tarry stool or stool containing blood or pus\n*   Has a temperature of 102 F (38.9 C) or higher\n*   Seems tired, irritable or in pain\n*   Has signs or symptoms of dehydration, including dry mouth, crying without tears, little or no urination, unusual sleepiness, or unresponsiveness\n\n【10】If you're an adult, call your doctor if you:\n\n【11】*   Can't keep liquids down for 24 hours\n*   Have diarrhea for more than two days\n*   Have blood in your vomit or bowel movements\n*   Have a temperature higher than 103 F (39.4 C)\n*   Have signs or symptoms of dehydration, including excessive thirst, dry mouth, little or no urination, severe weakness, dizziness on standing, or lightheadedness\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】Rotavirus is present in an infected person's stool two days before symptoms appear and for up to 10 days after symptoms lessen. The virus spreads easily through hand-to-mouth contact throughout this time — even if the infected person doesn't have symptoms.\n\n【14】If you have rotavirus and you don't wash your hands after using the toilet — or your child has rotavirus and you don't wash your hands after changing your child's diaper or helping your child use the toilet — the virus can spread to anything you touch, including food, toys and utensils. If another person touches your unwashed hands or a contaminated object and then touches his or her mouth, an infection may follow. The virus can remain infectious on surfaces that haven't been disinfected for weeks or months.\n\n【15】It's possible to be infected with rotavirus more than once, even if you've been vaccinated. However, repeat infections are typically less severe.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】Rotavirus infections are common in children ages 3 to 35 months — particularly those who spend time in child care settings. Older adults and adults caring for young children have an increased risk of infection as well.\n\n【18】In the United States, the risk of rotavirus is highest in winter and spring.\n\n【19】Complications\n-------------\n\n【20】Severe diarrhea can lead to dehydration, particularly in young children. Left untreated, dehydration can become a life-threatening condition regardless of its cause.\n\n【21】Prevention\n----------\n\n【22】To reduce the spread of rotavirus, wash your hands thoroughly and often — especially after you use the toilet, change your child's diaper or help your child use the toilet. But even strict hand-washing doesn't offer any guarantees. And commonly used alcohol-based hand sanitizers have little effect on rotavirus.\n\n【23】The World Health Organization recommends that all countries give infants a rotavirus vaccine. There are two vaccines available:\n\n【24】*   **RotaTeq.** This vaccine is given by mouth in three doses, often at 2, 4 and 6 months. The vaccine isn't approved for use in older children or adults.\n*   **Rotarix.** This vaccine is a liquid given in two doses to infants at ages 2 months and 4 months.\n\n【25】The vaccines are considered safe and effective, and studies show that they prevent thousands of children from developing rotavirus every year. However, rarely, they can cause a part of the intestine to fold back on itself (intussusception), resulting in possibly life-threatening intestinal blockage.\n\n【26】Children who have had intussusception are more likely to have it again after receiving the rotavirus vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that the vaccine not be given to children who have a history of intussusception.\n\n【27】For children who don't have a history of intussusception, there is a very small risk that it can develop after the rotavirus vaccine is given. Even so, the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks.\n\n【28】If your child has stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in his or her stool, or a change in bowel movements after getting the rotavirus vaccine, contact your doctor immediately.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:01:45", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:02:04", "cost": 18.752}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:02:03", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:01:44"}

Demographics, medical comorbidities, thyroid function laboratory data, psychotropic medications, presence of primary thyroid disorder, thyroid hormone replacement (T4 and/or T3), and mood disorder diagnoses (using International Classification of Diseases, 10  version, Clinical Modifications codes) were extracted electronically. The primary outcome, CRD, was defined as a PHQ-9 score greater than or equal to 10 _._ Logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between TSH categories (low ≤0.3 mIU/L; normal >0.3-4.2 mIU/L; high >4.2 mIU/L) and CRD.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The cohort included 29,034 patients, mean age 51.4 years, 65% females, 89.9% White, and a mean body mass index of 29.9 kg/m  . The mean ± standard deviation for TSH was 3.0±8.5 mIU/L, and the mean PHQ-9 score was 6.3±6.2. After adjustment, the odds of CRD were significantly higher among the low TSH category (odds ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.18-1.57; _P_ <.001) compared with the normal TSH category, especially in people 70 years of age or younger compared with people older than 70 years of age. Subgroup analysis did not show an increase in odds of CRD among patients with subclinical/overt hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism (after adjustment).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In this large population-based cross-sectional study, we report that low TSH was associated with higher odds of depression.

You may feel this burning on your tongue, gums, lips, inside of your cheeks, roof of your mouth or large areas of your whole mouth. The feeling of burning can be severe, as if you injured your mouth with a very hot drink.\n\n【2】Burning mouth syndrome usually comes on suddenly, but it can develop slowly over time. Often the specific cause can't be found. Although that makes treatment more challenging, working closely with your health care team can help you reduce symptoms.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Symptoms of burning mouth syndrome may include:\n\n【5】*   A burning or scalding feeling that most commonly affects your tongue, but also may affect your lips, gums, roof of your mouth, throat or whole mouth.\n*   A feeling of dry mouth with increased thirst.\n*   Taste changes in your mouth, such as a bitter or metallic taste.\n*   Loss of taste.\n*   Tingling, stinging or numbness in your mouth.\n\n【6】The discomfort from burning mouth syndrome can have several different patterns. It may:\n\n【7】*   Happen every day, with little discomfort when waking up, but become worse as the day goes on.\n*   Start as soon as you wake up and last all day.\n*   Come and go.\n\n【8】Whatever pattern of mouth discomfort you have, burning mouth syndrome may last for months to years. In rare cases, symptoms may suddenly go away on their own or happen less often. Sometimes the burning feeling may be briefly relieved during eating or drinking.\n\n【9】Burning mouth syndrome usually doesn't cause any physical changes to your tongue or mouth that can be seen.\n\n【10】### When to see a doctor\n\n【11】If you have discomfort, burning or soreness of your tongue, lips, gums or other areas of your mouth, see your health care provider or dentist. They may need to work together to help pinpoint a cause and come up with an effective treatment plan.\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】The cause of burning mouth syndrome may be primary or secondary.\n\n【14】### Primary burning mouth syndrome\n\n【15】When the cause can't be found, the condition is called primary or idiopathic burning mouth syndrome. Some research suggests that primary burning mouth syndrome is related to problems with the nerves involved with taste and pain.\n\n【16】### Secondary burning mouth syndrome\n\n【17】Sometimes burning mouth syndrome is caused by an underlying medical condition. In these cases, it's called secondary burning mouth syndrome.\n\n【18】Underlying problems that may be linked to secondary burning mouth syndrome include:\n\n【19】*   **Dry mouth,** which can be caused by some medicines, health problems, problems with the glands that make saliva or the side effects of cancer treatment.\n*   **Other oral conditions,** such as a fungal infection of the mouth called oral thrush, an inflammatory condition called oral lichen planus or a condition called geographic tongue that gives the tongue a maplike appearance.\n*   **Not getting enough nutrients,** such as a lack of iron, zinc, folate (vitamin B-9), thiamin (vitamin B-1), riboflavin (vitamin B-2), pyridoxine (vitamin B-6) and cobalamin (vitamin B-12).\n*   **Allergies or reactions** to foods, food flavorings, other food additives, fragrances or dyes, dental materials, or mouth care products.\n*   **Reflux of stomach acid** that enters your mouth from your stomach, also called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n*   **Certain medicines,** especially high blood pressure medicines.\n*   **Oral habits,** such as pushing your tongue against your teeth, biting the tip of your tongue, and grinding or clenching your teeth.\n*   **Endocrine disorders,** such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid known as hypothyroidism.\n*   **A very irritated mouth,** which may result from brushing your tongue too much or too hard, using abrasive toothpastes, overusing mouthwashes, or having too many acidic foods or drinks. Dentures that don't fit well may cause irritation that can make symptoms worse.\n*   **Psychological issues,** such as anxiety, depression or stress.\n\n【20】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【21】Burning mouth syndrome is uncommon. However, your risk may be greater if you're:\n\n【22】*   Female.\n*   In perimenopause or you're postmenopausal.\n*   Over the age of 50.\n*   A smoker.\n\n【23】Burning mouth syndrome usually starts suddenly, for no known reason. But certain factors may increase your risk of developing burning mouth syndrome, including:\n\n【24】*   Recent illness.\n*   Some long-term medical conditions such as fibromyalgia, Parkinson's disease, autoimmune disorders and neuropathy.\n*   Previous dental work.\n*   Allergic reactions to food.\n*   Certain medicines.\n*   Traumatic life events.\n*   Stress.\n*   Anxiety.\n*   Depression.\n\n【25】Complications\n-------------\n\n【26】Complications that burning mouth syndrome may cause are mainly related to discomfort, such as problems falling asleep or difficulty eating. Long-term cases involving a lot of discomfort also could lead to anxiety or depression.\n\n【27】Prevention\n----------\n\n【28】There's no known way to prevent burning mouth syndrome. But you may be able to reduce your discomfort by not using tobacco, limiting acidic or spicy foods, not drinking carbonated beverages, and using stress management methods. Or these measures may prevent your discomfort from feeling worse.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:20:39", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:21:08", "cost": 29.206}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:21:07", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:20:38"}

These conditions may also be called inborn errors of metabolism.\n\n【2】Metabolism is the complex set of chemical reactions that your body uses to maintain life, including energy production. Special enzymes break down food or certain chemicals so your body can use them right away for fuel or store them. Also, certain chemical processes break down substances that your body no longer needs, or make those it lacks.\n\n【3】When these chemical processes don't work properly due to a hormone or enzyme deficiency, a metabolic disorder occurs.

Patient medical records were abstracted for pertinent clinical data, glucocorticoid use, and final diagnoses. Sensitivities, specificities, predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated for the association of the various clinical findings and the presence of a positive biopsy result. Graphic and arithmetic models were constructed to predict positive temporal artery biopsy results.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】During the 10-year interval, 1113 patients had temporal artery biopsy. The results were positive for GCA in 373 patients (33.5%) and negative in 740 (66.5%). Twenty percent of all patients were taking glucocorticoids at the time of biopsy. The presence of jaw claudication had a positive predictive value of 78. Combinations of jaw claudication with new headache, scalp tenderness, and decreased vision had still higher values. Positive likelihood ratios in patients with these combinations and in those with diplopia were greater than 3. A normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate in patients not taking corticosteroids provided a high negative likelihood ratio of 40. An arithmetic equation provided the probability of a positive biopsy result on a continuous scale using 6 variables identified by logistic regression. Patients with a greater than 80% chance of a positive biopsy result and those with less than a 10% chance were identified.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】Positive predictive values, likelihood ratios, and an arithmetic formula identify patients who have an increased or decreased chance of a positive temporal artery biopsy result. Use of these methods to determine early initiation of glucocorticoid therapy before temporal artery biopsy or deferral until after biopsy may help reduce both vascular complications of GCA and adverse effects of corticosteroids.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】ESR ( erythrocyte sedimentation rate ), GCA ( giant cell arteritis ), LR ( likelihood ratio ), NPV ( negative predictive value ), PPV ( positive predictive value )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:29:39", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:30:02", "cost": 22.253}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:30:02", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:29:39"}

It happens when the nerve impulses to your voice box (larynx) are disrupted. This results in paralysis of the vocal cord muscles.\n\n【2】Vocal cord paralysis can make it hard to speak and even breathe. That's because your vocal cords, also called vocal folds, do more than just produce sound. They also protect your airway by preventing food, drink and even your saliva from entering your windpipe (trachea) and causing you to choke.\n\n【3】Possible causes of vocal cord paralysis include nerve damage during surgery, viral infections and certain cancers. Treatment for vocal cord paralysis usually involves surgery, and sometimes voice therapy.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Your vocal cords are two flexible bands of muscle tissue that sit at the entrance to the windpipe (trachea). When you speak, the bands come together and vibrate to make sound. The rest of the time, the vocal cords are relaxed in an open position so that you can breathe.\n\n【6】In most cases of vocal cord paralysis, only one vocal cord is paralyzed. Paralysis of both of your vocal cords is a rare but serious condition. This can cause difficulties with speech and significant problems with breathing and swallowing.\n\n【7】Signs and symptoms of vocal cord paralysis may include:\n\n【8】*   A breathy quality to the voice\n*   Hoarseness\n*   Noisy breathing\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Loss of vocal pitch\n*   Choking or coughing while swallowing food, drink or saliva\n*   The need to take frequent breaths while speaking\n*   Inability to speak loudly\n*   Loss of your gag reflex\n*   Ineffective coughing\n*   Frequent throat clearing\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】If you have unexplained hoarseness that lasts for more than 2 to 4 weeks, or if you notice any unexplained voice changes or discomfort, contact your health care provider.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】In vocal cord paralysis, the nerve impulses to your voice box (larynx) are disrupted, causing paralysis of the muscle. Health care providers often can't determine the exact cause of vocal cord paralysis. But some known causes may include:\n\n【13】*   **Injury to the vocal cord during surgery.** Surgery on or near the neck or upper chest can result in damage to the nerves that serve the voice box. Surgeries that carry a risk of damage include surgeries to the thyroid or parathyroid glands, esophagus, neck, and chest.\n*   **Neck or chest injury.** Trauma to the neck or chest may injure the nerves that serve the vocal cords or the voice box itself.\n*   **Stroke.** A stroke interrupts blood flow in the brain and may damage the part of the brain that sends messages to the voice box.\n*   **Tumors.** Tumors, both cancerous and noncancerous, can grow in or around the muscles, cartilage or nerves controlling the function of the voice box and can cause vocal cord paralysis.\n*   **Infections.** Some infections, such as Lyme disease, Epstein-Barr virus and herpes, can cause inflammation and directly damage the nerves in the voice box. There's some evidence that infection with COVID-19 may cause vocal cord paralysis.\n*   **Neurological conditions.** Certain neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease, can lead to vocal cord paralysis.\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】Factors that may increase your risk of developing vocal cord paralysis include:\n\n【16】*   **Undergoing throat or chest surgery.** People who need surgery on their thyroid, throat or upper chest have an increased risk of vocal cord nerve damage. Sometimes the breathing tubes used in surgery or to help you breathe if you're having serious respiratory trouble can damage the vocal cord nerves.\n*   **Having a neurological condition.** People with certain neurological conditions — such as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis — are more likely to develop vocal cord weakness or paralysis.\n\n【17】Complications\n-------------\n\n【18】Breathing problems associated with vocal cord paralysis may be so mild that you just have a hoarse-sounding voice, or they can be so serious that they're life-threatening.\n\n【19】Because vocal cord paralysis keeps the opening to the airway from completely opening or closing, other complications may include choking on or inhaling (aspirating) food or liquid. Aspiration that leads to severe pneumonia is rare but serious and requires immediate medical care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:15:10", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:15:22", "cost": 12.355}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:15:21", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:15:08"}

In a sense, DES and NE are different entities because they are defined by different manometric criteria. Unfortunately, clear pathophysiologic processes do not delineate these disorders. For these reasons, the esophagologist and physiologist should consider NE and DES distinct entities as they explore pathophysiologic mechanisms. From the perspective of the clinical gastroenterologist or internist, NE and DES may not appear as discrete clinical entities: they cannot be distinguished by their clinical presentations, and their treatments, although often inadequate, are essentially the same. Therefore, how we think about these disorders depends largely on our perspective.

Gocovri\n2.  Osmolex ER\n3.  Symmetrel\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Amantadine is an antidyskinetic medicine. It is used to treat Parkinson's disease (sometimes called \"paralysis agitans\" or \"shaking palsy\") and its symptoms, including dyskinesia (sudden uncontrolled movements). It may be given alone or in combination with other medicines (eg, levodopa) for Parkinson's disease. By improving muscle control and reducing stiffness, this medicine allows more normal movements of the body as the disease symptoms are reduced. Amantadine is also used to treat stiffness and shakiness caused by certain medicines that are used to treat nervous, mental, and emotional conditions.\n\n【4】Amantadine is also an antiviral medicine. It is used to prevent or treat certain influenza (flu) infections (type A). It may be given alone or together with flu shots. Amantadine will not work for colds, other types of flu, or other virus infections.\n\n【5】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【6】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【7】*   Tablet, Extended Release\n*   Capsule, Liquid Filled\n*   Tablet\n*   Solution\n*   Syrup\n*   Capsule\n*   Capsule, Extended Release\n\n【8】Before Using\n------------\n\n【9】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

The effects of this medicine may be increased because of slower removal from the body.\n\n【33】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【34】For patients taking amantadine for Parkinson's disease or movement problems (including dyskinesia) caused by certain medicines used to treat nervous, mental, and emotional conditions:\n\n【35】*   Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.\n*   This medicine comes with a Medication Guide or patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n*   Do not stop using this medicine suddenly without asking your doctor. You may need to slowly decrease your dose before stopping it completely.\n*   Improvement in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease usually occurs in about 2 days. However, in some patients, this medicine must be taken for up to 2 weeks before the full benefit is seen.\n\n【36】For patients taking amantadine to prevent or treat flu infections:\n\n【37】*   Talk to your doctor about the possibility of getting a flu shot if you have not had one yet.\n*   This medicine is best taken before exposure or right away after exposure to people who have the flu.\n*   To help keep yourself from getting the flu, keep taking this medicine for the full time of treatment. Or if you already have the flu, continue taking this medicine for the full time of treatment even if you begin to feel better after a few days. This will help clear up your infection completely. If you stop taking this medicine too soon, your symptoms may return. This medicine should be taken for at least 2 days after all your flu symptoms have disappeared.\n*   This medicine works best when there is a constant amount in the blood. To help keep the amount constant, do not miss any doses. Also, it is best to take the doses at evenly spaced times at day and night. For example, if you are to take two doses a day, the doses should be spaced about 12 hours apart. If this interferes with your sleep or other daily activities, or if you need help in planning the best times to take your medicine, check with your doctor.\n*   If you are using the oral liquid form of amantadine, use a marked measuring spoon, oral syringe, or medicine cup to measure each dose correctly. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.\n\n【38】Take Gocovri® extended-release capsule at bedtime. Swallow whole. Do not crush, break, or chew it. You may also open and sprinkle the extended-release capsules on a teaspoonful of soft food, including applesauce. Take all of the medicine right away without chewing. You may take this medicine with or without food.\n\n【39】Take Osmolex ER™ extended-release tablet in the morning. Swallow whole. Do not crush, open, or chew it.\n\n【40】Do not receive the nasal flu vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine) while taking this medicine.\n\n【41】Do not drink alcohol while you are using this medicine.\n\n【42】### Dosing\n\n【43】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【44】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【45】*   For treatment of Parkinson's disease or movement problems (including dyskinesia):\n    *   For oral dosage forms (extended-release capsules):\n        *   Adults—137 milligrams (mg) once a day at bedtime. Your doctor may increase your dose to 274 mg (two 137 mg capsules) once a day at bedtime after one week.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For oral dosage forms (extended-release tablets):\n        *   Adults—129 milligrams (mg) once a day in the morning. Your doctor may increase your dose each week to a maximum dose of 322 mg (one 129 mg tablet and one 193 mg tablet) once a day taken in the morning.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For oral dosage forms (liquid-filled capsules, syrup, and tablets):\n        *   Adults—100 milligrams (mg) 2 times a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose as needed.\n        *   Older adults—At first, 100 milligrams (mg) once a day as a single dose. Your doctor may adjust your dose as needed.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n*   For the treatment or prevention of flu:\n    *   For oral dosage forms (capsules, syrup, and tablets):\n        *   Adults—200 milligrams (mg) or 4 teaspoonfuls once a day as a single dose.\n        *   Older adults—100 milligrams (mg) once a day as a single dose.\n        *   Children 9 to 12 years of age—100 milligrams (mg) or 2 teaspoonfuls 2 times a day.\n        *   Children 1 to 9 years of age—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The usual dose is 4.4 to 8.8 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight per day. The dose is divided evenly and given 2 times a day. However, the dose is usually not more than 150 mg per day.\n        *   Children younger than 1 year of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【46】### Missed Dose\n\n【47】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule.

Keep from freezing.\n\n【51】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【52】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【53】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【54】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【55】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to see if the medicine is working properly and to allow changes in your dose. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.\n\n【56】Amantadine may cause some people to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors. It may also cause some people to have suicidal thoughts and tendencies or to become more depressed. Also tell your doctor if you have sudden or strong feelings, such as feeling nervous, angry, restless, violent, or scared. If you, your child, or your caregiver notice any of these adverse effects, tell your doctor or your child's doctor right away.\n\n【57】Some people who have used this medicine had unusual changes in their behavior. Talk with your doctor right away if you start having unusual urges, such as gambling urges, binge or compulsive eating, compulsive shopping, or sexual urges while using this medicine.\n\n【58】Drinking alcoholic beverages while taking this medicine may cause increased side effects, such as circulation problems, dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, or confusion. Do not drink alcoholic beverages while you are taking this medicine.\n\n【59】This medicine may cause some people to become dizzy, drowsy, or lightheaded, or to have blurred vision or trouble concentrating. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\n【60】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur with this medicine, especially when you suddenly get up from a lying or sitting position. These symptoms are more likely to occur when you begin taking this medicine or when the dose is increased. Getting up slowly may help. If this problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【61】Patients with Parkinson's disease must be careful not to overdo physical activities when their condition improves and body movements become easier, since injuries resulting from falls may occur. Such activities must be gradually increased to give your body time to adjust to a change in balance, circulation, and coordination.\n\n【62】Amantadine may cause dryness of the mouth, nose, and throat. For temporary relief of mouth dryness, use sugarless candy or gum, melted bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. If your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.\n\n【63】This medicine may cause purplish red, net-like, blotchy spots on the skin. This problem occurs more often in females and usually occurs on the legs or feet after this medicine has been taken regularly for a month or more. Although the blotchy spots may remain as long as you are taking this medicine, they will usually go away gradually within 2 to 12 weeks after you stop taking the medicine. If you have any questions about this, talk with your doctor.\n\n【64】Check with your doctor right away if you are having convulsions (seizures), difficulty with breathing, a fast heartbeat, a high fever, high or low blood pressure, increased sweating, loss of bladder control, severe muscle stiffness, unusually pale skin, or tiredness. These could be symptoms of a serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\n\n【65】If you are using this medicine for Parkinson's disease, do not stop taking this medicine suddenly without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to slowly reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely.\n\n【66】If you are using this medicine for Parkinson's disease, it is important that your doctor check your skin regularly for signs of melanoma (skin cancer). If you notice any unusual red, brown, or black spots on your skin, check with your doctor right away.\n\n【67】If your Parkinson's symptoms do not improve within a few days, if they become worse, or if this medicine appears less effective after a few weeks, check with your doctor.\n\n【68】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【69】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【70】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【71】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【72】#### More common\n\n【73】1.  Bladder pain\n2.  bloody or cloudy urine\n3.  blurred vision\n4.  confusion\n5.  difficult, burning, or painful urination\n6.  dizziness or lightheadedness\n7.  fainting\n8.  falls\n9.  frequent urge to urinate\n10.  lower back or side pain\n11.  seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there\n12.  swelling of the hands, feet, or lower legs\n\n【74】#### Less common\n\n【75】1.

Diagnosis was verified by individual medical record review. A cohort of sex- and age-matched comparators without sarcoidosis was assembled from the same population. Data on 18 chronic conditions recommended by the US Department of Health and Human Services for both cases and comparators were retrieved and compared.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The prevalence of multimorbidity (ie, the presence of ≥2 chronic conditions) was similar between the 2 groups: 111 of 345 cases (32.2%) and 110 of 345 comparators (31.9%) ( _P_ \\=.99). After the index date, 156 cases (43.8%) and 142 comparators (41.2%) developed multimorbidity, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 1.60 (95% CI, 1.27-2.01; _P_ <.001). The cumulative incidence of the presence of ≥3, 4, and 5 chronic conditions was also consistently significantly higher in cases than in comparators ( _P_ value=.01,004 and .002, respectively). Analysis by specific type of chronic condition revealed a significantly higher cumulative incidence of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke or transient ischemic attack, arthritis, depression, diabetes, and major osteoporotic fracture.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In this population, patients with sarcoidosis had a significantly higher risk of developing multimorbidity than did sex- and age-matched individuals without sarcoidosis.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CAD ( coronary artery disease ), CHF ( congestive heart failure ), HR ( hazard ratio ), REP ( Rochester Epidemiology Project )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:23:55", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:24:02", "cost": 6.888}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:41", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:24:01", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:23:54"}

When this happens, blood often backs up and fluid can build up in the lungs, causing shortness of breath.\n\n【2】Certain heart conditions gradually leave the heart too weak or stiff to fill and pump blood properly. These conditions include narrowed arteries in the heart and high blood pressure.\n\n【3】Proper treatment may improve the symptoms of heart failure and may help some people live longer. Lifestyle changes can improve quality of life. Try to lose weight, exercise, use less salt and manage stress.\n\n【4】But heart failure can be life-threatening. People with heart failure may have severe symptoms. Some may need a heart transplant or a device to help the heart pump blood.\n\n【5】Heart failure is sometimes called congestive heart failure.\n\n【6】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【7】If you have heart failure, your heart can't supply enough blood to meet your body's needs.\n\n【8】Symptoms may develop slowly. Sometimes, heart failure symptoms start suddenly. Heart failure symptoms may include:\n\n【9】*   Shortness of breath with activity or when lying down.\n*   Fatigue and weakness.\n*   Swelling in the legs, ankles and feet.\n*   Rapid or irregular heartbeat.\n*   Reduced ability to exercise.\n*   Wheezing.\n*   A cough that doesn't go away or a cough that brings up white or pink mucus with spots of blood.\n*   Swelling of the belly area.\n*   Very rapid weight gain from fluid buildup.\n*   Nausea and lack of appetite.\n*   Difficulty concentrating or decreased alertness.\n*   Chest pain if heart failure is caused by a heart attack.\n\n【10】### When to see a doctor\n\n【11】See your health care provider if you think you might have symptoms of heart failure. Call 911 or emergency medical help if you have any of the following:\n\n【12】*   Chest pain.\n*   Fainting or severe weakness.\n*   Rapid or irregular heartbeat with shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting.\n*   Sudden, severe shortness of breath and coughing up white or pink, foamy mucus.\n\n【13】These symptoms may be due to heart failure. But there are many other possible causes. Don't try to diagnose yourself.\n\n【14】At the emergency room, health care providers do tests to learn if your symptoms are due to heart failure or something else.\n\n【15】Call your health care provider right away if you have heart failure and:\n\n【16】*   Your symptoms suddenly become worse.\n*   You develop a new symptom.\n*   You gain 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) or more within a few days.\n\n【17】Such changes could mean that existing heart failure is getting worse or that treatment isn't working.\n\n【18】Causes\n------\n\n【19】Heart failure can be caused by a weakened, damaged or stiff heart.\n\n【20】*   If the heart is damaged or weakened, the heart chambers may stretch and get bigger. The heart can't pump out the needed amount of blood.\n*   If the main pumping chambers of the heart, called the ventricles, are stiff, they can't fill with enough blood between beats.\n\n【21】The heart muscle can be damaged by certain infections, heavy alcohol use, illegal drug use and some chemotherapy medicines. Your genes also can play a role.\n\n【22】Any of the following conditions also can damage or weaken the heart and cause heart failure.\n\n【23】*   **Coronary artery disease and heart attack.** Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure. The disease results from the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries. The deposits narrow the arteries. This reduces blood flow and can lead to heart attack.\n\n【24】    A heart attack occurs suddenly when an artery feeding the heart becomes completely blocked. Damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack may mean that the heart can no longer pump as well as it should.\n\n【25】*   **High blood pressure.** Also called hypertension, this condition forces the heart to work harder than it should to pump blood through the body. Over time, the extra work can make the heart muscle too stiff or too weak to properly pump blood.\n*   **Heart valve disease.** The valves of the heart keep blood flowing the right way. If a valve isn't working properly, the heart must work harder to pump blood. This can weaken the heart over time. Treating some types of heart valve problems may reverse heart failure.\n*   **Inflammation of the heart muscle, also called myocarditis.** Myocarditis is most commonly caused by a virus, including the COVID-19 virus, and can lead to left-sided heart failure.\n*   **A heart problem that you're born with, also called a congenital heart defect.** If the heart and its chambers or valves haven't formed correctly, the other parts of the heart have to work harder to pump blood. This may lead to heart failure.\n*   **Irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias.** Irregular heart rhythms may cause the heart to beat too fast, creating extra work for the heart. A slow heartbeat also may lead to heart failure. Treating an irregular heart rhythm may reverse heart failure in some people.\n*   **Other diseases.** Some long-term diseases may contribute to chronic heart failure. Examples are diabetes, HIV infection, an overactive or underactive thyroid, or a buildup of iron or protein.\n\n【26】Causes of sudden heart failure also include:\n\n【27】*   Allergic reactions.\n*   Any illness that affects the whole body.\n*   Blood clots in the lungs.\n*   Severe infections.\n*   Use of certain medicines.\n*   Viruses that attack the heart muscle.\n\n【28】Heart failure usually begins with the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle. This is the heart's main pumping chamber. But heart failure also can affect the right side. The lower right heart chamber is called the right ventricle. Sometimes heart failure affects both sides of the heart.\n\n| Type of heart failure | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【30】Source: American Heart Association\n\n| Right-sided heart failure | This type affects the lower right heart chamber, called the right ventricle. Fluid may back up into the belly, legs and feet, causing swelling. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Left-sided heart failure | This type affects the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle. Fluid may back up in the lungs, causing shortness of breath. |\n| Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), also called systolic heart failure | This is a type of left-sided heart failure. The left ventricle can't squeeze as strong as it should. The heart isn't strong enough to pump enough blood to the body. |\n| Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), also called diastolic heart failure | This is a type of left-sided heart failure. The left ventricle can't relax or fill fully. The heart has a problem filling with blood. |\n\n【32】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【33】Diseases and conditions that increase the risk of heart failure include:\n\n【34】*   **Coronary artery disease.** Narrowed arteries may limit the heart's supply of oxygen-rich blood, resulting in weakened heart muscle.\n*   **Heart attack.** A heart attack is a form of coronary artery disease that occurs suddenly. Damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack may mean the heart can no longer pump as well as it should.\n*   **Heart valve disease.** Having a heart valve that doesn't work properly raises the risk of heart failure.\n*   **High blood pressure.** The heart works harder than it has to when blood pressure is high.\n*   **Irregular heartbeats.** Irregular heartbeats, especially if they are very frequent and fast, can weaken the heart muscle and cause heart failure.\n*   **Congenital heart disease.** Some people who develop heart failure were born with problems that affect the structure or function of their heart.\n*   **Diabetes.** Having diabetes increases the risk of high blood pressure and coronary artery disease.\n*   **Sleep apnea.** This inability to breathe properly during sleep results in low blood-oxygen levels and an increased risk of irregular heartbeats. Both of these problems can weaken the heart.\n*   **Obesity.** People who have obesity have a higher risk of developing heart failure.\n*   **Viral infections.** Some viral infections can damage to the heart muscle.\n\n【35】Medicines that may increase the risk of heart failure include:\n\n【36】*   **Some diabetes medicines.** The diabetes drugs rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos) have been found to increase the risk of heart failure in some people. Don't stop taking these medicines without first talking to your health care provider.\n*   **Some other medicines.** Other medicines that may lead to heart failure or heart problems include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some medicines used to treat high blood pressure, cancer, blood conditions, irregular heartbeats, nervous system diseases, mental health conditions, lung and urinary problems, and infections.\n\n【37】Other risk factors for heart failure include:\n\n【38】*   **Aging.** The heart's ability to work decreases with age, even in healthy people.\n*   **Alcohol use.** Drinking too much alcohol may weaken the heart muscle and lead to heart failure.\n*   **Smoking or using tobacco.** If you smoke, quit. Using tobacco increases the risk of heart disease and heart failure.\n\n【39】Complications\n-------------\n\n【40】If you have health failure, it's important to have regular health checkups, even if symptoms improve. Your health care provider can examine you and run tests to check for complications.\n\n【41】Complications of heart failure depend on your age, overall health and the severity of heart disease. They may include:\n\n【42】*   **Kidney damage or failure.** Heart failure can reduce the blood flow to the kidneys. Untreated, this can cause kidney failure. Kidney damage from heart failure can require dialysis for treatment.\n*   **Other heart problems.** Heart failure can cause changes in the heart's size and function. These changes may damage heart valves and cause irregular heartbeats.\n*   **Liver damage.** Heart failure can cause fluid buildup that puts too much pressure on the liver. This fluid backup can lead to scarring, which makes it more difficult for the liver to work properly.\n*   **Sudden cardiac death.** If the heart is weak, there is a risk of dying suddenly due to a dangerous irregular heart rhythm.\n\n【43】Prevention\n----------\n\n【44】One way to prevent heart failure is to treat and control the conditions that can cause it. These conditions include coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity.\n\n【45】Some of the same lifestyle changes used to manage heart failure also may help prevent it.

It was our hypothesis that the associated implementation of physical distancing and masking led to a decline in circulation and detection of common respiratory viruses. Nasopharyngeal swabs processed with the Biofire, Film Array respiratory panel at Mayo Clinic Arizona were reviewed from January 1, 2017, to July 31, 2020. A total of 13,324 nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed. Between April and July 2017- 2019 (Period A) a mean of 262 tests were performed monthly, falling to 128 for the corresponding months of 2020 (Period B). A reduction in the monthly mean number of positive tests (Period A 71.5; Period B 2.8) and mean positivity rate (Period A 25.04%; Period B 2.07%) was observed. Rhinovirus/enterovirus was the most prevalent virus, with a monthly mean of 21.6 cases (30.2% of positives) for Period A and 2 cases (72.7% of positives) for Period B. Positivity for a second virus occurred in a mean of 2.1 positive tests (3.3%) in Period A but was absent in Period B. Implementation of distancing and masking coincides with a marked reduction in respiratory virus detection and likely circulation. Data from the fall/winter of 2020 will help clarify the potential role for distancing and masking as a mitigation strategy, not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also in the seasonal battle against common respiratory viruses.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ), HCoV ( human coronavirus ), RP ( respiratory panel ), SARS-CoV-2 ( severe acute respiratory illness coronavirus-2 )\n\n【4】National patterns of circulation of the common respiratory viruses, including human coronaviruses (HCoV), influenza, and parainfluenza, are well established. The 4 common HCoV species show peak prevalence between December and March, whereas human parainfluenza viruses show increased prevalence during April to June and October to November each year.\n\n【5】Longitudinal studies have shown a consistent, largely predictable pattern of year-on-year disease prevalence.\n\n【6】The Biofire, FilmArray respiratory (RP) panel (Biofire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT) is performed at Mayo Clinic, Arizona, for detection of respiratory viral pathogens. A pattern of positivity similar to that seen at other testing facilities has been reported previously, with seasonal variation in the circulation of respiratory viral pathogens dropping to a nadir in summer with a predictable increase in positivity thereafter, peaking in the winter months.\n\n【7】Bolster LaSalle CM, Grys TG.

Daytona Beach, FL.\n\n【8】Since severe acute respiratory illness coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in December 2019 and later declared a global pandemic, novel measures have been taken to mitigate virus transmission, with physical distancing as a central tenant of these measures. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends frequent handwashing, physical distancing of at least 6 feet, and the use of face masks to cover the mouth and nose.\n\n【9】Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  \nHow to protect yourself and others.\n\n【10】The utility of these interventions to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed. However, the influence of these measures on the circulating prevalence of common seasonal respiratory virus pathogens has not been reported in the United States to date.\n\n【11】Figure 1 January 2020 to July 2020 monthly number of positive nasopharyngeal swabs, separated by viral pathogen identified.\n\n【12】Figure 2 Monthly percentage positive nasopharyngeal swabs from January to July for 2017 to 2020 at Mayo Clinic Arizona. Positivity rates were calculated by dividing the number of positive tests per month by the total number of tests performed each month.\n\n【13】Figure 3 Monthly number of positive rhinovirus/enterovirus tests between January and July each year, 2017 to 2020 inclusive.\n\n【14】Our findings are contrary to those reported by Sberna et al in Rome, Italy, who reported similar prevalence levels of seasonal respiratory viruses from February to April 2020, when SARS-CoV-2 community transmission was high, as compared with the corresponding interval of previous years. It should be noted that a different assay was used for viral detection (QIAstat-DX Respiratory Panel; Qiagen).\n\n【15】Trend of respiratory pathogens during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\n【16】In Taiwan, where physical distancing and mask wearing was swiftly implemented in January 2020, a similar observation to ours has been made in the context of influenzas A and B. The nationwide surveillance data portal for infectious diseases, maintained by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, was analyzed for the first 12 weeks of 2020. The analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the positivity rate for 2020 as compared with the same 12 week interval of 2019.\n\n【17】Collateral benefit of COVID-19 control measures on influenza activity, Taiwan.\n\n【18】Likewise in Singapore, markers of influenza activity (number of daily visits to government primary care clinics with influenza-like illness, number of influenza-like illness samples tested per week, and the percentage of influenza positivity) were markedly lower for epidemiological weeks 5-9 of 2020, when distancing measures were introduced, as compared with the corresponding interval of the preceding 3 years.\n\n【19】Decreased influenza incidence under COVID-19 control measures, Singapore.\n\n【20】It is worth noting that our laboratory also offered the Focus Simplexa Flu A/B and RSV assay (Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA) before January 2019. The use and performance of this assay in tandem with the Biofire RP panel has been reported previously. Outside of influenza season (winter months), the Focus panel was not routinely ordered, with fewer than 20 tests per week. Compared with the BioFire panel, the Focus panel had greater sensitivity for the detection of influenza viruses and lower sensitivity for the detection of RSV.\n\n【21】Bolster LaSalle CM, Grys TG. Three year accumulated experience of the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel at a tertiary hospital. Poster presented at: Annual Meeting of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology and Clinical Virology Symposium, May 19-22, 2016. Daytona Beach, FL.\n\n【22】In January 2019, the Focus panel was replaced, first solely by the COBAS Liat Influenza A/B and RSV assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA) and later combined with the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). Both tests have been unavailable at our institution since March 24, 2020. Although detection rates with these 2 assays had not been compared directly with the Biofire RP assay, the use of these assays might have identified additional cases of Influenza A and RSV from March 2020 onwards. Similar to previous years, the use of these tests is anticipated to have been low for the months of interest in 2020 (April-July), given that they fall outside of peak influenza season.\n\n【23】There are several possible explanations for the decline in the number of tests performed since March of this year. This decline can likely be attributed partly to a reluctance to seek medical care since the onset of the pandemic, with a consequent reduction in health care utilization.\n\n【24】Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Department Visits - United States, January 1, 2019-May 30, 2020.\n\n【25】With the accompanying decline in positivity rate, it is also plausible that physical distancing and face coverings are reducing the transmissibility of the typical seasonal respiratory viruses. Our data are limited to just 4 months (April-July) since community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 became widespread in Arizona in late March 2020. It is anticipated that the respiratory viruses circulate at lower levels during these months, albeit normally higher than what we have seen for 2020 thus far.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【27】Clinical laboratory data collected since the arrival of widespread community transmission in Arizona of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates a reduction in the number of nasopharyngeal swabs being requested and the percentage of positive tests reported. Furthermore, this interval has been characterized by a complete absence of double viral infection and a dramatic reduction in our most consistently prevalent viral pathogen, rhinovirus/enterovirus. The reduction in transmission of these viruses with physical distancing bodes well for the impending fall influenza season. Further analysis of laboratory data as we proceed through the fall and winter of 2020, when an upswing of circulating virus numbers would normally be expected, will help to clarify the potential long-term role for physical distancing and face coverings as a mitigation strategy, not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also in the seasonal battle against common respiratory viral pathogens.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:34:18", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:34:22", "cost": 3.733}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:40", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:34:20", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:34:16"}

To be useful, a screening tool must be simple to use, inexpensive, and accurate. A commonly used screening tool in primary care practice with proven validity and reliability is the PHQ-9 ; the 9 items on this instrument are based on the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ Fourth Edition ( _DSM-IV_ ) diagnostic criteria.\n\n【24】Validation and utility of a self-report version of PRIME-MD: the PHQ primary care study.\n\n【25】The PHQ-9 has been used to screen for depression in patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular disease, as well as in ethnically diverse population groups.\n\n【26】Cost-effectiveness of collaborative care for chronically ill patients with comorbid depressive disorder in the general hospital setting, a randomised controlled trial.\n\n【27】Monitoring depression treatment outcomes with the patient health questionnaire-9.\n\n【28】Its usefulness in assessing depression severity and monitoring treatment response are well established.\n\n【29】Monitoring depression treatment outcomes with the patient health questionnaire-9.\n\n【30】Using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to measure depression among racially and ethnically diverse primary care patients.\n\n【31】MacArthur Initiative on Depression and Primary Care.\n\n【32】To meet _DSM-IV_ criteria for depression diagnosis, the patient must respond affirmatively to at least 1 of the first 2 items on the test (little interest or pleasure in doing things; feeling down, depressed, or hopeless), indicating that the symptom has been present more than half the time in the past 2 weeks, as well as score positively on some of the other 7 questions. A score of 10 or above is often used as the cutoff for a clinical diagnosis of majordepression and as an indication for the initiation of therapy. At these cutoff scores, the instrument has been shown to have a sensitivity and specificity for depression of 88%.\n\n【33】The PHQ-9: validity of a brief depression severity measure.\n\n【34】FIGURE 1 Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 copyright 1999 Pfizer Inc. All rights reserved. Reproduced with permission.\n\n【35】As a screening instrument, however, it cannot replace sound clinical judgment. Before deciding on treatment, the clinician must carefully evaluate those with scores indicative of depression for coexisting situational issues such as suicidal thoughts; substance use; medical illnesses presenting with anergy, insomnia, or anorexia; or comorbid psychiatric condition. Furthermore, the limitations of the self-reporting of depressive symptoms should be considered when using the PHQ-9. Studies have shown that the personality traits of patients can lead to discrepancies between self-reported ratings and a more objective assessment by a clinician, ie, those obtained via a structured clinical interview.\n\n【36】Discrepancies between self and observer ratings of depression: the relationship to demographic, clinical and personality variables.\n\n【37】Concordance between self-report and clinician's assessment of depression.\n\n【38】Multimodal assessment of depressive symptoms may be more appropriate in certain settings.\n\n【39】Although designed to be completed by the patient before or during the office visit, the PHQ-9 can also be administered by the physician or designated clinical staff member depending on practice protocols. A very flexible tool, PHQ-9 can be used indirectly (eg, via telephone) or directly at a face-to-face visit; evidence of this flexibility was provided by a large study conducted in Europe which showed a congruence between self-administered and telephone-administered PHQ-9.\n\n【40】Assessing depression in primary care with the PHQ-9: can it be carried out over the telephone?\n\n【41】For screening alone, the first 2 items (“In the past 2 weeks, have you been down or depressed?”; “Have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things you normally enjoy?”), known as the PHQ-2, have been shown to be very useful in deciding who is at risk.\n\n【42】Detecting and monitoring depression with a two-item questionnaire (PHQ-2).\n\n【43】Some practices rely on the PHQ-2 for general screening, only using the full PHQ-9 with someone who has risk factors and/or screens positive on the PHQ-2. However, as noted by the preventive task force, _screening alone is not enough_ . Each practice must work out the logistics of administering the tool and initiating depression management considering available resources and practice preferences.\n\n【44】MANAGEMENT OF DEPRESSION\n------------------------\n\n【45】Depression management can be usefully divided into 3 phases: initiation of treatment, continuation, and follow-up/maintenance. The initial goal in the first phase of depression management is to minimize depressive symptoms and achieve remission. The MacArthur Foundation and others have linked severity scores on the PHQ-9 with suggested interventions . On the basis of the obtained score, a clinician may adopt a step-up approach to treatment selection, beginning with supportive counseling and progressing, if necessary, along the spectrum to a combination treatment with antidepressants and psychotherapy. Again, these are general guidelines developed to assist a clinician in structuring conversation with the patient about possible interventions. To facilitate the tracking of patient progress, the PHQ-9 should be entered in the medical record in a manner that allows for easy retrieval, ideally in the form of a patient registry.\n\n【46】TABLE 1 Applying Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Scores to Practice\n\n| PHQ-9 score | Severity/provisional diagnosis | Treatment recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| <5 | Community norm | No action recommended |\n| 5-9 | Mild symptoms | Watchful waiting, self-management education, periodic rescreening |\n| 10-14 | Major depression, mild | Pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, creation of a treatment and follow-up plan, education, reevaluation |\n| 15-19 | Major depression, moderately severe | Immediate institution of treatment (pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy) |\n| ≥20 | Major depression, severe | Pharmacotherapy AND psychotherapy, referral |\n\n【48】Adapted from MacArthur Initiative on Depression and Primary Care,\n\n【49】MacArthur Initiative on Depression and Primary Care.\n\n【50】with permission.\n\n【51】### Pharmacological Management\n\n【52】The decision to use antidepressant agents should be made jointly by the clinician and the patient. Some factors to consider in drug selection include patient preferences, potential drug-drug interactions, insurance limitations, and adverse effects. Patients with major depression should remain on a successful medication regimen for at least 6 months for the first episode and longer for subsequent episodes; it is therefore critical that they are able to tolerate and afford that period of treatment. Patient involvement and education are key factors in treatment adherence. A step-up dosing schedule can be helpful in minimizing adverse effects; initial doses should also be lower for elderly patients and those with hepatic or renal impairment.

Clinicians should recognize that no one treatment is universally effective and that many depressed patients do not experience satisfactory clinical benefit from initial treatment. The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR\\*D) study, sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health, confirmed that several sequential treatment steps are often needed to obtain remission. However, when more treatment steps are required, short-term remission rates decline and relapse rates increase during the follow-up phase.\n\n【69】Acute and longer-term outcomes in depressed outpatients requiring one or several treatment steps: a STAR\\*D report.\n\n【70】Those who do not respond to the “first step” of a step-up treatment approach can be more easily identified when patient responses can be documented within 4 to 6 weeks of initiating medications or 8 to 12 weeks of initiating psychotherapy. These patients can then be moved to the next step, which may involve a simple change of medication or the referral to a mental health professional.\n\n【71】### Psychotherapy\n\n【72】Psychotherapy can reduce depressive symptoms, improve function, and prevent relapse in patients with major depression.\n\n【73】Reducing relapse and recurrence in unipolar depression: a comparative meta-analysis of cognitive-behavioral therapy's effects.\n\n【74】Randomized trial of behavioral activation, cognitive therapy, and antidepressant medication in the acute treatment of adults with major depresson.\n\n【75】Access to a psychotherapist, however, can pose a challenge in many health care systems. Two proposed solutions are the administration of cognitive-behavioral therapy by telephone and the training of nurses to act as care managers, providing focused care using concepts of behavioral activation.\n\n【76】Feasibility and acceptability of a telephone psychotherapy program for depressed adults treated in primary care.\n\n【77】Combined treatment with pharmacological agents is recommended for those with partial or no response to 12 weeks of psychological counseling, those with severe depression, or those with a prior chronic courseof illness. Patient preferences (specific gender, specific therapist in mind), health plan restrictions, and out-of-pocket costs should be considered in the selection of a psychotherapist.\n\n【78】### Clinical Guidelines\n\n【79】Guidelines have been developed to facilitate the incorporation of the principles of evidence-based medicine into depression identification and management. Prominent examples that target the primary care population are the MacArthur Foundation toolkit , the _Guideline for Major Depression in Adults in Primary Care_ of the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement , and the _Guideline for Depression_ of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which has been implemented throughout Britain .\n\n【80】In choosing a guideline, the primary care practitioner should assess the quality and currency of the guideline and its relevance to the practice. Once a guideline is chosen, the next challenge is to ensure that practitioners remember to use it. Those practices with electronic medical records have the opportunity to embed flags or reminders about steps in a guideline into their daily practice. Implementation in practices without electronic records will be more challenging.\n\n【81】### Follow-up Frequency\n\n【82】The aims of treatment in the continuation and maintenance treatment phases are to prevent relapse in the short-term and the return of any new episodes in the long-term. Nearly half of patients who receive an initial prescription for an antidepressant discontinue treatment during the first month; few receive the recommended levels of follow-up care.\n\n【83】Managing depression in medical outpatients.\n\n【84】Patterns of antidepressant use in community practice.\n\n【85】Frequent contacts during follow-up have been associatedwith better outcome. Patients should be seen 2 to 4 weeks after starting therapy to assess medication acceptance and response, reinforce educational messages, and address adverse effects and suicide risk. After the initial identification of a depressed patient, 3 contacts within 12 weeks are considered ideal.\n\n【86】The PHQ-9 should be administered during these follow-up visits to monitor patient progress. Studies that investigated the sensitivity of the PHQ-9 to change have shown that the measure is responsive to pharmacological and psychosocial interventions.\n\n【87】Responsiveness of the PHQ-9 to psychopharmacological depression treatment.\n\n【88】Measuring depression outcome with a brief self-report instrument: sensitivity to change of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).\n\n【89】Changes in the PHQ-9 scores after treatment with antidepressant agents correspond with clinician ratings of patient responses to treatment.\n\n【90】Measuring depression outcome with a brief self-report instrument: sensitivity to change of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).\n\n【91】Practice models will dictate who will see the patient on follow-up and whether follow-up can be conducted through nonvisit care. For instance, under the collaborative care model described below, follow-ups are performed by the care manager with case supervision by a psychiatrist and/or primary care physician.\n\n【92】Using the PHQ-9 to assess treatment response , clinicians can classify and manage patients as follows: complete response/remission, in which case therapy should be continued for at least 6 months; partial response, in which case a higher dose of the same agent should be used or a second agent or psychotherapy added; and no response, in which case a switch should be made to a different category of drug or to psychotherapy.\n\n【93】TABLE 4 Using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to Assess Initial Treatment Response\n\n【94】Goal of the initial phase of treatment is remission, defined as a PHQ-9 score of less than 5.\n\n【95】After 4 to 6 Weeks of Adequate Pharmacotherapy\n\n| PHQ-9 score | Treatment response | Recommended action |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Decrease of 5 points or more from baseline | Adequate or complete | Do not change treatment; conduct periodic follow-up |\n| Decrease of 2 to 4 points from baseline | Partial | Reconfirm diagnosis; consider comorbid conditions; increase dose of same agent or add second agent |\n| Decrease of 1 point or no change/increase in score | Poor or none | Reconfirm diagnosis; consider comorbid conditions; augment medication; switch medication; obtain psychiatric consultation; add psychological counseling |\n\n【97】Adapted from MacArthur Initiative on Depression and Primary Care,\n\n【98】MacArthur Initiative on Depression and Primary Care.\n\n【99】with permission.\n\n【100】\\* Goal of the initial phase of treatment is remission, defined as a PHQ-9 score of less than 5.\n\n【101】Indefinite antidepressant therapy should be discussed with patients who have additional risk factors such as 2 or more prior episodes of depression in 5 years, an initial episode after age 50, and difficult-to-treat episodes.\n\n【102】The _collaborative care model_ , a structured approach to care based on chronic disease management principles, involves allied specialists, such as registered nurses, who act as care managers and work in conjunction with the primary care physician and mental health specialist. This model uses a care manager and creates a collaborative relationship between a primary care practice and a psychiatrist; other critical components include the use of a screening instrument, the establishment of a registry where results can be entered and patients followed, and the use of evidence-based guidelines. Substantial evidence has shown this model to be more effective than standard care in improving short-term and long-term depression outcomes.\n\n【103】Chronic disease management for depression in primary care: a summary of the current literature and implications for practice.\n\n【104】Collaborative care for depression: a cumulative meta-analysis and review of longer-term outcomes.\n\n【105】Collaborative care management of late-life depression in the primary care setting: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【106】The system of care included in a collaborative model addresses weaknesses in systems that only screen for depression and do not follow up on those who have been identified or who have dropped out of care. A more detailed discussion of the model is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n【107】REFERRALS FOR PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION\n------------------------------------\n\n【108】Although primary care clinicians capably manage more than 75% of patients with depression,\n\n【109】*   Depression Guideline Panel\n\n【110】Depression in Primary Care: Treatment of Major Depression. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research , Rockville, MD 1993\n\n【111】referral for psychiatric evaluation is recommended in the following patients: those with a history of psychosis or who are suspected of having a primary psychotic disorder, those with a history of bipolar disorder or with symptoms of mania, those who have substantial trouble tolerating medication adverse effects, those whose depression has not responded to 2 adequate trials of antidepressants, those with complex comorbid medical conditions that complicate a choice of antidepressant, and those with complex comorbid mental conditions and/or a substance abuse problem.\n\n【112】Patients with positive scores on the 9th item of PHQ-9 should be assessed further by their primary care team for suicidal risk. Immediate psychiatric evaluation or emergency referral for hospitalization is necessary whenever there is _imminent_ danger that patients will harm themselves. Clarifying which patients are in imminent danger of suicide is a clinical decision best made by the practitioner directly involved with the patient. In making that determination, the practitioner should consider whether patients are preoccupied with or have thoughts about suicide, have stated their intent to act on those thoughts, have access to lethal means, and have a history of suicide attempts.\n\n【113】Patients who are deemed to be imminently at risk should be moved to a safe environment. A collaborative relationship between the mental health specialist and the primary care physician will help facilitate prompt intervention and ensure patient safety, particularly around this issue. An additional resource for patients and their families is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline .\n\n【114】PATIENT EDUCATION\n-----------------\n\n【115】Success in depression management largely depends on enabling patients to be active participants in their care process. Clinicians can help by providing educational materials or directing patients to available resources. They can also remind patients that depression, like asthma or diabetes, is a chronic and recurring disorder, the management of which requires their participation. They can educate patients regarding their medication, letting them know that 2 to 4 weeks of drug therapy may be needed before symptoms improve and alerting them to any potential adverse effects. They can remind them of the importance of taking their medication daily, continuing their medication for at least 6 months after they are feeling better, and consulting their physician if adverse effects or other problems with medication occur or before changing the dosage of or discontinuing medication. Finally, patients should be advised of the importance of eating a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and obtaining enough sleep.\n\n【116】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【117】Depression is the second most common reason for consultation in primary care practice but still remains frequently undiagnosed and undertreated. The PHQ-9 is a validated and reliable tool that the primary care physician can use to diagnose and treat depression and to monitor progress. A score of 10 or higher is used as the cutoff for a clinical diagnosis of depression and as an indication of the need to begin therapy. However, the PHQ-9 is intended only as a tool to facilitate clinical decision making and does not replace sound medical judgment. The goal of the initial treatment phase is to achieve remission either by pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or a combination of modalities. Clinical guidelines have been developed to provide clinicians with management algorithms. Continuation and maintenance phases aim at preventing relapse and lifelong recurrence; the PHQ-9 score can guide clinicians on treatment modifications and the need for referrals for psychiatric evaluation. Frequent follow-ups have been associated with better outcomes; 3 contacts within the 12 weeks after initial diagnosis are considered ideal.\n\n【118】Decisions regarding screening and follow-up—ie, where, how, and by whom the follow-up will be conducted—will be made by practices on the basis of their individual needs. The collaborative care model appears to be the most effective for depression management in primary care and addresses system weaknesses, particularly those associated with follow-up care.\n\n【119】In screening for depression, clinicians should particularly assess for suicidal risk; certain factors can help identify those at imminent risk of suicide. Ultimately, success in depression management largely depends on patient participation and self-activation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:11:56", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:12:29", "cost": 32.345}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:40", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:12:28", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:11:55"}

As of September 7, 2020, according to the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 tracker, there have been over 27 million estimated COVID-19 cases associated with over 890 thousand deaths worldwide. Initial reports suggested that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was a respiratory pathogen mediated by its affinity to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor. As our understanding of COVID-19 evolved, it became clear that SARS-CoV-2 leads to gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, owing to the ubiquitous presence of the ACE-2 receptor in the human gut. The gastrointestinal effects are seen due to ACE-2 expression on small intestine and colonic enterocytes, hepatocytes, and cholangiocytes.\n\n【1】Gastrointestinal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hepato-cellular injury (manifesting as transaminitis), have been widely reported. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 78 studies with 12,797 patients reported that loss of appetite with a prevalence of 22.3% was the most common gastrointestinal symptom. Other symptoms such as diarrhea were reported in 12.4%, nausea and/or vomiting were seen in 9.0%, and abdominal pain occurred in 6.2%.\n\n【2】Prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【3】Another meta-analysis demonstrated that the pooled prevalence estimates of transaminitis was 15%.\n\n【4】AGA Institute rapid review of the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of COVID-19, meta-analysis of international data, and recommendations for the consultative management of patients with COVID-19.\n\n【5】These two large reviews demonstrate that studies from China report a lower prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormalities compared with studies from other countries. This lower prevalence could be related to lack of adequate reporting of systemic symptoms in studies from China, as SARS-CoV-2 was initially thought to be a respiratory illness. In the midst of the beginnings of a global pandemic, gathering and reporting all data can be a legitimate challenge; indeed, significant heterogeneity exists among the studies included in these systematic reviews. Studies have demonstrated that gastrointestinal symptoms may be present before respiratory symptoms and sometimes even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The emergence of these data has led to amendment of screening and diagnostic protocols for COVID-19, with the inclusion of gastrointestinal symptoms to testing algorithms. It is now being recommended that patients presenting with these common gastrointestinal symptoms should undergo a thorough assessment for exposure to and presence of other nongastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n【6】A bigger debate and concern center on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and the role of feco-oral transmission of COVID-19. Samples from wastewater treatment plants from Italy demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 was present in such sources in northern Italy in December 2019, thereby predating the severe surge of cases seen in Italy.\n\n【7】SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating in northern Italy since December 2019: evidence from environmental monitoring.\n\n【8】Interestingly, the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in an area can be monitored through the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage water. In this regard, a study from France demonstrated an increased number of new COVID-19 cases two weeks after detection of SARS-CoV-2 in waste water.\n\n【9】Post-lockdown detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater of Montpellier, France.\n\n【10】Similar observations are now reported in other parts of the world. Chlorine treatment of waste water can effectively reduce SARS-CoV-2 but does not prevent the surge of cases that occurs after the detection of the virus in sewage. This suggests an increasing presence of the virus in the environment prior to case-surge, and that feco-oral spread may play a role in the transmission of COVID-19. There is an urgent need for the development of validated and optimized protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection and quantification in stool and sewage samples.\n\n【11】Sewage analysis as a tool for the COVID-19 pandemic response and management: the urgent need for optimised protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection and quantification.\n\n【12】This has implications both for infection control when dealing with sick individuals and for epidemiological prediction of a surge of COVID-19 cases in a geographic area.\n\n【13】In this issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , McDermott et al\n\n【14】COVID-19 and gastrointestinal symptoms: recognition, containment, and learning from the past.\n\n【15】present insights from past coronavirus outbreaks and the current COVID-19 pandemic pertaining to the recognition of gastrointestinal symptoms. The authors thoughtfully point out that while, until recently, there has been a relative lack of research on treatment and outcomes from SARS-CoV-2, there is a large amount of literature derived from research conducted over the years after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks. Gastrointestinal symptoms were commonly seen in both SARS and MERS, and the incidence of these symptoms appears to be more frequent in the SARS and MERS outbreaks. An instance of SARS community outbreak in 2004 was linked to airborne spread, and viral concentrations in respiratory secretions were lower than the concentrations in urine and stool.\n\n【16】Evidence of airborne transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus.\n\n【17】These observations from the past reinforce the notion that feco-oral spread may be an important one in transmitting the disease. The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms should suggest testing for SARS-CoV-2 so as to aid in timely diagnosis and avoid inadvertent transmission. McDermott et al\n\n【18】COVID-19 and gastrointestinal symptoms: recognition, containment, and learning from the past.\n\n【19】also suggest that it is important to distinguish between the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms when the patient is first seen and those that develop during the course of the illness. Gastrointestinal symptoms commonly develop during hospitalization, and symptoms that develop after diagnosis should be interpreted in context of the usage of medications being trialed for treatment of COVID-19. McDermott et al\n\n【20】COVID-19 and gastrointestinal symptoms: recognition, containment, and learning from the past.\n\n【21】also hypothesize novel models of disease transmission for COVID-19. It is unclear if the viral particles detected from feces and emesis are infectious and can transmit the disease. In the absence of data, and owing to the detection of viral particles by nucleic acid amplification tests, the risk of transmission via surface contamination cannot be ruled out. Studies have shown persistence of viral particles on inorganic surfaces for prolonged periods of time.\n\n【22】Aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 as compared with SARS-CoV-1.\n\n【23】A recent report from China suggested that fecal aerosol transmission in a high-rise building may have led to a community outbreak of COVID-19.\n\n【24】Probable evidence of fecal aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a high-rise building \\[published online ahead of print September 1, 2020\\].\n\n【25】These data have implications for community-spread for highly contagious viruses, especially in high-rise buildings with connected air-conditioning and sewage systems.\n\n【26】With data being inconclusive, there is a need for frequent air exchanges and consideration of installation of negative pressure systems while taking care of patients with COVID-19, especially while performing aerosol generating procedures. Another implication of these emerging data is the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for a commonly done procedure for recurrent _Clostridioides difficile_ infection, namely, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). _Clostridioides difficile_ infection is the most common bacterial infection in hospitals with high morbidity and mortality. Recurrent _C. difficile_ is extremely common with the risk being over 60% after 3 or more infections. Fecal microbiota transplantation reduces the risk of recurrent _C. difficile_ to less than 15%, owing to restoration of a disrupted microbiome. In 2020, microbiota-based therapies such as FMT are dependent on procurement of donor stool from well-screened donors ruling out microbiome-associated diseases and infections. With the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from stool and the presence of asymptomatic carriage, donors need to be reliably tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【27】Fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent clostridioides difficile infection: the COVID-19 Era.\n\n【28】In summary, current understanding of COVID-19 is steadily improving, with new data emerging day by day. Physicians should systematically collect, report, and publicly disseminate data on systemic involvement from COVID-19. Health care policy makers, patients, and the general population should stay abreast of these developments in a rapidly changing field.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": []}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:40", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:30:45", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:57:22"}

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS; or electronic cigarettes) could be a useful tool to reduce harm in the perioperative period. This pilot study examined the attitudes, beliefs, and practices of smokers scheduled for elective surgery regarding ENDS. This was a cross-sectional survey of current cigarette smokers who were evaluated in a preoperative clinic before elective surgery at Mayo Clinic. Measures included demographic characteristics, smoking history, 2 indices assessing the perception of how smoking affected health risks, ENDS use history, and 3 indices assessing interest in, perceived benefits of, and barriers to using ENDS in the perioperative period. Of the 112 smokers who completed the survey, 62 (55%) had tried ENDS and 24 (21%) reported current use. The most commonly stated reason for using ENDS was to quit smoking. Approximately 2 in 3 participants would be willing to use ENDS to help them reduce or eliminate perioperative cigarette use, and similar proportions perceived health benefits of doing so. Of the factors studied, only attempted to quit within the last year was significantly associated with increased interest in the perioperative use of ENDS ( _P_ \\=.03). Compared with participants who had tried ENDS (n=62), those who had never tried ENDS (n=50) had a significantly increased interest in the perioperative use of ENDS. A substantial proportion of patients scheduled for elective surgery had tried ENDS and would consider using ENDS to reduce perioperative use of cigarettes.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ENDS ( electronic nicotine delivery system ), NRT ( nicotine replacement therapy )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:40:56", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:41:02", "cost": 5.571}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:40", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:41:02", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:40:56"}

Retrospective extraction of ABI data and baseline echocardiographic data was performed. The primary outcome of interest was incident AF. The secondary outcomes of interest were incident ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 33,734 patients were included in the study. After adjusting for demographic and comorbidity variables, compared with patients who had normal ABI (1.0 to 1.39), there was an increased risk of incident AF in patients with low ABI (<1.0) (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.22) and elevated ABI (≥1.4) (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.31). The risk was greater in patients with increasing severity of PAD. Patients with abnormal ABIs had an increased risk of ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. We found that patients with PAD and incident AF have certain baseline echocardiographic abnormalities.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In this large cohort of ambulatory patients undergoing ABI measurement, patients with PAD were at increased risk for incident AF, ischemic stroke, and mortality. In these high-risk patients with abnormal ABI, particularly severe PAD and cardiac structural abnormalities, routine monitoring for AF and management of cardiovascular risk factors may be warranted.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ABI ( ankle-brachial index ), AF ( atrial fibrillation ), ARIC ( Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ), HR ( hazard ratio ), ICD ( International Classification of Diseases ), IL ( interleukin ), IQR ( interquartile range ), LAVI ( left atrial volume index ), LVEF ( left ventricular ejection fraction ), LVMI ( left ventricular mass index ), PAD ( peripheral arterial disease ), RVSP ( right ventricular systolic pressure )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:55:10", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:55:32", "cost": 21.22}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:40", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:55:31", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:55:09"}

Fox was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1958 and moved with his family to Port Coquitlam, British Columbia (25 km from Vancouver), in 1968. His parents and siblings noted that Terry was extremely competitive and stubborn from an early age. Despite his small size, he was named “athlete of the year” by his graduating high school class, and he enrolled in Simon Fraser University in Vancouver in 1976, where he studied kinesiology, played junior varsity basketball, and planned to become a physical education teacher.\n\n【1】Chronic leg pain after an automobile accident in November 1976 eventually led to the diagnosis of osteosarcoma involving Fox’s right leg in March 1977. He underwent an above-the-knee amputation, followed by more than a year of adjuvant chemotherapy at the BC Cancer Agency. Reportedly, one of Fox’s physicians told him that if he had been diagnosed a few years earlier, he would have received less effective chemotherapy with a poorer chance of long-term survival, which made Fox acutely aware of the importance of cancer research. He was upset when he learned of the limited cancer research funding in Canada at the time of his diagnosis and became motivated to act after witnessing some of the difficult experiences of his fellow patients with cancer.\n\n【2】Fox recovered remarkably quickly after his amputation and began to walk with a prosthesis less than a month after his surgery. He refused to consider himself disabled and joined a wheelchair basketball team a few months later, ultimately winning a national championship. After reading about Dick Traum, an amputee who completed the New York City Marathon in 1976, Fox decided to run the entire East-West length of Canada to raise money in support of cancer research. He trained relentlessly over 15 months, logging more than 3,000 running miles despite numerous injuries to his stump as well as his healthy leg, and he completed his first marathon (in British Columbia) in August 1979. He finished dead last but was loudly cheered by moved spectators. A letter-writing campaign resulted in early publicity for his transnational marathon plans, including donation of a support van by Ford and running shoes by Adidas, as well as the encouragement of the initially skeptical Canadian Cancer Society.\n\n【3】Fox’s “Marathon of Hope” began when he dipped his artificial leg in the Atlantic Ocean near St. John’s, Newfoundland, on April 12, 1980, and was intended to finish at the Pacific Ocean in Victoria, British Columbia, sometime in 1981. Initially, crowds along Fox's route were sparse and running was lonely. But, as time passed, interest escalated across the country. National media began extensive coverage of his quest, and his route was lined by well-wishers, donors, and fellow runners. Canadians of all ages followed his progress on television and were transfixed by his off-kilter stride and seemingly endless endurance. Fox never took a day off despite difficult weather, numerous injuries, careless drivers, and frequent arguments with his support team, which included his brother.\n\n【4】In late August 1980, Fox began to develop chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath, which resulted in hospitalization just outside of Thunder Bay in Western Ontario. He was found to have developed metastatic osteosarcoma in his lungs. By the time he had to abandon his marathon efforts, on September 1st—after running 143 consecutive days and covering more than 5,000 kilometers—he had raised $1.7 million for cancer research, and his story was known to millions of people in Canada and around the world.\n\n【5】Fox received numerous systemic treatments after his cancer recurred, including experimental interferon, but his disease progressed. Despite his weakened condition, he granted many interviews and continued to make appeals for cancer research funding until just before his death. On February 1, 1981, four months before his death, Fox achieved his original goal of raising $1 for every Canadian citizen; his Marathon of Hope Fund at the time totaled $24.17 million.\n\n【6】In September 1980, he became the youngest person ever to be named a Companion of the Order of Canada. The major research unit of the BC Cancer Agency in Vancouver received funds raised by the Marathon of Hope and was designated the “Terry Fox Laboratory” in 1981. After Fox died in June 1981, numerous roads, schools, athletic centers, parks, and fitness trails across Canada were named in his honor. A previously unnamed mountain in the Selkirk Range in British Columbia was christened Mount Terry Fox, and his story was dramatized in a film and in several books.\n\n【7】Since 1981, the Terry Fox Foundation has raised over $600 million for cancer research, and Fox has become an iconic figure for both disease advocates and disabled persons. The Terry Fox National School Run Day continues to involve thousands of schools and millions of students and teachers in Canada and across the world. In November 2004, Terry Fox was voted the second “Greatest Canadian of All Time” in a national poll organized by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n【8】Terry Fox has been honored twice philatelically by Canada. In 1982 (Scott #915), Fox became the first person ever to be depicted on a Canadian postage stamp without having been deceased for at least 10 years. He was included in Canada’s Millenium Series of postage stamps in January 2000 (Scott #1824) and was also the first individual Canadian depicted on a general circulation coin, a 2005 commemorative dollar.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:01:16", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:01:22", "cost": 5.664}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:40", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:01:22", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:01:16"}

At follow-up (8 years later at wave 5; 2010-11), participants were asked “if they had fallen down in the past 12 months” and, if so, “whether injured seriously enough (from the fall) to need medical treatment.” The outcome was categorized into 3 groups comprising “no fall,” “nonserious fall,” “fall requiring medical treatment (injurious fall).” Multinomial logistic regression was employed to examine the association between PA and risk of falls at follow-up. Covariates included age, sex, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, depressive symptoms, activity-limiting illness, and wealth. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22 (IBM, Inc. Armonk, NY).\n\n【20】At baseline, 9720 participants had complete data, although loss to follow-up (n=1848 died; n=3186 missing data at follow-up) resulted in a final analytic sample of n=4686 (age 63.2± 8.3 years; 44.1% men). At 8-year follow-up, 8.2% of the sample reported injurious falls that required medical treatment. Participants reporting falls were older, less likely to be male, physically inactive, reported activity-limiting illnesses, obese, and less affluent . In multivariate models, there was no association between PA and risk of a noninjurious fall . Participation in moderate PA at baseline was related to lower risk of an injurious fall in comparison with vigorous PA .

A cluster headache commonly awakens you in the middle of the night with intense pain in or around one eye on one side of your head.\n\n【2】Bouts of frequent attacks, known as cluster periods, can last from weeks to months, usually followed by remission periods when the headaches stop. During remission, no headaches occur for months and sometimes even years.\n\n【3】Fortunately, cluster headache is rare and not life-threatening. Treatments can make cluster headache attacks shorter and less severe. In addition, medications can reduce the number of cluster headaches you have.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】### Common signs and symptoms\n\n【6】A cluster headache strikes quickly, usually without warning, although you might first have migraine-like nausea and aura. Common signs and symptoms during a headache include:\n\n【7】*   Excruciating pain that is generally situated in, behind or around one eye, but may radiate to other areas of your face, head and neck\n*   One-sided pain\n*   Restlessness\n*   Excessive tearing\n*   Redness of your eye on the affected side\n*   Stuffy or runny nose on the affected side\n*   Forehead or facial sweating on the affected side\n*   Pale skin (pallor) or flushing on your face\n*   Swelling around your eye on the affected side\n*   Drooping eyelid on the affected side\n\n【8】People with cluster headache, unlike those with migraine, are likely to pace or sit and rock back and forth. Some migraine-like symptoms — including sensitivity to light and sound — can occur with a cluster headache, though usually on one side.\n\n【9】### Cluster period characteristics\n\n【10】A cluster period generally lasts for several weeks to months. The starting date and the duration of each cluster period might be consistent from period to period. For example, cluster periods can occur seasonally, such as every spring or every fall.\n\n【11】Most people have episodic cluster headaches. In episodic cluster headaches, the headaches occur for one week to a year, followed by a pain-free remission period lasting 3 months or longer before another cluster headache develops.\n\n【12】Chronic cluster periods might continue for more than a year, or pain-free periods might last less than one month.\n\n【13】During a cluster period:\n\n【14】*   Headaches usually occur every day, sometimes several times a day\n*   A single attack can last from 15 minutes to three hours\n*   The attacks often occur at the same time each day\n*   Most attacks occur at night, usually 1 to 2 hours after you go to bed\n\n【15】The pain usually ends as suddenly as it began, with rapidly decreasing intensity. After attacks, most people are pain-free but exhausted.\n\n【16】### When to see a doctor\n\n【17】**See your doctor** if you've just started to have cluster headaches to rule out other disorders and to find the most effective treatment.\n\n【18】Headache pain, even when severe, usually isn't the result of an underlying disease. But headaches can occasionally indicate a serious underlying medical condition, such as a brain tumor or rupture of a weakened blood vessel (aneurysm).\n\n【19】Additionally, if you have a history of headaches, see your doctor if the pattern changes or your headaches suddenly feel different.\n\n【20】**Seek emergency care** if you have any of these signs and symptoms:\n\n【21】*   An abrupt, severe headache, often like a thunderclap\n*   A headache with a fever, nausea or vomiting, a stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, numbness, or speaking difficulties, which can indicate a number of problems, including a stroke, meningitis, encephalitis or a brain tumor\n*   A headache after a head injury, even if it's a minor fall or bump, especially if it worsens\n*   A sudden, severe headache unlike any you've had\n*   A headache that worsens over days and changes in pattern\n\n【22】Causes\n------\n\n【23】The exact cause of cluster headaches is unknown, but cluster headache patterns suggest that abnormalities in the body's biological clock (hypothalamus) play a role.\n\n【24】Unlike migraine and tension headache, cluster headache generally isn't associated with triggers, such as foods, hormonal changes or stress.\n\n【25】Once a cluster period begins, however, drinking alcohol may quickly trigger a splitting headache. For this reason, many people with cluster headache avoid alcohol during a cluster period.\n\n【26】Other possible triggers include the use of medications such as nitroglycerin, a drug used to treat heart disease.\n\n【27】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【28】Risk factors for cluster headaches include:\n\n【29】*   **Sex.** Men are more likely to have cluster headaches.\n*   **Age.** Most people who develop cluster headaches are between ages 20 and 50, although the condition can develop at any age.\n*   **Smoking.** Many people who get cluster headache attacks are smokers. However, quitting smoking usually has no effect on the headaches.\n*   **Alcohol use.** If you have cluster headaches, drinking alcohol during a cluster period may increase your risk of an attack.\n*   **A family history.** Having a parent or sibling who has had cluster headache might increase your risk.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:06:51", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:07:00", "cost": 8.755}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:40", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:06:59", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:06:50"}

It is used to decrease the clotting ability of the blood and help prevent harmful clots from forming in blood vessels. This medicine is sometimes called a blood thinner, although it does not actually thin the blood. Heparin will not dissolve blood clots that have already formed, but it may prevent the clots from becoming larger and causing more serious problems.\n\n【3】Heparin is used to prevent or treat certain blood vessel, heart, and lung conditions. Heparin is also used to prevent blood clotting during open-heart surgery, bypass surgery, kidney dialysis, and blood transfusions. It is used in low doses to prevent the formation of blood clots in certain patients, especially those who must have certain types of surgery or who must remain in bed for a long time. Heparin may also be used to diagnose and treat a serious blood condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n【4】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【5】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【6】*   Solution\n\n【7】Before Using\n------------\n\n【8】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【9】### Allergies\n\n【10】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【11】### Pediatric\n\n【12】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of heparin injection in children. However, because heparin contains benzyl alcohol, use in newborn babies is not recommended.\n\n【13】### Geriatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of heparin injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to develop bleeding problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving heparin injection.\n\n【15】### Breastfeeding\n\n【16】Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.\n\n【17】### Drug Interactions\n\n【18】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【19】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

It is used to decrease the clotting ability of the blood and help prevent harmful clots from forming in blood vessels. This medicine is sometimes called a blood thinner, although it does not actually thin the blood. Heparin will not dissolve blood clots that have already formed, but it may prevent the clots from becoming larger and causing more serious problems.\n\n【3】Heparin is used to prevent or treat certain blood vessel, heart, and lung conditions. Heparin is also used to prevent blood clotting during open-heart surgery, bypass surgery, kidney dialysis, and blood transfusions. It is used in low doses to prevent the formation of blood clots in certain patients, especially those who must have certain types of surgery or who must remain in bed for a long time. Heparin may also be used to diagnose and treat a serious blood condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n【4】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【5】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【6】*   Solution\n\n【7】Before Using\n------------\n\n【8】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【9】### Allergies\n\n【10】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【11】### Pediatric\n\n【12】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of heparin injection in children. However, because heparin contains benzyl alcohol, use in newborn babies is not recommended.\n\n【13】### Geriatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of heparin injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to develop bleeding problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving heparin injection.\n\n【15】### Breastfeeding\n\n【16】Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.\n\n【17】### Drug Interactions\n\n【18】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【19】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Possible infectious causes include common bacterial pathogens (anaerobic, aerobic, or mixed), mycobacteria (tuberculous or nontuberculous), filamentous bacteria ( _Nocardia_ and _Actinomyces_ ), and fungal organisms (endemic mycosis: histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, or blastomycosis). A careful microbiological evaluation, including Gram, acid fast, and fungal stains and bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal nucleic acid amplification testing, and cultures of sputum and bronchial secretions are needed to evaluate most focal cavitary lung lesions. In this otherwise healthy patient with a relatively short antecedent history, as well as a background of infrequent binge drinking, a bacterial lung abscess is the most likely differential diagnosis, pending further diagnostic workup. Endemic or filamentous fungal infections are possible and need to be excluded. Tuberculosis is less likely given the absence of travel or known exposures.\n\n【17】Cavitary lung lesions also occur in systemic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and the presence of extrapulmonary disease manifestations should be assessed in these patients. Serologic testing for rheumatoid factor, anticitrullinated peptide antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) is valuable in the evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis and GPA.\n\n【18】Diagnostic value of standardized assays for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in idiopathic systemic vasculitis: EC/BCR Project for ANCA Assay Standardization.\n\n【19】Various neoplasms, such as bronchogenic carcinomas, lymphomas, and metastatic malignant tumors, also frequently cause focal cavitary lung lesions. Bronchoscopy with biopsy of the cavitary lesion should be performed if a malignant tumor is suspected. Lastly, focal cavitary lung lesions are rarely caused by pulmonary infarcts due to septic or pulmonary thromboembolic disease.\n\n【20】The results of sputum microbial stains and cultures, human immunodeficiency virus and fungal serologic testing, purified protein derivative skin testing, and _M tuberculosis_ interferon γ release testing were all negative. The ANCA testing revealed low-positive anti–proteinase-3 (PR3) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (1.0 units; reference range, 0-0.9 units). However, the result of ANCA testing by indirect immunofluorescence on ethanol-fixed neutrophils and PR3-transfected human mast cells was negative. Bronchoscopy demonstrated no endobronchial abnormalities, and endobronchial ultrasonography–guided biopsy of the cavitary lesion revealed acute inflammation with negative microbial stains.

Lung abscess: update on microbiology and management \\[published online ahead or print January 13, 2012\\]. _Am J Ther_ .\n\n【37】However, given the frequent use of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, the diagnostic yield of bacterial cultures remains suboptimal. Consequently, regardless of the bacterial organisms isolated from the respiratory tract, antibiotic treatment for lung abscess generally includes broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\n【38】In this patient, _Actinomyces_ , a branching (filamentous), gram-positive bacillus, and _Veillonella,_ a gram-negative anaerobic coccus, both part of the normal intestinal and oral flora, were isolated from the respiratory tract. Penicillin G represents the first-line therapy for both of these organisms. Nevertheless, given the limited yield of bacterial cultures and the polymicrobial nature of these infections, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is indicated for this patient. Treatment options include clindamycin and β-lactam antibiotics with anaerobic coverage, such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or carbapenems. Metronidazole is not preferred for treating lung abscesses. It has little activity against actinomyces and the microaerophilic streptococci commonly found in abscesses. There is no established duration of antibiotic therapy. Therapy is typically continued until there is notable or total radiologic response, usually for several months. Surgical resection is infrequently needed for patients without radiologic and/or clinical improvement despite appropriate antibiotic therapy or to manage complications such as major hemoptysis.\n\n【39】The patient was prescribed outpatient intravenous ertapenem therapy. After an initial radiologic and clinical improvement, her abscess cavity did not decrease further after 3 months of treatment. In addition, her fever and cough returned after the transition from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy. Consequently, she underwent surgical resection of her refractory lung abscess. Unfortunately, because of the hilar location of the lesion, she required a left pneumonectomy. The initial pathology was interpreted as an abscess cavity. All stains and cultures were negative, and antimicrobial therapy was discontinued.\n\n【40】Six weeks later she experienced recurrent fevers and abdominal pain. Repeated chest CT demonstrated the expected postoperative changes but no new abnormalities. Abdominal CT revealed 2 complex cavitary mass lesions—in the left pelvis involving the iliac artery and in the right kidney. Blood and urine culture results were negative, and the lesions progressed despite the reinitiation of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. She subsequently underwent complex multispecialty abdominal surgery for decortication of both lesions and vascular bypass of the compressed left iliac artery. The results of cultures and microbial stains remained negative. Histopathologic analysis of the renal lesion demonstrated extensive areas of geographic ne-crosis, numerous neutrophilic microabscesses, and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. In addition, pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis was present within the renal parenchyma.\n\n【41】*   **3.**\n\n【42】    **Which _one_ of the following tests would be _most helpful_ in confirming the clinically suspected diagnosis in this patient?**\n\n【43】    *   a.\n\n【44】        Repeated ANCA testing\n\n【45】    *   b.\n\n【46】        Repeated bronchoscopy with biopsy\n\n【47】    *   c.\n\n【48】        Repeated _M tuberculosis_ interferon γ release testing\n\n【49】    *   d.\n\n【50】        Repeated fungal serologic testing\n\n【51】    *   e.\n\n【52】        Angiotensin-converting enzyme level\n\n【53】The lack of clinical response to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and negative results from cultures of surgically removed tissue suggest a noninfectious inflammatory process. Histopathologic changes of geographic necrosis, neutrophilic microabscesses, and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, the presence of crescentic glomerulonephritis, and the previously low-positive PR3-ANCA test result are highly suggestive of GPA. On the basis of these observations, ANCA testing, which usually involves a stepwise approach, should be repeated in this patient. The PR3- and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCAs are measured using an antigen-specific assay, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. If PR3- and/or MPO-ANCAs are detected, the sample is further evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence staining of ethanol-fixed neutrophils. The staining pattern is generally categorized as cytoplasmic or perinuclear ANCA. Positive PR3-ANCA results are typically associated with a cytoplasmic ANCA pattern, whereas MPO-ANCAs result in a perinuclear ANCA pattern. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of a combined positive PR3-ANCA result and cytoplasmic ANCAs for GPA are excellent (73% and 99%, respectively).\n\n【54】Diagnostic value of standardized assays for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in idiopathic systemic vasculitis: EC/BCR Project for ANCA Assay Standardization.\n\n【55】There are 2 major classification systems for the vasculitides. The American College of Rheumatology criteria, published in 1990, require the presence of 2 or more of the following 4 criteria: nasal or oral inflammation, an abnormal chest radiograph finding (nodules, fixed infiltrates, or cavities), an abnormal urinalysis result (microscopic hematuria), and evidence of granulomatous arterial or perivascular inflammation on biopsy. The presence of 2 or more criteria has a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 92% for diagnosing GPA. The Chapel Hill Consensus criteria, published in 1994, were created for the purposes of identifying pathologic differences among the different vasculitides. These criteria defined GPA as a granulomatous inflammation involving the respiratory tract with a vasculitis of small to medium vessels. Neither system includes the presence of ANCAs as a requirement to fulfill the disease definition. Given her cavitary lung lesion and biopsy-proven granulomatous disease, our patient met criteria for GPA under the American College of Rheumatology classification and fulfilled the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference definition of GPA. Consequently, a diagnosis of GPA was established.\n\n【56】Repeated chest CT did not reveal any new pulmonary processes; therefore, repeated bronchoscopy with biopsy would not be indicated. However, reevaluation of the prior lung pathology in light of the additional information is essential. It too demonstrated geographic necrosis, neutrophilic microabscesses, and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, adding further support to the clinical diagnosis of GPA. Repeating the _M tuberculosis_ interferon γ release assay, performing more fungal serologic tests, or measuring an angiotensin-converting enzyme level would not be helpful in this patient.\n\n【57】The results of repeated ANCA testing for PR3-ANCA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (2.5 units; reference range, 0-0.9 units; previously 1.0 unit) and cytoplasmic ANCA by indirect immunofluorescence were now clearly positive (1:8), and a diagnosis of GPA was established.\n\n【58】*   **4.**\n\n【59】    **Which _one_ of the following statements is _true_ in regard to the cause of the GPA in this patient?**\n\n【60】    *   a.\n\n【61】        Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding PR3 are found in approximately 90% of cases of GPA\n\n【62】    *   b.\n\n【63】        Special stains frequently demonstrate organisms within the necrotizing granulomas of GPA\n\n【64】    *   c.\n\n【65】        The upper airway of patients with GPA is commonly colonized with _S aureus_\n\n【66】    *   d.\n\n【67】        Therapy with azithromycin may decrease the number of exacerbations in GPA patients\n\n【68】    *   e.\n\n【69】        ANCA seroconversion is only seen with the vasculitides\n\n【70】The pathogenesis of GPA remains unclear, and GPA is classified as an idiopathic small vessel vasculitis. Multiple genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors have been associated with the development of GPA. However, no definite causal genetic or environmental exposure has been identified. Multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in PR3, but none of these is routinely associated with GPA. Microbial stain results are typically negative for the necrotizing granulomas associated with GPA. In this patient, the cavitary lung lesion and positive culture results for _Actinomyces_ and _Veillonella_ from within the lesion, in conjunction with a clinical and radiologic response to appropriate antibiotic therapy, are highly suggestive of a lung abscess. Interestingly, over time the patient’s therapeutic progress stalled, and the disease progressed despite surgical site control and antimicrobial therapy, indicating a transition to a noninfectious inflammatory process.\n\n【71】Infections are not uncommonly reported before the initial presentation or exacerbations of GPA cases. Patients with GPA are more likely to carry _S aureus_ in their nasal passages than age-matched controls. These carriers are at higher risk for disease flares, and therapy with a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole may prevent these events. The putative mechanisms for the benefit of trimoxazole-sulfamethoxazole remain speculative. Azithromycin has some anti-inflammatory properties and has been found to reduce exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis, follicular bronchiolitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but not in GPA. Several systemic infections, including bacterial endocarditis, may mimic the clinical presentation of GPA and cause ANCA seroconversion. Consequently, it is crucial to exclude systemic infections before establishing a diagnosis of GPA.\n\n【72】*   **5.**\n\n【73】    **Which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ next step in managing this patient’s GPA?**\n\n【74】    *   a.\n\n【75】        Because the disease has been resected, observe and repeat imaging in 1 month\n\n【76】    *   b.\n\n【77】        Immunosuppression with prednisone alone\n\n【78】    *   c.\n\n【79】        Immunosuppression with prednisone and cyclophosphamide\n\n【80】    *   d.\n\n【81】        Immunosuppression with prednisone and methotrexate\n\n【82】    *   e.\n\n【83】        Immunosuppression with prednisone and rituximab (anti-CD20 chimeric antibody)\n\n【84】The goal of immunosuppressive therapy in GPA is to treat acute inflammation and prevent irreversible organ damage and mortality. The mortality of untreated severe GPA approaches 90% at 2 years; however, combination therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide improves long-term survival to closer to 80%.\n\n【85】Wegener granulomatosis: an analysis of 158 patients.\n\n【86】Consequently, once a diagnosis of GPA has been established, it should be treated promptly and aggressively. Selection of optimal treatment regimen for GPA is based on disease extent (nonsevere disease \\[limited\\] vs severe), stage (remission induction vs remission maintenance), and patient-specific risk of treatment-associated adverse effects. Our patient is a young woman of childbearing age who needs remission induction therapy for a new diagnosis of severe GPA (given the pauci-immune glomerulonephritis). Despite the crucial role of corticosteroids in controlling acute inflammation in patients with GPA, the long-term effects of corticosteroid monotherapy are suboptimal. Historically, combination therapy with high-dose corticosteroids tapered during 3 to 6 months in combination with 3 to 6 months of either oral or pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide was considered the standard of care for these patients.\n\n【87】Wegener granulomatosis: an analysis of 158 patients.\n\n【88】However, the use of cyclophosphamide has been associated with major acute and chronic adverse events. Patients frequently develop severe leukopenia in the short term, which has been associated with a high risk of severe, potentially life-threatening acute infections or acute hemorrhagic cystitis. Long-term adverse effects of cyclophosphamide include an increased risk for hematologic and solid malignant tumors, including bladder cancer, and irreversible infertility.\n\n【89】Methotrexate is not indicated for remission induction therapy in patients with severe GPA. However, it effectively induces remission in nonsevere disease and can be used for remission maintenance therapy. On the basis of the results of a recent clinical trial demonstrating the noninferiority of B-cell depletion therapy with the humanized anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in combination with corticosteroids compared with cyclophosphamide in severe GPA, the Food and Drug Administration approved rituximab as the first-line agent for remission induction therapy of GPA.\n\n【90】Rituximab versus cyclophosphamide for ANCA-associated vasculitis.\n\n【91】Rituximab has a more favorable adverse effect profile, especially in younger patients. Our patient was successfully treated with high-dose corticosteroids and rituximab therapy (375 mg/m  for 4 doses in weekly intervals).\n\n【92】Discussion\n----------\n\n【93】Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) is a small vessel vasculitis, part of the spectrum of ANCA-associated vasculitides, which also includes microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic GPA (Churg-Strauss syndrome), and renal-limited vasculitis. It is a rare disease, with an incidence of approximately 3.0 per 100,000 persons in the United States.\n\n【94】The epidemiology of Wegener's granulomatosis: estimates of the five-year period prevalence, annual mortality, and geographic disease distribution from population-based data sources.\n\n【95】Clinical presentation of GPA is highly variable and can include constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, arthralgias, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss) and organ-specific symptoms (eg, hemoptysis, cavitary lung nodules or masses, sinusitis, hematuria, palpable purpura, and mononeuritis multiplex). The most commonly affected organs are the upper and lower respiratory tract and the kidneys.\n\n【96】The cause of GPA remains poorly defined and is likely multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors. In the case described, an antibiotic-responsive polymicrobial lung abscess preceded the clinical development of GPA and ANCA seroconversion. It is possible that the prior infection triggered the autoimmune process. Chronic smoldering inflammation (in our case due to polymicrobial infection with _Actinomyces_ and _Veillonella_ sp) may result in persistent neutrophil activation, autoantigen presentation (PR3), and the subsequent generation of ANCA targeting PR3. Interestingly, although low-grade chronic inflammation is relatively common, the development of vasculitis is rarely seen, indicating that host and pathogen-specific factors likely contribute to the development of autoimmunity.\n\n【97】The association between GPA and _S aureus_ is well established. Commonly, _S aureus_ colonizes patients with GPA and represents an independent risk factor for disease relapse (relative risk, 7.2).\n\n【98】Association of chronic nasal carriage of _Staphylococcus aureus_ and higher relapse rates in Wegener granulomatosis.\n\n【99】The chances of developing vasculitis may be further augmented through immune activation by _S aureus_ superantigens. Associations among other infective agents have been much less frequently reported.\n\n【100】Whereas ANCAs represent a valuable diagnostic marker, their role in the disease pathogenesis remains controversial. Putative mechanisms include neutrophil activation followed by release of proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species, mediated by binding of ANCAs to the PR3 on activated neutrophils. Over time, ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation may result in damage to vascular endothelium and surrounding tissues.\n\n【101】Active GPA needs to be treated promptly and aggressively with high-dose corticosteroids in conjunction with other immunosuppressive agents. Severe (ie, life or organ threatening) disease is treated with either rituximab or cyclophosphamide, whereas nonsevere disease may be treated with methotrexate. The successful induction of remission is typically based on the comprehensive clinical assessment of all organ manifestations and systemic symptoms. To help with this assessment, clinical scoring systems, such as the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for GPA, have been developed to measure disease activity. Aggressive therapy results in disease remission in approximately 90% of patients. Once remission is achieved, the goal of therapy becomes remission maintenance. Preferred medications for maintenance therapy are azathioprine and methotrexate, which have similar safety and efficacy profiles.\n\n【102】Azathioprine or methotrexate maintenance for ANCA-associated vasculitis.\n\n【103】In contrast, a recent study demonstrated mycophenolate mofetil to be less efficacious.\n\n【104】Mycophenolate mofetil vs azathioprine for remission maintenance in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【105】Recent retrospective case series also suggest a potential role of rituximab for remission maintenance therapy, and an international, prospective randomized controlled trial is being developed.\n\n【106】Despite remission maintenance therapy, 30% to 60% of patients will experience disease relapses.\n\n【107】Wegener granulomatosis: an analysis of 158 patients.\n\n【108】Risk factors for relapse include persistent ANCA positivity, upper respiratory tract and lung involvement, and airway colonization with _S aureus_ . To assess for relapse, patients are monitored closely, approximately every 3 to 4 months, on disease remission. At these visits, patients undergo history, physical examination, urinanalysis with microscopy (to assess for hematuria), chest radiography (to assess for new pulmonary nodules), and a comprehensive laboratory evaluation measuring serum creatinine, electrolytes, complete blood cell count, liver function, sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and B cells in patients treated with rituximab. Even though ANCA testing is frequently performed, increases of ANCA levels are poor predictors of relapses in patients treated with conventional immunosuppression.\n\n【109】Antiproteinase 3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and disease activity in Wegener granulomatosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【36】Yazbeck MF, Dahdel M, Kalra A, Browne AS, Pratter MR.

On the basis of these observations, ANCA testing, which usually involves a stepwise approach, should be repeated in this patient. The PR3- and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCAs are measured using an antigen-specific assay, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

The American College of Rheumatology criteria, published in 1990, require the presence of 2 or more of the following 4 criteria: nasal or oral inflammation, an abnormal chest radiograph finding (nodules, fixed infiltrates, or cavities), an abnormal urinalysis result (microscopic hematuria), and evidence of granulomatous arterial or perivascular inflammation on biopsy. The presence of 2 or more criteria has a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 92% for diagnosing GPA. The Chapel Hill Consensus criteria, published in 1994, were created for the purposes of identifying pathologic differences among the different vasculitides. These criteria defined GPA as a granulomatous inflammation involving the respiratory tract with a vasculitis of small to medium vessels. Neither system includes the presence of ANCAs as a requirement to fulfill the disease definition. Given her cavitary lung lesion and biopsy-proven granulomatous disease, our patient met criteria for GPA under the American College of Rheumatology classification and fulfilled the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference definition of GPA.

Multiple genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors have been associated with the development of GPA. However, no definite causal genetic or environmental exposure has been identified. Multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in PR3, but none of these is routinely associated with GPA. Microbial stain results are typically negative for the necrotizing granulomas associated with GPA. In this patient, the cavitary lung lesion and positive culture results for _Actinomyces_ and _Veillonella_ from within the lesion, in conjunction with a clinical and radiologic response to appropriate antibiotic therapy, are highly suggestive of a lung abscess. Interestingly, over time the patient’s therapeutic progress stalled, and the disease progressed despite surgical site control and antimicrobial therapy, indicating a transition to a noninfectious inflammatory process.\n\n【71】Infections are not uncommonly reported before the initial presentation or exacerbations of GPA cases. Patients with GPA are more likely to carry _S aureus_ in their nasal passages than age-matched controls. These carriers are at higher risk for disease flares, and therapy with a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole may prevent these events. The putative mechanisms for the benefit of trimoxazole-sulfamethoxazole remain speculative. Azithromycin has some anti-inflammatory properties and has been found to reduce exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis, follicular bronchiolitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but not in GPA. Several systemic infections, including bacterial endocarditis, may mimic the clinical presentation of GPA and cause ANCA seroconversion. Consequently, it is crucial to exclude systemic infections before establishing a diagnosis of GPA.\n\n【72】*   **5.**\n\n【73】    **Which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ next step in managing this patient’s GPA?**\n\n【74】    *   a.\n\n【75】        Because the disease has been resected, observe and repeat imaging in 1 month\n\n【76】    *   b.\n\n【77】        Immunosuppression with prednisone alone\n\n【78】    *   c.\n\n【79】        Immunosuppression with prednisone and cyclophosphamide\n\n【80】    *   d.\n\n【81】        Immunosuppression with prednisone and methotrexate\n\n【82】    *   e.\n\n【83】        Immunosuppression with prednisone and rituximab (anti-CD20 chimeric antibody)\n\n【84】The goal of immunosuppressive therapy in GPA is to treat acute inflammation and prevent irreversible organ damage and mortality. The mortality of untreated severe GPA approaches 90% at 2 years; however, combination therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide improves long-term survival to closer to 80%.\n\n【85】Wegener granulomatosis: an analysis of 158 patients.\n\n【86】Consequently, once a diagnosis of GPA has been established, it should be treated promptly and aggressively. Selection of optimal treatment regimen for GPA is based on disease extent (nonsevere disease \\[limited\\] vs severe), stage (remission induction vs remission maintenance), and patient-specific risk of treatment-associated adverse effects. Our patient is a young woman of childbearing age who needs remission induction therapy for a new diagnosis of severe GPA (given the pauci-immune glomerulonephritis). Despite the crucial role of corticosteroids in controlling acute inflammation in patients with GPA, the long-term effects of corticosteroid monotherapy are suboptimal. Historically, combination therapy with high-dose corticosteroids tapered during 3 to 6 months in combination with 3 to 6 months of either oral or pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide was considered the standard of care for these patients.\n\n【87】Wegener granulomatosis: an analysis of 158 patients.\n\n【88】However, the use of cyclophosphamide has been associated with major acute and chronic adverse events. Patients frequently develop severe leukopenia in the short term, which has been associated with a high risk of severe, potentially life-threatening acute infections or acute hemorrhagic cystitis. Long-term adverse effects of cyclophosphamide include an increased risk for hematologic and solid malignant tumors, including bladder cancer, and irreversible infertility.\n\n【89】Methotrexate is not indicated for remission induction therapy in patients with severe GPA. However, it effectively induces remission in nonsevere disease and can be used for remission maintenance therapy. On the basis of the results of a recent clinical trial demonstrating the noninferiority of B-cell depletion therapy with the humanized anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in combination with corticosteroids compared with cyclophosphamide in severe GPA, the Food and Drug Administration approved rituximab as the first-line agent for remission induction therapy of GPA.\n\n【90】Rituximab versus cyclophosphamide for ANCA-associated vasculitis.\n\n【91】Rituximab has a more favorable adverse effect profile, especially in younger patients. Our patient was successfully treated with high-dose corticosteroids and rituximab therapy (375 mg/m  for 4 doses in weekly intervals).\n\n【92】Discussion\n----------\n\n【93】Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) is a small vessel vasculitis, part of the spectrum of ANCA-associated vasculitides, which also includes microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic GPA (Churg-Strauss syndrome), and renal-limited vasculitis. It is a rare disease, with an incidence of approximately 3.0 per 100,000 persons in the United States.\n\n【94】The epidemiology of Wegener's granulomatosis: estimates of the five-year period prevalence, annual mortality, and geographic disease distribution from population-based data sources.\n\n【95】Clinical presentation of GPA is highly variable and can include constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, arthralgias, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss) and organ-specific symptoms (eg, hemoptysis, cavitary lung nodules or masses, sinusitis, hematuria, palpable purpura, and mononeuritis multiplex). The most commonly affected organs are the upper and lower respiratory tract and the kidneys.\n\n【96】The cause of GPA remains poorly defined and is likely multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors. In the case described, an antibiotic-responsive polymicrobial lung abscess preceded the clinical development of GPA and ANCA seroconversion. It is possible that the prior infection triggered the autoimmune process. Chronic smoldering inflammation (in our case due to polymicrobial infection with _Actinomyces_ and _Veillonella_ sp) may result in persistent neutrophil activation, autoantigen presentation (PR3), and the subsequent generation of ANCA targeting PR3. Interestingly, although low-grade chronic inflammation is relatively common, the development of vasculitis is rarely seen, indicating that host and pathogen-specific factors likely contribute to the development of autoimmunity.\n\n【97】The association between GPA and _S aureus_ is well established. Commonly, _S aureus_ colonizes patients with GPA and represents an independent risk factor for disease relapse (relative risk, 7.2).\n\n【98】Association of chronic nasal carriage of _Staphylococcus aureus_ and higher relapse rates in Wegener granulomatosis.\n\n【99】The chances of developing vasculitis may be further augmented through immune activation by _S aureus_ superantigens. Associations among other infective agents have been much less frequently reported.\n\n【100】Whereas ANCAs represent a valuable diagnostic marker, their role in the disease pathogenesis remains controversial. Putative mechanisms include neutrophil activation followed by release of proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species, mediated by binding of ANCAs to the PR3 on activated neutrophils. Over time, ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation may result in damage to vascular endothelium and surrounding tissues.\n\n【101】Active GPA needs to be treated promptly and aggressively with high-dose corticosteroids in conjunction with other immunosuppressive agents. Severe (ie, life or organ threatening) disease is treated with either rituximab or cyclophosphamide, whereas nonsevere disease may be treated with methotrexate. The successful induction of remission is typically based on the comprehensive clinical assessment of all organ manifestations and systemic symptoms. To help with this assessment, clinical scoring systems, such as the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for GPA, have been developed to measure disease activity. Aggressive therapy results in disease remission in approximately 90% of patients. Once remission is achieved, the goal of therapy becomes remission maintenance. Preferred medications for maintenance therapy are azathioprine and methotrexate, which have similar safety and efficacy profiles.\n\n【102】Azathioprine or methotrexate maintenance for ANCA-associated vasculitis.\n\n【103】In contrast, a recent study demonstrated mycophenolate mofetil to be less efficacious.\n\n【104】Mycophenolate mofetil vs azathioprine for remission maintenance in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【105】Recent retrospective case series also suggest a potential role of rituximab for remission maintenance therapy, and an international, prospective randomized controlled trial is being developed.\n\n【106】Despite remission maintenance therapy, 30% to 60% of patients will experience disease relapses.\n\n【107】Wegener granulomatosis: an analysis of 158 patients.\n\n【108】Risk factors for relapse include persistent ANCA positivity, upper respiratory tract and lung involvement, and airway colonization with _S aureus_ . To assess for relapse, patients are monitored closely, approximately every 3 to 4 months, on disease remission. At these visits, patients undergo history, physical examination, urinanalysis with microscopy (to assess for hematuria), chest radiography (to assess for new pulmonary nodules), and a comprehensive laboratory evaluation measuring serum creatinine, electrolytes, complete blood cell count, liver function, sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and B cells in patients treated with rituximab. Even though ANCA testing is frequently performed, increases of ANCA levels are poor predictors of relapses in patients treated with conventional immunosuppression.\n\n【109】Antiproteinase 3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and disease activity in Wegener granulomatosis.", "index": -1, "show": true, "start": -1, "end": 172, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【87】Wegener granulomatosis: an analysis of 158 patients.", "content": "【0】30-Year-Old Woman With Dyspnea, Cough, Hemoptysis, and a Cavitary Lung Lesion\nA previously healthy 30-year-old woman presented with a 6-week history of progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough.

She experienced no improvement with azithromycin as empirical treatment for community-acquired pneumonia and presented to the emergency department.\n\n【1】Her vital signs and physical examination findings were normal. Chest radiography revealed a left upper lobe opacity, which was further characterized as a 7×5×4-cm perihilar cavity on chest computed tomography (CT). She was a smoker and admitted to infrequent binge drinking. She denied prior syncope, aspiration, dental disease, recent travel, illicit drug use, and _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ , occupational, or environmental exposures.

Possible infectious causes include common bacterial pathogens (anaerobic, aerobic, or mixed), mycobacteria (tuberculous or nontuberculous), filamentous bacteria ( _Nocardia_ and _Actinomyces_ ), and fungal organisms (endemic mycosis: histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, or blastomycosis). A careful microbiological evaluation, including Gram, acid fast, and fungal stains and bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal nucleic acid amplification testing, and cultures of sputum and bronchial secretions are needed to evaluate most focal cavitary lung lesions. In this otherwise healthy patient with a relatively short antecedent history, as well as a background of infrequent binge drinking, a bacterial lung abscess is the most likely differential diagnosis, pending further diagnostic workup. Endemic or filamentous fungal infections are possible and need to be excluded. Tuberculosis is less likely given the absence of travel or known exposures.\n\n【17】Cavitary lung lesions also occur in systemic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and the presence of extrapulmonary disease manifestations should be assessed in these patients. Serologic testing for rheumatoid factor, anticitrullinated peptide antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) is valuable in the evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis and GPA.\n\n【18】Diagnostic value of standardized assays for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in idiopathic systemic vasculitis: EC/BCR Project for ANCA Assay Standardization.\n\n【19】Various neoplasms, such as bronchogenic carcinomas, lymphomas, and metastatic malignant tumors, also frequently cause focal cavitary lung lesions. Bronchoscopy with biopsy of the cavitary lesion should be performed if a malignant tumor is suspected. Lastly, focal cavitary lung lesions are rarely caused by pulmonary infarcts due to septic or pulmonary thromboembolic disease.\n\n【20】The results of sputum microbial stains and cultures, human immunodeficiency virus and fungal serologic testing, purified protein derivative skin testing, and _M tuberculosis_ interferon γ release testing were all negative. The ANCA testing revealed low-positive anti–proteinase-3 (PR3) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (1.0 units; reference range, 0-0.9 units). However, the result of ANCA testing by indirect immunofluorescence on ethanol-fixed neutrophils and PR3-transfected human mast cells was negative. Bronchoscopy demonstrated no endobronchial abnormalities, and endobronchial ultrasonography–guided biopsy of the cavitary lesion revealed acute inflammation with negative microbial stains.

They were the only organisms isolated in 50% of cases.\n\n【34】Bacteriology and treatment of primary lung abscess.\n\n【35】Commonly isolated organisms include both anaerobic ( _Peptostreptococcus_ , _Bacteroides_ , _Fusobacterium,_ and _Veillonella_ ) and aerobic ( _Streptococcus milleri_ , S _taphylococcus aureus,_ and _Klebsiella_ sp) bacteria.\n\n【36】Yazbeck MF, Dahdel M, Kalra A, Browne AS, Pratter MR. Lung abscess: update on microbiology and management \\[published online ahead or print January 13, 2012\\]. _Am J Ther_ .\n\n【37】However, given the frequent use of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, the diagnostic yield of bacterial cultures remains suboptimal. Consequently, regardless of the bacterial organisms isolated from the respiratory tract, antibiotic treatment for lung abscess generally includes broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\n【38】In this patient, _Actinomyces_ , a branching (filamentous), gram-positive bacillus, and _Veillonella,_ a gram-negative anaerobic coccus, both part of the normal intestinal and oral flora, were isolated from the respiratory tract. Penicillin G represents the first-line therapy for both of these organisms. Nevertheless, given the limited yield of bacterial cultures and the polymicrobial nature of these infections, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is indicated for this patient. Treatment options include clindamycin and β-lactam antibiotics with anaerobic coverage, such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or carbapenems. Metronidazole is not preferred for treating lung abscesses. It has little activity against actinomyces and the microaerophilic streptococci commonly found in abscesses. There is no established duration of antibiotic therapy. Therapy is typically continued until there is notable or total radiologic response, usually for several months. Surgical resection is infrequently needed for patients without radiologic and/or clinical improvement despite appropriate antibiotic therapy or to manage complications such as major hemoptysis.\n\n【39】The patient was prescribed outpatient intravenous ertapenem therapy. After an initial radiologic and clinical improvement, her abscess cavity did not decrease further after 3 months of treatment. In addition, her fever and cough returned after the transition from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy. Consequently, she underwent surgical resection of her refractory lung abscess. Unfortunately, because of the hilar location of the lesion, she required a left pneumonectomy. The initial pathology was interpreted as an abscess cavity. All stains and cultures were negative, and antimicrobial therapy was discontinued.\n\n【40】Six weeks later she experienced recurrent fevers and abdominal pain. Repeated chest CT demonstrated the expected postoperative changes but no new abnormalities. Abdominal CT revealed 2 complex cavitary mass lesions—in the left pelvis involving the iliac artery and in the right kidney. Blood and urine culture results were negative, and the lesions progressed despite the reinitiation of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. She subsequently underwent complex multispecialty abdominal surgery for decortication of both lesions and vascular bypass of the compressed left iliac artery. The results of cultures and microbial stains remained negative. Histopathologic analysis of the renal lesion demonstrated extensive areas of geographic ne-crosis, numerous neutrophilic microabscesses, and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. In addition, pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis was present within the renal parenchyma.\n\n【41】*   **3.**\n\n【42】    **Which _one_ of the following tests would be _most helpful_ in confirming the clinically suspected diagnosis in this patient?**\n\n【43】    *   a.\n\n【44】        Repeated ANCA testing\n\n【45】    *   b.\n\n【46】        Repeated bronchoscopy with biopsy\n\n【47】    *   c.\n\n【48】        Repeated _M tuberculosis_ interferon γ release testing\n\n【49】    *   d.\n\n【50】        Repeated fungal serologic testing\n\n【51】    *   e.\n\n【52】        Angiotensin-converting enzyme level\n\n【53】The lack of clinical response to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and negative results from cultures of surgically removed tissue suggest a noninfectious inflammatory process.

Despite the crucial role of corticosteroids in controlling acute inflammation in patients with GPA, the long-term effects of corticosteroid monotherapy are suboptimal. Historically, combination therapy with high-dose corticosteroids tapered during 3 to 6 months in combination with 3 to 6 months of either oral or pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide was considered the standard of care for these patients.\n\n【87】Wegener granulomatosis: an analysis of 158 patients.\n\n【88】However, the use of cyclophosphamide has been associated with major acute and chronic adverse events. Patients frequently develop severe leukopenia in the short term, which has been associated with a high risk of severe, potentially life-threatening acute infections or acute hemorrhagic cystitis. Long-term adverse effects of cyclophosphamide include an increased risk for hematologic and solid malignant tumors, including bladder cancer, and irreversible infertility.\n\n【89】Methotrexate is not indicated for remission induction therapy in patients with severe GPA. However, it effectively induces remission in nonsevere disease and can be used for remission maintenance therapy. On the basis of the results of a recent clinical trial demonstrating the noninferiority of B-cell depletion therapy with the humanized anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in combination with corticosteroids compared with cyclophosphamide in severe GPA, the Food and Drug Administration approved rituximab as the first-line agent for remission induction therapy of GPA.\n\n【90】Rituximab versus cyclophosphamide for ANCA-associated vasculitis.\n\n【91】Rituximab has a more favorable adverse effect profile, especially in younger patients. Our patient was successfully treated with high-dose corticosteroids and rituximab therapy (375 mg/m  for 4 doses in weekly intervals).\n\n【92】Discussion\n----------\n\n【93】Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) is a small vessel vasculitis, part of the spectrum of ANCA-associated vasculitides, which also includes microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic GPA (Churg-Strauss syndrome), and renal-limited vasculitis. It is a rare disease, with an incidence of approximately 3.0 per 100,000 persons in the United States.\n\n【94】The epidemiology of Wegener's granulomatosis: estimates of the five-year period prevalence, annual mortality, and geographic disease distribution from population-based data sources.\n\n【95】Clinical presentation of GPA is highly variable and can include constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, arthralgias, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss) and organ-specific symptoms (eg, hemoptysis, cavitary lung nodules or masses, sinusitis, hematuria, palpable purpura, and mononeuritis multiplex). The most commonly affected organs are the upper and lower respiratory tract and the kidneys.\n\n【96】The cause of GPA remains poorly defined and is likely multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors. In the case described, an antibiotic-responsive polymicrobial lung abscess preceded the clinical development of GPA and ANCA seroconversion. It is possible that the prior infection triggered the autoimmune process. Chronic smoldering inflammation (in our case due to polymicrobial infection with _Actinomyces_ and _Veillonella_ sp) may result in persistent neutrophil activation, autoantigen presentation (PR3), and the subsequent generation of ANCA targeting PR3. Interestingly, although low-grade chronic inflammation is relatively common, the development of vasculitis is rarely seen, indicating that host and pathogen-specific factors likely contribute to the development of autoimmunity.\n\n【97】The association between GPA and _S aureus_ is well established. Commonly, _S aureus_ colonizes patients with GPA and represents an independent risk factor for disease relapse (relative risk, 7.2).\n\n【98】Association of chronic nasal carriage of _Staphylococcus aureus_ and higher relapse rates in Wegener granulomatosis.\n\n【99】The chances of developing vasculitis may be further augmented through immune activation by _S aureus_ superantigens. Associations among other infective agents have been much less frequently reported.\n\n【100】Whereas ANCAs represent a valuable diagnostic marker, their role in the disease pathogenesis remains controversial. Putative mechanisms include neutrophil activation followed by release of proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species, mediated by binding of ANCAs to the PR3 on activated neutrophils. Over time, ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation may result in damage to vascular endothelium and surrounding tissues.\n\n【101】Active GPA needs to be treated promptly and aggressively with high-dose corticosteroids in conjunction with other immunosuppressive agents. Severe (ie, life or organ threatening) disease is treated with either rituximab or cyclophosphamide, whereas nonsevere disease may be treated with methotrexate. The successful induction of remission is typically based on the comprehensive clinical assessment of all organ manifestations and systemic symptoms. To help with this assessment, clinical scoring systems, such as the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for GPA, have been developed to measure disease activity. Aggressive therapy results in disease remission in approximately 90% of patients. Once remission is achieved, the goal of therapy becomes remission maintenance. Preferred medications for maintenance therapy are azathioprine and methotrexate, which have similar safety and efficacy profiles.\n\n【102】Azathioprine or methotrexate maintenance for ANCA-associated vasculitis.\n\n【103】In contrast, a recent study demonstrated mycophenolate mofetil to be less efficacious.\n\n【104】Mycophenolate mofetil vs azathioprine for remission maintenance in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【105】Recent retrospective case series also suggest a potential role of rituximab for remission maintenance therapy, and an international, prospective randomized controlled trial is being developed.\n\n【106】Despite remission maintenance therapy, 30% to 60% of patients will experience disease relapses.\n\n【107】Wegener granulomatosis: an analysis of 158 patients.\n\n【108】Risk factors for relapse include persistent ANCA positivity, upper respiratory tract and lung involvement, and airway colonization with _S aureus_ . To assess for relapse, patients are monitored closely, approximately every 3 to 4 months, on disease remission. At these visits, patients undergo history, physical examination, urinanalysis with microscopy (to assess for hematuria), chest radiography (to assess for new pulmonary nodules), and a comprehensive laboratory evaluation measuring serum creatinine, electrolytes, complete blood cell count, liver function, sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and B cells in patients treated with rituximab. Even though ANCA testing is frequently performed, increases of ANCA levels are poor predictors of relapses in patients treated with conventional immunosuppression.\n\n【109】Antiproteinase 3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and disease activity in Wegener granulomatosis.", "index": 17259, "show": true, "start": 17246, "end": 17302, "province": ["语义有效性", "语句/字词重复"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:02:39", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:03:58", "cost": 78.301}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:40", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:03:57", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:02:38"}

In muscular dystrophy, abnormal genes (mutations) interfere with the production of proteins needed to form healthy muscle.\n\n【2】There are many kinds of muscular dystrophy. Symptoms of the most common variety begin in childhood, mostly in boys. Other types don't surface until adulthood.\n\n【3】There's no cure for muscular dystrophy. But medications and therapy can help manage symptoms and slow the course of the disease.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The main sign of muscular dystrophy is progressive muscle weakness. Specific signs and symptoms begin at different ages and in different muscle groups, depending on the type of muscular dystrophy.\n\n【6】### Duchenne type muscular dystrophy\n\n【7】This is the most common form. Although girls can be carriers and mildly affected, it's much more common in boys.\n\n【8】Signs and symptoms, which typically appear in early childhood, might include:\n\n【9】*   Frequent falls\n*   Difficulty rising from a lying or sitting position\n*   Trouble running and jumping\n*   Waddling gait\n*   Walking on the toes\n*   Large calf muscles\n*   Muscle pain and stiffness\n*   Learning disabilities\n*   Delayed growth\n\n【10】### Becker muscular dystrophy\n\n【11】Signs and symptoms are similar to those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but tend to be milder and progress more slowly. Symptoms generally begin in the teens but might not occur until the mid-20s or later.\n\n【12】### Other types of muscular dystrophy\n\n【13】Some types of muscular dystrophy are defined by a specific feature or by where in the body symptoms begin. Examples include:\n\n【14】*   **Myotonic.** This is characterized by an inability to relax muscles following contractions. Facial and neck muscles are usually the first to be affected. People with this form typically have long, thin faces; drooping eyelids; and swanlike necks.\n*   **Facioscapulohumeral (FSHD).** Muscle weakness typically begins in the face, hip and shoulders. The shoulder blades might stick out like wings when arms are raised. Onset usually occurs in the teenage years but can begin in childhood or as late as age 50.\n*   **Congenital.** This type affects boys and girls and is apparent at birth or before age 2. Some forms progress slowly and cause only mild disability, while others progress rapidly and cause severe impairment.\n*   **Limb-girdle.** Hip and shoulder muscles are usually affected first. People with this type of muscular dystrophy might have difficulty lifting the front part of the foot and so might trip frequently. Onset usually begins in childhood or the teenage years.\n\n【15】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【16】Seek medical advice if you notice signs of muscle weakness — such as increased clumsiness and falling — in you or your child.\n\n【17】Causes\n------\n\n【18】Certain genes are involved in making proteins that protect muscle fibers. Muscular dystrophy occurs when one of these genes is defective.\n\n【19】Each form of muscular dystrophy is caused by a genetic mutation particular to that type of the disease. Most of these mutations are inherited.\n\n【20】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【21】Muscular dystrophy occurs in both sexes and in all ages and races. However, the most common variety, Duchenne, usually occurs in young boys. People with a family history of muscular dystrophy are at higher risk of developing the disease or passing it on to their children.\n\n【22】Complications\n-------------\n\n【23】The complications of progressive muscle weakness include:\n\n【24】*   **Trouble walking.** Some people with muscular dystrophy eventually need to use a wheelchair.\n*   **Trouble using arms.** Daily activities can become more difficult if the muscles of the arms and shoulders are affected.\n*   **Shortening of muscles or tendons around joints (contractures).** Contractures can further limit mobility.\n*   **Breathing problems.** Progressive weakness can affect the muscles associated with breathing. People with muscular dystrophy might eventually need to use a breathing assistance device (ventilator), initially at night but possibly also during the day.\n*   **Curved spine (scoliosis).** Weakened muscles might be unable to hold the spine straight.\n*   **Heart problems.** Muscular dystrophy can reduce the efficiency of the heart muscle.\n*   **Swallowing problems.** If the muscles involved with swallowing are affected, nutritional problems and aspiration pneumonia can develop.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【26】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【27】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【28】*   Blood or bone marrow problems (eg, agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia) or\n*   Colitis (inflammation in gut), history of or\n*   Diarrhea, severe, history of or\n*   Heart rhythm problems (eg, arrhythmia)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【29】*   Kidney disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【30】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【31】A nurse or other trained health professional will give you or your child this medicine. This medicine is given as a shot into a muscle or a vein.\n\n【32】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【33】Your doctor will check your or your child's progress closely while you are receiving this medicine. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【34】If your or your child's symptoms do not improve within a few days, or if they become worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【35】Cefotaxime injection may cause diarrhea, and in some cases it can be severe. Do not take any medicine or give medicine to your child to treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor. Diarrhea medicines may make the diarrhea worse or make it last longer. If you have any questions about this or if mild diarrhea continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【36】Cefotaxime injection can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【37】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【38】Before you or your child have any medical tests, tell the medical doctor in charge that you are receiving this medicine. The results of some tests may be affected by this medicine.\n\n【39】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【40】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【41】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.

Levofloxacin was administered orally and/or intravenously and adjusted to renal function in the inpatient setting. The primary outcome measure was sustained ventricular tachycardia recorded electrocardiographically.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】With a median time from the start of levofloxacin use to hospital discharge (or death) of 4 days (range, 1-94 days), only 2 patients (0.2%; 95% CI, 0.0%-0.7%) experienced the primary outcome of sustained ventricular tachycardia after the initiation of levofloxacin use.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In this study, the short-term risk for sustained ventricular tachycardia in patients with a prolonged QTc who subsequently received levofloxacin was very rare. These results suggest that levofloxacin may be a safe option in patients with prolonged QTc; however, studies with longer follow-up are needed.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ECG ( electrocardiogram ), HERG ( human-a-go-go-ether-related gene ), QTc ( corrected QT interval )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:58:10", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:58:19", "cost": 9.252}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:40", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:58:19", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:58:06"}

Data were obtained by retrospective medical record analysis.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】The study comprised 47 patients with renal (n=34) and hepatic (n=13) functioning allografts. Median time to cardiac surgery from transplantation was 79 months. The most common procedures were as follows: coronary artery bypass grafting, 22 (47%); aortic valve procedures, 11 (23%); and mitral valve procedures, 5 (11%). One patient (2%) died within 30 days of surgery. Renal allograft dysfunction was noted in 5 renal patients (15%) immediately after surgery. Two patients required dialysis postoperatively, 1 of whom required continued dialysis on dismissal. Transient allograft dysfunction, as determined by elevated liver enzyme levels, occurred in 6 hepatic patients (46%). However, all hepatic patients had functional allografts on dismissal. Two patients (4%) developed leg wound infections, and 9 (19%) had respiratory complications. No sternal or mediastinal infection occurred. One- and 5-year survival rates (mean ± SEM) for all patients were 93%±4% and 76%±8%, respectively. Of the renal patients, 1- and 5-year survival rates (mean ± SEM) were 97%±3% and 82%±8%, respectively. One- and 5-year survival rates (mean ± SEM) for hepatic patients were 77%±12% and 69%±13%, respectively.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Cardiac surgery can be performed safely in kidney and liver transplant recipients, with low early mortality and excellent medium-term survival. In almost all instances, allograft function is well preserved.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】CABG ( coronary artery bypass grafting ), NYHA ( New York Heart Association )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:17:33", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:17:38", "cost": 5.52}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:40", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:17:38", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:11:21"}

Tetanus is a serious illness that causes convulsions (seizures) and severe muscle spasms that can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. Tetanus causes death in 30 to 40 percent of cases.\n\n【4】In recent years, two thirds of all tetanus cases have been in persons 50 years of age and older. A tetanus infection in the past does not make you immune to tetanus in the future.\n\n【5】Tetanus immune globulin works by giving your body the antibodies it needs to protect it against tetanus infection. This is called passive protection. This passive protection lasts long enough to protect your body until your body can produce its own antibodies against tetanus.\n\n【6】Tetanus immune globulin is to be administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Solution\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

The diagnosis was based on the presence of a “ringed esophagus” or a tapered distal esophagus on upper endoscopy as well as the presence of a dense eosinophilic infiltrate on esophageal biopsy. All patients were treated with topical corticosteroids, and follow-up was performed by telephone interviews.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】The 17 men and 4 women ranged in age from 28 years to 55 years at diagnosis (mean, 40 years). All had solid-food dysphagia for at least 6 years, and 15 patients had prior food impaction. Eighteen patients had either a ringed-appearing esophagus or smooth tapering in the distal esophagus. All patients had a dense eosinophilic infiltration (>20 eosinophils per high-power field) in the mid or distal esophagus. Topical corticosteroid therapy for 6 weeks resulted in complete dysphagia relief in all patients and lasted a minimum of 4 months.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】Eosinophilic esophagitis is an entity associated with food dysphagia (predominantly in young adults) and a ringed or smooth tapered distal-appearing esophagus.

It happens when a germ-fighting protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in the kidneys. This causes a type of swelling called inflammation that, over time, can make it harder for the kidneys to filter waste from the blood.\n\n【2】IgA nephropathy often becomes worse slowly over years. But the course of the disease varies from person to person. Some people leak blood into their urine without having other problems. Others might have complications such as losing kidney function and spilling protein into the urine. Still others develop kidney failure, which means the kidneys stop working well enough to filter the body's waste on their own.\n\n【3】There's no cure for IgA nephropathy, but medicines can slow how quickly it becomes worse. Some people need treatment to lower inflammation, reduce the spilling of protein into the urine and prevent the kidneys from failing. Such treatments may help the disease become not active, a state called remission. Keeping blood pressure under control and lowering cholesterol also slow the disease.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】IgA nephropathy often doesn't cause symptoms early on. You might not notice any health effects for 10 years or more. Sometimes, routine medical tests find signs of the disease, such as protein and red blood cells in the urine that are seen under a microscope.\n\n【6】When IgA nephropathy causes symptoms, they might include:\n\n【7】*   Cola- or tea-colored urine caused by blood. You might notice these color changes after a cold, sore throat or respiratory infection.\n*   Blood that can be seen in the urine.\n*   Foamy urine from protein leaking into the urine. This is called proteinuria.\n*   Pain on one or both sides of the back below the ribs.\n*   Swelling in the hands and feet called edema.\n*   High blood pressure.\n*   Weakness and tiredness.\n\n【8】If the disease leads to kidney failure, symptoms may include:\n\n【9】*   Rashes and itchy skin.\n*   Muscle cramps.\n*   Upset stomach and vomiting.\n*   Less appetite.\n*   Metallic taste in the mouth.\n*   Confusion.\n\n【10】Kidney failure is life-threatening without treatment. But dialysis or a kidney transplant can help people live for many more years.\n\n【11】### When to see a doctor\n\n【12】See your doctor if you think you have symptoms of IgA nephropathy. It's key to get a checkup if you notice blood in your urine. Various conditions can cause this symptom. But if it keeps happening or it doesn't go away, it might be a sign of a serious health problem. Also see your doctor if you notice sudden swelling in your hands or feet.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】The kidneys are two bean-shaped, fist-sized organs located at the small of the back, one on each side of the spine. Each kidney contains tiny blood vessels called glomeruli. These vessels filter waste, extra water and other substances from the blood. Then the filtered blood goes back into the bloodstream. The waste products pass into the bladder and out of the body in urine.\n\n【15】Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is a type of protein called an antibody. The immune system makes IgA to help attack germs and fight infections. But with IgA nephropathy, this protein collects in the glomeruli. This causes inflammation and affects their filtering ability over time.\n\n【16】Researchers don't know exactly what causes IgA to build up in the kidneys. But the following things might be linked with it:\n\n【17】*   **Genes.** IgA nephropathy is more common in some families and in certain ethnic groups, such as people of Asian and European descent.\n*   **Liver diseases.** These include scarring of the liver called cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B and C infections.\n*   **Celiac disease.** Eating gluten, a protein found in most grains, triggers this digestive condition.\n*   **Infections.** These include HIV and some bacterial infections.\n\n【18】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【19】The exact cause of IgA nephropathy is unknown. But these factors might raise the risk of getting it:\n\n【20】*   **Sex.** In North America and Western Europe, IgA nephropathy affects at least twice as many men as it does women.\n*   **Ethnicity.** IgA nephropathy is more common in white people and people of Asian descent than it is in Black people.\n*   **Age.** IgA nephropathy most often develops between the mid-teens and mid-30s.\n*   **Family history.** IgA nephropathy appears to run in some families.\n\n【21】Complications\n-------------\n\n【22】The course of IgA nephropathy varies from person to person. Some people have the disease for years with few or no problems. Many don't get diagnosed. Other people develop one or more of the following complications:\n\n【23】*   **High blood pressure.** Damage to the kidneys from IgA buildup can raise blood pressure. And high blood pressure can do more damage to the kidneys.\n*   **High cholesterol.** High levels of cholesterol can raise the risk of a heart attack.\n*   **Acute kidney failure.** If the kidneys can't filter blood well enough due to buildup of IgA, levels of waste products rise quickly in the blood. And if kidney function gets worse very quickly, health care professionals may use the term rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.\n*   **Chronic kidney disease.** IgA nephropathy can cause the kidneys to stop working over time. Then a treatment called dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed to live.\n*   **Nephrotic syndrome.** This is a group of problems that can be caused by damage to the glomeruli. The problems can include high urine protein levels, low blood protein levels, high cholesterol and lipids, and swelling of the eyelids, feet and stomach area.\n\n【24】Prevention\n----------\n\n【25】You can't prevent IgA nephropathy. Talk with your doctor if you have a family history of the disease. Ask what you can do to keep your kidneys healthy. For example, it helps to lower high blood pressure and keep cholesterol at healthy levels.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:04:00", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:04:16", "cost": 16.734}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:40", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:04:15", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:03:58"}

If these occur, do not drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not able to see well. If these eye changes are bothersome, check with your doctor.\n\n【47】While you are using latanoprost, the iris (colored part) of your treated eye may slowly become more brown in color. This is more likely to happen if you have blue-brown, gray-brown, green-brown, or yellow-brown eyes. You may notice this change usually within several months or years from the start of treatment. You may also have darkening of the eyelid skin color or longer, thicker, and darker eyelashes. These changes to the iris, eyelid, and lashes may be permanent even if you stop using latanoprost. However, any of these changes will affect only the eye being treated with latanoprost. Check with your doctor if you have any concerns about this.\n\n【48】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【49】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.

Logistic regression models for the odds of any improvement in score as a function of aqueductal CSF flow and separate models for any improvement in gait, incontinence, cognition, and total score were constructed.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Forty-two patients (86%) had improvement in gait at postoperative follow-up (mean, 10 months). Of the 32 patients with incontinence, 27 (69%) improved. Of the 36 patients with cognitive impairment, 16 (44%) improved. In univariate and fully adjusted models, increased CSF flow through the aqueduct was not significantly associated with improvement or the magnitude of improvement in gait, cognition, or incontinence. Thirty-six patients underwent high-volume lumbar puncture preoperatively, of whom 5 (14%) had no response. The aqueductal CSF flow rates of these 5 patients were significantly higher than those of the patients who improved after lumbar puncture. Postoperative complications occurred in 15 patients. The aqueductal CSF flow rates in these 15 patients were not significantly different from those of patients who experienced no complications.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】Among patients who underwent VPS for the treatment of NPH, measurement of CSF flow through the cerebral aqueduct did not reliably predict which patients would improve after shunting or the magnitude of improvement.\n\n【8】CSF ( cerebrospinal fluid ), CT ( computed tomography ), LP ( lumbar puncture ), MR ( magnetic resonance ), NPH ( normal-pressure hydrocephalus ), VPS ( ventriculoperitoneal shunting )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:33:43", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:33:51", "cost": 7.468}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:40", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:33:50", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:33:42"}

It also is known as talk therapy, counseling, psychosocial therapy or, simply, therapy.\n\n【2】During psychotherapy, you learn about your specific issues and how your thoughts, emotions and behaviors affect your moods. Talk therapy helps you learn how to take control of your life and respond to challenging situations with healthy coping skills.\n\n【3】There are many types of psychotherapy. The type that's right for you depends on your situation.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Psychotherapy can help treat most mental health issues, including:\n\n【6】*   **Anxiety disorders,** such as social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), phobias, panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n*   **Mood disorders,** such as depression or bipolar disorder.\n*   **Addictions,** such as alcohol use disorder, drug dependence or compulsive gambling.\n*   **Eating disorders,** such as anorexia or bulimia.\n*   **Personality disorders,** such as borderline personality disorder or dependent personality disorder.\n*   **Schizophrenia** or other disorders that cause detachment from reality.\n\n【7】Not everyone who benefits from psychotherapy is diagnosed with a mental illness. Psychotherapy can help with the stresses and conflicts of life that can affect anyone.\n\n【8】For example, psychotherapy may help you:\n\n【9】*   **Resolve conflicts** with your partner or someone else in your life.\n*   **Relieve anxiety or stress** due to work or other situations.\n*   **Cope with major life changes,** such as divorce, the death of a loved one or the loss of a job.\n*   **Learn to manage unhealthy reactions,** such as road rage or other aggressive behavior.\n*   **Come to terms with an ongoing or serious health issue,** such as diabetes, cancer or long-term pain.\n*   **Recover from physical or sexual abuse** or witnessing violence.\n*   **Cope with sexual problems,** whether they're due to a physical or psychological cause.\n*   **Sleep better** if you have trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep.\n\n【10】In some cases, psychotherapy can be as effective as medicines, such as antidepressants. But depending on your situation, talk therapy alone may not be enough to ease the symptoms of a mental health condition. You also may need medicines or other treatments.\n\n【11】Risks\n-----\n\n【12】Psychotherapy generally involves little risk. But because it can explore painful feelings and experiences, you may feel emotionally uncomfortable at times. A skilled therapist who can meet your needs can minimize any risks.\n\n【13】Learning coping skills can help you manage and conquer negative feelings and fears.\n\n【14】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【15】Here's how to get started:\n\n【16】*   **Find a qualified mental health therapist.** Get a referral from a health care provider, health insurance plan, friend or another trusted source. Many employers offer counseling services or referrals through employee assistance programs, also known as EAPs. Or you can find a therapist on your own. You could start by looking for a professional association on the internet. Look for a therapist who has skills and training in the area that you need help addressing.\n*   **Understand the costs.** If you have health insurance, find out what coverage is available for psychotherapy. Some health plans cover only a certain number of psychotherapy sessions a year. Also, talk to your therapist about fees and payment options.\n*   **Review your concerns.** Before your first appointment, think about what issues you'd like to work on. You also can sort this out with your therapist but having some sense in advance may provide a good starting point.\n\n【17】### Check qualifications\n\n【18】Before seeing a psychotherapist, check the person's background, education, certification, and licensing. Psychotherapist is a general term rather than a job title or an indication of education, training or licensure.\n\n【19】Trained psychotherapists may have different job titles, depending on their education and role. Most have a master's or doctoral degree with training in psychological counseling. Medical doctors specializing in mental health are known as psychiatrists. They can prescribe medicines, and some may provide psychotherapy.\n\n【20】Examples of psychotherapists include:\n\n【21】*   Psychologists.\n*   Psychiatrists.\n*   Licensed professional counselors.\n*   Licensed social workers.\n*   Licensed marriage and family therapists.\n*   Psychiatric nurses.\n*   Other licensed professionals with mental health training.\n\n【22】Make sure that the therapist you choose meets state certification and licensing requirements. The key is to find a skilled therapist who can match the type and intensity of therapy with your needs.\n\n【23】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【24】### Your first therapy session\n\n【25】At the first psychotherapy session, the therapist usually gathers information about you and your needs. You may be asked to fill out forms about your physical and emotional health. It might take a few sessions for your therapist to fully understand your situation and concerns and determine the best course of action.\n\n【26】The first session is also an opportunity for you to interview your therapist. You'll be able to see whether the therapist's approach and personality are going to work for you. Make sure you understand:\n\n【27】*   What type of therapy will be used.\n*   The goals of your treatment.\n*   How long each session will be.\n*   How many therapy sessions you may need.\n\n【28】Ask questions anytime during your appointment. If you don't feel comfortable with the first therapist you see, try someone else. Having a good fit with your therapist is critical for effective treatment.\n\n【29】### Starting psychotherapy\n\n【30】You'll likely meet your therapist weekly or every other week for 45 minutes to one hour. These sessions could be held in the therapist's office, or you could meet during a video visit. Psychotherapy also can take place in a hospital if you've been admitted for treatment. In the hospital, psychotherapy focuses on safety and becoming more mentally and emotionally stable.\n\n【31】### Types of psychotherapy\n\n【32】Some types of psychotherapy work better than others in treating certain disorders and conditions. Your therapist will consider your situation and preferences to determine which approach or combination of approaches is best for you.\n\n【33】Some psychotherapy methods proven effective include:\n\n【34】*   **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),** which helps you identify unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and learn healthier coping skills.\n*   **Dialectical behavior therapy,** a type of CBT that teaches behavioral skills to help you handle stress, manage your emotions and improve your relationships with others.\n*   **Acceptance and commitment therapy,** which helps you become aware of and accept your thoughts and feelings. It also helps you commit to making changes and improves your ability to cope with, and adjust to, challenging situations.\n*   **Psychodynamic and psychoanalysis therapies,** which focus on increasing your awareness of thoughts and behaviors that you may not be aware of. These therapies help you find out what motivates you and help you resolve conflicts.\n*   **Interpersonal psychotherapy,** which focuses on problems with your relationships with other people to improve how you relate to others, such as family, friends and co-workers.\n*   **Supportive psychotherapy,** which improves your ability to cope with stress and difficult situations.\n\n【35】Online apps are available that use several methods.\n\n【36】Psychotherapy formats include individual, couple, family or group sessions. These formats can be effective for all age groups.\n\n【37】### During psychotherapy\n\n【38】For most types of psychotherapy, your therapist encourages you to talk about your thoughts and feelings and what's troubling you. Don't worry if you find it hard to open up about your feelings. Your therapist can help you gain more confidence and comfort as time goes on.\n\n【39】Because psychotherapy sometimes involves intense emotional discussions, you may find yourself crying, becoming upset or even having an angry outburst during a session. You also may feel physically exhausted after a session. Your therapist can help you cope with these feelings and emotions.\n\n【40】After a session, your therapist may ask you to do specific activities or practice what you learned. Over time, discussing your concerns can improve your mood and change the way you think and feel about yourself. It also can improve your ability to cope with problems.\n\n【41】### Confidentiality\n\n【42】Except in rare cases, conversations with your therapist are confidential. But a therapist may break confidentiality if there's an immediate threat to safety or when state or federal law requires reporting concerns to authorities. Your therapist can answer questions about confidentiality.\n\n【43】### Length of psychotherapy\n\n【44】The number of psychotherapy sessions you need and how frequently you need to see your therapist depends on factors such as:\n\n【45】*   Your mental health issues.\n*   Severity of your symptoms.\n*   How long you've had symptoms or have been dealing with your mental health issues.\n*   How quickly you make progress toward your treatment goals.\n*   How much stress you're experiencing.\n*   How much your mental health concerns interfere with daily life.\n*   How much support you receive from family members and others.\n*   Cost and insurance limitations.\n\n【46】The length of psychotherapy sessions also can depend on the method used. For example, cognitive behavioral therapy consists of a shorter course of treatment. But dialectical behavior therapy can take longer. Your therapist can help you understand how long treatment will take.\n\n【47】It may take only weeks to help you cope with a short-term issue. Or treatment may last a year or longer if you have a long-term mental health issue or other long-term concerns.\n\n【48】Results\n-------\n\n【49】Psychotherapy may not cure your condition or make an unpleasant situation go away. But it can give you the power to cope in a healthy way and feel better about yourself and your life.\n\n【50】### Getting the most out of psychotherapy\n\n【51】To get the most out of psychotherapy, take these steps:\n\n【52】*   **Make sure you feel comfortable with your therapist.** If you aren't comfortable, look for another therapist who can make you feel more at ease.\n*   **Approach therapy as a partnership.** Psychotherapy is most effective when you actively participate and share in decision-making. Make sure you and your therapist agree about the major issues and how to work on them. Together, you can set goals and measure progress over time.\n*   **Be open and honest.** Success depends on your willingness to share your thoughts, feelings and experiences. It also depends on whether you're willing to consider new insights, ideas and ways of doing things. If you hesitate to talk about certain issues because of painful emotions, embarrassment or fears about your therapist's reaction, let your therapist know.\n*   **Follow your treatment plan.** If you feel down or lack motivation, it may be tempting to skip psychotherapy sessions. But doing so can slow your progress. Try to attend all sessions and think about what you want to discuss.\n*   **Don't expect instant results.** Working on emotional issues can be painful, and it may require hard work. You may need several sessions before you begin to improve.\n*   **Do your homework between sessions.** If your therapist asks you to document your thoughts in a journal or practice coping skills outside of your therapy sessions, follow through. These assignments can help you apply what you've learned in the therapy sessions.\n*   **If psychotherapy isn't helping, talk to your therapist.** If you don't feel that you're benefiting from therapy after several sessions, talk to your therapist about it. You and your therapist may decide to make some changes or try a different approach that may be more effective.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:55:12", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:56:59", "cost": 106.144}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:40", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:56:56", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:55:10"}

However, its occurrence in patients treated for osteoporosis is rare. Although poor oral hygiene and invasive dental procedures have been identified as potential triggers, little is known about the role of other systemic risk factors. We describe a patient who developed ONJ after her first treatment with denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of NF-κB ligand. This patient had several comorbidities that prompted us to assess the German ONJ registry for the incidence of comorbidities in patients with ONJ. In summary, almost half of the patients (35 of 86 \\[41%\\]) had 1 or more risk factors thought to increase the risk of ONJ. In conclusion, comorbidities or comedications may increase the susceptibility of developing ONJ during osteoporosis therapy.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ONJ ( osteonecrosis of the jaw )\n\n【4】Antiresorptive therapy using bisphosphonates is a well-established therapy for benign and malignant bone diseases. More recently, denosumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against receptor activator of NF-κB ligand, has also been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis and bone metastases. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a well-known complication of antiresorptive therapy for malignant bone diseases, such as skeletal metastases, affecting up to 8% of treated patients.\n\n【5】Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw: report of a task force of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.\n\n【6】However, ONJ rarely occurs in patients treated for osteoporosis, which is thought to be related to the lower cumulative dose of the antiresorptive agent and additional host-related factors. It may be triggered by invasive procedures and promoted by poor oral hygiene, but little is known about the prevalence of comorbidities and comedications in these patients.\n\n【7】Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw: report of a task force of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.\n\n【8】After having identified an index case of ONJ after treatment with denosumab, we assessed the German ONJ registry to define the role of relevant risk factors for ONJ during osteoporosis treatment in the absence of cancer. The patient’s file was analyzed for medical history, history of present illness, medications, and laboratory findings to identify potential risk factors for ONJ. Subsequently, we analyzed the German ONJ registry, which contains 1196 adjudicated cases of ONJ. All the cases had been documented using a predefined questionnaire.\n\n【9】Case Report\n-----------\n\n【10】We describe a 75-year-old woman in whom ONJ developed after the first subcutaneous injection of denosumab. She had previously sustained osteoporotic fractures of the proximal humerus and the hip while taking alendronate, 70 mg/wk, for more than 3 years. Her medical history included unclassified inflammatory bowel disease, previous glucocorticoid therapy, impaired renal function with a glomerular filtration rate of 50 mL/min, and chronic anemia for decades without the need for transfusions. The Fracture Risk Algorithm (FRAX) score assessment predicted a 28% risk of experiencing a major osteoporotic fracture during the next 10 years.\n\n【11】FRAX and its applications to clinical practice.\n\n【12】Treatment was switched to denosumab (60 mg subcutaneously). Two months later, development of ONJ of the right lower jaw required surgical débridement and antibiotic drug treatment. She reported no invasive dental procedure preceding the occurrence of ONJ. The diagnosis of ONJ was made by an experienced oral surgeon based on clinical and radiographic findings and was histologically confirmed by 2 independent pathologists.\n\n【13】Owing to the long duration of antiresorptive therapy before denosumab therapy, the cause of ONJ in this patient is likely to be continued suppression of bone remodeling. Until now, the incidence of ONJ associated with denosumab use for osteoporosis seems to be very low. To our knowledge, only 2 patients with ONJ have been reported, both occurring in the crossover group from the extension of the FREEDOM trial.\n\n【14】Five years of denosumab exposure in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis: results from the first two years of the FREEDOM extension.\n\n【15】On further evaluation, she was found to have heterozygous β-thalassemia with a hemoglobin level of 5.8 mmol/L (reference range, 7.4-10.7 mmol/L; to convert hemoglobin to g/dl, multiply by 0.6206) and mild to moderate iron overload\n\n【16】Iron overload in human disease.\n\n【17】based on a serum ferritin level of 665 μg/L (reference range, 30-400 μg/L; to convert ferritin to pmol/L, multiply by 2.247). Alternative osteoporosis therapies were discussed, but the patient preferred to continue denosumab therapy and did not report fractures or ONJ during the 14 months of follow-up with 2 subsequent injections.\n\n【18】Of the 1196 cases of ONJ in the registry, 86 were associated with osteoporosis treatment in the absence of cancer. All the patients had received bisphosphonates, including alendronate in 63% (n=54), ibandronate in 14% (n=12), and zoledronic acid in 11% (n=9). More than half of the patients (50 of 86 \\[58%\\]) underwent invasive dental or jaw bone procedures preceding the development of ONJ. Mean bisphosphonate exposure before ONJ diagnosis was 31 months (range, 1-102 months). Thirty-five of 86 patients (41%) had 1 or more comorbidities, such as current systemic glucocorticoid therapy (n=22; 26%), chronic obstructive lung disease or current smoking (n=8; 9%), diabetes mellitus (n=5; 6%), or hematologic disorders (n=6; 7%), as described in the present case. Although an association with ONJ has not yet been described, β-thalassemia is associated with a high risk of osteoporotic fractures, and alterations of the bone microenvironment and disturbed bone remodeling by iron overload have been implicated.\n\n【19】Thalassemia Clinical Research Network  \nBone disease in thalassemia: a frequent and still unresolved problem.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【21】Findings from this case, the first with denosumab in Germany, and the registry data emphasize the role of comorbidities in the pathogenesis of ONJ.

You may experience a broken foot during a car crash or from a simple misstep or fall.\n\n【2】The seriousness of a broken foot varies. Fractures can range from tiny cracks in your bones to breaks that pierce your skin.\n\n【3】Treatment for a broken foot depends on the exact site and severity of the fracture. A severely broken foot may require surgery to implant plates, rods or screws into the broken bone to maintain proper position during healing.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】If you have a broken foot, you may experience some of the following signs and symptoms:\n\n【6】*   Immediate, throbbing pain\n*   Pain that increases with activity and decreases with rest\n*   Swelling\n*   Bruising\n*   Tenderness\n*   Deformity\n*   Difficulty in walking or bearing weight\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】See a doctor if there is obvious deformity, if the pain and swelling don't get better with self-care, or if the pain and swelling gets worse over time. Also, see a doctor if the injury interferes with walking.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】The most common causes of a broken foot include:\n\n【11】*   **Car accidents.** The crushing injuries common in car accidents may cause breaks that require surgical repair.\n*   **Falls.** Tripping and falling can break bones in your feet, as can landing on your feet after jumping down from just a slight height.\n*   **Impact from a heavy weight.** Dropping something heavy on your foot is a common cause of fractures.\n*   **Missteps.** Sometimes just putting your foot down wrong can result in a broken bone. A toe can get broken from stubbing your toes on furniture.\n*   **Overuse.** Stress fractures are common in the weight-bearing bones of your feet. These tiny cracks are usually caused over time by repetitive force or overuse, such as running long distances. But they can also occur with normal use of a bone that's been weakened by a condition such as osteoporosis.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】You may be at higher risk of a broken foot or ankle if you:\n\n【14】*   **Participate in high-impact sports.** The stresses, direct blows and twisting injuries that occur in sports such as basketball, football, gymnastics, tennis and soccer can causes foot fractures.\n*   **Use improper technique or sports equipment.** Faulty equipment, such as shoes that are too worn or not properly fitted, can contribute to stress fractures and falls. Improper training techniques, such as not warming up and stretching, also can cause foot injuries.\n*   **Suddenly increase your activity level.** Whether you're a trained athlete or someone who's just started exercising, suddenly boosting the frequency or duration of your exercise sessions can increase your risk of a stress fracture.\n*   **Work in certain occupations.** Certain work environments, such as a construction site, put you at risk of falling from a height or dropping something heavy on your foot.\n*   **Keep your home cluttered or poorly lit.** Walking around in a house with too much clutter or too little light may lead to falls and foot injuries.\n*   **Have certain conditions.** Having decreased bone density (osteoporosis) can put you at risk of injuries to your foot bones.\n\n【15】Complications\n-------------\n\n【16】Complications of a broken foot are uncommon but may include:\n\n【17】*   **Arthritis.** Fractures that extend into a joint can cause arthritis years later. If your foot starts to hurt long after a break, see your doctor for an evaluation.\n*   **Bone infection (osteomyelitis).** If you have an open fracture, meaning one end of the bone protrudes through the skin, your bone may be exposed to bacteria that cause infection.\n*   **Nerve or blood vessel damage.** Trauma to the foot can injure adjacent nerves and blood vessels, sometimes actually tearing them. Seek immediate attention if you notice any numbness or circulation problems. Lack of blood flow can cause a bone to die and collapse.\n\n【18】Prevention\n----------\n\n【19】These basic sports and safety tips may help prevent a broken foot:\n\n【20】*   **Wear proper shoes.** Use hiking shoes on rough terrain. Wear steel-toed boots in your work environment if necessary. Choose appropriate athletic shoes for your sport.\n*   **Replace athletic shoes regularly.** Discard sneakers as soon as the tread or heel wears out or if the shoes are wearing unevenly. If you're a runner, replace your sneakers every 300 to 400 miles.\n*   **Start slowly.** That applies to a new fitness program and each individual workout.\n*   **Cross-train.** Alternating activities can prevent stress fractures. Rotate running with swimming or biking.\n*   **Build bone strength.** Calcium-rich foods, such as milk, yogurt and cheese, really can do your body good.

It's called myelogenous (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) leukemia because it affects a group of white blood cells called the myeloid cells, which normally develop into the various types of mature blood cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.\n\n【3】Acute myelogenous leukemia is also known as acute myeloid leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】General signs and symptoms of the early stages of acute myelogenous leukemia may mimic those of the flu or other common diseases.\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia include:\n\n【7】*   Fever\n*   Bone pain\n*   Lethargy and fatigue\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Pale skin\n*   Frequent infections\n*   Easy bruising\n*   Unusual bleeding, such as frequent nosebleeds and bleeding from the gums\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】Make an appointment with a doctor if you develop any signs or symptoms that seem unusual or that worry you.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Acute myelogenous leukemia occurs when a bone marrow cell develops changes (mutations) in its genetic material or DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. Normally, the DNA tells the cell to grow at a set rate and to die at a set time. In acute myelogenous leukemia, the mutations tell the bone marrow cell to continue growing and dividing.\n\n【12】When this happens, blood cell production becomes out of control. The bone marrow produces immature cells that develop into leukemic white blood cells called myeloblasts. These abnormal cells are unable to function properly, and they can build up and crowd out healthy cells.\n\n【13】It's not clear what causes the DNA mutations that lead to leukemia, but doctors have identified factors that increase the risk.\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】Factors that may increase your risk of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) include:\n\n【16】*   **Increasing age.** The risk of acute myelogenous leukemia increases with age. Acute myelogenous leukemia is most common in adults age 65 and older.\n*   **Your sex.** Men are more likely to develop acute myelogenous leukemia than are women.\n*   **Previous cancer treatment.** People who've had certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy may have a greater risk of developing AML.\n*   **Exposure to radiation.** People exposed to very high levels of radiation, such as survivors of a nuclear reactor accident, have an increased risk of developing AML.\n*   **Dangerous chemical exposure.** Exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzene, is linked to a greater risk of AML.\n*   **Smoking.** AML is linked to cigarette smoke, which contains benzene and other known cancer-causing chemicals.\n*   **Other blood disorders.** People who've had another blood disorder, such as myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera or thrombocythemia, are at greater risk of developing AML.\n*   **Genetic disorders.** Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of AML.\n\n【17】Many people with AML have no known risk factors, and many people who have risk factors never develop the cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:08:01", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:12:08", "cost": 247.197}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:39", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:12:06", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:07:58"}

We review the treatment of acute ischemic stroke from the prehospital setting, to the emergency department, to the inpatient hospital setting. We discuss the importance of prehospital assessment and treatment, including the use of elements of the neurologic examination, recognition of symptoms that can mimic those of acute ischemic stroke, and rapid transport of patients who are potential candidates for thrombolytic therapy to hospitals with that capability. Coordinated management of acute ischemic stroke in the emergency department is critical as well, beginning with non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the brain. The advantages of a multidisciplinary dedicated stroke team are discussed, as are thrombolytic therapy and other inpatient treatment options.

The 2 groups received separate surveys; both surveys contained knowledge-based questions about mammography, but the educational intervention group survey also contained qualitative questions that assessed the educational pamphlets.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of the 668 surveys returned (responders), 248 (34.4%) were from the control group, and 420 (58.3%) were from the intervention group. Approximately 80% of responders had had more than 7 prior mammograms. Significant increases in knowledge about mammography were found in the educational intervention compared with the control group on questions regarding age to begin screening mammography (67.9% vs 54.4%; _P_ <.001), recommended frequency of mammograms (86.4% vs 75.4%; _P_ <.001), overall reduction in mortality due to screening mammography (55.2% vs 8.9%; _P_ <.001), and proportions of women who required follow-up mammograms (35.5% vs 14.9%; _P_ <.001) or biopsy (59.5% vs 13.3%; _P_ <.001). Qualitative data results indicated that most women who received the educational intervention found the pamphlets helpful and informative despite having had many previous mammograms.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】The results suggest that providing women scheduled for screening mammograms with physician-approved educational material before their appointment significantly increases knowledge about screening mammography, risks and benefits, and possible follow-up.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:16:20", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:16:27", "cost": 6.341}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:39", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:16:26", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:16:19"}

In teenagers, adapalene is not expected to cause different side effects or problems than it does in adults.\n\n【13】### Geriatric\n\n【14】Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of adapalene in the elderly with use in other age groups. Older adults are not likely to develop acne.\n\n【15】### Breastfeeding\n\n【16】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【17】### Drug Interactions\n\n【18】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【19】### Other Interactions\n\n【20】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【21】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【22】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【23】*   Eczema or\n*   Seborrheic dermatitis—Use of this medicine may cause or increase the irritation associated with eczema or seborrheic dermatitis\n\n【24】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【25】It is very important that you use this medicine only as directed. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may cause irritation of the skin.\n\n【26】Do not apply this medicine to windburned or sunburned skin or on open wounds.\n\n【27】Do not use this medicine in or around the eyes, lips, or inside of the nose. Spread the medicine away from these areas when applying. If the medicine accidently gets on these areas, wash with water at once.\n\n【28】Apply the medicine to clean, dry areas of the skin affected by acne. Rub in gently and well. Wash your hands afterwards to remove any medicine that may remain on them.\n\n【29】To help clear up your acne completely, it is very important that you keep using this medicine for the full time of treatment , even if your symptoms begin to clear up after a short time. If you stop using this medicine too soon, your acne may return or get worse.\n\n【30】### Dosing\n\n【31】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【32】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【33】*   For topical dosage form (gel):\n    *   For acne:\n        *   Adults and teenagers—Apply a small amount as a thin film once a day, at least one hour before bedtime. Apply the medicine to dry, clean areas affected by acne. Rub in gently and well.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【34】### Missed Dose\n\n【35】If you miss a dose of this medicine, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【36】### Storage\n\n【37】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【38】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【39】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【40】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【41】During the first 3 weeks you are using adapalene, your acne may seem to get worse before it gets better. Full improvement should be seen within 12 weeks, especially if you use the medicine every day. You should not stop using adapalene if your acne seems worse at first, unless irritation or other symptoms become severe. Check with your doctor if your acne does not improve within 8 to 12 weeks.\n\n【42】Do not apply any topical product to the same area where you are using adapalene, unless otherwise directed by your doctor. If applied to the same area treated with adapalene, the following products may cause mild to severe irritation of the skin:\n\n【43】*   Hair products that irritate the skin, such as permanents or hair removal products\n*   Skin products for acne (such as clindamycin or erythromycin) or other skin products containing a peeling agent (such as benzoyl peroxide, resorcinol, salicylic acid, or sulfur)\n*   Skin products that cause one to be more sensitive to the sun, such as those containing spices or lime\n*   Skin products that are too drying or that contain a large amount of alcohol, such as astringents, cosmetics, shaving creams, or after-shave lotions\n*   Skin products that are abrasive, such as some soaps or skin cleansers\n\n【44】Your doctor may ask you to use other topical products, such as benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, or erythromycin, during your treatment with adapalene. Applying the products at different times of the day will lessen the chance of causing skin irritation.\n\n【45】If your skin becomes too dry or red at any time, discuss with your doctor whether you should continue using adapalene. Applying creams, lotions, or moisturizers as needed helps lessen these skin problems.\n\n【46】During treatment with this medicine, avoid getting too much sun on treated areas and do not use sunlamps. Since your skin may be more prone to sunburn or skin irritation, use sunscreen or sunblocking lotions regularly with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or more. Wear protective clothing against sun, wind, and cold weather.\n\n【47】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【48】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【49】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【50】#### More common\n\n【51】1.  Burning sensation or stinging of skin\n2.  dryness and peeling of skin\n3.  itching of skin\n4.  redness of skin\n\n【52】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【53】#### Rare\n\n【54】1.

Many of these discoveries were funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the NIH remains a leader in supporting research in the United States. However, as the field has developed, the NIH has responded proactively to identify roadblocks and to develop solutions that will accelerate translation of basic discoveries to the clinical setting. These activities range from organizing specialized workshops and coordinating activities among international organizations and the different arms of the government to funding small-scale industry. In addition, the NIH has been a key driver in providing needed infrastructure in areas in which the private sector has been unable to, or does not believe it can, invest. These activities of the NIH are as important as its traditional funding role, and I believe they have contributed to the innovation and rapid pace of discovery in this field.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CGMP ( Current Good Manufacturing Practices ), ESC ( embryonic stem cell ), IPSC ( induced pluripotent stem cell ), NIH ( National Institutes of Health )\n\n【4】The stem cell domain of the regenerative medicine field has seen fundamental changes initiated by seminal discoveries in cell biology, genetic engineering, and whole genome sequencing. Many of these discoveries were funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the NIH remains a leader in supporting research in the United States. In addition, as the field has developed, the NIH has responded proactively to identify roadblocks and to develop solutions that will accelerate translation of basic discoveries to the clinical setting.\n\n【5】The NIH and Its Role in Advancing Regenerative Medicine Science Into Practice\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】As the largest provider of research dollars in the Unites States, the NIH plays an important role in funding research and, as with any other field, has played a leading role in supporting regenerative medicine research. The dollar amount invested in research is substantial , and approximately a billion dollars a year are invested directly into stem cell research.\n\n【7】However, funding is not the only important function of a government agency. As in any new area, the government’s role is larger than simply providing research dollars . To be responsive to the community it serves, the NIH must be able to identify trends, anticipate change, develop programs, and be prepared to respond to these anticipated challenges.\n\n【8】Steering a new course for stem cell research: NIH’s intramural Center for Regenerative Medicine.\n\n【9】In the subsequent sections, I provide an overview of where I see the field moving and how I see the NIH responding to these challenges.\n\n【10】Figure National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for research has doubled over the past 10 years and has remained at this high level over the past 5 years. ARRA = American Recovery & Reinvestment Act; R&D = research and development; RMS = Research Management and Support.\n\n【11】Table 1 Possible Roles of the National Institutes of Health in Translating Research Discoveries to Therapy\n\n| Identify trends and roadblocks |\n| --- |\n| Fund efforts likely to succeed |\n| Decrease the risks of translational efforts |\n| Provide the infrastructure to enable innovation |\n| Ensure that appropriate regulations exist |\n| Help establish rules and regulations |\n| Coordinate activity |\n| Monitor the field |\n| Showcase or provide examples |\n\n【13】Identifying Trends and Roadblocks\n---------------------------------\n\n【14】Trends that I see in the field are summarized in Table 2 . These trends, I believe, have shaped the way the field has grown. They affect the choice of cells researchers use, the regulatory pathways investigators follow, the type of manufacturing paradigm they utilize, how they obtain funding for the development process to generate a regulated product, and how they market the product. Because the NIH is the premier source of funding in the United States, it is perhaps only reasonable to assume that NIH funding decisions contributed to these trends, and I have no doubt that ongoing allocation efforts by the NIH will continue to shape the field. What the NIH recognized and what none of the other funding agencies anticipated was the rapid translation of these fundamental discoveries to clinical practice and how quickly the NIH must respond if it wishes to remain proactive rather than reactive.\n\n【15】Table 2 Major Trends Shaping the Field of Regenerative Medicine\n\n【16】PSC = pluripotent stem cell.\n\n| Rapid technological advances in PSC technology |\n| --- |\n| Ability to manufacture, freeze, and ship cells on a large scale |\n| Decreasing cost of next-generation sequencing |\n| Breakthroughs in gene engineering technologies |\n| Ability to make 3-dimensional structures |\n| Regulations defining what is a product vs practice of medicine |\n| The changing patent landscape |\n| Changes in the funding landscape |\n| The pharmaceutical business model is undergoing revamping |\n| New business models for autologous therapy |\n| Hospitals and academic institutions taking the lead in personalized medicine |\n| The drug reimbursement model is changing |\n| Health care delivery and cost containment models are being reevaluated |\n\n【18】a PSC = pluripotent stem cell.\n\n【19】In hindsight, perhaps one could have anticipated this acceleration. The change has been rapid because the field could take advantage of independent discoveries that were being made by scientists in other domains and apply these solutions to current problems in the regenerative medicine field. For example, the award-winning work on pluripotency by Gurdon and Byrne\n\n【20】The first half-century of nuclear transplantation.\n\n【21】and Takahashi et al\n\n【22】Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors.\n\n【23】enabled investigators to apply the Nobel Prize–winning work of Capecchi and Thomas\n\n【24】Site-directed mutagenesis by gene targeting in mouse embryo-derived stem cells.\n\n【25】Altering the genome by homologous recombination.\n\n【26】on homologous recombination to human stem cells. These new results and discoveries were further accelerated by the advances in genetic engineering made by other groups working in fields as diverse as plant biology.\n\n【27】ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas-based methods for genome engineering.\n\n【28】These new engineering techniques in turn could be readily refined as the embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC) discoveries enabled researchers to test tissues rapidly in large panels of lines whose culture conditions had been standardized and whose properties we understand in detail thanks to the advances in next-generation sequencing.\n\n【29】Genomic and personalized medicine: foundations and applications.\n\n【30】New approaches to molecular diagnosis.\n\n【31】Table 2 highlights discoveries or developments that have contributed to this rapid acceleration. Although no list can be comprehensive, the following breakthroughs have contributed to the accelerating pace of change and contributed to the birth of entire industries.\n\n【32】Each of the breakthroughs I have identified has had a fundamental effect on the field, although some at first blush may sound trivial. The ability to freeze cells and ship them, for example, has led to the development of a tissue banking service that includes storage and shipping of organs for transplant, providing bone marrow and apheresis products, and banking of cord blood and other newer cell types now being considered for therapy. More than 150 cord blood storage companies exist worldwide, and bone marrow transplant is the standard of care with tissue routinely being shipped from one country to another for transplant.\n\n【33】Next-generation sequencing companies abound, and in addition to providing services to the academic community, they provide sequencing services to the medical community and have made testing for a large number of familial diseases feasible. It is now possible to design a breast cancer screen or a familial Parkinson disease screen to look at all sequence variations in a subset of genes to determine risk and perform preventive medical procedures. Sequencing in individuals with undiagnosed diseases has already yielded dividends for those individuals or families. The Beerys’ story on identifying the sequence variations that led to a diagnosis and an off-the-shelf treatment\n\n【34】or the story of Lilly Grossman\n\n【35】are illustrative of the power of this methodology. High-profile stories and the direct marketing of tests to patients have changed the field in unexpected ways.\n\n【36】Are results of targeted gene sequencing ready to be used for clinical decision making for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia?\n\n【37】After the revolution? ethical and social challenges in ‘personalized genomic medicine.’.\n\n【38】The ability to obtain cells from well-characterized, well-annotated parent populations and differentiate them from cells that were difficult to obtain in any other way, and to do so in numbers that are sufficient for screening and therapy, has caused a sea change in the field. One obvious example is the number of companies that are being established to consider cell-based therapy. Several of the companies that have somatic cell products have now successfully navigated the regulatory pathway to have commercial products. These companies range from mesenchymal stem cell companies and cord blood–based services to skin- and cartilage-based product providers. Companies using other cell types have products in late-stage trials, and such companies include neural stem cell–based companies, ESC-derived retinal cell– and islet cell–based companies, and more recently, IPSC-derived product–based companies.\n\n【39】Although there are not as many companies in the screening and toxicology field, it is perhaps important to note that the screening world and in particular the toxicology screening world is undergoing a change as a result of the advances in our ability to generate specific types of stem cells. Perhaps the earliest example of change was the adoption of the ESC test for toxicology by the European Center for Validation of Alternate Methods. More recently, the availability of cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent cells on a large scale from a number of companies and the demonstration that human cardiomyocytes are a better predictor of cardiotoxicity than cardiomyocytes from other species has led to widespread adoption of this test in early-stage drug screening.\n\n【40】Drug-induced functional cardiotoxicity screening in stem cell-derived human and mouse cardiomyocytes: effects of reference compounds.\n\n【41】Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes: boutique science or valuable arrhythmia model?\n\n【42】Thanks to the advances in bioreactor technology, the availability of other cell types in bulk cultures will further accelerate adoption. Equally important has been the work of several investigators documenting the utility of pluripotent stem cell–derived cells in screening for new therapeutics and their utility for screening in orphan and rare disorders. These new findings have led to the availability of novel screening services and the establishment of public-private partnerships to identify compounds using panels of ESC- and PSC-derived cells.\n\n【43】The NIH interprets these trends to allocate resources and guide its budget decisions and to identify experts, think tanks, and societies that can help provide feedback on how best to move forward.\n\n【44】Principal Investigators of Clinical Research Networks Initiative  \nSignposts along the NIH roadmap for reengineering clinical research: lessons from the Clinical Research Networks initiative.\n\n【45】Equally important, the NIH has tried to understand what roadblocks need to be resolved first to enable the rapid pace of change to continue.\n\n【46】Despite Positive Trends, Roadblocks Exist and Need to Be Resolved\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】The NIH has identified several major roadblocks that hamper translational science , ranging from the obvious, such as the reduction in funding from federal sources, to the less obvious practical issues, such as the lack of appropriate consent documents. Although space constraints limit a detailed discussion, I will discuss some examples of the types of efforts undertaken by the NIH to resolve some of these roadblocks.\n\n【48】Table 3 Translational Science Roadblocks and NIH Solutions\n\n| Roadblocks | NIH solutions |\n| --- | --- |\n| Difficulties in procuring cells | Develop consent documents, identify tissue sourcing agencies, identify and fund storage and banking groups and enable them to distribute tissue |\n| Difficulty in navigating the patent landscape | Develop landscape documents, develop a UBMTA, establish standardized LULLS for engineering technologies |\n| Lack of infrastructure to manufacture cells | Develop PACT centers, enable companies, identify CMOs, resolve roadblocks to academic-industry collaborations with service providers |\n| No coordinating activity | NIHCRM, CNRM, work with ATCC on testing, help coordinate FDA harmonization efforts, work with international repositories, develop controls and standards, identify biorepositories and ensure distribution of cells, work with NIEHS on cell panels, annual meeting with pharmaceutical firms to coordinate and establish public-private partnerships |\n| Limited funding for translational efforts | PO1, SBIR, STTR, cofunding with other funding agencies, establish public-private partnerships |\n| No regulatory clarity | NIH-FDA meetings, international harmonization, work with societies and other stakeholders |\n| Lack of screening programs | NCATS, NIH funding for screening centers, public-private partnerships |\n| Lack of clarity for the cell therapy process | NIH-FDA meetings, develop intramural capability, NIH Clinical Center for orphan and rare diseases, CTSAs |\n\n【50】ATTC = American Type Culture Collection; CMO = contact manufacturing organization; CNRM = Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine; CTSA = Clinical and Translational Sciences Award; FDA = Food and Drug Administration; LULLS = limited-use label licenses; NCATS = National Center for Advancing Translational Science; NIEHS = National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; NIH = National Institutes of Health; NIHCRM = NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine; PACT = Production Assistance for Cellular Therapies; PO1 = Research Program Project grant; SBIR = Small Business Innovation Research program; STTR = Small Business Technology Transfer program; UBMTA = uniform biological material transfer agreement.\n\n【51】To obtain the best return on scarce research dollars, the NIH, in addition to its direct research support, has partnered with other government agencies such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Institute of Science and Technology, and the Environmental Protection Agency to help coordinate funding efforts and has begun to develop common data sets of information. The NIH has noted that funding for this activity has come from other sources as well, including private foundations, state governments, and industry, and the NIH has worked hard to help coordinate such activity and develop public-private partnerships.\n\n【52】Public private partnerships: a marriage of necessity.\n\n【53】Important components of the public-private partnership that have been the cornerstones of innovation in biotechnology are the Small Business Innovation Research program, the Small Business Technology Transfer program, and advanced technology funding programs. The NIH has encouraged stem cell companies to register and apply for these grants and has worked at the institutional level to ensure that companies could access the requisite technology to be competitive in the bidding process .\n\n【54】The NIH realized that current funding programs may not be suited for translational research and that necessary infrastructure would need to be developed to allow for successful translation. As the NIH engaged in discussion with stakeholders, there existed a need to modify the standard Research Project Grant (R01) program and introduce longer-term grants and larger project grants with larger dollar amounts to enable preclinical studies to be performed by academic investigators.\n\n【55】Principal Investigators of Clinical Research Networks Initiative  \nSignposts along the NIH roadmap for reengineering clinical research: lessons from the Clinical Research Networks initiative.\n\n【56】Three major initiatives introduced by Dr Francis S. Collins, director of the NIH, deserve special mention. The National Center for Advancing Translational Science was established to meet the tasks of accelerating translational science, including work with stem cells in screening and toxicology, and helping bridge the gap that exists because of a dearth of funding from traditional investing sources. The NIH has identified the NIH Clinical Center as an invaluable resource and developed plans to allow access to NIH-funded investigators worldwide. Dr John I. Gallin, the director of the Clinical Center, has identified different ways researchers can work with the center,\n\n【57】including work on stem cells. More recently, Dr Collins established the NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine to help identify the roadblocks that exist for this field and to develop creative solutions to resolve such roadblocks.\n\n【58】In an attempt to develop synergy and enhance the ability of investigators to move their results to the next step on the translation path, the NIH has developed model consent forms and material transfer agreements, identified patent issues, and negotiated appropriate limited-use label licenses to enable researchers to distribute their results widely and access services from service providers. To further ensure access to key reagents, the NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine generated IPSC lines including engineered reporter lines, deposited them with repositories, and ensured that these repositories could distribute cell lines worldwide with minimal restrictions at a reasonable cost. The NIH has also developed Program Assistance for Cellular Therapeutics centers for manufacturing clinical-grade cells and university-based screening centers to allow investigators access to resources that would be difficult to generate for any individual group. The NIH has also transferred expertise and reagents to service providers so that such technology would be widely disseminated and allow individual investigators to focus on key questions rather than having to develop and standardize protocols themselves.\n\n【59】To reduce the cost of access to clinically compliant lines that will be required for therapy and to make preclinical studies easier, the NIH funded the development of an ESC bank at a Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) site and the generation of a set of IPSC lines from healthy donors using commercial contract manufacturing organizations. In addition, it funded the development of reporter cell line subclones in these CGMP-compliant lines. Because the government bore the initial costs, obtaining a matched research-grade stock of the cells will cost individual investigators much less and, more importantly, will save them time while providing some security that lines made with a similar process will behave similarly. The reporter cell line subclones will make biodistribution and other required safety studies much easier to assess, and because they will be closely related to the CGMP line, it will likely mean fewer concerns about interpreting the results. A criterion for these reporter cell lines was that they be available to both commercial and noncommercial groups. This stipulation was important because it meant that as research transitioned from an academic to a more applied approach, investigators would not have to go back and remake lines (or develop new constructs) or negotiate licenses at a later and more expensive stage.\n\n【60】It is hoped that while each initiative may have only a small effect, the cumulative effect of resolving roadblocks along the entire path may be synergistic. It is further hoped that any investigator armed with the appropriate consent forms, material transfer agreements, and licenses and with access to standardized cell lines and controls (that can be obtained at a reasonable cost by a single phone call) can readily develop a screening or therapeutic intervention protocol. Further development of the novel protocol can be funded via novel granting mechanisms or with the assistance of the National Center for Advancing Translational Science, the NIH Clinical Center, or university-funded screening and cell manufacturing centers, enabling rapid development that can then be disseminated widely via service providers, small businesses, and pharmaceutical partners who in turn are funded by specialized granting programs or public-private partnerships to permit widespread access to cell-based therapy.\n\n【61】The NIH Must Develop New Ways to Support New Business Models\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【62】Although the NIH believes that the aforementioned efforts will play an important role in accelerating the development of cell-based therapeutic interventions, it recognizes that many of the old models of drug delivery may not work, and new business models will have to be supported. In examining the field, the new efforts can be broadly divided into 3 different groups: engineered cells, hospital-based services, and “homegrown” tissues.\n\n【63】### Engineered Cells\n\n【64】As discussed previously, major advances have been made in engineering of cells and continuous improvements in vector design, delivery, and development of self-inactivating vectors or integration-free gene delivery technologies. Gene therapy companies have begun to adopt these techniques, and companies have initiated clinical trials with such therapies. Three different approaches are being adopted: (1) the use of cells as delivery vehicles whereby the product is inserted into a “safe harbor” site using vectors that allow conditional delivery that is not epigenomically silenced for the lifetime of the individual, (2) a knockout strategy in which the abnormal product is deleted using precision excision methods, and (3) a repair strategy in which the specific defect is corrected. Individual groups and companies are exploring these technologies for therapy in diseases such as cancer, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and lysosomal storage disorders.\n\n【65】New frontier in regenerative medicine: site-specific gene correction in patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells.\n\n【66】Concise review: genetically engineered stem cell therapy targeting angiogenesis and tumor stroma in gastrointestinal malignancy.\n\n【67】### Hospital-Based Services\n\n【68】Two trends in practice in some medical centers are changing treatment paradigms. The first is the development of personalized medicine strategies based on current technology. These strategies include diagnostic panels with which evermore customized tests can be performed and developed relatively rapidly. The second is personalized therapy such as testing drugs on tumor cells from an individual patient’s tumor to develop the right “cocktail” of effective drugs for treatment of that patient.\n\n【69】Next-generation sequencing in hematologic malignancies: what will be the dividends?\n\n【70】Personalized cancer medicine: molecular diagnostics, predictive biomarkers, and drug resistance.\n\n【71】Predictive molecular pathology and its role in targeted cancer therapy: a review focussing on clinical relevance.\n\n【72】Genomic biomarkers for personalized medicine: development and validation in clinical studies.\n\n【73】### Homegrown Tissue\n\n【74】Several hospital- and institute-based services have begun to adopt biomaterial engineering services and combine them with cell culture techniques to build 3-dimensional structures. These innovations include structures such as the trachea, the esophagus, valves, the bladder, and sheets of cells. Companies that provide specialized bioreactors to enable this sort of growth have emerged, and novel methodologies to image the growing tissue have been developed.\n\n【75】Tissue engineering for the oncologic urinary bladder.\n\n【76】Engineering functional epithelium for regenerative medicine and in vitro organ models: a review.\n\n【77】Tissue engineering technology and its possible applications in oral and maxillofacial surgery.\n\n【78】### Potential Solutions\n\n【79】It is hard to imagine fitting these efforts into the centralized manufacture and global distribution model that the pharmaceutical industry has used effectively to deliver small-molecule products or even biologics. Novel models, however, mean novel infrastructure, novel players, and higher risk, which in turn means that our metrics from funding need to change, our information dissemination needs to target a different audience, and our partnership program models need to evolve.\n\n【80】A national clinical decision support infrastructure to enable the widespread and consistent practice of genomic and personalized medicine.\n\n【81】Towards a European strategy for medicines research (2014-2020): the EUFEPS position paper on Horizon 2020.\n\n【82】Paving the way to personalized genomic medicine: steps to successful implementation.\n\n【83】The Personalized Medicine Coalition: goals and strategies.\n\n【84】It is still the early days of this new era, and so far no successful model has been developed. However, the NIH has continued to experiment with providing CGMP-grade cells to multiple users, developing banks of IPSCs, and providing royalty-free licenses. Time will tell what is the best method moving forward, but it is important to note that the NIH understands the need and is proactively attempting to develop a solution.\n\n【85】The NIH Needs to Anticipate and Support Tomorrow’s Breakthroughs\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【86】As with any prediction, it is far more likely that I will be wrong than right, but nevertheless, I can perhaps make some cautious predictions, summarized in Table 4 . It seems to me that the genetic engineering breakthroughs coupled with the ability to make differentiated cells of various kinds will allow for functional cures. Perhaps the earliest success will come in the hematopoietic system or in the retina, where viral delivery of a missing gene product has already had success. Using safe harbor technologies and strategies to prevent silencing and regulating gene expression in immune-matched cells that are differentiated into a tissue or organ phenotype will allow controlled and regulated therapy. Another breakthrough that I believe will change the field is the ability to make more complex 3-dimensional structures. Currently, we have been limited by our inability to construct a true vasculature that will allow nutrient delivery in synthetic constructs that are more than 8 or 10 cell layers thick. Keeping organ structures alive while a vasculature develops has been difficult as well. Current work in angiogenesis, the ability to print organs layer by layer, and the isolation of endothelial cells in large numbers suggest that we are close. A third breakthrough that builds on the work on IPSCs is the idea of direct transdifferentiation using readily available sources of adult cells and directing their differentiation into a difficult to obtain cell type.\n\n【87】Table 4 New Breakthroughs That May Change the Field of Cell Therapy\n\n| Ability to expand HSC or make HSC from PSC |\n| --- |\n| Developing a cost-effective model to resolve the immune rejection issue |\n| Accelerating maturation of PSC-derived cells |\n| Somatic cell engineering |\n| Directed differentiation without a stable PSC stage |\n| Developing a way to vascularize tissue |\n| In vivo directed differentiation |\n\n【89】HSC = hematopoietic stem cells; PSC = pluripotent stem cells.\n\n【90】The NIH has recognized that funding such innovation is key and will continue to focus on funding the best science. However, it also recognizes that novel discoveries may render earlier efforts obsolete and that it needs to constantly evaluate its priorities and allocations to remain responsive. This is all the more crucial in this field that is moving far faster than we had anticipated. The NIH will continue its efforts to gather information and obtain feedback and encourages readers to write or respond to the Requests for Information that the NIH publishes.\n\n【91】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【92】The NIH sees the stem cell field as a broad area that has many subfields with investigators at various stages of progress on the translational pathway. The NIH believes that its role in accelerating translation includes not just funding the field but also identifying trends, anticipating challenges, and proactively developing novel solutions to enable researchers’ efforts. These solutions include resolving issues related to access to tissues and cells, providing clarification on regulations, reducing costs, and enabling access to key reagents and resources that are not easily obtained elsewhere. Equally important, the NIH realizes that it cannot do it alone and that it needs to help develop public-private interactions to ensure that progress continues. The NIH encourages feedback and looks forward to developing novel programs and novel solutions based on such interactions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:28:47", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:29:03", "cost": 15.535}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:39", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:29:03", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:28:47"}

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【25】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【26】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【27】*   Bleeding problems—These conditions increase the risk of bleeding at the place of injection.\n\n【28】*   Liver disease—Papaverine can cause liver damage when it is given in ways that allow it to get into the bloodstream (by mouth or by injection into a muscle, a vein, or an artery); when papaverine is given by intracavernosal injection, liver damage is much less likely because the medicine enters the bloodstream very slowly.\n\n【29】*   Priapism (history of) or\n*   Sickle cell disease—Patients with these conditions have an increased risk of priapism (erection lasting longer than 4 hours) while using papaverine.\n\n【30】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【31】To give papaverine injection:\n\n【32】*   Cleanse the injection site with alcohol. Using a sterile needle, inject the medicine slowly and directly into the base of the penis as instructed by your doctor. Papaverine should not be injected just under the skin. The injection is usually not painful, although you may feel some tingling in the tip of your penis. If the injection is very painful or you notice bruising or swelling at the place of injection, that means you have been injecting the medicine under the skin. Stop, withdraw the needle, and reposition it properly before continuing with the injection.\n*   After you have completed the injection, put pressure on the place of injection to prevent bruising. Then massage your penis as instructed by your doctor. This helps the medicine spread to all parts of the penis, so that it will work better.\n\n【33】This medicine usually begins to work in about 10 minutes. You should attempt intercourse within 2 hours after injecting the medicine.\n\n【34】### Dosing\n\n【35】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【36】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【37】*   For injection dosage form:\n    *   For the treatment of erectile dysfunction:\n        *   Adults—30 to 60 milligrams (mg) injected very slowly into the area of your penis as directed by your doctor. Allow one or two minutes to completely inject the dose. Do not inject more than one dose in a day. Also, do not use this medicine more than two days in a row or more than three times a week.\n\n【38】### Storage\n\n【39】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【40】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【41】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【42】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【43】Use papaverine injection exactly as directed by your doctor . Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than ordered. If too much is used, the erection may become so strong that it lasts too long and does not reverse when it should. This condition is called priapism, and it can be very dangerous. If the effect is not reversed, the blood supply to the penis may be cut off and permanent damage may occur.\n\n【44】Contact your doctor immediately if the erection lasts for longer than 4 hours or if it becomes painful. This may be a sign of priapism and must be treated right away to prevent permanent damage.\n\n【45】If you notice bleeding at the site when you inject papaverine, put pressure on the spot until the bleeding stops. If it doesn't stop, check with your doctor.\n\n【46】It is important for you to examine your penis regularly. Check with your doctor if you find a lump where the medicine has been injected or if you notice that your penis is becoming curved. These may be signs that unwanted tissue is growing (called fibrosis), which should be seen by your doctor.\n\n【47】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【48】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【49】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【50】#### Rare\n\n【51】1.  Dizziness\n2.  erection continuing for more than 4 hours, or painful erection\n3.  lumps in the penis\n\n【52】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【53】#### Less common\n\n【54】1.  Bruising or bleeding at place of injection\n2.  burning (mild) along penis\n3.  difficulty in ejaculating\n4.  swelling at place of injection\n\n【55】Papaverine injected into the penis may cause tingling at the tip of the penis.

The effects — and what you can do about them — depend on the cause and at what point in your life male hypogonadism occurs. Some types of male hypogonadism can be treated with testosterone replacement therapy.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Hypogonadism can begin during fetal development, before puberty or during adulthood. Signs and symptoms depend on when the condition develops.\n\n【5】### Fetal development\n\n【6】If the body doesn't produce enough testosterone during fetal development, the result may be impaired growth of the external sex organs. Depending on when hypogonadism develops and how much testosterone is present, a child who is genetically male may be born with:\n\n【7】*   Female genitals\n*   Genitals that are neither clearly male nor clearly female (ambiguous genitals)\n*   Underdeveloped male genitals\n\n【8】### Puberty\n\n【9】Male hypogonadism can delay puberty or cause incomplete or lack of normal development. It can hamper:\n\n【10】*   Development of muscle mass\n*   Voice deepening\n*   Growth of body and facial hair\n*   Growth of the penis and testicles\n\n【11】And it can cause:\n\n【12】*   Excessive growth of the arms and legs in relation to the trunk of the body\n*   Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia)\n\n【13】### Adulthood\n\n【14】In adult males, hypogonadism can alter certain masculine physical characteristics and impair normal reproductive function. Early signs and symptoms might include:\n\n【15】*   Decreased sex drive\n*   Decreased energy\n*   Depression\n\n【16】Over time, men with hypogonadism can develop:\n\n【17】*   Erectile dysfunction\n*   Infertility\n*   Decrease in hair growth on the face and body\n*   Decrease in muscle mass\n*   Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia)\n*   Loss of bone mass (osteoporosis)\n\n【18】Severe hypogonadism can also cause mental and emotional changes. As testosterone decreases, some men have symptoms similar to those of menopause in women. These can include:\n\n【19】*   Difficulty concentrating\n*   Hot flashes\n\n【20】### When to seek help\n\n【21】See your health care provider if you have symptoms of male hypogonadism. Finding the cause of hypogonadism is an important first step to getting appropriate treatment.\n\n【22】Causes\n------\n\n【23】Male hypogonadism means the testicles don't produce enough of the male sex hormone testosterone. There are two basic types of hypogonadism:\n\n【24】*   **Primary.** This type of hypogonadism — also known as primary testicular failure — originates from a problem in the testicles.\n*   **Secondary.** This type of hypogonadism indicates a problem in the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland — parts of the brain that signal the testicles to produce testosterone. The hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which signals the pituitary gland to make follicle-stimulating hormone (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)) and luteinizing hormone (luteinizing hormone (LH)). Luteinizing hormone then signals the testes to produce testosterone.\n\n【25】Either type of hypogonadism can be caused by an inherited (congenital) trait or something that happens later in life (acquired), such as an injury or an infection. At times, primary and secondary hypogonadism occur together.\n\n【26】### Primary hypogonadism\n\n【27】Common causes of primary hypogonadism include:\n\n【28】*   **Klinefelter syndrome.** This condition results from a congenital abnormality of the sex chromosomes, X and Y. A male normally has one X and one Y chromosome. In Klinefelter syndrome, two or more X chromosomes are present in addition to one Y chromosome.\n\n【29】    The Y chromosome contains the genetic material that determines the sex of a child and related development. The extra X chromosome that occurs in Klinefelter syndrome causes abnormal development of the testicles, which in turn results in underproduction of testosterone.\n\n【30】*   **Undescended testicles.** Before birth, the testicles develop inside the abdomen and normally move down into their permanent place in the scrotum. Sometimes one or both of the testicles aren't descended at birth.\n\n【31】    This condition often corrects itself within the first few years of life without treatment. If not corrected in early childhood, it can lead to malfunction of the testicles and reduced production of testosterone.\n\n【32】*   **Mumps orchitis.** A mumps infection involving the testicles that occurs during adolescence or adulthood can damage the testicles, affecting the function of the testicles and testosterone production.\n*   **Hemochromatosis.** Too much iron in the blood can cause testicular failure or pituitary gland dysfunction, affecting testosterone production.\n*   **Injury to the testicles.** Because they're outside the abdomen, the testicles are prone to injury. Damage to both testicles can cause hypogonadism. Damage to one testicle might not impair total testosterone production.\n*   **Cancer treatment.** Chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer can interfere with testosterone and sperm production. The effects of both treatments often are temporary, but permanent infertility may occur.\n\n【33】    Although many men regain their fertility within a few months after treatment, preserving sperm before starting cancer therapy is an option for men.\n\n【34】### Secondary hypogonadism\n\n【35】In secondary hypogonadism, the testicles are normal but don't function properly due to a problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus. A number of conditions can cause secondary hypogonadism, including:\n\n【36】*   **Kallmann's syndrome.** This is an abnormal development of the area of the brain that controls the secretion of pituitary hormones (hypothalamus). This abnormality can also affect the ability to smell (anosmia) and cause red-green color blindness.\n*   **Pituitary disorders.** An abnormality in the pituitary gland can impair the release of hormones from the pituitary gland to the testicles, affecting normal testosterone production. A pituitary tumor or other type of brain tumor located near the pituitary gland may cause testosterone or other hormone deficiencies.\n\n【37】    Also, treatment for a brain tumor, such as surgery or radiation therapy, can affect the pituitary gland and cause hypogonadism.\n\n【38】*   **Inflammatory disease.** Certain inflammatory diseases, such as sarcoidosis, histiocytosis and tuberculosis, involve the hypothalamus and pituitary gland and can affect testosterone production.\n*   **HIV/AIDS.** HIV/AIDS can cause low levels of testosterone by affecting the hypothalamus, the pituitary and the testes.\n*   **Medications.** The use of certain drugs, such as opiate pain medications and some hormones, can affect testosterone production.\n*   **Obesity.** Being significantly overweight at any age might be linked to hypogonadism.\n*   **Aging.** As men age, there's a slow, progressive decrease in testosterone production. The rate varies greatly.\n\n【39】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【40】Risk factors for hypogonadism include:\n\n【41】Hypogonadism can be inherited. If any of these risk factors are in your family health history, tell your doctor.\n\n【42】Complications\n-------------\n\n【43】The complications of untreated hypogonadism differ depending on when it develops — during fetal development, puberty or adulthood.\n\n【44】Complications might include:\n\n【45】*   Abnormal genitalia\n*   Enlarged male breasts (gynecomastia)\n*   Infertility\n*   Erectile dysfunction\n*   Osteoporosis\n*   Poor self-image", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:25:02", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:25:23", "cost": 20.072}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:39", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:25:22", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:25:02"}

These drugs are usually injected directly into a vein through a needle or taken by mouth as pills.\n\n【2】Chemotherapy for breast cancer frequently is used in addition to other treatments, such as surgery, radiation or hormone therapy. Chemotherapy can be used to increase the chance of a cure, decrease the risk of the cancer returning, alleviate symptoms from the cancer or help people with cancer live longer with a better quality of life.\n\n【3】If the cancer has recurred or spread, chemotherapy may control the breast cancer to help you live longer. Or it can help ease symptoms the cancer is causing.\n\n【4】Chemotherapy for breast cancer also carries a risk of side effects — some temporary and mild, others more serious or permanent. Your doctor can help you decide whether chemotherapy for breast cancer is a good choice for you.\n\n【5】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【6】Chemotherapy for breast cancer may be given in the following situations:\n\n【7】### Chemotherapy after surgery for breast cancer\n\n【8】After you have surgery to remove the breast cancer, your doctor may recommend chemotherapy to destroy any undetected cancer cells and reduce your risk of the cancer recurring. This is known as adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n【9】Your doctor may recommend adjuvant chemotherapy if you have a high risk of the cancer recurring or spreading to other parts of your body (metastasizing), even if there is no evidence of cancer after surgery. You may have a higher risk of metastasis if cancer cells are found in lymph nodes near the affected breast.\n\n【10】### Chemotherapy before surgery for breast cancer\n\n【11】Chemotherapy is sometimes given before surgery (known as neoadjuvant therapy or preoperative chemotherapy) to shrink larger cancers. This may:\n\n【12】*   Allow the surgeon the best chance of removing the cancer completely\n*   Enable the surgeon to remove only the cancer, rather than the entire breast\n*   Decrease the extent of disease in lymph nodes, allowing for less invasive lymph node surgery\n*   Decrease the chance the cancer will return\n*   Help your doctor understand how well your cancer responds to chemotherapy, which helps clarify prognosis and the best chemotherapy drug choice\n\n【13】Neoadjuvant therapy is often used for:\n\n【14】*   Inflammatory breast cancer\n*   HER2-positive breast cancer\n*   Triple-negative breast cancer\n*   High-grade breast cancers\n*   Cancers that have spread to the lymph nodes\n*   Larger breast cancers\n\n【15】### Chemotherapy as the primary treatment for advanced breast cancer\n\n【16】If breast cancer has spread to other parts of your body and surgery isn't an option, chemotherapy can be used as the primary treatment. It may be used in combination with targeted therapy.\n\n【17】The main goal of chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer is generally to improve quality and length of life rather than to cure the disease.\n\n【18】Risks\n-----\n\n【19】Chemotherapy medications travel throughout the body. Side effects depend on the drugs you receive and your reaction to them. Side effects may get worse during the course of treatment. Most side effects are temporary and subside once treatment is finished. Sometimes chemotherapy can have long-term or permanent effects.\n\n【20】### Short-term side effects\n\n【21】In the process of targeting fast-growing cancer cells, chemotherapy drugs can also damage other fast-growing healthy cells, such as those in the hair follicles, bone marrow and digestive tract. These side effects often go away after treatment is finished or within a year after completing chemotherapy. In some cases, they may be long lasting.\n\n【22】Common short-term side effects include:\n\n【23】*   Hair loss\n*   Fatigue\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Constipation or diarrhea\n*   Mouth sores\n*   Skin and nail changes\n*   Increased risk of developing infection (due to fewer white blood cells that help fight infection)\n*   Nerve damage (neuropathy)\n*   Problems with cognitive function that affect memory and concentration, also known as chemo brain\n\n【24】### Long-term side effects\n\n【25】Certain chemotherapy drugs for breast cancer can cause long-term side effects, including:\n\n【26】*   **Infertility.** One possible side effect that may not go away is infertility. Some anti-cancer drugs damage the ovaries. This may cause menopause symptoms, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Menstrual periods may become irregular or stop (amenorrhea). If ovulation ceases, pregnancy becomes impossible.\n\n【27】    Depending on your age, chemotherapy may induce a premature permanent menopause. Discuss with your doctor your risk of permanent menopause and its consequences.\n\n【28】    If you continue to menstruate, you may still be able to get pregnant, even during treatment or after treatment is completed. But because the effects of chemotherapy are dangerous to the fetus, talk with your doctor about appropriate birth control options before treatment begins.\n\n【29】*   **Bone thinning.** Women who experience menopause early because of chemotherapy may have a higher risk of the bone-thinning conditions osteopenia and osteoporosis. It's generally recommended that these women have periodic bone density tests and, possibly, treatments to prevent further bone loss.\n*   **Heart damage.** Chemotherapy carries a small risk of weakening the heart muscle and causing other heart problems. Certain chemotherapy medications are associated with a higher risk of future heart problems.\n*   **Leukemia.** Rarely, chemotherapy for breast cancer can trigger a secondary cancer, such as cancer of the blood cells (leukemia), several years after the chemotherapy is completed.\n\n【30】### Other side effects\n\n【31】Feelings of fear, sadness and isolation can compound the physical side effects of chemotherapy, both during and after treatment. During chemotherapy, you have regular contact with and support from oncologists and nurses. Everyone involved is working toward the same goal — completion of treatment with the best possible outcome. When it's over, you can feel as if you're alone, with no one to help you return to normal life or deal with fears of breast cancer recurrence.\n\n【32】Consider talking with a mental health professional or other health care professional who works with people who have cancer. It may also help to talk with someone who has been in the same situation. Connect with others through a hotline, support group or online community for people who have been treated for cancer.\n\n【33】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【34】### Assess the potential benefit of chemotherapy\n\n【35】When deciding whether chemotherapy is right for you, your doctor considers:\n\n【36】*   **Cancer size and grade.** Larger cancers and higher grade cancers are more likely to recur and are more likely to benefit from chemotherapy.\n*   **Lymph node status.** If your breast cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, your doctor may recommend chemotherapy.\n*   **Age.** Breast cancer that occurs at a younger age may be more aggressive than cancer that develops later in life. So doctors may recommend that younger people with breast cancer undergo chemotherapy.\n*   **Previous treatments.** If you've had chemotherapy before, your doctor considers this when developing your treatment plan.\n*   **Your general health and other medical conditions.** Your overall health may affect your ability to tolerate side effects of chemotherapy. Certain health problems, such as heart disease or diabetes, may affect which drugs are selected for your chemotherapy.\n*   **Hormone receptor status.** If your cancer cells have receptors for the hormones estrogen and progesterone, your doctor may recommend hormone therapy in addition to chemotherapy.\n*   **HER2 status.** If your breast cancer produces too much of a growth-promoting protein known as HER2, your doctor may recommend chemotherapy and drugs that specifically target this protein.\n*   **Genetic profile.** For certain types of breast cancer such as hormone receptor positive breast cancer, your doctor may have your cancer cells tested to learn more about their genetic makeup.\n\n【37】    Gene expression profiling tests, such as Oncotype DX, EndoPredict and MammaPrint, may help predict the risk of recurrence and give your doctor an idea of how your cancer cells might respond to chemotherapy. If it's not clear whether you'd benefit from chemotherapy, these tests can be helpful. But they're not useful for everyone and are only used in certain situations.\n\n【38】*   **Your preferences.** Talk with your doctor about your preferences for your care. These can be taken into consideration, especially when multiple options for therapy are available.\n\n【39】### Take steps to improve your overall health\n\n【40】Make healthy choices before cancer treatment so you'll feel strong as your treatment begins. Continuing healthy choices during treatment may help minimize side effects.\n\n【41】Your doctor may recommend that you:\n\n【42】*   Get plenty of rest.\n*   Stay active and make the time to exercise.\n*   Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\n*   Minimize stress.\n*   Avoid infections, such as the common cold and the flu. Talk with your doctor about recommended vaccinations, including annual flu vaccines. Also engage in behavior to reduce the risk of infection while on active chemotherapy, such as washing hands or using hand sanitizer before eating and using gloves while doing yardwork.\n*   See your dentist for any signs of infection in your teeth or gums.\n*   Undergo blood tests to check your liver and kidney function and tests to check your heart function. If problems show up, your doctor may delay your treatment or select a chemotherapy drug and dosage that is safer for you.\n\n【43】### Plan ahead for side effects\n\n【44】Ask your doctor what side effects you can expect during and after chemotherapy. If you know what to expect, you can prepare. For example, if your chemotherapy treatment will cause infertility, you may wish to store sperm, fertilized eggs (embryos) or eggs for future use. If your chemotherapy will cause hair loss, consider a wig or a head covering, or talk to your doctor about measures that may prevent hair loss.\n\n【45】### Make arrangements for help at home and at work\n\n【46】Most people are able to continue working and doing their usual activities during chemotherapy. Your doctor can give you an idea of how much the chemotherapy will affect your usual activities, but it's difficult to predict just how you'll feel.\n\n【47】Prepare by asking for time off work or help at home for the first few days after treatment. If you'll be in the hospital during chemotherapy treatment, arrange to take time off work and find someone to take care of your usual responsibilities at home.\n\n【48】### Tell your doctor about any drugs or supplements you're taking\n\n【49】Medications or supplements you're taking, including any herbal supplements, vitamins or over-the-counter drugs, may affect the way the chemotherapy drugs work. Your doctor may suggest alternative medications or that you not take the medications or supplements for a period before or after a chemotherapy session.\n\n【50】### The day of treatment\n\n【51】Your doctor or nurse will let you know what you can and can't eat or drink on the day of your chemotherapy session. It may help to take a family member or friend with you to the treatment session for support and companionship.\n\n【52】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【53】### Timing and frequency of chemotherapy sessions\n\n【54】Chemotherapy for breast cancer is given in cycles. The cycle for chemotherapy can vary from once a week to once every three weeks. Each treatment session is followed by a period of recovery.\n\n【55】Typically, if you have early-stage breast cancer, you'll undergo chemotherapy treatments for three to six months, but your doctor will adjust the timing to your circumstances. If you have advanced breast cancer, treatment may continue beyond six months.\n\n【56】If you have early-stage breast cancer and you are also scheduled to receive radiation therapy, it usually happens after chemotherapy.\n\n【57】### Common drug combinations\n\n【58】There are many chemotherapy drugs available. Because each person is different, your doctor will tailor the type and dose of medications (regimen) — often a combination of two or three chemotherapy drugs — to your type of breast cancer and medical history.\n\n【59】### Where chemotherapy is given\n\n【60】Breast cancer chemotherapy sessions can take place at your doctor's office, at an outpatient unit in a hospital or clinic, or at home.\n\n【61】### How chemotherapy is given\n\n【62】Chemotherapy drugs can be given in a variety of ways, including as pills you take at home. Most often they're injected into a vein (IV). This can be done through:\n\n【63】*   An IV needle and tube (catheter) in your hand or wrist.\n*   A catheter port implanted in your chest before beginning chemotherapy. This port stays in place for the duration of your chemotherapy treatment and eliminates the need to find a suitable vein at each treatment session.\n\n【64】### A typical chemotherapy session\n\n【65】Not all chemotherapy sessions are alike, but a session might follow this order:\n\n【66】*   You have a blood sample drawn for a blood count and other blood tests.\n*   You meet with your doctor to review your blood test results and assess your overall health.\n*   Your doctor orders the chemotherapy.\n*   You meet with the member of your health care team who's administering your chemotherapy.\n*   You undergo a brief physical exam to check your temperature, pulse and blood pressure.\n*   You have the IV catheter inserted.\n*   You receive medications to prevent side effects such as nausea, anxiety or inflammation.\n*   You receive the chemotherapy drugs. This may take up to several hours.\n\n【67】### After a chemotherapy session\n\n【68】Following a chemotherapy session, you may:\n\n【69】*   Have your temporary IV catheter removed.\n*   Have your vital signs checked.\n*   Review side effects with your doctor.\n*   Receive prescriptions for medications you can take at home to help with side effects.\n*   Be advised on what to eat and drink.\n*   Receive instructions on proper handling of bodily fluids, such as urine, stool, vomit, semen and vaginal secretions, as these may contain some of the chemotherapy drugs for the next 48 hours. This may simply involve flushing the toilet twice after use.\n\n【70】Some people feel fine after a chemotherapy session and can return to their schedules and activities. Others may feel side effects more quickly. You may want to arrange for someone to drive you home afterward, at least for the first few sessions, until you see how you feel.\n\n【71】### During the course of chemotherapy\n\n【72】After a few sessions, you may be able to predict more accurately when you'll feel fine and when you may need to cut back on activities. Marking your calendar or keeping a journal may help you track your general response to chemotherapy sessions and plan events accordingly.\n\n【73】Following your treatment plan closely is the best way to get the most benefit from chemotherapy. If side effects become too bothersome, discuss them with your doctor. He or she may be able to adjust the dose or type of chemotherapy medication you're receiving or prescribe other medications to help relieve some symptoms such as nausea. If the number of white cells in your blood drops, your doctor may stop your chemotherapy until your white cells return to a safe level.\n\n【74】Relaxation techniques such as meditation and deep breathing may help reduce stress. And exercise has been shown to help improve sleep and lessen fatigue caused by chemotherapy. Wearing wigs, hats or turbans can make hair loss less obvious.\n\n【75】Results\n-------\n\n【76】After you complete chemotherapy treatment, your doctor will schedule follow-up visits to monitor for long-term side effects and check for cancer recurrence. Expect appointments every few months and then less frequently the longer you remain cancer-free.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:55:55", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:56:44", "cost": 49.066}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:39", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:56:44", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:54:38"}

What he perhaps does not fully appreciate is that exposure to sunlight is probably the best source of vitamin D and often provides 90% to 95% of the vitamin D requirement for people of all ages. For example, wearing a bathing suit and being exposed to sunlight that would cause a mild pinkness (ie, 1 minimal erythemal dose \\[MED\\]) is equivalent to taking between 10,000 and 20,000 IU of vitamin D.\n\n【1】Vitamin D: the underappreciated D-lightful hormone that is important for skeletal and cellular health.\n\n【2】Thus, limited sensible exposure to sunlight, ie, no more than 25% of the time required to produce a MED, 2 to 3 times a week is usually adequate. Mother Nature has dealt with the problem of humans being unable to produce sufficient vitamin D during the winter by storing excess vitamin D in the body fat so that it can be released during the winter. Fear of skin cancer is real. However, chronic excessive exposure to sunlight and sunburning incidents are most responsible for the high incidence of skin cancer.\n\n【3】A prospective study of pigmentation, sun exposure, and risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma in women.\n\n【4】There is little evidence that minimal sensible exposure to sunlight will considerably increase the risk of skin cancer. Although it is easy to say that vitamin D can be obtained from supplements and foods fortified with vitamin D, this is not an easy task. Eight ounces of milk or vitamin D-fortified orange juice contains only 100 IU of vitamin D. A person would have to eat salmon, mackerel, or sardines almost daily to satisfy their body's vitamin D requirement. Most experts agree that 1000 IU of vitamin D daily is required to meet vitamin D needs in the absence of any sun exposure.\n\n【5】Fortification of orange juice with vitamin D: a novel approach for enhancing vitamin D nutritional health.\n\n【6】Vitamin D and its major metabolites: serum levels after graded oral dosing in healthy men.\n\n【7】Although it is true that aging decreases the body's ability to produce vitamin D in the skin, investigators have shown that, because the skin has such a great capacity to produce vitamin D, elderly persons’ exposure to 15 minutes of sunlight 3 times a week in the summer or exposure in a tanning bed 3 times a week can raise their blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.\n\n【8】Prophylaxis against vitamin D deficiency in the elderly by regular sunlight exposure.\n\n【9】Ultraviolet irradiation corrects vitamin D deficiency and suppresses secondary hyperparathyroidism in the elderly.\n\n【10】Furthermore, Chuck et al\n\n【11】Subliminal ultraviolet-B irradiation for the prevention of vitamin D deficiency in the elderly: a feasibility study.\n\n【12】reported that in nursing home residents, exposure to indirect ultraviolet radiation was the most effective means of maintaining circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, even better than a vitamin D supplement.\n\n【13】The draconian message that people should never be exposed to sunlight without sun protection is totally unwarranted and should be replaced with the message that sensible sun exposure is good for overall health and well-being. Hypovitaminosis D has been linked not only to increased risk of tuberculosis, as noted by Dr Padda, but also to increased risk of type 1 diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cancers of the colon, breast, prostate, ovaries, and other organs.\n\n【14】Vitamin D: the underappreciated D-lightful hormone that is important for skeletal and cellular health.\n\n【15】An estimate of premature cancer mortality in the U.S. due to inadequate doses of solar ultraviolet-B radiation.\n\n【16】Thus, I hope that the study reported by Plotnikoff and Quigley\n\n【17】Prevalence of severe hypovitaminosis D in patients with persistent, nonspecific musculoskeletal pain.\n\n【18】has enlightened physicians about how common and underdiagnosed hypovitaminosis D is and about its consequences on bone and muscle health.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:27:28", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:28:07", "cost": 38.908}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:39", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:28:06", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:27:27"}

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has issued a recommendation to screen for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) only in asymptomatic adults with blood pressure greater than 135/80 mm Hg.\n\n【1】*   US Preventive Services Task Force\n\n【2】Screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement.\n\n【3】The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for type 2 DM in asymptomatic adults with blood pressure of 135/80 mm Hg or lower. This recommendation has caused considerable consternation in the community of those who treat patients with type 2 DM. In this issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , Sheehy et al\n\n【4】Back to Wilson and Jungner: 10 good reasons to screen for type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【5】provide a rationale for implementation of a screening test and advocate a much broader screening regimen. Ideally, recommendations that influence the practice of medicine should be based on multiple randomized, controlled clinical trials. With this particular recommendation, however, both parties  rely solely on expert opinion.\n\n【6】When determining whether a screening test or program is worthwhile, some of the most important factors are evidence, guideline recommendations, competing priorities, and testing errors.\n\n【7】Evidence\n--------\n\n【8】Evidence in support of screening should be objective, preferably from randomized controlled trials. Expert opinion should be considered only as a last resort. If expert opinion is the only guidance available, recommendations from the most objective, disinterested sources should be favored.\n\n【9】The USPSTF does not dispute that treatment of type 2 DM is useful; it asserts merely that evidence is insufficient to support screening, except in persons with hypertension.\n\n【10】Few studies of early detection of type 2 DM have been conducted, and randomized, controlled trials have not been performed. Screening for and early detection of type 2 DM appear to be a prelude to application of intensive treatment. Holman et al\n\n【11】10-Year follow-up of intensive glucose control in type 2 diabetes.\n\n【12】recently published a report on 10-year follow-up of the intensive treatment of type 2 DM in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), which showed long-term microvascular benefit and reduced myocardial infarctions and mortality. In that study, _intensive_ treatment is defined as any treatment that is not diet only. After exclusion of the mildest cases, the comparison is essentially between “no treatment” and any treatment at all, hardly what most people think of as intensive therapy. Most physicians can agree that treatment is better than no treatment, which is really all that the cited investigators conclude. The issue arises as to whether the pursuit of the academic target of 6.5% to 7.0% for glycated hemoglobin is required or whether any treatment that reduces the patient's glycated hemoglobin to less than 8% is adequate. This question has not yet been answered.\n\n【13】The weight of the prior literature has not been able to identify macrovascular benefits of tight control in type 2 DM. Some microvascular effects are reduced, but reduction in coronary artery disease and stroke in this population has been difficult to demonstrate in shorter-term studies. Moreover, neither the original UKPDS nor the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease (ADVANCE) trial showed any macrovascular benefit to tight glucose control.\n\n【14】*   UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Group\n\n【15】Effect of intensive blood-glucose control with metformin on complications in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes (UKPDS 34).\n\n【16】ADVANCE Collaborative Group  \nIntensive blood glucose control and vascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n【17】The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study found that, compared with standard therapy, the use of intensive therapy (which targeted a glycated hemoglobin of <6.0%) increased mortality and did not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events.\n\n【18】*   Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Study Group\n\n【19】Effects of intensive glucose lowering in type 2 diabetes.\n\n【20】In light of the new UKPDS report, duration of treatment, not intensity, may be the key to beneficial outcomes.\n\n【21】To secure the macrovascular benefit of intensive control and to refute the findings of the ACCORD study, which are directly applicable to the question at hand, Sheehy et al invoke the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT).\n\n【22】*   Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group\n\n【23】The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n\n【24】The DCCT was conducted in a population with a different disease (patients with type 1 DM) and may not be generalizable to the population of patients with type 2 DM. The DCCT cannot be construed as incontrovertible evidence that tight/intensive control of glucose in type 2 DM is justified. In addition, the ADVANCE and ACCORD studies were conducted in different populations (those with newly diagnosed vs long-standing disease), which may help explain the conflicting results. Also, the UKPDS found that control of blood pressure has a higher yield in prevention of morbidity than strict control of blood sugar.\n\n【25】*   UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group\n\n【26】Tight blood pressure control and risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes: UKPDS 38.\n\n【27】Although the UKPDS did technically support tight control, the definition of _tight control_ was very broad, ie, any pharmacologic intervention whatsoever (eg, metformin or a sulfonylurea medication).\n\n【28】Guidelines\n----------\n\n【29】Disease-specific guidelines that promote screening may be incomplete and are subject to external factors, such as the amount and quality of supporting evidence, the availability of funding for screening programs and treatment, and public review and support. Diabetes mellitus is a severe public health problem, the incidence and prevalence of which are increasing. Finding and treating patients with type 2 DM is a goal broadly shared in the medical community. Most of the Wilson and Jungner criteria\n\n【30】_Principles and Practice of Screening for Disease_ . World Health Organization Public Health Papers, No. 34.\n\n【31】are met for screening for type 2 DM, but few if any apply to screening for impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Also, the Wilson and Jungner criteria are 40 years old and have been expanded to include caveats about the value of early treatment.\n\n【32】Screening criteria: the Wilson-Jungner criteria for appraising the validity of a screening programme.\n\n【33】Whether screening for type 2 DM precisely meets all the relevant criteria for disease screening remains unclear. The primary concern is that the available evidence is neither clear nor conclusive that treatment is more beneficial if initiated at an early vs at a later stage. The pathophysiology and natural history of type 2 DM are still poorly understood despite basic science breakthroughs, ongoing research, and the disease burden on the population. Pending further evidence-based studies showing that early detection and treatment of asymptomatic type 2 DM are warranted, implementation of screening programs should perhaps be postponed.\n\n【34】Competing Priorities\n--------------------\n\n【35】Coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease are the number 1 and number 3 causes of death in the United States, respectively. Hypertension, elevated cholesterol levels, and type 2 DM all place patients at increased risk of these diseases. Which of these risk factors should we make it a priority to reduce? In my opinion, none of the above. Instead, lifestyle interventions should be encouraged. The 3 preferred interventions—smoking cessation, proper diet, and appropriate exercise—have salutary effects on both outcomes and risk factors but do not require medical care or incur expense. However, recidivism is common with these 3 preferred interventions, and long-term success is unusual.\n\n【36】Funds expended on lesser or futile interventions represent an opportunity cost (ie, the cost of an alternative path that must be foregone in order to pursue a certain action) for possibly more cost-effective services. Of course, appropriate pharmacologic intervention for these conditions should be instituted as warranted within the current standard of medical practice. The broad benefits of primary prevention of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease in terms of lifestyle changes and smoking cessation may outweigh the secondary prevention of detection of asymptomatic disease. However, in this age of $4.00 prescriptions for generic drugs, perhaps the answer _is_ a prescription for a pill, even though it may carry its own risks and adverse effects. The best option is not clear.\n\n【37】Testing Errors\n--------------\n\n【38】Test results can be classified as true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Unfortunately, the accurate classification of outcomes can be known only if a criterion standard for comparison of the screen exists. Expensive, difficult, or nonexistent criterion standards can lead to undue enthusiasm for the screen in the absence of evidence of adequate test characteristics. The test characteristics of glucose screening are reasonably good, but the clinical value is unclear. Mislabeling a patient as having type 2 DM may have unwelcome consequences in areas as diverse as psychological well-being or insurance coverage. The consequences of mislabeling a patient with hyperglycemia who is asymptomatic as not having diabetes are uncertain.\n\n【39】Bias\n----\n\n【40】Several types of bias exist regarding screening. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, most, if not all, favor screening. Among these types of bias are selection bias, lead-time bias, and length bias.\n\n【41】**Selection Bias.** Persons who desire screening tend to be those in a population who are relatively healthy and who desire to be healthier. These persons are not typical of the general population.

Expert opinion should be considered only as a last resort. If expert opinion is the only guidance available, recommendations from the most objective, disinterested sources should be favored.\n\n【9】The USPSTF does not dispute that treatment of type 2 DM is useful; it asserts merely that evidence is insufficient to support screening, except in persons with hypertension.\n\n【10】Few studies of early detection of type 2 DM have been conducted, and randomized, controlled trials have not been performed. Screening for and early detection of type 2 DM appear to be a prelude to application of intensive treatment. Holman et al\n\n【11】10-Year follow-up of intensive glucose control in type 2 diabetes.\n\n【12】recently published a report on 10-year follow-up of the intensive treatment of type 2 DM in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), which showed long-term microvascular benefit and reduced myocardial infarctions and mortality. In that study, _intensive_ treatment is defined as any treatment that is not diet only. After exclusion of the mildest cases, the comparison is essentially between “no treatment” and any treatment at all, hardly what most people think of as intensive therapy. Most physicians can agree that treatment is better than no treatment, which is really all that the cited investigators conclude. The issue arises as to whether the pursuit of the academic target of 6.5% to 7.0% for glycated hemoglobin is required or whether any treatment that reduces the patient's glycated hemoglobin to less than 8% is adequate. This question has not yet been answered.\n\n【13】The weight of the prior literature has not been able to identify macrovascular benefits of tight control in type 2 DM. Some microvascular effects are reduced, but reduction in coronary artery disease and stroke in this population has been difficult to demonstrate in shorter-term studies. Moreover, neither the original UKPDS nor the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease (ADVANCE) trial showed any macrovascular benefit to tight glucose control.\n\n【14】*   UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Group\n\n【15】Effect of intensive blood-glucose control with metformin on complications in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes (UKPDS 34).\n\n【16】ADVANCE Collaborative Group  \nIntensive blood glucose control and vascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n【17】The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study found that, compared with standard therapy, the use of intensive therapy (which targeted a glycated hemoglobin of <6.0%) increased mortality and did not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events.\n\n【18】*   Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Study Group\n\n【19】Effects of intensive glucose lowering in type 2 diabetes.\n\n【20】In light of the new UKPDS report, duration of treatment, not intensity, may be the key to beneficial outcomes.\n\n【21】To secure the macrovascular benefit of intensive control and to refute the findings of the ACCORD study, which are directly applicable to the question at hand, Sheehy et al invoke the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT).\n\n【22】*   Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group\n\n【23】The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n\n【24】The DCCT was conducted in a population with a different disease (patients with type 1 DM) and may not be generalizable to the population of patients with type 2 DM. The DCCT cannot be construed as incontrovertible evidence that tight/intensive control of glucose in type 2 DM is justified. In addition, the ADVANCE and ACCORD studies were conducted in different populations (those with newly diagnosed vs long-standing disease), which may help explain the conflicting results. Also, the UKPDS found that control of blood pressure has a higher yield in prevention of morbidity than strict control of blood sugar.\n\n【25】*   UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group\n\n【26】Tight blood pressure control and risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes: UKPDS 38.\n\n【27】Although the UKPDS did technically support tight control, the definition of _tight control_ was very broad, ie, any pharmacologic intervention whatsoever (eg, metformin or a sulfonylurea medication).\n\n【28】Guidelines\n----------\n\n【29】Disease-specific guidelines that promote screening may be incomplete and are subject to external factors, such as the amount and quality of supporting evidence, the availability of funding for screening programs and treatment, and public review and support. Diabetes mellitus is a severe public health problem, the incidence and prevalence of which are increasing. Finding and treating patients with type 2 DM is a goal broadly shared in the medical community. Most of the Wilson and Jungner criteria\n\n【30】_Principles and Practice of Screening for Disease_ . World Health Organization Public Health Papers, No. 34.\n\n【31】are met for screening for type 2 DM, but few if any apply to screening for impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Also, the Wilson and Jungner criteria are 40 years old and have been expanded to include caveats about the value of early treatment.\n\n【32】Screening criteria: the Wilson-Jungner criteria for appraising the validity of a screening programme.\n\n【33】Whether screening for type 2 DM precisely meets all the relevant criteria for disease screening remains unclear. The primary concern is that the available evidence is neither clear nor conclusive that treatment is more beneficial if initiated at an early vs at a later stage. The pathophysiology and natural history of type 2 DM are still poorly understood despite basic science breakthroughs, ongoing research, and the disease burden on the population. Pending further evidence-based studies showing that early detection and treatment of asymptomatic type 2 DM are warranted, implementation of screening programs should perhaps be postponed.\n\n【34】Competing Priorities\n--------------------\n\n【35】Coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease are the number 1 and number 3 causes of death in the United States, respectively. Hypertension, elevated cholesterol levels, and type 2 DM all place patients at increased risk of these diseases. Which of these risk factors should we make it a priority to reduce? In my opinion, none of the above. Instead, lifestyle interventions should be encouraged. The 3 preferred interventions—smoking cessation, proper diet, and appropriate exercise—have salutary effects on both outcomes and risk factors but do not require medical care or incur expense. However, recidivism is common with these 3 preferred interventions, and long-term success is unusual.\n\n【36】Funds expended on lesser or futile interventions represent an opportunity cost (ie, the cost of an alternative path that must be foregone in order to pursue a certain action) for possibly more cost-effective services. Of course, appropriate pharmacologic intervention for these conditions should be instituted as warranted within the current standard of medical practice. The broad benefits of primary prevention of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease in terms of lifestyle changes and smoking cessation may outweigh the secondary prevention of detection of asymptomatic disease. However, in this age of $4.00 prescriptions for generic drugs, perhaps the answer _is_ a prescription for a pill, even though it may carry its own risks and adverse effects. The best option is not clear.\n\n【37】Testing Errors\n--------------\n\n【38】Test results can be classified as true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Unfortunately, the accurate classification of outcomes can be known only if a criterion standard for comparison of the screen exists. Expensive, difficult, or nonexistent criterion standards can lead to undue enthusiasm for the screen in the absence of evidence of adequate test characteristics. The test characteristics of glucose screening are reasonably good, but the clinical value is unclear. Mislabeling a patient as having type 2 DM may have unwelcome consequences in areas as diverse as psychological well-being or insurance coverage. The consequences of mislabeling a patient with hyperglycemia who is asymptomatic as not having diabetes are uncertain.\n\n【39】Bias\n----\n\n【40】Several types of bias exist regarding screening. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, most, if not all, favor screening. Among these types of bias are selection bias, lead-time bias, and length bias.\n\n【41】**Selection Bias.** Persons who desire screening tend to be those in a population who are relatively healthy and who desire to be healthier. These persons are not typical of the general population. Persons who are screened tend to have better outcomes because they are healthier to begin with, and they have different health objectives.\n\n【42】**Lead-Time Bias.** Suppose we have a screening test for lung cancer and assume that we have no truly effective treatment for lung cancer.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated a PFO with atrial septal aneurysm and a small right-to-left shunt at rest on bubble study, which became large during a Valsalva maneuver. The study results were otherwise normal. How should this patient be managed?\n\n【15】This patient with unexplained ischemic stroke most likely had paradoxical embolization of a thrombus through the PFO. This presumptive diagnosis is supported by the presence of deep vein thrombosis on duplex scanning, the “high-risk” finding of atrial septal aneurysm, and the lack of demonstration of other potential causes of stroke in an otherwise healthy young patient.\n\n【16】Proposal for updated nomenclature and classification of potential causative mechanism in patent foramen ovale–associated stroke.\n\n【17】Suggested testing for PFO device closure is shown in Table 1 .\n\n【18】Table 1 Patent Foramen Ovale Closure for Unexplained Stroke\n\n| The following are required: |\n| --- |\n| Ischemic (embolic) stroke etiology confirmed by neurology consultation/imaging |\n| PFO with right-to-left shunting documented by echocardiography bubble study |\n| Absence of other cardiac embolic sources (eg, PFE, LAA thrombus) |\n| Negative venous thrombophilia screen including lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies |\n| MRA or CT angiogram of the extracranial arterial circulation negative for embolic source including dissection |\n| Cardiac rhythm monitoring (30-120 days) negative for atrial fibrillation |\n\n【20】CT, computed tomography; LAA, left atrial appendage; MRA, magnetic resonance angiography; PFE, papillary fibroelastoma; PFO, patent foramen ovale.\n\n【21】Recent randomized trials of PFO device closure versus antiplatelet therapy have demonstrated the superiority of device closure for prevention of recurrent stroke after a first event in patients under the age of 60 who had undergone a comprehensive assessment for more common causes of stroke, such as atherosclerotic disease involving the cervical vessels, spontaneous arterial dissection, and overt or subclinical atrial fibrillation as detected on cardiac monitoring.\n\n【22】Cryptogenic stroke and high-risk patent foramen ovale: The DEFENSE-PFO Trial.\n\n【23】Patent foramen ovale closure or anticoagulation vs. antiplatelets after stroke.\n\n【24】Long-term outcomes of patent foramen ovale closure or medical therapy after stroke.\n\n【25】Patent foramen ovale closure or antiplatelet therapy for cryptogenic stroke.\n\n【26】In a recent meta-analysis comparing device closure of PFO versus antiplatelet therapy, the absolute reduction in the incidence of recurrent stroke was 8.7% over 5 years of follow-up (10% vs 1.3%).\n\n【27】Patent foramen ovale closure, antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation in patients with patent foramen ovale and cryptogenic stroke: A systematic review and network meta-analysis incorporating complementary external evidence.\n\n【28】The US Food and Drug Administration has approved 2 devices for closure of PFO: the Amplatzer PFO occluder and the Gore Cardioform septal occluder .

Ao, aortic; AS, atrial septum; LA, left atrium; PFO, patent foramen ovale; RA, right atrium.\n\n【31】Guideline recommendations published in 2020 by the American Academy of Neurology recommend device closure of PFO over antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of recurrent stroke, in carefully evaluated patients without another demonstrated stroke etiology.\n\n【32】Practice advisory update summary: Patent foramen ovale and secondary stroke prevention.\n\n【33】This recommendation has been endorsed by the Society for Cardiac Angiography and Intervention, American Heart Association, and American Stroke Association.\n\n【34】This patient underwent device closure as an outpatient procedure and returned to work 3 days later. She has had no complications and no recurrence of neurologic symptoms.\n\n【35】Case 3\n------\n\n【36】A 26-year-old man with transient left-sided weakness had a transthoracic echocardiogram as part of an evaluation for possible source of embolism. This demonstrated a right-to-left shunt by bubble study, but the exact location of the shunt could not be determined. Subsequently, TEE showed no evidence of intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunting . What is the explanation for this discrepancy?\n\n【37】Figure 4 Transesophageal echocardiogram, bubble study case 3. No microbubbles seen in LA, indicating no right-to-left shunting present. LA, left atrium; RA, right atrium.\n\n【38】The patient required heavy intravenous sedation for TEE because of a prominent gag reflex. He was unable to perform a satisfactory Valsalva maneuver during the TEE, and his PFO and related atrial level shunt went undetected. Later the same day, he underwent a repeated transthoracic bubble study that showed a large right-to-left atrial shunt after Valsalva release . Intracardiac echocardiography performed at the time of PFO device closure, confirmed the presence of a large PFO.\n\n【39】Figure 5 Transthoracic echocardiogram, bubble study case 3. Large number of microbubbles in LV, indicate large right-to-left shunt is present. LV, left ventricle; RV, right ventricle.\n\n【40】Intravenous sedation interferes with adequate performance of the Valsalva maneuver in some patients,\n\n【41】Comparison of transthoracic versus transesophageal echocardiography for detection of right-to-left atrial shunting using agitated saline contrast.\n\n【42】and it can cause a false-negative TEE examination result for right-to-left shunting. For patients referred to our echocardiographic laboratory, we perform transthoracic bubble study before sedation for a TEE examination, to improve the sensitivity of detecting a PFO with shunting. In all patients undergoing TEE bubble study for possible right-to-left shunting, it is important to localize the exact location of the shunt. If microbubbles appear in the left atrium but cannot be seen crossing the atrial septum (through a PFO or atrial septal defect), then careful examination of pulmonary veins must be performed to detect an intrapulmonary shunt—for example, owing to pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.\n\n【43】Case 4\n------\n\n【44】A 57-year-old man presented to the General Cardiology Clinic with a complaint of intermittent dyspnea. There was no history of cardiac disease. He had a history of farmer’s lung, but no recent pulmonary symptoms. His physical examination was unrevealing. When asked more specifically to describe his symptoms, he noted that they could occur at any time, and that he had learned that by walking around or otherwise exercising for a few minutes, his dyspnea would often improve. His symptoms had been attributed to farmer’s lung.\n\n【45】Evaluation in the pulmonary function laboratory demonstrated resting hypoxemia with an O <sub>2 </sub> saturation of 97% in supine position and as low as 84% in the sitting and standing positions. There was no correction with nasal cannula oxygen at 2, 4, and 6 L/min. However, after the patient had walked on a treadmill for a few minutes while breathing room air, his oxygen saturation increased to 96% . What is the explanation for these findings?\n\n【46】Table 2 Oxygen Titration Study From Case 4 Demonstrating Arterial Desaturation Unresponsive to Oxygen, Self-Correcting With Exercise\n\n| Inspired gas | Activity | Time (min) | SpO 2 (%) | Heart rate (beats/min) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Room air | Rest | 7.0 | 87 | 58 |\n| 4 L/min | Rest | 2.0 | 86 | 91 |\n| 6 L/min oxymizer | Rest | 3.0 | 87 | 85 |\n| 8 L/min oxymizer | Rest | 2.0 | 84 | 92 |\n| Room air | 2.5 mph, 4.5% grade | 3.0 | 97 | 109 |\n| Room air | 2.5 mph, 6% grade | 2.0 | 96 | 114 |\n| Room air | 2.5 mph, 7.5% grade | 3.0 | 96 | 116 |\n| Total exercise time | Total exercise time | 16 |  |  |\n\n【48】Echocardiography demonstrated a PFO with intermittent right-to-left shunting that increased in the upright position, as demonstrated by bubble study injections. Pulse oximetry confirmed normal supine arterial O <sub>2 </sub> saturation with a fall in saturation in the upright position. Grade 1 left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was also noted. A diagnosis of platypnea-orthodeoxia was made, and he subsequently underwent uncomplicated device closure of a large PFO. His symptoms and the associated intermittent arterial desaturation resolved.\n\n【49】The finding of resting arterial desaturation that improves with exercise is unusual. We hypothesized that at rest in the upright position, right atrial pressure was higher than the left atrial pressure for some portion of the cardiac cycle, perhaps related to abnormal pulmonary resistance from the patient’s pre-existing lung disease. Right-to-left shunting would occur at this time. With exercise, the left atrial pressure increased because of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, thus reducing or eliminating the right-to-left shunting by increasing the left-to-right atrial pressure gradient. As a result, symptoms and desaturation would diminish with exercise. PFO device closure is an effective treatment for patients with platypnea-orthodeoxia, and most will have prompt resolution of symptoms after device placement.\n\n【50】Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome: An overlooked cause of hypoxemia.\n\n【51】Arterial blood gases and shunt studies in different body positions are key to diagnosing this treatable condition.\n\n【52】Case 5\n------\n\n【53】A 63-year-old woman was referred for consideration of PFO device closure because of progressive exertional dyspnea and an abnormal echocardiogram. The echocardiogram demonstrated a PFO with no shunting at rest, but a large right-to-left shunt induced with Valsalva release. Grade 1 diastolic filling abnormality was also present. An exercise test showed limiting dyspnea at about 6 METs of activity, and this was accompanied by arterial desaturation as measured by fingertip pulse oximetry. There was no evidence of ischemia on imaging. It was believed that the PFO could be contributing to the patient’s exertional dyspnea, and the patient was referred for consideration of device closure. How should this patient be managed?\n\n【54】A second upright exercise test was performed using a forehead pulse oximeter. This test did not show any arterial desaturation despite reproduction of the patient’s symptoms of breathlessness. Again, there was no indication of myocardial ischemia. Subsequently, right heart catheterization with supine bicycle exercise was performed; it reproduced the patient’s symptoms of dyspnea and was characteristic of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The resting pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 14 mm Hg increased to 28 mm Hg at peak exercise, with reproduction of severe dyspnea. At this time, arterial O <sub>2 </sub> saturation measured by oximetry and blood gas analysis was 96%. This patient’s symptoms were due to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The Valsalva-induced right-to-left shunt appeared to be an incidental finding, and PFO device closure was not recommended. The arterial desaturation during initial exercise testing was not duplicated with forehead oximetry and was attributed to poor contact of the fingertip probe. This has also been noted in patients with Raynaud disease. The significance of inducible right-to-left shunting in patients with dyspnea and arterial desaturation has been evaluated in small numbers of patients.\n\n【55】Effectiveness of percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale for hypoxemia.\n\n【56】Patent foramen ovale and hypoxemia.\n\n【57】PFO closure may be appropriate if other causes of arterial desaturation are carefully excluded. In patients with dyspnea, PFO and inducible right-to-left shunt, but without arterial desaturation at rest or with exercise, PFO closure is not of proven benefit. However, this subset of patients has not been systematically studied. Many of these patients might have an alternative explanation for dyspnea, as did the patient in this case.\n\n【58】Case 6\n------\n\n【59】A 70-year-old man is scheduled to undergo dual-chamber pacemaker implantation for symptomatic bradycardia. He has a known asymptomatic PFO previously documented by echocardiography. His referring physician questions whether the PFO should be closed to prevent the possibility of right-to-left embolization of potential pacemaker thrombus in the future. What should you tell her?\n\n【60】The data here are discordant. In one study of patients with intracardiac device leads, those who had a documented PFO showed a higher incidence of stroke compared with those who did not have a PFO documented.\n\n【61】Stroke or transient ischemic attack in patients with transvenous pacemaker or defibrillator and echocardiographically detected patent foramen ovale.\n\n【62】In a separate case control series of patients, all of whom had PFO, the presence of intracardiac device leads did not confer an additional risk of stroke. In fact, most strokes could be related to the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in this latter population.\n\n【63】Risk of Cerebrovascular events in patients with patent foramen ovale and intracardiac devices.\n\n【64】PFO closure was not recommended in this patient. On the other hand, for patients with obvious device lead thrombus or vegetations, and large right-to-left shunt through a PFO, device closure of PFO or anticoagulation therapy should be considered. PFO closure can be especially important in those undergoing device lead extraction, to prevent paradoxical embolization. In younger patients with genetically mediated malignant arrhythmias and PFO requiring lifelong implantable cardioverter defibrillator for sudden death prevention, shared decision making would be recommended to address the concerns raised regarding the potential for paradoxical embolism over ensuing decades.\n\n【65】Case 7\n------\n\n【66】A 24-year-old medical student plans to take sport scuba diving lessons. She has just finished the cardiovascular physiology section and questions whether she should have an echocardiogram to rule out a PFO as a risk for decompression illness during her dives. What is the appropriate response?\n\n【67】Screening for PFO is not currently recommended to reduce the chance of decompression illness for sport scuba divers.\n\n【68】Patent foramen ovale and scuba diving: A practical guide for physicians on when to refer for screening.\n\n【69】Decompression illness is extremely uncommon, under 0.1% in the overall population of sport divers, and it is unlikely to be reduced further by routine PFO closure. In all patients, safe scuba diving behavior is recommended to prevent decompression illness. On the other hand, in commercial divers, or those with prior episodes of decompression illness, examination for and closure of PFO may be indicated. In a registry of divers with a history of decompression illness and documented PFO, closure of PFO eliminated recurrent episodes of decompression illness, whereas those not closed had a continuing risk of future events.\n\n【70】Patent foramen ovale closure is effective in divers: Long-term results from the DIVE-PFO Registry.\n\n【71】Case 8\n------\n\n【72】A 36-year-old woman with frequent migraines has been found to have PFO on an echocardiogram. Should PFO closure be considered to reduce the occurrence of her migraines?\n\n【73】The prevalence of PFO is 20%-25% in the general population; the prevalence of migraine is approximately 12%. Thus, a large number of individuals will have both conditions by chance alone. The transatrial passage of vasoactive substances, such as serotonin or microemboli that are normally filtered by the lungs, into the brain circulation has been proposed as a cause of migraine attack, and observational studies have suggested a benefit of PFO closure among migraineurs. Three prospective randomized trials have examined this question.\n\n【74】Migraine intervention with STARFlex Technology (MIST) Trial.\n\n【75】Percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale in migraine with aura, a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【76】Percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale in patients with migraine: The PREMIUM Trial.\n\n【77】None met their primary endpoints for efficacy. The most recent of these, the Premium trial,\n\n【78】Percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale in patients with migraine: The PREMIUM Trial.\n\n【79】was double blinded and sham controlled. The primary endpoint was defined as a 50% reduction in migraine attacks. This endpoint was not met. However, individuals randomized to the treatment arm did experience a reduction in headache days per month (about 1.4 fewer) and were more likely to have complete remission of migraine (8.5% vs. 1%). In a non-prespecified subgroup analysis of patients having predominantly migraine with aura, there was a statistically significant reduction in headache frequency. Of note, the placebo response rate was 31% in the sham treatment group, indicating a strong placebo effect of the procedure. PFO closure was not recommended for this individual. Further investigations into the potential relationship of migraine and PFO are underway.\n\n【80】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【81】PFO is common, with a prevalence in the general population of approximately 20%-25%. PFO closure is indicated in carefully selected patients with otherwise unexplained stroke after a comprehensive evaluation performed by a dedicated team of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular specialists or well documented platypnea-orthodeoxia. Though closure is most commonly performed through a percutaneous approach, there may be a role for surgical closure, often semi-robotic, in select patients with other coexisting cardiac defects or anatomy unsuitable for device placement.\n\n【82】In the absence of arterial desaturation, otherwise unexplained dyspnea is unlikely to be improved by PFO device closure, but this question needs more study. For most patients undergoing pacemaker implantation, sport divers, or those with migraine, there are currently no guideline indications for routine PFO closure. An individualized approach incorporating expert advice and shared decision making will be needed in some patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:30:28", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:30:43", "cost": 14.877}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:39", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:30:43", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:30:27"}

The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.\n\n【2】Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and overall health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer.\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include:\n\n【6】*   Chest pain when you breathe or cough\n*   Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)\n*   Cough, which may produce phlegm\n*   Fatigue\n*   Fever, sweating and shaking chills\n*   Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems)\n*   Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea\n*   Shortness of breath\n\n【7】Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection. Or they may vomit, have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or have difficulty breathing and eating.\n\n【8】#### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】See your doctor if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you're coughing up pus.\n\n【10】It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a doctor:\n\n【11】*   Adults older than age 65\n*   Children younger than age 2 with signs and symptoms\n*   People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system\n*   People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system\n\n【12】For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】Many germs can cause pneumonia. The most common are bacteria and viruses in the air we breathe. Your body usually prevents these germs from infecting your lungs. But sometimes these germs can overpower your immune system, even if your health is generally good.\n\n【15】Pneumonia is classified according to the types of germs that cause it and where you got the infection.\n\n【16】#### Community-acquired pneumonia\n\n【17】Community-acquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia. It occurs outside of hospitals or other health care facilities. It may be caused by:\n\n【18】*   **Bacteria.** The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. is Streptococcus pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur on its own or after you've had a cold or the flu. It may affect one part (lobe) of the lung, a condition called lobar pneumonia.\n*   **Bacteria-like organisms.** Mycoplasma pneumoniae also can cause pneumonia. It typically produces milder symptoms than do other types of pneumonia. Walking pneumonia is an informal name given to this type of pneumonia, which typically isn't severe enough to require bed rest.\n*   **Fungi.** This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large doses of the organisms. The fungi that cause it can be found in soil or bird droppings and vary depending upon geographic location.\n*   **Viruses, including COVID-19.** Some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu can cause pneumonia. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Viral pneumonia is usually mild. But in some cases it can become very serious. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may cause pneumonia, which can become severe.\n\n【19】#### Hospital-acquired pneumonia\n\n【20】Some people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness. Hospital-acquired pneumonia can be serious because the bacteria causing it may be more resistant to antibiotics and because the people who get it are already sick. People who are on breathing machines (ventilators), often used in intensive care units, are at higher risk of this type of pneumonia.\n\n【21】#### Health care-acquired pneumonia\n\n【22】Health care-acquired pneumonia is a bacterial infection that occurs in people who live in long-term care facilities or who receive care in outpatient clinics, including kidney dialysis centers. Like hospital-acquired pneumonia, health care-acquired pneumonia can be caused by bacteria that are more resistant to antibiotics.\n\n【23】#### Aspiration pneumonia\n\n【24】Aspiration pneumonia occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit or saliva into your lungs. Aspiration is more likely if something disturbs your normal gag reflex, such as a brain injury or swallowing problem, or excessive use of alcohol or drugs.\n\n【25】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【26】Pneumonia can affect anyone. But the two age groups at highest risk are:\n\n【27】*   Children who are 2 years old or younger\n*   People who are age 65 or older\n\n【28】Other risk factors include:\n\n【29】*   **Being hospitalized.** You're at greater risk of pneumonia if you're in a hospital intensive care unit, especially if you're on a machine that helps you breathe (a ventilator).\n*   **Chronic disease.** You're more likely to get pneumonia if you have asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart disease.\n*   **Smoking.** Smoking damages your body's natural defenses against the bacteria and viruses that cause pneumonia.\n*   **Weakened or suppressed immune system.** People who have HIV/AIDS, who've had an organ transplant, or who receive chemotherapy or long-term steroids are at risk.\n\n【30】Complications\n-------------\n\n【31】Even with treatment, some people with pneumonia, especially those in high-risk groups, may experience complications, including:\n\n【32】*   **Bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia).** Bacteria that enter the bloodstream from your lungs can spread the infection to other organs, potentially causing organ failure.\n*   **Difficulty breathing.** If your pneumonia is severe or you have chronic underlying lung diseases, you may have trouble breathing in enough oxygen. You may need to be hospitalized and use a breathing machine (ventilator) while your lung heals.\n*   **Fluid accumulation around the lungs (pleural effusion).** Pneumonia may cause fluid to build up in the thin space between layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity (pleura). If the fluid becomes infected, you may need to have it drained through a chest tube or removed with surgery.\n*   **Lung abscess.** An abscess occurs if pus forms in a cavity in the lung. An abscess is usually treated with antibiotics. Sometimes, surgery or drainage with a long needle or tube placed into the abscess is needed to remove the pus.\n\n【33】Prevention\n----------\n\n【34】To help prevent pneumonia:\n\n【35】*   **Get vaccinated.** Vaccines are available to prevent some types of pneumonia and the flu. Talk with your doctor about getting these shots. The vaccination guidelines have changed over time so make sure to review your vaccination status with your doctor even if you recall previously receiving a pneumonia vaccine.\n*   **Make sure children get vaccinated.** Doctors recommend a different pneumonia vaccine for children younger than age 2 and for children ages 2 to 5 years who are at particular risk of pneumococcal disease. Children who attend a group child care center should also get the vaccine. Doctors also recommend flu shots for children older than 6 months.\n*   **Practice good hygiene.** To protect yourself against respiratory infections that sometimes lead to pneumonia, wash your hands regularly or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\n*   **Don't smoke.** Smoking damages your lungs' natural defenses against respiratory infections.\n*   **Keep your immune system strong.** Get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:34:24", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:34:35", "cost": 10.741}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:39", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:34:33", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:34:22"}

Estradiol, testosterone, and cortisol levels were quantified.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】After controlling for effects of time of day and season, dads had lower mean ± SE testosterone (6.5±0.7 vs 10.0±0.9 ng/dL; _P_ <.005) and cortisol (morning values, 0.30±0.05 vs 0.53±0.05 µg/dL; _P_ <.005) concentrations, a higher proportion of samples with detectable estradiol concentrations (68% \\[308/454\\] vs 57% \\[87/154\\]; _P_ \\=.01), and higher estradiol concentrations in those detectable samples (3.81±0.09 pg/mL \\[13 dads\\] vs 3.26±0.11 pg/mL \\[9 controls\\]; _P_ <.002) than did control men. Within 10 individual dads with frequent samples before and after the birth, the percentage of samples with detectable estradiol was lower during the month before the birth than during the month after (51% vs 71%; _P_ \\=.02), and cortisol concentration was increased in the week before the birth (to a mean of 0.16 µg/dL). In each of 13 dads providing frequent samples, testosterone concentration and variance were low immediately after the birth (no change from previous levels in 5, decrease after prebirth increase in 3, and decrease relative to all other times in 5).\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】In this population of Canadian volunteers attending prenatal classes, expectant fathers had lower testosterone and cortisol levels and a higher proportion of samples with detectable estradiol concentrations than control subjects. Individual patterns of testosterone variance relative to the birth and estradiol and cortisol concentrations immediately before the birth may be worthy of further investigation.

She had been diagnosed with gout during the previous year, and this was managed with febuxostat that was initiated 3 months prior; she was not on colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or corticosteroids. Her heart failure was managed with carvedilol, losartan, eplerenone, and furosemide. In clinic, she stated that she first noticed her knee pain the previous day after spending much of the day in a dental chair with her leg extended while undergoing a root canal procedure. The pain was significant both with activity and rest. A review of systems was unremarkable; she denied fevers, chills, and malaise. She denied any preceding trauma to her knee.\n\n【1】On physical examination, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 89/55 mm Hg (near her baseline) and heart rate of 78 beats/min with a regular rhythm. She appeared to be in mild distress with an antalgic gait. Her left knee was mildly swollen, erythematous, and warm. Her knee was most tender along the anterior aspect, just superior to the patella. Knee flexion (both active and passive) exacerbated her pain and was limited to 60 degrees due to pain. Knee extension was full and less painful. No tophi were noted on exam.\n\n【2】Three weeks earlier, she had undergone laboratory testing that had shown a serum uric acid level of 5.2 mg/dL (reference range: 2.4 to 6.0 mg/dL). Before initiating febuxostat, her uric acid level had been 10.6 mg/dL.\n\n【3】*   1.\n\n【4】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ cause of this patient’s knee pain?**\n\n【5】    *   a.\n\n【6】        Cellulitis\n\n【7】    *   b.\n\n【8】        Septic arthritis\n\n【9】    *   c.\n\n【10】        Prepatellar bursitis\n\n【11】    *   d.\n\n【12】        Reactive arthritis\n\n【13】    *   e.\n\n【14】        Crystalline arthropathy\n\n【15】The patient’s clinical presentation and examination findings are concerning for an inflammatory process involving the knee, with the initial evaluation focused on differentiating between infectious versus noninfectious etiologies, intra-articular versus extra-articular processes, and systemic versus localized disease.\n\n【16】Given the patient’s severe pain with movement of the knee joint, an overlying cellulitis is less probable compared to a joint-related process. Cellulitis is also less likely to present with abrupt onset and with no preceding wound or ulceration.\n\n【17】Septic arthritis is a possibility as it frequently affects the knee with symptoms of swelling, warmth, and pain, as observed in our patient. In addition, this patient has risk factors for septic arthritis, including recent dental work, which can lead to transient bacteremia and hematogenous seeding. However, this diagnosis would be somewhat less likely in the absence of systemic symptoms, such as fever or malaise.\n\n【18】Prepatellar bursitis is possible as it commonly presents as an acute onset of knee pain, and patients are often unable to flex at the knee due to pain. This diagnosis is less likely, however, given her physical exam, as her knee was most tender superior to the patella; in the case of prepatellar bursitis, tenderness would be most pronounced anterior to the patella. In addition, pain would be less pronounced with rest, and there might be a history of frequent kneeling or recent trauma to the knee.\n\n【19】Reactive arthritis is less likely as it typically presents as an oligoarthritis most commonly in patients aged 20 to 40 years\n\n【20】Modes of presentation of reactive arthritis based on the affected joints.\n\n【21】in days-to-weeks following an inciting enteric or genitourinary infection, which our patient did not have.\n\n【22】Altogether, this patient’s presentation is most consistent with a flare of crystalline arthritis, specifically gout, with rapid presentation and maximal symptomatic severity typically reached within a day of onset, in addition to significant inflammation on exam with minimal systemic symptoms. Her prior episodes of gout and other risk factors including post-menopausal status, chronic kidney disease, and furosemide therapy also increase the likelihood of this representing a flare. While her recent uric acid level was normal, gout flares can occur despite normouricemia or even hypouricemia. In addition, although long-term treatment with urate-lowering therapy can significantly reduce gout flares, it is very common for patients to continue to have flares during the year or so following initiation of therapy. Given this, the 2020 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Management of Gout strongly recommends administering concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis therapy (eg, colchicine, NSAIDs, or prednisone/prednisolone) to lower the risk of acute gout flares during the first months of anti-hyperuricemic therapy.\n\n【23】2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout.\n\n【24】In this patient’s case, she had only been taking febuxostat for approximately 3 months before this episode, and she had unfortunately not been on prophylactic therapy due to colchicine intolerance and was avoiding NSAIDs and systemic steroids given her chronic kidney disease and heart failure.\n\n【25】*   2.\n\n【26】    **What is the _best_ next step in diagnosis and management of this patient’s knee pain?**\n\n【27】    *   a.\n\n【28】        Plain radiographs\n\n【29】    *   b.\n\n【30】        Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【31】    *   c.\n\n【32】        Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT)\n\n【33】    *   d.\n\n【34】        Diagnostic arthrocentesis\n\n【35】    *   e.\n\n【36】        Ultrasound\n\n【37】Plain radiographs would be helpful if there were suspicion for acute fracture or bony abnormality. However, other than potentially showing subcortical bone cysts without erosions or the classic juxta-articular “rat bite” lesions, plain radiographs are not typically helpful in diagnosing crystalline arthropathy. These radiographic findings are also associated with chronic gout and so are less likely to be seen in a patient with a relatively short history of gout.\n\n【38】Magnetic resonance imaging is sensitive in showing soft-tissue and osseous abnormalities, but findings observed in crystalline arthritis are not specific.\n\n【39】Dual-energy computed tomography can detect monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition within joints and soft tissues and is particularly useful for joints that are not amenable to aspiration or in cases in which there remains high suspicion for crystalline arthropathy despite negative aspiration. Dual-energy computed tomography can be falsely negative in patients with a first episode of gout and fewer than 6 weeks of symptoms.\n\n【40】Dual energy CT for the diagnosis of gout: an accuracy and diagnostic yield study.\n\n【41】However, the gold standard for gout diagnosis is joint arthrocentesis with polarized light microscopy to identify uric acid crystals within white blood cells. A further benefit of joint arthrocentesis is that aspirated synovial fluid can be sent for total nucleated cell count with differential as well as cultures if there remains a suspicion for coincident infection.\n\n【42】Ultrasound is useful to determine if a joint effusion is present that would be amenable to aspiration and to guide diagnostic arthrocentesis; however, it is not the gold standard for diagnosis of crystalline arthropathy.\n\n【43】One year before this patient’s current episode of acute knee pain, she had the onset of left mid-foot pain and was found to have a serum uric acid level of 11.2 mg/dL. In the weeks before the onset of her foot pain, she was having difficulty with episodes of congestive heart failure in the setting of her chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy. She had her medications adjusted on two occasions with improvement in heart failure symptoms. In evaluation of her foot pain, she underwent diagnostic arthrocentesis of the second tarsometatarsal joint with polarized light microscopy demonstrating intracellular uric acid crystals consistent with acute gout. Careful review and reconsideration of cardiac medications is important following a new diagnosis of gout. At the time of this initial gout flare, our patient was taking losartan, furosemide, spironolactone, and carvedilol. She had been placed on losartan after developing a persistent cough while taking lisinopril.\n\n【44】*   3.\n\n【45】    **Which antihypertensive is _most_ helpful to reduce gout exacerbations in this patient?**\n\n【46】    *   a.\n\n【47】        Lisinopril\n\n【48】    *   b.\n\n【49】        Losartan\n\n【50】    *   c.\n\n【51】        Furosemide\n\n【52】    *   d.\n\n【53】        Spironolactone\n\n【54】    *   e.\n\n【55】        Carvedilol\n\n【56】A large nested case-control study performed in the United Kingdom (involving more than 24,000 cases of incident gout in patients with hypertension and 50,000 matched controls) provided data showing the relative risk of incident gout with various antihypertensive drugs. Based on this data, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors including lisinopril is associated with an increased risk of incident gout (relative risk 1.25). In contrast, the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan is associated with fewer gout exacerbations (relative risk \\[RR\\]: 0.81). Losartan reduces serum uric acid levels by producing a uricosuric effect that is not observed in non-losartan angiotensin receptor blockers. Diuretics as a group have the strongest increased risk of incident gout (RR: 2.36).\n\n【57】Antihypertensive drugs and risk of incident gout among patients with hypertension: population based case-control study.\n\n【58】However, this risk differs among diuretics. Both thiazide and loop diuretics are known to increase serum uric acid and the risk of gout attacks by increasing renal urate reabsorption. In contrast, potassium-sparing diuretics appear to not significantly increase risk of incipient gout.\n\n【59】Use of diuretics and risk of incident gout: a population-based case-control study.\n\n【60】β-blockers such as carvedilol are associated with increased gout flares (RR: 1.48) as well as increased serum urate; however, the mechanism remains unclear.\n\n【61】Antihypertensive drugs and risk of incident gout among patients with hypertension: population based case-control study.\n\n【62】Thus, among the antihypertensives with which our patient had been treated, losartan would have provided the most benefit. Although she was taking carvedilol and furosemide, which both would have increased her risk for gout, it was not believed that her medications could be changed given her significant cardiomyopathy.\n\n【63】The gout in our patient’s foot was initially treated with a short course of oral prednisone with symptomatic resolution. Subsequently, she started on allopurinol 100 mg daily in combination with colchicine 0.6 mg daily. Two weeks after initiating these medications, she developed a rash, fever, and diarrhea with an elevated C-reactive protein 26.7 mg/L (≤10 mg/L). Allopurinol was discontinued due to suspicion of a mild drug reaction. Colchicine was also discontinued given concern it was contributing to her diarrhea. After a few months off of therapy, she was started on febuxostat.\n\n【64】*   4.\n\n【65】    **Which of the following represents this patient’s _greatest_ risk factor for a severe allopurinol hypersensitivity reaction?**\n\n【66】    *   a.\n\n【67】        Chronic kidney disease\n\n【68】    *   b.\n\n【69】        Age 60 years or older\n\n【70】    *   c.\n\n【71】        Female sex\n\n【72】    *   d.\n\n【73】        Initial allopurinol dose less than or equal to 100 mg\n\n【74】    *   e.\n\n【75】        Caucasian ethnicity\n\n【76】A large study using US Medicaid data involving 400,401 allopurinol initiators identified 203 hospitalizations as a result of severe allopurinol hypersensitivity.\n\n【77】Racial/ethnic variation and risk factors for allopurinol-associated severe cutaneous adverse reactions: a cohort study.\n\n【78】Chronic kidney disease (RR: 2.3), age 60 years or older (RR: 1.7), female sex (RR: 2.5), and initial allopurinol dose greater than 100 mg (RR: 1.9) were all identified as independent risk factors. Asians, blacks, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders were also shown to be at greater risk of allopurinol hypersensitivity reactions, with RRS of 3.0, 3.0, and 6.7, respectively, compared with whites and Hispanics. This is explained by the higher prevalence of the _HLA-B∗5801_ allele in those ethnic groups. An important caveat to this study was that stages of chronic kidney disease were not separated, and it is possible that most of the patients in this study had earlier-stage kidney disease than our patient. Patients with more advanced kidney disease and lower glomerular filtration rate are significantly more likely to have severe hypersensitivity when the starting dose of allopurinol is not appropriately adjusted. Although this patient’s chronic kidney disease, age, and sex all increased her risk for a severe allopurinol hypersensitivity reaction, given her low allopurinol starting dose, her risk was likely increased the most by her sex. Some would advocate starting an even lower dose (100 mg alternating every other day with 50 mg) to further minimize any renal-related risk with her estimated glomerular filtration rate that was just below 60 mL/min per 1.73 m  .\n\n【79】Starting dose is a risk factor for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome: a proposed safe starting dose of allopurinol.\n\n【80】To evaluate our patient’s current episode of left knee pain, she underwent diagnostic arthrocentesis. An ultrasound exam of the left knee was performed before the procedure.\n\n【81】*   5.\n\n【82】    **Which of the following ultrasound findings is _most specific_ for gout _in this patient_ ?**\n\n【83】    *   a.\n\n【84】        Double contour sign\n\n【85】    *   b.\n\n【86】        Synovitis\n\n【87】    *   c.\n\n【88】        Joint effusion\n\n【89】    *   d.\n\n【90】        Bone proliferation\n\n【91】    *   e.\n\n【92】        Juxta-articular erosion\n\n【93】The “double contour sign” is considered a highly specific ultrasound finding for gout, defined as an abnormal hyperechoic band over the superficial margin of the articular hyaline cartilage, independent of the angle of insonation, and which may be irregular or regular, continuous, or intermittent and can be distinguished from the cartilage interface sign. In a large international multicenter study, the presence of the double contour sign was 91.4% specific and had an 87.7% positive predictive value with a 69.3% negative predictive value.\n\n【94】Performance of ultrasound in the diagnosis of gout in a multicenter study: comparison with monosodium urate monohydrate crystal analysis as the gold standard.\n\n【95】In contrast, synovitis, edema within the synovium, and increased flow on Doppler ultrasound are less specific findings typically associated with an inflammatory arthritis. Joint effusion, seen on ultrasound by observing fluid in the joint space that is pushed away when compression is applied, and bone proliferation are nonspecific findings seen in a variety of arthropathies, both inflammatory and non-inflammatory. “Rat bite” or juxta-articular erosions are frequently seen in gout, though this is typically a radiographic as opposed to sonographic finding.\n\n【96】Gout: an old disease in new perspective—a review.\n\n【97】The patient’s left knee ultrasound showed no knee intra-articular effusion, minimal synovitis, and no double contour sign. No fluid could be aspirated from the joint. During the ultrasound exam there was significant point tenderness just above the patella. Images of the left quadriceps tendon/patellar enthesis (the site of attachment of the tendon to bone) showed hyperechoic crystalline deposits. Power Doppler of the same area showed extensive hyperemia. Ultrasound findings were consistent with uric acid deposition and acute inflammation of the quadriceps tendon/patellar enthesis.\n\n【98】Based on the ultrasound findings and the clinical presentation, our patient was diagnosed with gout enthesitis. Gout enthesitis could be treated with systemic glucocorticoids or NSAIDs. However, given this patient’s cardiomyopathy and frequent heart failure episodes, an ultrasound-guided peri-tendinous glucocorticoid injection was performed. Ultrasound guidance is important as inadvertent intratendinous injection could increase the risk of rupture. It is our experience that intra-articular glucocorticoid injection does not relieve symptoms of quadriceps enthesitis. Were ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection not available, use of oral dexamethasone could have been considered, as this steroid has minimal mineralocorticoid activity and thus fewer issues with volume retention.\n\n【99】Following the ultrasound-guided injection of methylprednisolone and lidocaine around the site of the quadriceps enthesis, our patient experienced immediate relief (lidocaine effect) and could fully flex her knee without pain. She continued to enjoy sustained relief of her knee pain at a visit 2 weeks later and has experienced no further episodes.\n\n【100】Discussion\n----------\n\n【101】Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in the United States with a prevalence of 1% to 4% in the adult population (1% to 2% in women, 3% to 6% in men).\n\n【102】Gout: an old disease in new perspective—a review.\n\n【103】Deposition of MSU crystals in the tissues, especially the joints and peri-articular tissues, can cause an acute inflammatory response. While hyperuricemia must be present for MSU crystals to form, uric acid levels fluctuate and are often normal during gouty attacks. When gout is suspected, synovial fluid or tophi aspirate should be obtained and studied for crystals. When this is not possible, the American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria provide an approach to diagnosis, although these are not diagnostic criteria but rather guidelines that are primarily intended for facilitating enrollment in studies.\n\n【104】2015 Gout classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative.\n\n【105】Without treatment, chronic tophaceous gout may develop, with extensive joint destruction and deformity.\n\n【106】Our patient developed gout enthesitis, which is one of the known extra-articular manifestations of gout. In individuals with gout, urate deposition can be seen in a variety of locations within the soft tissue of the musculoskeletal system, including the tendons, ligaments, bursae, and entheses.\n\n【107】The distribution of urate deposition within the extremities in gout: a review of 148 dual-energy CT cases.\n\n【108】Enthesitis is often difficult to diagnose because pain at entheseal sites often presents as arthralgia, and swelling is typically absent.\n\n【109】Enthesitis: from pathophysiology to treatment.\n\n【110】Awareness of this condition, especially in patients in whom gout flares are suspected but seemingly unresponsive to intra-articular steroid injection, can substantially improve management.\n\n【111】Once suspected, diagnosis of gout enthesitis is either based on clinical findings or may be assisted by imaging, particularly ultrasound or DECT.\n\n【112】Dual energy CT for the diagnosis of gout: an accuracy and diagnostic yield study.\n\n【113】Although there are clinical guidelines to direct treatment of gout arthropathy, there are no such guidelines for gout enthesitis; thus, treatment of this condition is typically based on recommendations for gout arthropathy. Given that this is a relatively common but greatly underdiagnosed condition, it is hoped that with increased recognition and treatment, specific guidelines for extra-articular gout will be developed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:45:09", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:45:44", "cost": 34.845}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:39", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:45:44", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:45:08"}

The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence of cutaneous NTM infection was 1.3 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.9-1.7 per 100,000 person-years). The incidence increased with age at diagnosis ( _P_ \\=.003) and was higher in 2000 to 2009 (2.0 per 100,000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.3-2.8 per 100,000 person-years) than in 1980 to 1999 (0.7 per 100,000 person-years; 95% CI, 0.3-1.1 per 100,000 person-years) ( _P_ \\=.002).

The hole increases the amount of blood that flows through the lungs. The condition is present at birth (congenital heart defect).\n\n【2】Small atrial septal defects might be found by chance and never cause a concern. Others close during infancy or early childhood.\n\n【3】A large, long-term atrial septal defect can damage the heart and lungs. Surgery may be needed to repair an atrial septal defect and to prevent complications.\n\n【4】### Types\n\n【5】Types of atrial septal defects include:\n\n【6】*   **Secundum.** This is the most common type of ASD. It occurs in the middle of the wall between the upper heart chambers (atrial septum).\n*   **Primum.** This type of ASD affects the lower part of the atrial septum and might occur with other congenital heart defects.\n*   **Sinus venosus.** This rare type of ASD usually occurs in the upper part of the wall separating the heart chambers. It's also associated with other heart structure changes present at birth.\n*   **Coronary sinus.** In this rare type of ASD, part of the wall between the coronary sinus — which is part of the vein system of the heart — and the left upper heart chamber (left atrium) is missing.\n\n【7】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【8】Many babies born with atrial septal defects have no signs or symptoms. Signs or symptoms can begin in adulthood.\n\n【9】Atrial septal defect signs and symptoms can include:\n\n【10】*   Shortness of breath, especially when exercising\n*   Fatigue\n*   Swelling of legs, feet or belly (abdomen)\n*   Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)\n*   Sensation of a rapid, pounding heartbeat (palpitations) or skipped beats\n*   Whooshing sound that can be heard through a stethoscope (heart murmur)\n\n【11】### When to see a doctor\n\n【12】Serious congenital heart defects, including large atrial septal defects, are often diagnosed before or soon after a child is born.\n\n【13】Contact your health care provider if you or your child has:\n\n【14】*   Shortness of breath\n*   Easy tiring, especially after activity\n*   Swelling of legs, feet or belly (abdomen)\n*   Sensations of a rapid, pounding heartbeat (palpitations) or skipped beats\n\n【15】Causes\n------\n\n【16】The cause of atrial septal defect is unclear. Atrial septal defect is a structure problem that occurs during heart development while a baby is still in the womb.\n\n【17】Genetics, certain medical conditions, use of certain medications, and environmental or lifestyle factors, such as smoking or alcohol misuse, may play a role.\n\n【18】### How the heart works\n\n【19】To understand the cause of atrial septal defect, it may be helpful to know how the heart typically works.\n\n【20】The typical heart is made of four chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).\n\n【21】The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs. In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and then returns it to the heart's left side. The left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the body's main artery (aorta) and out to the rest of the body.\n\n【22】A large atrial septal defect can cause extra blood to overfill the lungs and overwork the right side of the heart. If not treated, the right side of the heart eventually grows larger and becomes weak. The blood pressure in the arteries in the lungs can also increase, leading to pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【23】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【24】Atrial septal defect (ASD) occurs as the baby's heart is developing during pregnancy. Certain health conditions or drug use during pregnancy may increase a baby's risk of atrial septal defect or other congenital heart defect. These things include:\n\n【25】*   German measles (rubella) infection during the first few months of pregnancy\n*   Diabetes\n*   Lupus\n*   Alcohol or tobacco use\n*   Illegal drug use, such as cocaine\n*   Use of certain medications, including some anti-seizure medications and drugs to treat mood disorders\n\n【26】Some types of congenital heart defects occur in families (inherited). If you have or someone in your family has congenital heart disease, including ASD, screening by a genetic counselor can help determine the risk of certain heart defects in future children.\n\n【27】Complications\n-------------\n\n【28】A small atrial septal defect might never cause any concern. Small atrial septal defects often close during infancy.\n\n【29】Larger atrial septal defects can cause serious complications, including:\n\n【30】*   Right-sided heart failure\n*   Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)\n*   Stroke\n*   Early death\n*   High blood pressure in the lung arteries (pulmonary hypertension)\n\n【31】Pulmonary hypertension can cause permanent lung damage. This complication, called Eisenmenger syndrome, usually develops over many years and occurs uncommonly in people with large atrial septal defects.\n\n【32】Treatment can prevent or help manage many of these complications.\n\n【33】### Atrial septal defect and pregnancy\n\n【34】If you have an atrial septal defect and are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, it's important to talk to your health care provider and to seek proper prenatal care. A health care provider may recommend ASD repair before conceiving. A large atrial septal defect or its complications can lead to a high-risk pregnancy.\n\n【35】Prevention\n----------\n\n【36】Because the cause of atrial septal defect (ASD) is unclear, prevention may not be possible. But getting good prenatal care is important. If you have an ASD and are planning to become pregnant, schedule a visit with your health care provider. This visit should include:\n\n【37】*   **Discussing current health conditions and medications.** You'll need to monitor certain health conditions, such as diabetes or lupus, during pregnancy. Your health care provider might also recommend adjusting or stopping certain medications before pregnancy.\n*   **Reviewing your family medical history.** If you have a family history of congenital heart defects or other genetic conditions, consider talking with a genetic counselor to determine your specific risks.\n*   **Getting tested for immunity to German measles (rubella).** Rubella in the mother has been linked to some types of congenital heart defects in the baby.

The immunostaining pattern was determined to be GAD65-specific by radioimmunoprecipitation assay. These cases were identified among samples submitted for paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation using indirect immunofluorescence. In no case had GAD65 or any other islet cell antibody testing been requested.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】In most cases, the patients' presentations were initially considered neurodegenerative or inflammatory (multiple sclerosis or paraneoplastic). Median age at onset was 50 years, and 77% were women. Of the 44 patients seen at the Mayo Clinic, 23% were African American; in contrast, less than 10% of Mayo Clinic's neurology patients are African American. Median follow-up was 24 months. The radioimmunoprecipitation assay values for GAD65 antibody were extremely high (median, 1429 nmol/L; interquartile range, 643-3078 nmol/L) and correlated significantly with immunofluorescence titers (median, 3840; interquartile range, 1920-15,360; _r_ \\=0.81; _P_ <.001). Neurological manifestations were multifocal in 41 patients and included cerebellar ataxia (63%), brainstem involvement (29%), seizures (27%), stiff-man phenomena (26%), extrapyramidal signs (16%), and myelopathy (8%). One third of the patients had type 1 diabetes mellitus, 53% had thyroid autoantibodies, and 16% had vitiligo. Eleven of 20 patients identified as African American had brainstem involvement. Some patients appeared to benefit from short-term immunosuppression (none received long-term therapy).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】The neurological spectrum of GAD65 autoimmunity includes brainstem, extrapyramidal, and spinal cord syndromes. In our experience, African American patients were disproportionately affected. A patient with a presumed neurodegenerative disorder of new onset, with high levels of GAD65 antibody (>20 nmol/L), merits consideration of immunotherapy.\n\n【8】CNS ( central nervous system ), GABA ( γ-aminobutyric acid ), GAD65 ( glutamic acid decarboxylase ), IA-2 ( islet cell tyrosine phosphatase-like protein ), IQR ( interquartile range ), MRS ( modified Rankin scale ), RIA ( radioimmunoprecipitation assay ), SMS ( stiff-man syndrome )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:57:58", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:58:01", "cost": 3.319}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:39", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:58:01", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:57:57"}

It is also used to lower the risk of death in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\n\n【3】Empagliflozin works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. Linagliptin helps to control blood sugar levels by making the pancreas gland release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar when there is too much sugar in the blood. Metformin reduces the absorption of sugar from the stomach, reduces the release of stored sugar from the liver, and helps your body use sugar better.

They develop on areas of skin that often flex — such as the lower abdomen, upper thighs or armpits. Bullous pemphigoid is most common in older adults.\n\n【2】Bullous pemphigoid occurs when your immune system attacks a thin layer of tissue below your outer layer of skin. The reason for this abnormal immune response is unknown, although it sometimes can be triggered by taking certain medications.\n\n【3】Bullous pemphigoid often goes away on its own in a few months, but may take as many as five years to resolve. Treatment usually helps heal the blisters and ease any itching. It may include corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, and other drugs that suppress the immune system. Bullous pemphigoid can be life-threatening, especially for older people who are already in poor health.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The signs and symptoms of bullous pemphigoid may include:\n\n【6】*   Itching skin, weeks or months before blisters form\n*   Large blisters that don't easily rupture when touched, often along creases or folds in the skin\n*   Skin around the blisters that is normal, reddish or darker than normal\n*   Eczema or a hive-like rash\n*   Small blisters or sores in the mouth or other mucous membranes (benign mucous membrane pemphigoid)\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】See your doctor if you develop:\n\n【9】*   Unexplained blistering\n*   Blisters on your eyes\n*   Signs of infection\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】The blisters occur because of a malfunction in your immune system.\n\n【12】Your body's immune system normally produces antibodies to fight bacteria, viruses or other potentially harmful foreign substances. For reasons that are not clear, the body may develop an antibody to a particular tissue in your body.\n\n【13】In bullous pemphigoid, the immune system produces antibodies to the fibers that connect the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and the next layer of skin (dermis). These antibodies trigger inflammation that produces the blisters and itching of bullous pemphigoid.\n\n【14】### Contributing factors\n\n【15】Bullous pemphigoid usually appears randomly with no clear factors contributing to the onset of disease. Some cases may be triggered by:\n\n【16】*   **Medications.** Prescription drugs that may cause bullous pemphigoid include etanercept (Enbrel), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), furosemide (Lasix) and penicillin.\n*   **Light and radiation.** Ultraviolet light therapy to treat certain skin conditions may trigger bullous pemphigoid, as can radiation therapy to treat cancer.\n*   **Medical conditions.** Disorders that may trigger bullous pemphigoid include psoriasis, lichen planus, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis.\n\n【17】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【18】Bullous pemphigoid most commonly occurs in older adults, and the risk increases with age.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:36:15", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:36:27", "cost": 12.12}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:39", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:36:26", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:36:14"}

Physical examination revealed jaundice and a nontender visible mass in the right upper abdominal quadrant. The total serum bilirubin level was 12 mg/dL, and levels of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase were high. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed severe distention of the gallbladder, which was protruding the abdominal wall, along with dilatation of the common bile duct caused by a heterogeneous mass in the head of the pancreas. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography confirmed the presence of a 5-cm pancreatic mass with vascular invasion. The patient refused surgery.

This thickened, stiff tissue makes it more difficult for your lungs to work properly. As pulmonary fibrosis worsens, you become progressively more short of breath.\n\n【2】The scarring associated with pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by a multitude of factors. But in most cases, doctors can't pinpoint what's causing the problem. When a cause can't be found, the condition is termed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【3】The lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis can't be repaired, but medications and therapies can sometimes help ease symptoms and improve quality of life. For some people, a lung transplant might be appropriate.\n\n【4】Pulmonary fibrosis care at Mayo Clinic\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis may include:\n\n【7】*   Shortness of breath (dyspnea)\n*   A dry cough\n*   Fatigue\n*   Unexplained weight loss\n*   Aching muscles and joints\n*   Widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes (clubbing)\n\n【8】The course of pulmonary fibrosis — and the severity of symptoms — can vary considerably from person to person. Some people become ill very quickly with severe disease. Others have moderate symptoms that worsen more slowly, over months or years.\n\n【9】Some people may experience a rapid worsening of their symptoms (acute exacerbation), such as severe shortness of breath, that may last for several days to weeks. People who have acute exacerbations may be placed on a mechanical ventilator. Doctors may also prescribe antibiotics, corticosteroid medications or other medications to treat an acute exacerbation.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Pulmonary fibrosis scars and thickens the tissue around and between the air sacs (alveoli) in your lungs. This makes it more difficult for oxygen to pass into your bloodstream. The damage can be caused by many different factors — including long-term exposure to certain toxins, certain medical conditions, radiation therapy and some medications.\n\n【12】#### Occupational and environmental factors\n\n【13】Long-term exposure to a number of toxins and pollutants can damage your lungs. These include:\n\n【14】*   Silica dust\n*   Asbestos fibers\n*   Hard metal dusts\n*   Coal dust\n*   Grain dust\n*   Bird and animal droppings\n\n【15】#### Radiation treatments\n\n【16】Some people who receive radiation therapy for lung or breast cancer show signs of lung damage months or sometimes years after the initial treatment. The severity of the damage may depend on:\n\n【17】*   How much of the lung was exposed to radiation\n*   The total amount of radiation administered\n*   Whether chemotherapy also was used\n*   The presence of underlying lung disease\n\n【18】#### Medications\n\n【19】Many drugs can damage your lungs, especially medications such as:\n\n【20】*   **Chemotherapy drugs.** Drugs designed to kill cancer cells, such as methotrexate (Trexall, Otrexup, others) and cyclophosphamide, can also damage lung tissue.\n*   **Heart medications.** Some drugs used to treat irregular heartbeats, such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Nexterone, Pacerone), may harm lung tissue.\n*   **Some antibiotics.** Antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Macrodantin, others) or ethambutol can cause lung damage.\n*   **Anti-inflammatory drugs.** Certain anti-inflammatory drugs such as rituximab (Rituxan) or sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) can cause lung damage.\n\n【21】#### Medical conditions\n\n【22】Lung damage can also result from a number of conditions, including:\n\n【23】*   Dermatomyositis\n*   Polymyositis\n*   Mixed connective tissue disease\n*   Systemic lupus erythematosus\n*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Sarcoidosis\n*   Scleroderma\n*   Pneumonia\n\n【24】Many substances and conditions can lead to pulmonary fibrosis. Even so, in most cases, the cause is never found. Pulmonary fibrosis with no known cause is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【25】Researchers have several theories about what might trigger idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, including viruses and exposure to tobacco smoke. Also, some forms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis run in families, and heredity may play a role in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【26】Many people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may also have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — a condition that occurs when acid from your stomach flows back into your esophagus. Ongoing research is evaluating if GERD may be a risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or if GERD may lead to a more rapid progression of the condition. However, more research is needed to determine the association between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and GERD.\n\n【27】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【28】Factors that make you more susceptible to pulmonary fibrosis include:\n\n【29】*   **Age.** Although pulmonary fibrosis has been diagnosed in children and infants, the disorder is much more likely to affect middle-aged and older adults.\n*   **Sex.** Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is more likely to affect men than women.\n*   **Smoking.** Far more smokers and former smokers develop pulmonary fibrosis than do people who have never smoked. Pulmonary fibrosis can occur in patients with emphysema.\n*   **Certain occupations.** You have an increased risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis if you work in mining, farming or construction or if you're exposed to pollutants known to damage your lungs.\n*   **Cancer treatments.** Having radiation treatments to your chest or using certain chemotherapy drugs can increase your risk of pulmonary fibrosis.\n*   **Genetic factors.** Some types of pulmonary fibrosis run in families, and genetic factors may be a component.\n\n【30】Complications\n-------------\n\n【31】Complications of pulmonary fibrosis may include:\n\n【32】*   **High blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension).** Unlike systemic high blood pressure, this condition affects only the arteries in your lungs. It begins when the smallest arteries and capillaries are compressed by scar tissue, causing increased resistance to blood flow in your lungs.\n\n【33】    This in turn raises pressure within the pulmonary arteries and the lower right heart chamber (right ventricle). Some forms of pulmonary hypertension are serious illnesses that become progressively worse and are sometimes fatal.\n\n【34】*   **Right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale).** This serious condition occurs when your heart's lower right chamber (ventricle) has to pump harder than usual to move blood through partially blocked pulmonary arteries.\n*   **Respiratory failure.** This is often the last stage of chronic lung disease. It occurs when blood oxygen levels fall dangerously low.\n*   **Lung cancer.** Long-standing pulmonary fibrosis also increases your risk of developing lung cancer.\n*   **Lung complications.** As pulmonary fibrosis progresses, it may lead to complications such as blood clots in the lungs, a collapsed lung or lung infections.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:35:10", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:35:24", "cost": 14.774}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:39", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:35:24", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:35:09"}

Blinded chart review determined how often providers screened and subjects endorsed suicidal ideation (SI). Positive indicators included chart notes recording SI and/or Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scored more than 0 on question 9.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We found that only 29 of 66 (43.9%) SDs and 14 of 141 (9.9%) controls had been screened at any point by any means ( _P_ < .001). Only 25.8% (17 of 66) of SDs expressed SI, whereas 58.6% of screened SDs (17 of 29) did so, though none at final appointments before death. No control ever expressed SI. While the majority of both cases and controls went unscreened, providers were more likely to screen SDs ( _P_ < .001; odds ratio \\[OR\\], 9.0; 95% CI, 3.6-22.0), even with controlling for mental health diagnoses ( _P_ \\= .02; OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.2-10.6).\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】With providers screening less than half of SDs at any point in the year before death, and less than 60% of SDs ever endorsing SI, including none at final appointments, the findings of this naturalistic study bring into question both current screening practices and screening effectiveness. Nonetheless, when SDs were screened, they were significantly more likely to endorse SI than were controls, not 1 of whom ever expressed SI. Taken together, these data suggest that patients expressing SI at any point are at elevated risk for eventual suicide.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】OMC ( Olmsted Medical Center ), PHQ-9 ( Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ), REP ( Rochester Epidemiology Project ), SD ( suicide decedent ), SI ( suicidal ideation )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:39:26", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:39:49", "cost": 23.582}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:39", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:39:47", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:39:24"}

Two of the medical devices were tested with both new and old interface modules. The 6 cellular telephones chosen represent the different cellular technology protocols in use: Code Division Multiple Access (2 models), Global System for Mobile communications, Integrated Digital Enhanced Network, Time Division Multiple Access, and analog. The cellular telephones were tested when operating at or near their maximum power output. The medical devices, connected to clinical simulators during testing, were monitored by observing the device displays and alarms.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of 510 tests performed, the incidence of clinically important interference was 1.2%; EMI was induced in 108 tests (21.2%).

We would like to broaden the differential diagnosis in a scenario such as this.\n\n【1】Acute coronary syndrome during an anaphylactic reaction, especially in those who receive epinephrine, can occur for a variety of reasons, including (1) ABS or stress cardiomyopathy, (2) allergic myocardial infarction (ie, Kounis syndrome \\[KS\\]), and (3) hypersensitive myocarditis (HM).\n\n【2】Apical ballooning syndrome affects mainly women during emotional stress and is characterized by the presence of normal coronary arteries and reversible apical ventricular dysfunction. In this syndrome, it is thought that myocardial stunning occurs as a result of high levels of circulating (ie, endogenous) catecholamines. Epinephrine triggers a switch in intracellular signal trafficking in ventricular cardiomyocytes from Gs protein to Gi protein signaling via the β <sub>2 </sub> \\-adrenoceptor, which in turn protects against the proapoptotic effects of the intense activation of β <sub>1 </sub> \\-adrenoceptors. However, this change also causes a negative inotropic effect. Because β-adrenoceptor density is greatest at the apical myocardium, this effect is greatest in that region. Other mechanisms have also been implicated.\n\n【3】It is not surprising that a supratherapeutic dose of intravenous epinephrine could produce a similar phenomenon, as postulated by Manivannan et al. However, this is not the first reported case of ABS due to the administration of epinephrine, as the authors claim. Six cases of stress cardiomyopathy due to epinephrine and 3 due to dobutamine were recently described by Abraham et al.\n\n【4】Stress cardiomyopathy after intravenous administration of catecholamines and beta-receptor agonists.\n\n【5】The dose of epinephrine ranged from a minimum of 1 mg to 40 mg. Some recent reports have even linked this syndrome to anaphylactic reaction.\n\n【6】Tako-tsubo-like syndrome during anaphylactic reaction.\n\n【7】However, other possible etiologies of ABS after a bee sting must also be entertained. The coincidental occurrence of chest pain, electrocardiographic changes, and elevated troponin levels during anaphylactic reaction to bee sting has previously been described as KS by various authors.\n\n【8】Acute anterior myocardial infarction after multiple bee stings: a case of Kounis syndrome.\n\n【9】During hypersensitive reactions, sudden release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells, macrophages, and T lymphocytes has been postulated to lead to coronary vasospasm and hence to acute coronary syndrome. A myocardial biopsy will reveal a normal myocardium. However, KS may occur in association with ABS because various cytokines have been implicated in the causation of ABS. In this context, exogenous administration of epinephrine is not required for the development of ABS. A case report of KS with ABS has been published.\n\n【10】A case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy associated with Kounis syndrome.\n\n【11】Hypersensitive reactions may also involve the heart by causing HM. In patients with HM, the myocardial biopsy will reveal the presence of eosinophils, atypical lymphocytes, and giant cells. Clinically, it is difficult to differentiate HM from KS because both present with signs and symptoms of acute coronary syndrome and for both coronary angiography reveals normal coronary arteries.\n\n【12】The patient described by Manivannan et al had ventricular dysfunction typical of ABS in the presence of an anaphylactic reaction. Hence, we propose that she had KS complicated by ABS due to epinephrine and release of cytokines from the allergic reaction to the bee sting. As such, exogenous epinephrine administration need not be credited as the sole origin of ABS in this patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:32:35", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:33:21", "cost": 45.631}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:38", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:33:19", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:32:33"}

Primary outcome measures were agreement with 2 in-principle statements about substituted judgment and, after an experimental vignette that varied the basis used by a patient's surrogate to refuse life-saving treatment, responses indicating how appropriate it would be to overrule the surrogate's decision.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Our response rate was 62% (1156 of 1875 respondents). When there is a conflict between what a surrogate believes a patient would have wanted (substituted judgment) and what the surrogate believes is in the patient's best interest, 4 of 5 physicians (78%) agreed that the surrogate should base their decision on substituted judgment. Yet we also found that 2 of 5 physicians (40%) agree that surrogates should make decisions they believe are in the patient's best interest, even if those seem to contradict the patient's prior wishes. In the experimental vignette, physicians were much more likely to oppose overruling a surrogate's refusal of life-sustaining medical treatment when that refusal was made on the basis of substituted judgment compared with when the refusal was made on the basis of the patient's best interest (50% vs 20%; odds ratio, 4.2; 95% CI, 2.7-6.3). Responses to the in-principle items about substituted judgment were not consistently associated with responses to the experimental vignette.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】US physicians largely agree, in principle, that surrogates should prioritize what the patient would have wanted over what they believe is in the patient's best interest, although many physicians are ambivalent in cases in which the 2 norms conflict. Even physicians who reject the principle of substituted judgment tend to treat substituted judgment as the preferred norm for surrogate decision making when responding to a clinical vignette.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】OR ( odds ratio )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:58:24", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:58:29", "cost": 4.704}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:38", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:58:28", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:58:21"}

Random effects modeling was used to adjust for variables known or hypothesized to be associated with IM-ITE scores and allowed discrimination of effects of individual conferences on IM-ITE scores.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Total conference attendance was significantly associated with increased IM-ITE scores, with cohort mean increase of 2.30% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.24% to 3.36%; _P_ <.001). Core curriculum conferences accounted for much more of this association than either medical grand rounds or morbidity and mortality, with cohort mean increases of 2.05% (95% CI, 0.13% to 3.90%; _P_ \\=.04), 0.24% (95% CI, -0.56% to 1.03%; _P_ \\=.61), and 0.03% (95% CI, -1.69% to 1.69%; _P_ \\=.97), respectively.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Conference attendance is associated with improved knowledge acquisition as measured by improved performance on IM-ITE.

There isn't a simple target range for high blood pressure in all children because what's considered normal changes as children grow. However, in teenagers, high blood pressure is defined the same as for adults: A blood pressure reading greater than or equal to 130/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).\n\n【2】The younger a child is, the more likely it is that the high blood pressure is caused by a specific and identifiable medical condition. Older children can develop high blood pressure for the same reasons adults do — excess weight, poor nutrition and lack of exercise.\n\n【3】Lifestyle changes, such as eating a heart-healthy diet low in salt (sodium) and exercising more, can help reduce high blood pressure in children. But for some children, medications may be necessary.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】High blood pressure usually doesn't cause symptoms. However, signs and symptoms that might indicate a high blood pressure emergency (hypertensive crisis) include:\n\n【6】*   Headaches\n*   Seizures\n*   Vomiting\n*   Chest pains\n*   Fast, pounding or fluttering heartbeat (palpitations)\n*   Shortness of breath\n\n【7】If your child has any of these signs or symptoms, seek emergency medical care.\n\n【8】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【9】Your child's blood pressure should be checked during routine well-check appointments starting at age 3, and at every appointment if your child is found to have high blood pressure.\n\n【10】If your child has a condition that can increase the risk of high blood pressure — including premature birth, low birth weight, congenital heart disease and certain kidney problems — blood pressure checks might begin soon after birth.\n\n【11】If you're concerned about your child having a risk factor for high blood pressure, such as having obesity, talk to your child's doctor.\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】High blood pressure in younger children is often related to other health conditions, such as heart defects, kidney disease, genetic conditions or hormonal disorders. Older children — especially those who are overweight — are more likely to have primary hypertension. This type of high blood pressure occurs on its own, without an underlying condition.\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】Your child's risk factors for high blood pressure depend on health conditions, genetics and lifestyle factors.\n\n【16】### Primary (essential) hypertension\n\n【17】Primary hypertension occurs on its own, without an identifiable cause. This type of high blood pressure occurs more often in children age 6 and older.

To do so may cause your lung condition to become worse.\n\n【25】This medicine usually comes with patient instructions. Read them carefully before using the medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the nebulizer, ask your doctor to show you how to use it.\n\n【26】Dornase alfa should be used with the eRapid™ nebulizer system or a jet nebulizer that is connected to an air compressor. An air compressor is used with a nebulizer to turn the medicine into a fine spray. You will breathe in the spray through your mouth. To use:\n\n【27】*   Dornase alfa inhalation solution comes in small plastic containers called ampules. Each ampule contains one full dose of dornase alfa. Do not use an ampule that has already been opened. Do not use a cloudy or discolored inhalation solution.\n*   Remove the ampule from the pouch. Place the inhalation solution in the medicine reservoir or nebulizer cup on the machine.\n*   Connect the nebulizer to the face mask or mouthpiece, then connect the nebulizer to the compressor.\n*   Use the mouthpiece of the nebulizer to breathe in Pulmozyme®. Do not use a face mask with the nebulizer because less medicine will get into your lungs.\n*   Patients who are unable to breathe in or breathe out by mouth may use the PARI BABY™ nebulizer with the supplied face mask. Make sure you understand exactly how to use this medicine in the nebulizer.\n*   Use the nebulizer for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until the medicine in the nebulizer cup is gone.\n*   Follow the manufacturer's directions for care and cleaning of the nebulizer and compressor.\n*   Do not mix any other medicine in the nebulizer with dornase alfa.\n\n【28】In order to receive the full effects of this medicine, you must use it every day as ordered by your doctor. If possible, dornase alfa should be used at about the same time each day. You may notice some improvement in your condition within the first week of treatment. However, some patients may not feel the full effects of this medicine for weeks or months.\n\n【29】If you are taking any other medicines for cystic fibrosis, keep taking them as you did before you started using dornase alfa, unless otherwise directed by your doctor. However, do not put any other inhaled medicine in the nebulizer at the same time that you use dornase alfa. Other inhaled medicines may be used in a clean nebulizer before or after your treatment with dornase alfa.\n\n【30】### Dosing\n\n【31】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【32】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【33】*   For inhalation dosage form (solution):\n    *   For cystic fibrosis:\n        *   Adults and children 5 years of age and older—2.5 milligrams (mg) (one ampule) once a day in the nebulizer.\n        *   Children 3 months to 4 years of age—Dose must be determined by your doctor. The dose is usually 2.5 mg (one ampule) once a day in the nebulizer.\n        *   Children younger than 3 months of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【34】### Missed Dose\n\n【35】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【36】### Storage\n\n【37】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【38】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【39】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【40】Store the medicine in the refrigerator in the foil pouches. However, keep the medicine from freezing. Do not leave this medicine out of the refrigerator for longer than 24 hours. If an ampule of medicine is left out for longer than this, it should be thrown away and a new ampule should be used.\n\n【41】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【42】It is very important that your doctor check the progress of you or your child at regular visits.

As of June 8, 2020, there are close to 2 million COVID-19 cases in the United States with 112,000 deaths \\[coronavirus.jhu.edu\\]. As patient volumes increased, healthcare systems and state and federal governments scrambled to address critical shortages of COVID-19 test kits, personal protective equipment, pharmaceutical drugs, and medical equipment such as mechanical ventilators. Medical care was further challenged by a lack of proven therapies for those who contract the virus. Fortunately, some regions have seen a flattening in the rate of incident cases over the last several weeks. Nonetheless, the experience of recent months amplifies the importance of planning for imbalances of supply and demand. To ensure scarce resources are allocated fairly and in a manner that produces the greatest benefit for those in need, multiple guidelines and policy recommendations have been created to guide critical care specialists and others who care for patients with COVID-19\n\n【1】Interim Guidance for Basic and Advanced Life Support in Adults, Children, and Neonates With Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19.\n\n【2】Fair allocation of scarce medical resources in the time of Covid-19.\n\n【3】Healthcare providers and others who are not on the frontlines of COVID-19 response may have limited familiarity with changes in clinical practice that are necessitated by pandemic response. As healthcare providers continue to learn about the management of COVID-related disease, health systems are grappling with questions of allocating scarce medical resources. They must fairly and transparently determine which patients receive intensive care unit (ICU)-level care. Many families may not have even considered the possibility that a loved one may not receive all the interventions they desire, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), if a region has exceeded its surge capacity and is operating in crisis standards of care. Attending to these uncertainties will require not only a high level of emotional sensitivity to each patient’s needs but a solid grasp of the many ethical considerations and national advocacy positions that inform specific institutional policies and governmental positions related to the allocation of scarce healthcare resources during crisis standards of care.\n\n【4】In this paper, we examine ethical considerations related to the provision or withholding of CPR during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim is to provide a high-level overview of multiple ethical and practical considerations that need to be balanced to ensure fair and safe delivery of healthcare to patients in need, and to serve the interests of our communities. Familiarity with these guiding considerations can help healthcare providers and others to respond to patient and family questions about COVID-19 care in an ethically informed and nuanced way.\n\n【5】Risks to Healthcare Workers\n---------------------------\n\n【6】Healthcare workers are at significant risk of infection from exposure to COVID-19 infected patients, as documented in a report from the United States Centers for Disease Control indicating that more than 9200 cases of COVID-19 had been observed in medical providers between February and April 2020.\n\n【7】CDC COVID-19 Response Team  \nCharacteristics of health care personnel with COVID-19 — United States, February 12–April 9, 2020.\n\n【8】The greatest risk of transmission is during interventions/procedures generating aerosolized virions. These procedures include chest compressions and endotracheal intubation, 2 core interventions of CPR. Resuscitation, by its very nature, requires prompt, skilled, and aggressive response from healthcare workers. However, the duty to respond to a deteriorating patient must be balanced with our duty to protect our workforce. Many hospitals, including Mayo Clinic, require code responders to don personal protective equipment (PPE) sufficient to safeguard against COVID-19, regardless of whether the patient is known to be infected. This approach reduces the risk of inadvertent exposure. Likewise, pneumatic chest compression vests (such as LUCAS \\[Jolife AB, Lund, Sweden\\]) can reduce the number of responders and reduce unnecessary contact with the patient. Under conventional models of care, patients or surrogates may request CPR, even if the likelihood of benefit is small. Participating in such nonbeneficial, high-risk interventions under “normal circumstances” contributes significantly to moral anguish, but rarely poses a threat to the responders’ health. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic substantial threats to the physical and mental wellbeing of our workforce must weigh into resuscitation decisions.\n\n【9】Risks to Patients\n-----------------\n\n【10】Enhancing PPE practices and relying more heavily on automated chest compression devices are necessary steps to protect our healthcare workforce. However, they delay initiation of lifesaving interventions, and it is possible that these policies may translate to worse outcomes for in-hospital cardiac arrest. Patients who achieve return of spontaneous circulation often require ongoing life support such as mechanical ventilation and vasoactive medications; this may be infeasible in systems already operating in surge or crisis mode of scarcity. These concerns have prompted policy discussions about resuscitation practices, including whether default “full code” status for patients remains appropriate in crisis standards of care or whether institutions might forestall attempts at resuscitation on a case-by-case basis, when outcomes are expected to be poor.\n\n【11】Out of Hospital Resuscitation\n-----------------------------\n\n【12】Outside the hospital, emergency responders must balance 2 aims: protection of the workforce and the continued provision of life-preserving interventions. The former is highlighted by the experience in New York City of out of hospial exposure and contraction of the virus. According to one report, during the week of March 23  , New York City Regional Emergency Services received 6000 calls in a single day, at a time when close to 20% of their workforce (including various members of the ambulance team) were out sick with several testing positive for COVID-19 (Marshall L, personal communication).\n\n【13】Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China.\n\n【14】Resource allocation is also a consideration in out of hospital triage decisions. Modifying the response team structures to minimize the number of staff interacting with the patient is important and will decrease exposures in the frontline. Equipping emergency responders with COVID-19 test kits can help shorten the time to diagnosis and early institution of isolation measures. Residents of nursing homes and other congregate care settings are at increased risk of COVID-19 exposure, infection, and mortality, and its complications and are most likely to require emergency measures such as resuscitation. Given the current crises the management and staff of these facilities should define the goals of care with the residents and/or their healthcare surrogates maintaining a clear focus on the decisions for resuscitation status. Palliative care services (perhaps via telehealth) may serve to facilitate such conversations, particularly to insure a non-coercive and transparent decision-making process.\n\n【15】In-Hospital Resuscitation\n-------------------------\n\n【16】Although the capacity to monitor patients and deploy PPE in resuscitation is greater in hospital settings, in-hospital resuscitation presents other ethical challenges. Initial reports from China indicated that 5% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 required ICU level care. Half of these ICU patients needed mechanical ventilator support -- and many of required such support for prolonged duration.\n\n【17】Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China.\n\n【18】In the United States, the COVID-19 crisis in places like New York City has illustrated the inadequacy of hospital beds, ICU beds, staff, and medical equipment to meet surge demands. The tenets of biomedical ethics and state law remain pillars to guide medical decision-making and resource allocation, especially to provide structure in a chaotic pandemic. The critical situation has prompted active discussion at multiple levels and forums with measures such as blanket do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders discussed in the media.\n\n【19】Systematic approaches include disaster-management strategies that commonly employ triage guidelines to assess a patient’s probability of survival. In addition, severity of illness scoring systems can lend objectivity and consistency to the decisions regarding life-sustaining intervention such as access to intensive care or provision of CPR. The latter is most influenced by underlying conditions and multi-organ system dysfunction from the acute event. A score can be used to categorize patients into a prioritization status to guide resource allocation, one such category would include patients unlikely to benefit from critical care and/or acute resuscitation.\n\n【20】Development of a triage protocol for critical care during an influenza pandemic.\n\n【21】Clinicians must be mindful that a depersonalized scoring system and perhaps less time to establish a supportive environment may have a negative impact on patient and family interactions.\n\n【22】Formulation and application of triage and resuscitative categories guided by severity of illness scoring is the recommended basis of resource allocation, particularly of ventilators.\n\n【23】The toughest triage - allocating ventilators in a pandemic.\n\n【24】In conditions of extreme scarcity, we recommend individuals who have already been triaged to not receive ICU resources not be resuscitated with CPR (in other words, a do not attempt resuscitation code status). As soon as resources become less strained, such orders should be revisited. Hospitals should anticipate the need to provide support to the designated triage officer from the incident command center or even a central triage subgroup that includes experienced clinicians, medical ethicists, and legal expertise. Setting realistic expectations through prompt and clear communication to patients and families is a cornerstone of such an approach.\n\n【25】In summary, healthcare systems and frontline providers face extreme pressures during pandemics. The uncertainties around COVID-19 infection rate, morbidity, mortality, as well as lack of proven therapies, exacerbate the circumstances. Implementation of guidelines for crisis standards of care during a pandemic should be guided by the principles of justice and equity. Triage teams deployed by hospital incident command centers should be guided by medical ethics, incorporate critical care expertise, and support individual providers faced with decisions of both triage and resuscitative status of patients. Health systems must take measures to mitigate resource strain, such as canceling elective procedures, adjusting staff to patient ratios, engaging in proactive advance care planning and goals of care conversations.\n\n【26】As hospitals across the United States prepare and plan for a potential surge of critically ill COVID-19 patients coincide with start of influenza season in the fall, we believe that the aim of these preparations should be to save most lives possible while preserving a commitment to the core ethical values that shape the practice of medicine, including providing the highest quality of care possible, to be good stewards of public resources, and to distribute scare medical resources in a manner that is fair and transparent. Those guiding commitments may need to adapt in light of changing circumstances but should never be jettisoned, even during a pandemic. Candidly discussing the many challenges of balancing those ethical commitments during the COVID-19 pandemic can not only help to reassure patients that their interests remain at the very center of our efforts, but can help to preserve the trust that the communities we serve have placed in us.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:35:45", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:36:06", "cost": 21.025}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:38", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:36:06", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:35:45"}

This usually happens during childhood. A common cause of stomach ulcers (peptic ulcers), H. pylori infection may be present in more than half the people in the world.\n\n【2】Most people don't realize they have H. pylori infection because they never get sick from it. If you develop signs and symptoms of a peptic ulcer, your health care provider will probably test you for H. pylori infection. A peptic ulcer is a sore on the lining of the stomach (gastric ulcer) or the first part of the small intestine (duodenal ulcer).\n\n【3】H. pylori infection is treated with antibiotics.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Most people with H. pylori infection will never have any signs or symptoms. It's not clear why many people don't have symptoms. But some people may be born with more resistance to the harmful effects of H. pylori.\n\n【6】When signs or symptoms do occur with H. pylori infection, they are typically related to gastritis or a peptic ulcer and may include:\n\n【7】*   An ache or burning pain in your stomach (abdomen)\n*   Stomach pain that may be worse when your stomach is empty\n*   Nausea\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Frequent burping\n*   Bloating\n*   Unintentional weight loss\n\n【8】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【9】Make an appointment with your health care provider if you notice any signs and symptoms that may be gastritis or a peptic ulcer. Seek immediate medical help if you have:\n\n【10】*   Severe or ongoing stomach (abdominal) pain that may awaken you from sleep\n*   Bloody or black tarry stools\n*   Bloody or black vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】H. pylori infection occurs when H. pylori bacteria infect your stomach. H. pylori bacteria are usually passed from person to person through direct contact with saliva, vomit or stool. H. pylori may also be spread through contaminated food or water. The exact way H. pylori bacteria causes gastritis or a peptic ulcer in some people is still unknown.\n\n【13】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【14】People often get H. pylori infection during childhood. Risk factors for H. pylori infection are related to living conditions in childhood, such as:\n\n【15】*   **Living in crowded conditions.** Living in a home with many other people can increase your risk of H. pylori infection.\n*   **Living without a reliable supply of clean water.** Having a reliable supply of clean, running water helps reduce the risk of H. pylori.\n*   **Living in a developing country.** People living in developing countries have a higher risk of H. pylori infection. This may be because crowded and unsanitary living conditions may be more common in developing countries.\n*   **Living with someone who has an H. pylori infection.** You're more likely to have H. pylori infection if you live with someone who has H. pylori infection.\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】Complications associated with H. pylori infection include:\n\n【18】*   **Ulcers.** H. pylori can damage the protective lining of the stomach and small intestine. This can allow stomach acid to create an open sore (ulcer). About 10% of people with H. pylori will develop an ulcer.\n*   **Inflammation of the stomach lining.** H. pylori infection can affect the stomach, causing irritation and swelling (gastritis).\n*   **Stomach cancer.** H. pylori infection is a strong risk factor for certain types of stomach cancer.\n\n【19】Prevention\n----------\n\n【20】In areas of the world where H. pylori infection and its complications are common, health care providers sometimes test healthy people for H. pylori. Whether there is a benefit to testing for H. pylori infection when you have no signs or symptoms of infection is controversial among experts.\n\n【21】If you're concerned about H. pylori infection or you think you may have a high risk of stomach cancer, talk to your health care provider.

Dr Hayes contends that the recent changes to the ABIM’s certification status reporting format “provide patients with inadequate information about the recertification status of their physicians”; however, these changes are intended to do the opposite. By paring down the amount of information publicly reported about ABIM diplomates, we believe the certification status reporting on our website is now clearer and more understandable to the public and other stakeholders. Although we applaud physicians who have voluntarily recertified in the past, our new reporting focuses on recency—whether physicians are _currently_ and _continuously_ engaged in activities to stay up-to-date.\n\n【1】The new reporting format is also designed to enhance clarity regarding the certification status of physicians with multiple certifications. The ABIM encourages diplomates to maintain only the certifications that are relevant to their practice. However, before the recent reporting changes, the way certification status was reported could appear misleading to patients. For example, if a cardiologist decided to maintain only his cardiovascular disease certification because his internal medicine certification was not relevant to his current practice, he would be listed under the old reporting format on the ABIM’s website as “Not Certified” in internal medicine. With the new reporting format, this diplomate would be listed as “Certified” in cardiovascular disease, and internal medicine would be listed only with the date of initial certification, without designating lapsed certifications as “Not Certified.” The only physicians who are reported as “Not Certified” under the new reporting format are those who no longer have any valid certifications. Diplomates can access their complete certification history by logging in to their account on the ABIM website.\n\n【2】Dr Hayes asks why the ABIM did not address the “grandfather” issue sooner. Incidentally, the ABIM Board of Directors decided to discontinue issuing “lifetime” certifications in 1968, but they concluded at the time that the ABIM did not yet have the capacity to develop a comprehensive recertification program. When the ABIM rolled out recertification and began issuing time-limited certifications in the late 1980s, they made the decision to honor certifications that had been issued without expiration dates, thus creating the grandfathers. The ABIM has sought ways to engage grandfathers in the MOC process for many years. The new MOC requirements do not take away the certification of physicians with lifetime certifications, but the ABIM now reports whether all physicians, including grandfathers, are “Meeting MOC Requirements” on a continuous basis. Since the new program launched on January 1, 2014, more than 8000 grandfathers have chosen to enroll in MOC.\n\n【3】The ABIM believes it is critical that its leadership be held to the same or higher standard for MOC participation as its diplomates. All physicians in service to the ABIM—including staff, directors, councilors, and members of ABIM committees—are required to adhere to the ABIM’s MOC Policy for Physicians Serving ABIM.\n\n【4】This policy includes the requirement that internists/subspecialists who have valid-indefinitely certification (grandfathers) must take and pass an MOC secure examination within the first 3 years of service (or within 3 years of the date this updated policy was enacted in 2013) if they have not passed an ABIM secure examination within 10 years before starting ABIM service. The policy also requires that all internists/subspecialists serving the ABIM, including grandfathers, must continuously meet MOC requirements throughout their ABIM service.\n\n【5】The principles behind MOC are, in fact, based on evidence. Studies have shown that a physician’s overconfidence\n\n【6】Physicians’ diagnostic accuracy, confidence, and resource requests: a vignette study.\n\n【7】inhibits his or her diagnostic accuracy. A physician’s ability to independently and accurately self-assess is poor,\n\n【8】Accuracy of physician self-assessment compared with observed measures of competence: a systematic review.\n\n【9】“I'll never play professional football” and other fallacies of self-assessment.\n\n【10】and more clinical experience does not necessarily lead to better outcomes of care.\n\n【11】Systematic review: the relationship between clinical experience and quality of health care.\n\n【12】Studies have also found that fewer than 30% of physicians examine their own performance data and try to improve.\n\n【13】Measure, learn, and improve: physicians' involvement in quality improvement.\n\n【14】The MOC program structure tries to address these concerns with a sound theoretical rationale via the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education’s 6 competencies framework. There is also a respectable body of scientific evidence regarding MOC’s relationship to patient outcomes, physician performance, and validity of the assessment or educational methods utilized in the program and its learning or improvement potential.\n\n【15】American Board of Medical Specialties maintenance of certification: theory and evidence regarding the current framework.\n\n【16】Specialty board certification in the United States: issues and evidence.\n\n【17】The ABIM is a physician-led, nonprofit, independent evaluation organization with the mission of enhancing the quality of health care by certifying internists and subspecialists who have the knowledge, skills, and attitudes essential for excellent patient care. Ensuring that our MOC program contributes to improved health care delivery is as important to us as it is to our diplomates. We recognize that there is currently a limited evidence base regarding the impact of MOC on patient outcomes. Thus, over the next several years, we will continue to evaluate our MOC program and its recent changes. The results of this evaluation will help us to further enhance the value of MOC to both physicians and the patients they serve.\n\n【18】Although this reply may not address all of Dr Hayes’ concerns, we have a continuing and robust research program regarding MOC and welcome outside, well-designed research as well. Through a new initiative called Assessment 2020, the ABIM is also actively reaching out to physicians and the broader community to help define what competencies physicians will need as the field of medicine continues to evolve. For more information and to participate in this conversation, we encourage readers to visit the Assessment 2020 website.\n\n【19】We appreciate Dr Hayes’ feedback, which is precisely the kind of engagement and input that helps our process continue to get better.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:40:09", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:41:01", "cost": 51.405}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:38", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:40:59", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:40:07"}

Undisclosed financial COI may influence the perception of the authors' scientific impartiality and erode the public trust in the reported results. Data regarding completeness of COI disclosure in high-impact–factor general medicine journals are limited. We compared payments disclosed by US-based physicians who were first or last authors of clinical drug trials published between August 2016 and August 2018 in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ , _JAMA,_ and _Lancet_ , to payments reported by industry to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Open Payments Database. Of 247 included authors, 198 (80%) have not disclosed some or all received payments. The median undisclosed sum was $8409 (US Dollars) (interquartile range \\[IQR\\] $123 to $44,890). Most authors (n=170, 69%) have received more than $10,000 per year (median $120,403, IQR $58,905 to $242,014). The median undisclosed sum for these authors was $26,530 (IQR $7462 to $71,562). Median undisclosed sums for authors of papers from studies performed with and without industry funding were $20,899 (IQR $4191 to $59,883) and $149 (IQR $0 to $3276), respectively. In 10 (8%) of 125 industry-funded trials, the first or last author had not disclosed personal payments from the study sponsor (median $9741, IQR $4508 to $101,484). These findings could raise concerns about the authors' equipoise toward the trial results and influence the public perception of the credibility of reported data. Health care professionals, reviewers, and journal editors should demand more transparent reporting of financial COI.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CMS ( Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ), COI ( conflict of interest ), ICMJE ( International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ), IQR ( interquartile range )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:04:25", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:04:31", "cost": 6.593}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:38", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:04:31", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:04:24"}

SandIMMUNE\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Cyclosporine injection is given together with a steroid medicine to prevent the body from rejecting a transplanted organ (e.g. kidney, liver, or heart). It belongs to a group of medicines known as immunosuppressive agents.\n\n【4】When a patient receives an organ transplant, the body's white blood cells will try to get rid of (reject) the transplanted organ. Cyclosporine works by suppressing the immune system to prevent the white blood cells from trying to get rid of the transplanted organ.\n\n【5】Cyclosporine is a very strong medicine. It can cause side effects that can be very serious, such as high blood pressure, kidney problems, or liver problems. It may also decrease the body's ability to fight infections. You and your doctor should talk about the benefits this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.\n\n【6】This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Solution\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【11】### Allergies\n\n【12】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【13】### Pediatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of cyclosporine injection have not been performed in the pediatric population. However, no pediatric-specific problems have been documented to date.\n\n【15】### Geriatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of cyclosporine injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have high blood pressure or age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving cyclosporine injection.\n\n【17】### Breastfeeding\n\n【18】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【21】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【30】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【31】*   Allergy to polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor® EL)—Should not be used in patients with this condition.\n\n【32】*   Anemia or\n*   Bleeding problems or\n*   Brain disease (e.g. encephalopathy) or\n*   Cancer or\n*   Eye or visual problems (e.g. papilloedema) or\n*   Hyperkalemia (high potassium in the blood) or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) or\n*   Hyperuricemia (too much uric acid in the blood) or\n*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease or\n*   Precancerous skin changes or\n*   Seizures, history of or\n*   Thrombocytopenia (low number of platelets)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【33】*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) or\n*   Hypocholesterolemia (low cholesterol in the blood) or\n*   Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium in the blood)—May increase risk for encephalopathy.\n\n【34】*   Infection—May decrease body's ability to fight infection.\n\n【35】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【36】A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins.\n\n【37】This medicine is usually given 4 to 12 hours before organ transplantation. Then your doctor will switch you to the oral (by mouth) form of Sandimmune®.\n\n【38】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【39】It is very important that your doctor check you closely while you are receiving this medicine. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【40】This medicine may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. The most serious signs of this reaction are very fast or irregular breathing, gasping for breath, wheezing, or fainting. Other signs may include changes in color of the skin of the face, very fast but irregular heartbeat or pulse, hive-like swellings on the skin, flushing of the face, and puffiness or swellings of the eyelids or around the eyes. If these side effects occur, get emergency help at once.\n\n【41】Check with your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms: blood in the urine, change in the frequency of urination or amount of urine, difficulty breathing, drowsiness, increased thirst, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, or swelling of the feet or lower legs, or weakness. These may be symptoms of a serious kidney problem.\n\n【42】Hyperkalemia (high potassium in the blood) may occur while you are receiving this medicine. Tell your doctor right away if you have the following symptoms: abdominal or stomach pain, confusion, difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, nausea or vomiting, nervousness, numbness or tingling in the hands, feet, or lips, shortness of breath, or weakness or heaviness of the legs. Do not use supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without first checking with your doctor.\n\n【43】Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.\n\n【44】This medicine may increase your risk of getting skin cancer or cancer of the lymph system (lymphoma). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.\n\n【45】This medicine may increase your risk of developing infections. Avoid being near people who are sick while you are receiving this medicine. Wash your hands often. Tell your doctor if you have any kind of infection before you start using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you have ever had an infection that would not go away or an infection that kept coming back.\n\n【46】This medicine may increase your risk of developing rare and serious virus infections, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN). The BK virus may affect how your kidneys work and cause a transplanted kidney to fail. Check with your doctor right away if you are having more than one of these symptoms: bloody urine, a decreased frequency or amount of urine, increased thirst, loss of appetite, lower back or side pain, nausea, swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs, trouble breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting, or weight gain.\n\n【47】While you are being treated with cyclosporine, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Cyclosporine lowers your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. However, it may be especially important to receive certain immunizations to prevent a disease. In addition, other persons living in your house should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have recently taken oral polio vaccine. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.\n\n【48】In some patients (usually younger patients), tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of the gums may appear soon after treatment with cyclosporine is started. Brushing and flossing your teeth, carefully and regularly, and massaging your gums may help prevent this. See your dentist regularly to have your teeth cleaned. Check with your medical doctor or dentist if you have any questions about how to take care of your teeth and gums, or if you notice any tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of your gums.\n\n【49】Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may increase the effects of cyclosporine by increasing the amount of this medicine in the body. You should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are receiving this medicine.\n\n【50】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal (e.g. St. John's wort) or vitamin supplements.\n\n【51】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【52】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【53】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【54】#### More common\n\n【55】1.  Abdominal or stomach pain or tenderness\n2.  black, tarry stools\n3.  blurred vision\n4.  chest pain\n5.  chills\n6.  clay colored stools\n7.  cloudy urine\n8.  cough\n9.  dark urine\n10.  decrease in urine output or decrease in urine-concentrating ability\n11.  decreased appetite\n12.  dizziness\n13.  fever\n14.  headache\n15.  itching\n16.  loss of appetite\n17.  nausea and vomiting\n18.  nervousness\n19.  painful or difficult urination\n20.  pounding in the ears\n21.  shakiness in the legs, arms, hands, or feet\n22.  shortness of breath\n23.  skin rash\n24.  slow or fast heartbeat\n25.  sore throat\n26.  sores, ulcers, or white spots on the lips or in the mouth\n27.  swelling of the feet or lower legs\n28.  swollen glands\n29.  trembling or shaking of the hands or feet\n30.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n31.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n32.  yellow eyes or skin\n\n【56】#### Less common\n\n【57】1.

The median follow-up was 63 months. The primary end points of the study were operative outcomes, complication reduction, function conservation, and cosmetics. The secondary end points were disease-free and overall survival.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The mean operative blood loss in the MALND group was less than in the CALND group ( _P_ <.001). The patients who underwent MALND had less axillary pain, numbness or paresthesias, and arm swelling ( _P_ <.001). The aesthetic appearance of the axilla in the MALND group was much better than that in the CALND group ( _P_ \\=.001 at 6 months and _P_ \\=.002 at 24 months). A significant difference was found between the 2 groups in distant metastasis ( _P_ \\=.04). The disease-free survival rate was 64.5% in the MALND group and 60.8% in the CALND group ( _P_ \\=.88).

Kent et al describe an electronic health record (EHR)-compatible model that assesses the individual risk for diabetes and how such an assessment may aid in deciding where preventive interventions may be especially warranted. As discussed by Kent et al, their study was predicated on the following considerations. First, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Study clearly established the efficacy of either lifestyle modification or metformin in reducing the risk of occurrence of type 2 diabetes (Knowler WC et al, Reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle interventions or metformin. _NEJM._ 2002;346(6):393-403). However, the risk of occurrence of type 2 diabetes varies markedly in prediabetic subjects. Uncertainty thus surrounds which patients would benefit from preventive interventions, the latter less likely to be valuable in low-risk patients. Second, there are relevant issues as regards preventive interventions: intensive lifestyle modifications require health care resources and patient compliance, while the use of metformin may be attended by significant side effects. Third, extrapolation of findings from randomized clinical trials to patients in the “real world” may be challenged by heterogeneity in this patient population and in their response to treatment. Kent et al used the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (OLDW) observational database to develop and validate a risk prediction model based on 11 variables (age, sex, race, smoking, BMI, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and HgbA1c); the predicted 3-year rates for diabetes faithfully correlated with observed rates. The OLDW model was then applied to the DPP data, with the following notable results: The effect of lifestyle modification was comparable across all risk groups on the relative scale, whereas the treatment effect of metformin increased as risk increased; the 3-year predicted risk of developing diabetes was 9.0%, 6.0%, and 3.9% for usual care, metformin therapy, and lifestyle modification, respectively; and either lifestyle modification or metformin prevented more than 50% or 70%, respectively, of preventable diabetic cases in the highest risk quartile of patients. This analysis and modeling by Kent et al are important and timely, especially as they culminated in a valuable EHR-compatible tool. This SMART app automatically predicts individual risk for type 2 diabetes; it identifies those high-risk patients for whom preventive intervention would likely interrupt the development of type 2 diabetes; and it promotes shared decision making with prediabetic patients regarding the prudent course of their management.\n\n【4】Vigorous Physical Activity and the Risk of Primary Cardiac Arrest\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The health benefits of physical activity are indisputable and diverse, ranging widely from reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality to salutary effects on irritable bowel disease and depression. However, still to be fully resolved are such issues as the level of physical activity that exerts the optimal beneficial effects, the nature of the relationship between health benefits and a graded increase in physical activity, and the clearly troubling one whether too much physical activity may prove damaging, indeed, fatal. As regards the latter, vigorous physical activity has been linked, albeit relatively rarely, to sudden cardiac arrest. The study by Jin et al addresses such issues using primary cardiac arrest (PCA) as the primary outcome. These authors utilized the Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort database; this database includes a National Health Screening dataset that compiled data on questionnaire-derived physical activity.

The data obtained from more than a half million participants in this screening program from 2009 to 2014 demonstrate the following key findings: 1) Compared with inactivity, physical activity was associated with less PCA, with beneficial effects discerned at levels of physical activity below the recommended minimum of 7.5 MET-hour/week and at all seven levels of activity, including physical activity greater than 37.5 MET-hour/week; 2) These associations generally held true, irrespective of age, sex, BMI, and relevant comorbidities; 3) Maximal benefit was observed with physical activity in the range of 15.0 to <22.5 MET-hour/week; 4) PCA was not increased when physical activity was ≥ 37.5 MET-hour/week, irrespective of lifestyle risk factors or cardiovascular disease and 5) Increased physical activity associated with diminished all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

The failure of systemic analgesic drugs, such as opioids, is often due to their off-target toxicity, development of tolerance, and abuse potential. Interventional pain procedures provide target specificity but lack pharmacologically selective agents with long-term efficacy. Gene therapy vectors are a new tool for the development of molecularly selective pain therapies, which have already been proved to provide durable analgesia in preclinical models. Taken together, advances in image-guided delivery and gene therapy may lead to a new class of dual selective analgesic treatments integrating the molecular selectivity of analgesic genes with the anatomic selectivity of interventional delivery techniques.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AAV ( adeno-associated virus ), Cav ( voltage-gated calcium channel ), CCD ( conventional drug discovery ), CNS ( central nervous system ), CRISPR/Cas9 ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 ), DRG ( dorsal root ganglion ), DREADD ( designer receptors activated by designer drugs ), ED ( epidural ), GABA ( γ-aminobutyric acid ), HSV ( herpes simplex virus ), IL-10 ( interleukin 10 ), IT ( intrathecal ), Kv ( voltage-gated potassium channel ), Nav ( voltage-gated sodium channel ), NK1 ( neurokinin type 1 ), NMDA ( N-methyl-d-aspartate ), shRNA ( small hairpin RNA ), TRP ( transient receptor potential channel ), TRPV1 ( transient receptor potential channel, subfamily V, member 1 )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .™\n\n【9】Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【10】**MOC Credit Statement:** Successful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1 MOC points in the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program.

Specifically, the 2 most prevalent causes of chronic pain in the population were low back pain and knee pain, as documented by a survey performed by the National Center for Health Statistics, whereby 28.1% of adult Americans reported low back pain and 19.5% localized knee pain during the past 3 months.\n\n【23】Institute of Medicine  \nRelieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research.\n\n【24】The National Academies Press , Washington, DC 2011\n\n【25】Locoregional pain is also responsible for a substantial portion of the financial burden of chronic pain. Low back pain is estimated to cost $30 billion in direct health care expenditures and $100 to $200 billion in decreased wages and disability in the United States annually.\n\n【26】Soni A.

Fifteen percent of patients with cancer pain experience anatomically localized pain, such as pain originating from bone metastases or neuropathic pain from nerve compression or invasion.\n\n【31】Cancer pain management.\n\n【32】Pain in these patients often cannot be adequately controlled by systemic analgesic treatments because the high doses needed for analgesia trigger intolerable adverse effects.\n\n【33】Understanding the experience of pain in terminally ill patients.\n\n【34】Although the best short-term outcomes in these patients are, therefore, frequently achieved by regional administration of local anesthetics or by selective neurolysis, neither approach is durable.\n\n【35】Cancer pain management.\n\n【36】The Search for Systemic Analgesic Therapies\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【37】### The Conventional Drug Discovery Paradigm\n\n【38】Current analgesic therapies fail in a substantial number of patients with chronic pain.\n\n【39】Cancer pain management.\n\n【40】This failure is most striking in cancer pain, where pain remains inadequately controlled in 50% of all patients.\n\n【41】Prevalence of undertreatment in cancer pain: a review of published literature.\n\n【42】Despite the search for novel analgesic treatments during the past few decades, currently available analgesic drugs exert their effect through very few categories of molecular targets.\n\n【43】A capsule history of pain management.\n\n【44】CT-guided injection of a TRPV1 agonist around dorsal root ganglia decreases pain transmission in swine.\n\n【45】Recent advances in neurobiology of nociception, however, identified a variety of candidate therapeutic targets located in the peripheral nervous system that are not used by current analgesic drugs. Important examples include ion channels expressed by primary sensory neurons, cytokines that play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, and several inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters that modulate nociceptive signaling.\n\n【46】Characterization of these nociceptive mechanisms led to a search for a new generation of analgesic drugs using the techniques of conventional drug discovery (CDD); CDD, ie, the search for new small-molecule therapeutic entities, largely relies on empirical screening of candidate compounds. Two approaches are used by the pharmaceutical industry and academic laboratories involved in CDD. First, phenotype-directed screening seeks to identify chemical entities that have a desirable effect on the phenotype of a disease model without previous knowledge of their molecular mechanism of action.\n\n【47】Phenotypic screening in cancer drug discovery: past, present and future.\n\n【48】Various assays modeling the disease phenotype on the level of a cell or an organism have been described.\n\n【49】Modern phenotypic drug discovery is a viable, neoclassic pharma strategy.\n\n【50】Efficacious compounds are then examined for molecular mechanism of action using reverse biology techniques. Second, target-directed screening relies on biochemical knowledge of specific molecular targets and uses small-molecule screening strategies, typically by examining large libraries of compounds.\n\n【51】Discovery of small molecule cancer drugs: successes, challenges and opportunities.\n\n【52】The actual biologic effect of thus discovered compounds is then tested in vivo in disease models. Although there has been a substantial effort to facilitate CDD by using high-throughput assays and by implementing genomic data, the discovery of new small-molecule drugs is declining in all medical fields. In fact, pharmaceutical industry data show that the number of truly innovative drugs (defined as new molecular entities) approved by the major regulatory bodies (such as the US Food and Drug Administration) has been decreasing by 50% every 5 years worldwide.\n\n【53】How to improve R&D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge.\n\n【54】PAREXEL Biopharmaceutical Statistical Sourcebook 2014/2015.\n\n【55】Parexel Intl Corp , Waltham, MA 2014\n\n【56】How were new medicines discovered?\n\n【57】Although multiple candidate analgesic agents that had been identified through CDD were tested in preclinical models, the success regarding clinical translation has been very limited, as reviewed next.\n\n【58】### Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels\n\n【59】Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na <sub>v </sub> ) are responsible for the formation of action potentials in all excitatory cells. Several Na <sub>v </sub> subtypes are expressed by primary sensory neurons but not by other excitatory cells, such as neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) or myocytes.\n\n【60】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【61】Specifically, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8, and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.9 have been found to be involved in nociception. All of these channels undergo upregulation in rodent models of nerve injury or inflammatory and neuropathic pain.\n\n【62】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【63】In addition, mutations in genes encoding these channels are associated with inherited pain disorders in humans. Gain-of-function mutations of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7 result in inherited erythromelalgia, an autosomal dominant disorder manifesting by extreme heat hyperalgesia.\n\n【64】Erythermalgia: molecular basis for an inherited pain syndrome.\n\n【65】Although clinical manifestations of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8 are less clearly defined, they have also been associated with the development of painful neuropathies and insensitivity to pain, respectively, in humans.\n\n【66】Pain as a channelopathy.\n\n【67】A variety of molecular entities have been tested in the preclinical setting that selectively inactivate Na <sub>v </sub> , including toxins isolated from tarantula venom or small-molecule compounds identified via target-directed screening.\n\n【68】Inhibitors of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7: patent applications since 2010.\n\n【69】Engineering potent and selective analogues of GpTx-1, a tarantula venom peptide antagonist of the Na(V)1.7 sodium channel.\n\n【70】Identification and characterization of proTx-III \\[μ-TRTX-Tp1a\\], a new voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor from venom of the tarantula thrixopelma pruriens.\n\n【71】Three peptide modulators of the human voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7, an important analgesic target, from the venom of an Australian tarantula.\n\n【72】Yet, despite an ongoing effort, none of these agents have been approved as a drug for use in humans.\n\n【73】### Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels\n\n【74】Similar to Na <sub>v </sub> , voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca <sub>v </sub> ) expressed in primary sensory neurons result in an increased firing frequency.\n\n【75】Voltage-gated calcium channels as targets for the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【76】At the level of the spinal cord, the upregulation of Ca <sub>v </sub> secondary to nerve injury has been described in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【77】The physiology, pathology, and pharmacology of voltage-gated calcium channels and their future therapeutic potential.\n\n【78】Specifically, Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 seems to play a critical role in neuropathic pain. Inactivation of this channel by channel-binding peptide 3 inhibits trafficking of Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 to the cytoplasmic membrane and, thereby, diminishes membrane excitability of nociceptive neurons, resulting in attenuation of nocifensive behavior in rodent models.\n\n【79】Suppression of inflammatory and neuropathic pain by uncoupling CRMP-2 from the presynaptic Ca  channel complex.\n\n【80】Gabapentinoids are the only class of systemic analgesic drugs that may exert their therapeutic effect through interacting with Ca <sub>v </sub> . Gabapentinoids were initially conceived as orally available analogues of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, for the treatment of seizure disorders.\n\n【81】Calcium channel a2–d ligands: gabapentin and pregabalin.\n\n【82】Although the antiepileptic efficacy of gabapentinoids did not hold up to the initial promise, they have been found to be efficacious for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【83】Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults.\n\n【84】Neuropathic pain: principles of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【85】Although the mechanism of action of gabapentinoids has not been fully elucidated, they have been found to bind to the α2δ-1 subunit of the Ca <sub>v </sub> , and it is, therefore, thought that they may, at least in part, exert analgesia through inhibition of Ca <sub>v </sub> .\n\n【86】Implications and mechanism of action of gabapentin in neuropathic pain.\n\n【87】A search for selective and potent Ca <sub>v </sub> antagonists identified ω-conotoxin MVIIA, a neurotoxic peptide isolated in the 1980s from the venom of marine snails belonging to the genus _Conus_ .\n\n【88】Neuronal calcium channel antagonists: discrimination between calcium channel subtypes using omega-conotoxin from _Conus magus_ venom.\n\n【89】Peptide neurotoxins from fish-hunting cone snails.\n\n【90】ω-Conotoxin MVIIA selectively blocks N-type Ca <sub>v </sub> present in nociceptive fibers. Despite efforts over 2 decades, a search for a drug with the mechanism of action analogous to ω-conotoxin MVIIA that would be efficacious and nontoxic after systemic administration has failed.

Several TRP are expressed by the primary sensory neurons and are typically activated by noxious stimuli.\n\n【111】TRP channels and pain.\n\n【112】TRP, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) is a particularly attractive target for drug development because it is almost exclusively expressed by primary nociceptive neurons and its inactivation results in loss of pain and heat sensation while other sensory modalities remain intact.\n\n【113】The cloned capsaicin receptor integrates multiple pain-producing stimuli.\n\n【114】The capsaicin receptor: a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway.\n\n【115】Capsaicin, the pungent substance in chili peppers, is the only analgesic agent acting through TRPV1 clinically available to date and is used in the form of a patch to treat locoregional pain.\n\n【116】Topical capsaicin formulations in the management of neuropathic pain.\n\n【117】Capsaicin is a reversible TRPV1 agonist and is thought to induce analgesia by desensitizing TRPV1+ nerve fibers.\n\n【118】Capsaicin-based therapies for pain control.\n\n【119】A more intuitive approach to using the TRPV1 pathway is the use of TRPV1 receptor antagonists. Although a variety of TRPV1 antagonists have been tested in preclinical models, none have been successfully translated to the clinical setting owing to their off-target adverse effects, which included hyperthermia and impaired noxious heat sensation, after systemic delivery.\n\n【120】Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 antagonists: a patent review (2011-2014).\n\n【121】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【122】Glial cells have been reported to initiate and maintain neurogenic inflammation in the setting of chronic neuropathic pain, resulting in increased neuronal excitability.\n\n【123】Importance of glial activation in neuropathic pain.\n\n【124】The effect of glia on the primary sensory neurons may be mediated by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1β, and various chemokines.\n\n【125】Spinal interleukin-10 therapy to treat peripheral neuropathic pain.\n\n【126】The proinflammatory and pronociceptive effect of these cytokines is countered by anti-inflammatory cytokines. The principal anti-inflammatory cytokine is interleukin 10 (IL-10). Therefore, IL-10 is an attractive agent to treat neuropathic pain, which is known to be relatively refractory to opioid analgesics.\n\n【127】The IT administration of recombinant IL-10 has, indeed, been found to reduce neuroinflammation and allodynia in animal models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【128】Snake venom phospholipase A2s (Asp49 and Lys49) induce mechanical allodynia upon peri-sciatic administration: involvement of spinal cord glia, proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide.\n\n【129】Cytokine involvement in dynorphin-induced allodynia.\n\n【130】However, direct delivery of the recombinant IL-10 was found not to be feasible for clinical translation because of its high cost, its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and its half-life of only 2 hours in the cerebrospinal fluid after IT delivery.\n\n【131】Interleukin-10 as a CNS therapeutic: the obstacle of the blood-brain/blood-spinal cord barrier.\n\n【132】Controlling pathological pain by adenovirally driven spinal production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【133】### Pain-Modulating Neurotransmitters\n\n【134】Development and maintenance of chronic pain states is associated with alteration of the neurotransmitter milieu in the CNS.\n\n【135】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【136】The neuroinhibitory transmitter GABA is known to inhibit neuropathic pain signaling on the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【137】Partial peripheral nerve injury promotes a selective loss of GABAergic inhibition in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【138】Although 2 classes of GABAergic drugs—baclofen and benzodiazepines—are used in clinical practice in select patients, their effect is not selective to the nociceptive pathways, resulting in a very low therapeutic index in the context of pain management.\n\n【139】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【140】Despite substantial effort, novel and more selective analgesic agents using the GABAergic pathway are not clinically available.\n\n【141】Another neurotransmitter involved in pain signaling is substance P. Substance P is produced by neurons throughout the peripheral nervous system and CNS, and it exerts its effect by activating neurokinin type 1 (NK <sub>1 </sub> ) receptor.\n\n【142】Neurobiology of substance P and the NK1 receptor.\n\n【143】Studies using NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor knockout mice and NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists in rodents suggested that blocking substance P signaling would result in profound analgesia, thereby generating widespread enthusiasm regarding clinical translation.\n\n【144】The substance P receptor antagonist CP-99,994 reduces acute postoperative pain.\n\n【145】The NK1 receptor is essential for the full expression of noxious inhibitory controls in the mouse.\n\n【146】However, clinical studies of several NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists given by the systemic route reported an almost complete lack of analgesic efficacy in humans.\n\n【147】Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists: a comprehensive patent survey.\n\n【148】The failure of NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists may have been considered a breaking point in analgesic drug discovery and development as it brought the realization that there may be no magic bullet consisting of a chemical compound targeting a single nociceptive mechanism with a degree of nociceptive specificity that could rival (or exceed) the analgesic activity of opioids.\n\n【149】Locoregional Analgesics: An Alternative Approach to Drug Development\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【150】### Clinical Interventional Pain Procedures for Locoregional Pain Syndromes\n\n【151】Interventional drug delivery for locoregional chronic pain is one of the most common procedures performed in clinical practice.\n\n【152】The role of invasive pain management modalities in the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【153】Multiple techniques that target various pain generators under imaging guidance are used.\n\n【154】Interventional approaches to pain management.\n\n【155】The most frequent targets for interventional drug delivery are the spinal nerves, which are accessed either IT or via the epidural (ED) route under fluoroscopic guidance. More than 2.5 million ED injections were performed in 2013 in the United States.\n\n【156】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, _Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting_ , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.\n\n【157】Although all these procedures are remarkably safe, their efficacy has recently come under scrutiny.\n\n【158】Pain Management Injection Therapies for Low Back Pain.\n\n【159】Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , Rockville, MD 2015\n\n【160】For the ED injection, there is evidence of moderate efficacy for some pain syndromes, such as lumbar radiculitis, but no evidence of efficacy in others, such as spinal stenosis (neurogenic intermittent claudication).\n\n【161】A randomized trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis.\n\n【162】The chief reason for the limited efficacy of interventional procedures for chronic pain is the small repertoire of analgesic agents available for these routes of delivery. For IT delivery, the available drugs are limited to opioids, benzodiazepines, baclofen, ziconotide, local anesthetics, and ketamine.\n\n【163】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【164】For ED delivery, local anesthetics and corticosteroids constitute the only agents available to date. The pharmacologic effect of these agents is relatively nonspecific, and its duration is only transient in most patients, requiring either implantation of a pump for the IT route or repeated interventions for the ED route; on average patients receive 2 to 3 injections of ED corticosteroids per year.\n\n【165】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, _Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting_ , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.\n\n【166】Although the discovery of novel analgesic agents specifically designed for anatomically selective routes of delivery, such as ED, is a major unmet clinical need, this area has not been appreciably explored by the pharmaceutical industry and research laboratories. The search for novel molecular targets has focused on systemically administered drugs, whereas drug development for localized delivery mainly involved optimizing the formulation of already available agents for ED delivery, such as depot liposomal forms of corticosteroids extending their biological half-life (currently in the phase of preclinical development).\n\n【167】A lipid based depot (DepoFoam technology) for sustained release drug delivery.\n\n【168】It is notable that although the field of CDD focused on systemic analgesic drugs, the major truly innovative agent recently approved for the treatment of chronic pain, ziconotide, is a locally delivered (IT) agent.\n\n【169】### Requirements for a New Generation of Analgesic Drugs for Interventional Delivery\n\n【170】A desirable agent for localized, interventional delivery would ideally meet 2 requirements that differ from systemic drugs developed via CCD: (1) prolonged or even permanent activity after a single administration and (2) ability to penetrate the target tissue locally without a need for sufficient bioavailability after systemic administration and for lack of off-target toxicity. Although the first requirement raises a conceptual bar that the candidate interventional agents need to reach compared with most systemic drugs currently under development via CDD, the second requirement lowers this bar substantially. The combination of these 2 requirements, ie, the need for long-term effect after a single administration and lessened concern for off-target distribution and toxicity, seems to be uniquely suited for an emerging drug discovery and disease treatment paradigm: gene therapy.\n\n【171】Gene Therapy\n------------\n\n【172】### Beyond Hereditary Disorders\n\n【173】Gene therapy was initially developed to correct dysfunctional genes in rare monogenic disorders, such as inborn errors of metabolism or blood clotting disorders.\n\n【174】History of gene therapy.\n\n【175】However, the greatest potential impact of gene therapy may lie in the treatment of common, acquired disorders.\n\n【176】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【177】Cardioprotection by gene therapy: a review paper on behalf of the Working Group on Drug Cardiotoxicity and Cardioprotection of the Italian Society of Cardiology.\n\n【178】The field of gene therapy reached critical benchmarks during the past several years.\n\n【179】Gene therapy clinical trials worldwide to 2012: an update.\n\n【180】Gene therapy returns to centre stage.\n\n【181】In 2012, alipogene tiparvovec became the first gene therapy product to be commercially approved in Europe (for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency).\n\n【182】Endgame: glybera finally recommended for approval as the first gene therapy drug in the European Union.\n\n【183】In 2015, talimogene laherparepvec was the first gene vector brought to market in the United States (for the treatment of inoperable malignant melanoma and head and neck cancer).\n\n【184】Talimogene laherparepvec: first global approval.\n\n【185】Talimogene laherparepvec improves durable response rate in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n【186】### Gene Vectors: A Distinct Class of Therapeutic Agents\n\n【187】In gene therapy, a vector serves as an intracellular delivery mechanism for the instruction set provided by the therapeutic gene (transgene) to the targeted cells.\n\n【188】Gene therapy—basic principles and the road from bench to bedside.\n\n【189】in: Gad S.C. Rubany G.M. Pharmaceutical Sciences Encyclopedia. John Wiley & Sons Inc , Hoboken, NJ 2010\n\n【190】The encoded proteins or peptides are expressed by the target cells, thereby harnessing their machinery to produce the therapeutic substance locally. Vectors are the most commonly genetically engineered viruses whose ability to replicate is artificially disrupted and part or all of their genome is replaced by a transgene of choice.\n\n【191】Viral vectors for gene therapy: the art of turning infectious agents into vehicles of therapeutics.\n\n【192】Unique from other drug constructs, the viral vector–transgene package is modular. The surface characteristics of the viral shell (capsid serotype) will determine its tissue selectivity (tropism), and this can be varied independently of the carried transgene. This provides great flexibility in testing large numbers of potential transgene products directed at varying molecular targets. This approach also enables overexpressing, silencing, or de novo expressing of virtually any gene, thereby affecting any signaling pathway. A further variable that can be introduced is selective anatomic delivery, which may augment or overcome the challenges of insufficient tissue tropism.\n\n【193】### Primary Sensory Neurons as the Target of Gene Therapy for Pain\n\n【194】The primary sensory neurons, as the point of aggregation of nociceptive signaling from the periphery, are a rational target of gene therapy.\n\n【195】Nociceptors: the sensors of the pain pathway.\n\n【196】These neurons reside in the DRG, a structure that is anatomically accessible, obviating the risk of CNS instrumentation. There are also appropriate small-animal models of DRG access and peripheral nociceptive testing.\n\n【197】Tests and models of nociception and pain in rodents.\n\n【198】Targeted delivery of pharmacological agents into rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【199】These characteristics have focused attention on DRG neurons as the primary target for modulation of nociception. Gene therapy may be directed to DRG neurons either by transducing them directly or by transducing anatomically or functionally related structures, such as the glia or the meninges, whereby nociception is indirectly modulated by their interaction with DRG neurons.\n\n【200】### Targeting the Primary Sensory Neurons by Gene Vectors\n\n【201】To attain gene transfer to the primary sensory neurons, several routes of vector delivery have been explored. First, replication-incompetent herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors delivered by skin inoculation were pioneered by Fink, Glorioso, and others.\n\n【202】Deletion of multiple immediate-early genes from herpes simplex virus reduces cytotoxicity and permits long-term gene expression in neurons.\n\n【203】Engineering herpes simplex virus vectors for CNS applications.\n\n【204】This approach takes advantage of the inherent ability of this virus to undergo retrograde axonal transport from the sensory nerve terminal to the cell body and, thereby, to transduce DRG neurons whose dendrites originate in the injected sensory field of the skin. Although this selectivity makes HSV attractive for gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system, it also restricts its utility for other gene therapy applications; the overall translational experience with this vector remains, therefore, relatively limited.\n\n【205】Second, IT injection of several serotypes of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors was found to selectively transduce the primary sensory neurons.\n\n【206】AAV8(gfp) preferentially targets large diameter dorsal root ganglion neurones after both intra-dorsal root ganglion and intrathecal injection.\n\n【207】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【208】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【209】Recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (rAAV2/6)-mediated gene transfer to nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery.\n\n【210】Differential adeno-associated virus mediated gene transfer to sensory neurons following intrathecal delivery by direct lumbar puncture.\n\n【211】Adeno-associated virus is the leading vector type across many gene therapy fields because it is not associated with any disease in any species, is devoid of any viral genes, and yields stable gene expression for months to years.\n\n【212】Adeno-associated virus: from defective virus to effective vector.\n\n【213】The initial safety concerns regarding AAV vectors, which included insertional mutagenesis, germline transmission, replication escape, and dissemination of the vector to the public domain, have been thoroughly addressed in the field and do not seem to be applicable in the context of human trials, as previously reviewed in detail elsewhere.\n\n【214】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【215】Furthermore, the difficulties with large-scale manufacturing of AAV vectors, which were holding back the clinical translation of AAV-based gene therapy, have recently been overcome.\n\n【216】Large-scale recombinant adeno-associated virus production.\n\n【217】A relative restriction associated with AAV is the need to switch capsids if serial treatments are needed because serologic immunity renders the readministration of a vector with the same serotypes ineffective.\n\n【218】Immune responses to AAV vectors: overcoming barriers to successful gene therapy.\n\n【219】In addition to AAV, IT delivery of other vector types, such lentiviruses or AAV plasmid DNA, was also tested for gene therapy for pain. Although efficacious in certain therapeutic strategies, these vectors did not transduce the primary sensory neurons but rather glial cells or the meninges.\n\n【220】Gene therapy for the treatment of chronic peripheral nervous system pain.\n\n【221】Third, to further improve the efficiency of gene transfer, several groups have targeted the nociceptive neurons directly by intraganglionic injection of AAV in rodents.\n\n【222】Intraganglionic AAV6 results in efficient and long-term gene transfer to peripheral sensory nervous system in adult rats.\n\n【223】Comparison of AAV serotypes for gene delivery to dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【224】Direct injection into the dorsal root ganglion: technical, behavioral, and histological observations.\n\n【225】Although this approach led to highly efficacious and selective gene transfer to the DRGs in a rodent model, an open surgical procedure consisting of paravertebral exposure and foraminotomy was required.\n\n【226】Molecular Targets of Gene Therapy for Pain\n------------------------------------------\n\n【227】The molecular selectivity of gene therapy has been of great interest because it enables utilization of antinociceptive mechanisms that have not been accessible by conventional agents. A variety of approaches have been found to be efficacious in animal models of chronic pain. Important examples of the molecular targets used to date by gene therapy for pain are (1) spinal opioid delivery, (2) anti-inflammatory cytokines, and (3) ion channels and neurotrophic growth factor.\n\n【228】### Spinal Opioid Delivery\n\n【229】The opioid system is an attractive target for gene therapy because of the robust clinical experience with exogenous opioids. Although opioids modulate pain processing at multiple levels of the nervous system, delivery of exogenous opioids to the spinal IT space is sufficient to achieve analgesia.\n\n【230】Intrathecal opioids for intractable pain syndromes.\n\n【231】Gene transfer of opioid genes selectively to DRG neurons has been found to reduce chronic pain in animal models of locoregional pain (as reviewed next). This approach may eliminate the toxicity of exogenously administered opioids, which is attributed to their extraspinal effects in the CNS and in peripheral tissues.\n\n【232】Side effects of intrathecal and epidural opioids.\n\n【233】Long-term opioid management for chronic noncancer pain.\n\n【234】A systematic review of the use of opioid medication for those with moderate to severe cancer pain and renal impairment: a European Palliative Care Research Collaborative opioid guidelines project.\n\n【235】A review of potential adverse effects of long-term opioid therapy: a practitioner's guide.\n\n【236】The prevalence, severity, and impact of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: results of a US and European Patient Survey (PROBE 1).\n\n【237】The effects of opioids and opioid analogs on animal and human endocrine systems.\n\n【238】Coronary heart disease outcomes among chronic opioid and cyclooxygenase-2 users compared with a general population cohort.\n\n【239】Opioids and immune modulation: more questions than answers.\n\n【240】Two principal strategies using opioid signaling for analgesia by gene therapy have been described. First, several groups have used transgenes encoding endogenous opioid agonists delivered to the DRGs. Goss et al\n\n【241】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【242】used preproenkephalin, a δ-opioid receptor agonist, and endomorphine-2, a μ-opioid receptor agonist, delivered by HSV vectors. We used AAV to deliver prepro-ß-endorphin, an artificial opioid precursor of the μ-opioid agonist peptide ß-endorphin that is engineered to be secreted in a stimulus-independent manner via the constitutive secretory pathway.\n\n【243】Retrovirus-mediated expression of an artificial beta-endorphin precursor in primary fibroblasts.\n\n【244】Administration of these therapeutic genes resulted in robust reduction of allodynia or hyperalgesia in multiple rodent models of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain.\n\n【245】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【246】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【247】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【248】Herpes vector-mediated expression of proenkephalin reduces bone cancer pain.\n\n【249】The second strategy to harness the opioid system for gene therapy of pain consists of transferring genes that encode an opioid receptor. Xu et al\n\n【250】Adeno-associated viral transfer of opioid receptor gene to primary sensory neurons: a strategy to increase opioid antinociception.\n\n【251】Efficiencies of transgene expression in nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors.\n\n【252】reported this approach several years ago, but no recent follow-up studies seem to have been attempted. Another approach testing an opioid receptor mutant was reported more recently.\n\n【253】Intrathecal delivery of a mutant micro-opioid receptor activated by naloxone as a possible antinociceptive paradigm.\n\n【254】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【255】Gene transfer of IL-10 by several vector systems, including HSV and AAV, has been extensively tested in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【256】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【257】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【258】Controlling neuropathic pain by adeno-associated virus driven production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【259】HSV-mediated transfer of interleukin-10 reduces inflammatory pain through modulation of membrane tumor necrosis factor α in spinal cord microglia.\n\n【260】Production of IL-10 resulted in marked reduction of allodynia and hyperalgesia, a finding verified independently by multiple groups. In addition to IL-10, a tumor necrosis factor–soluble receptor delivered via HSV-mediated gene transfer reduced allodynia in a rodent model of varicella zoster virus–induced pain.\n\n【261】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【262】### Ion Channels\n\n【263】Discovery of the voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels that are specific to nociception and the failure to generate corresponding conventional analgesic drugs has prompted an effort to use these targets via gene therapy. Two approaches have been used: (1) overexpression of ion channels responsible for membrane hyperpolarization by delivering vectors that carry the gene encoding for the respective channel and (2) downregulation of ion channels responsible for membrane depolarization by RNA interference, ie, by delivering vectors encoding small interfering RNA or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) complementary to the sequence of the respective ion channel, or by gene transfer of genes whose products deactivate these channels.\n\n【264】In the first approach, AAV-mediated gene transfer of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 in a rat model of neuropathic pain resulted in normalization of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 expression that had been downregulated in the context of nerve injury. This was associated with a decrease in allodynia in the treated animals.\n\n【265】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【266】Similarly, overexpression of the glycine receptor (a ligand-gated chloride channel) in the sensory fibers mediated by HSV resulted in attenuation of hyperalgesia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【267】HSV delivery of a ligand-regulated endogenous ion channel gene to sensory neurons results in pain control following channel activation.\n\n【268】In the second approach, Samad et al\n\n【269】Virus-mediated shRNA knockdown of Na(v)1.3 in rat dorsal root ganglion attenuates nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.\n\n【270】found that knockout of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 by shRNA encoded by an AAV vector delivered into the DRGs attenuated allodynia in the experimental animals. Similarly, knockout of the NR subunit of the NMDA receptor in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord via AAV-mediated transfer of the respective small interfering RNA reduced spinal NMDA currents as well as nociceptive behavior in a model of chronic inflammatory pain.\n\n【271】siRNA-mediated knockdown of the NR1 subunit gene of the NMDA receptor attenuates formalin-induced pain behaviors in adult rats.\n\n【272】A conditional deletion of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in adult spinal cord dorsal horn reduces NMDA currents and injury-induced pain.\n\n【273】Downregulation of the TRPV1 signaling via gene transfer of either shRNA delivered by IT AAV or the dominant negative (poreless) form of the protein delivered by HSV has been found to reduce allodynia in rat models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【274】Intrathecal AAV serotype 9-mediated delivery of shRNA against TRPV1 attenuates thermal hyperalgesia in a mouse model of peripheral nerve injury.\n\n【275】Herpes simplex virus vector-mediated gene delivery of poreless TRPV1 channels reduces bladder overactivity and nociception in rats.\n\n【276】An HSV vector system for selection of ligand-gated ion channel modulators.\n\n【277】Fischer et al\n\n【278】Sustained relief of neuropathic pain by AAV-targeted expression of CBD3 peptide in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【279】downregulated Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 by AAV-mediated gene transfer of Ca  channel-binding peptide 3, also resulting in attenuation of neuropathic pain in the rat model. Ma et al\n\n【280】Expression of inwardly rectifying potassium channels by an inducible adenoviral vector reduced the neuronal hyperexcitability and hyperalgesia produced by chronic compression of the spinal ganglion.\n\n【281】found that overexpression of Kir2.1, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, delivered by an adenoviral vector into the DRGs suppresses neuronal excitability and prevents the development of hyperalgesia in rodents.\n\n【282】### Neurotransmitters and Growth Factors\n\n【283】Delivery of AAV or HSV vectors encoding several isoforms of the GABA gene showed reduction of allodynia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【284】Constitutive GABA expression via a recombinant adeno-associated virus consistently attenuates neuropathic pain.\n\n【285】Vector-mediated release of GABA attenuates pain-related behaviors and reduces Na(V)1.7 in DRG neurons.\n\n【286】The AAV- or HSV-mediated gene transfer of several neurotrophic growth factors has been investigated as a novel approach to treat chronic pain by reversing the synaptic remodeling described in chronic pain states. This approach could be tested only by gene therapy because conventional pharmacotherapy could not attain target-specific, long-term delivery of an active agent.

The failure of systemic analgesic drugs, such as opioids, is often due to their off-target toxicity, development of tolerance, and abuse potential. Interventional pain procedures provide target specificity but lack pharmacologically selective agents with long-term efficacy. Gene therapy vectors are a new tool for the development of molecularly selective pain therapies, which have already been proved to provide durable analgesia in preclinical models. Taken together, advances in image-guided delivery and gene therapy may lead to a new class of dual selective analgesic treatments integrating the molecular selectivity of analgesic genes with the anatomic selectivity of interventional delivery techniques.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AAV ( adeno-associated virus ), Cav ( voltage-gated calcium channel ), CCD ( conventional drug discovery ), CNS ( central nervous system ), CRISPR/Cas9 ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 ), DRG ( dorsal root ganglion ), DREADD ( designer receptors activated by designer drugs ), ED ( epidural ), GABA ( γ-aminobutyric acid ), HSV ( herpes simplex virus ), IL-10 ( interleukin 10 ), IT ( intrathecal ), Kv ( voltage-gated potassium channel ), Nav ( voltage-gated sodium channel ), NK1 ( neurokinin type 1 ), NMDA ( N-methyl-d-aspartate ), shRNA ( small hairpin RNA ), TRP ( transient receptor potential channel ), TRPV1 ( transient receptor potential channel, subfamily V, member 1 )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .™\n\n【9】Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【10】**MOC Credit Statement:** Successful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1 MOC points in the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program.

Specifically, the 2 most prevalent causes of chronic pain in the population were low back pain and knee pain, as documented by a survey performed by the National Center for Health Statistics, whereby 28.1% of adult Americans reported low back pain and 19.5% localized knee pain during the past 3 months.\n\n【23】Institute of Medicine  \nRelieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research.\n\n【24】The National Academies Press , Washington, DC 2011\n\n【25】Locoregional pain is also responsible for a substantial portion of the financial burden of chronic pain.

Fifteen percent of patients with cancer pain experience anatomically localized pain, such as pain originating from bone metastases or neuropathic pain from nerve compression or invasion.\n\n【31】Cancer pain management.\n\n【32】Pain in these patients often cannot be adequately controlled by systemic analgesic treatments because the high doses needed for analgesia trigger intolerable adverse effects.\n\n【33】Understanding the experience of pain in terminally ill patients.\n\n【34】Although the best short-term outcomes in these patients are, therefore, frequently achieved by regional administration of local anesthetics or by selective neurolysis, neither approach is durable.\n\n【35】Cancer pain management.\n\n【36】The Search for Systemic Analgesic Therapies\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【37】### The Conventional Drug Discovery Paradigm\n\n【38】Current analgesic therapies fail in a substantial number of patients with chronic pain.\n\n【39】Cancer pain management.\n\n【40】This failure is most striking in cancer pain, where pain remains inadequately controlled in 50% of all patients.\n\n【41】Prevalence of undertreatment in cancer pain: a review of published literature.\n\n【42】Despite the search for novel analgesic treatments during the past few decades, currently available analgesic drugs exert their effect through very few categories of molecular targets.\n\n【43】A capsule history of pain management.\n\n【44】CT-guided injection of a TRPV1 agonist around dorsal root ganglia decreases pain transmission in swine.\n\n【45】Recent advances in neurobiology of nociception, however, identified a variety of candidate therapeutic targets located in the peripheral nervous system that are not used by current analgesic drugs. Important examples include ion channels expressed by primary sensory neurons, cytokines that play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, and several inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters that modulate nociceptive signaling.\n\n【46】Characterization of these nociceptive mechanisms led to a search for a new generation of analgesic drugs using the techniques of conventional drug discovery (CDD); CDD, ie, the search for new small-molecule therapeutic entities, largely relies on empirical screening of candidate compounds. Two approaches are used by the pharmaceutical industry and academic laboratories involved in CDD. First, phenotype-directed screening seeks to identify chemical entities that have a desirable effect on the phenotype of a disease model without previous knowledge of their molecular mechanism of action.\n\n【47】Phenotypic screening in cancer drug discovery: past, present and future.\n\n【48】Various assays modeling the disease phenotype on the level of a cell or an organism have been described.\n\n【49】Modern phenotypic drug discovery is a viable, neoclassic pharma strategy.\n\n【50】Efficacious compounds are then examined for molecular mechanism of action using reverse biology techniques. Second, target-directed screening relies on biochemical knowledge of specific molecular targets and uses small-molecule screening strategies, typically by examining large libraries of compounds.\n\n【51】Discovery of small molecule cancer drugs: successes, challenges and opportunities.\n\n【52】The actual biologic effect of thus discovered compounds is then tested in vivo in disease models. Although there has been a substantial effort to facilitate CDD by using high-throughput assays and by implementing genomic data, the discovery of new small-molecule drugs is declining in all medical fields. In fact, pharmaceutical industry data show that the number of truly innovative drugs (defined as new molecular entities) approved by the major regulatory bodies (such as the US Food and Drug Administration) has been decreasing by 50% every 5 years worldwide.\n\n【53】How to improve R&D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge.\n\n【54】PAREXEL Biopharmaceutical Statistical Sourcebook 2014/2015.\n\n【55】Parexel Intl Corp , Waltham, MA 2014\n\n【56】How were new medicines discovered?\n\n【57】Although multiple candidate analgesic agents that had been identified through CDD were tested in preclinical models, the success regarding clinical translation has been very limited, as reviewed next.\n\n【58】### Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels\n\n【59】Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na <sub>v </sub> ) are responsible for the formation of action potentials in all excitatory cells. Several Na <sub>v </sub> subtypes are expressed by primary sensory neurons but not by other excitatory cells, such as neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) or myocytes.\n\n【60】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【61】Specifically, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8, and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.9 have been found to be involved in nociception. All of these channels undergo upregulation in rodent models of nerve injury or inflammatory and neuropathic pain.\n\n【62】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【63】In addition, mutations in genes encoding these channels are associated with inherited pain disorders in humans. Gain-of-function mutations of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7 result in inherited erythromelalgia, an autosomal dominant disorder manifesting by extreme heat hyperalgesia.\n\n【64】Erythermalgia: molecular basis for an inherited pain syndrome.\n\n【65】Although clinical manifestations of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8 are less clearly defined, they have also been associated with the development of painful neuropathies and insensitivity to pain, respectively, in humans.\n\n【66】Pain as a channelopathy.\n\n【67】A variety of molecular entities have been tested in the preclinical setting that selectively inactivate Na <sub>v </sub> , including toxins isolated from tarantula venom or small-molecule compounds identified via target-directed screening.\n\n【68】Inhibitors of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7: patent applications since 2010.\n\n【69】Engineering potent and selective analogues of GpTx-1, a tarantula venom peptide antagonist of the Na(V)1.7 sodium channel.\n\n【70】Identification and characterization of proTx-III \\[μ-TRTX-Tp1a\\], a new voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor from venom of the tarantula thrixopelma pruriens.\n\n【71】Three peptide modulators of the human voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7, an important analgesic target, from the venom of an Australian tarantula.\n\n【72】Yet, despite an ongoing effort, none of these agents have been approved as a drug for use in humans.\n\n【73】### Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels\n\n【74】Similar to Na <sub>v </sub> , voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca <sub>v </sub> ) expressed in primary sensory neurons result in an increased firing frequency.\n\n【75】Voltage-gated calcium channels as targets for the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【76】At the level of the spinal cord, the upregulation of Ca <sub>v </sub> secondary to nerve injury has been described in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【77】The physiology, pathology, and pharmacology of voltage-gated calcium channels and their future therapeutic potential.\n\n【78】Specifically, Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 seems to play a critical role in neuropathic pain. Inactivation of this channel by channel-binding peptide 3 inhibits trafficking of Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 to the cytoplasmic membrane and, thereby, diminishes membrane excitability of nociceptive neurons, resulting in attenuation of nocifensive behavior in rodent models.\n\n【79】Suppression of inflammatory and neuropathic pain by uncoupling CRMP-2 from the presynaptic Ca  channel complex.\n\n【80】Gabapentinoids are the only class of systemic analgesic drugs that may exert their therapeutic effect through interacting with Ca <sub>v </sub> . Gabapentinoids were initially conceived as orally available analogues of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, for the treatment of seizure disorders.\n\n【81】Calcium channel a2–d ligands: gabapentin and pregabalin.\n\n【82】Although the antiepileptic efficacy of gabapentinoids did not hold up to the initial promise, they have been found to be efficacious for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【83】Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults.\n\n【84】Neuropathic pain: principles of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【85】Although the mechanism of action of gabapentinoids has not been fully elucidated, they have been found to bind to the α2δ-1 subunit of the Ca <sub>v </sub> , and it is, therefore, thought that they may, at least in part, exert analgesia through inhibition of Ca <sub>v </sub> .\n\n【86】Implications and mechanism of action of gabapentin in neuropathic pain.\n\n【87】A search for selective and potent Ca <sub>v </sub> antagonists identified ω-conotoxin MVIIA, a neurotoxic peptide isolated in the 1980s from the venom of marine snails belonging to the genus _Conus_ .\n\n【88】Neuronal calcium channel antagonists: discrimination between calcium channel subtypes using omega-conotoxin from _Conus magus_ venom.\n\n【89】Peptide neurotoxins from fish-hunting cone snails.\n\n【90】ω-Conotoxin MVIIA selectively blocks N-type Ca <sub>v </sub> present in nociceptive fibers. Despite efforts over 2 decades, a search for a drug with the mechanism of action analogous to ω-conotoxin MVIIA that would be efficacious and nontoxic after systemic administration has failed. Only in 2004, ziconotide, a ω-conotoxin MVIIA derivative, was approved for localized intrathecal (IT) delivery in patients with severe, otherwise intractable pain.\n\n【91】Intrathecal ziconotide: a review of its use in patients with chronic pain refractory to other systemic or intrathecal analgesics.\n\n【92】### Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels\n\n【93】Voltage-gated potassium channels (K <sub>v </sub> ) are also critical determinants of the firing frequency, and their downregulation results in membrane hyperexcitability.\n\n【94】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【95】Distinct potassium channels on pain-sensing neurons.\n\n【96】Although several potassium channels are expressed by primary nociceptive fibers, K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 has been most thoroughly studied in association with chronic pain and has been found to be markedly downregulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in the setting of nerve injury and neuropathic pain.\n\n【97】A long noncoding RNA contributes to neuropathic pain by silencing Kcna2 in primary afferent neurons.\n\n【98】Yet, no analgesic drugs that modulate nociceptive signaling through K <sub>v </sub> are clinically available.\n\n【99】### Ligand-Gated Cation Channels\n\n【100】Ligand-gated ion channels are an attractive target for drug development because their endogenous ligands can serve as a molecular pattern for discovery of compounds with analogous pharmacodynamics but therapeutically more favorable pharmacokinetics. The _N_ \\-methyl- d \\-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor mediates long-term potentiation, which has been found to play a key role in the development of chronic pain.\n\n【101】NMDA receptors and memory encoding.\n\n【102】Long-term potentiation at spinal C-fiber synapses: a target for pathological pain.\n\n【103】The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, a dissociative general anesthetic agent, is used in certain subgroups of chronic pain, but data on its efficacy are inconclusive.\n\n【104】Wherefore ketamine?\n\n【105】Effects of low-dose intranasal (S)-ketamine in patients with neuropathic pain.\n\n【106】Ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for cancer pain.\n\n【107】Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of subcutaneous ketamine in the management of cancer pain.\n\n【108】Ketamine as adjuvant analgesic to opioids: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review.\n\n【109】Despite an ongoing research effort, no clinically available NMDA antagonist more specific to nociception has been found.\n\n【110】Transient receptor potential channels (TRP) constitute another family of ligand-gated cation channels. Several TRP are expressed by the primary sensory neurons and are typically activated by noxious stimuli.\n\n【111】TRP channels and pain.\n\n【112】TRP, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) is a particularly attractive target for drug development because it is almost exclusively expressed by primary nociceptive neurons and its inactivation results in loss of pain and heat sensation while other sensory modalities remain intact.\n\n【113】The cloned capsaicin receptor integrates multiple pain-producing stimuli.\n\n【114】The capsaicin receptor: a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway.\n\n【115】Capsaicin, the pungent substance in chili peppers, is the only analgesic agent acting through TRPV1 clinically available to date and is used in the form of a patch to treat locoregional pain.\n\n【116】Topical capsaicin formulations in the management of neuropathic pain.\n\n【117】Capsaicin is a reversible TRPV1 agonist and is thought to induce analgesia by desensitizing TRPV1+ nerve fibers.\n\n【118】Capsaicin-based therapies for pain control.\n\n【119】A more intuitive approach to using the TRPV1 pathway is the use of TRPV1 receptor antagonists. Although a variety of TRPV1 antagonists have been tested in preclinical models, none have been successfully translated to the clinical setting owing to their off-target adverse effects, which included hyperthermia and impaired noxious heat sensation, after systemic delivery.\n\n【120】Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 antagonists: a patent review (2011-2014).\n\n【121】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【122】Glial cells have been reported to initiate and maintain neurogenic inflammation in the setting of chronic neuropathic pain, resulting in increased neuronal excitability.\n\n【123】Importance of glial activation in neuropathic pain.\n\n【124】The effect of glia on the primary sensory neurons may be mediated by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1β, and various chemokines.\n\n【125】Spinal interleukin-10 therapy to treat peripheral neuropathic pain.\n\n【126】The proinflammatory and pronociceptive effect of these cytokines is countered by anti-inflammatory cytokines. The principal anti-inflammatory cytokine is interleukin 10 (IL-10). Therefore, IL-10 is an attractive agent to treat neuropathic pain, which is known to be relatively refractory to opioid analgesics.\n\n【127】The IT administration of recombinant IL-10 has, indeed, been found to reduce neuroinflammation and allodynia in animal models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【128】Snake venom phospholipase A2s (Asp49 and Lys49) induce mechanical allodynia upon peri-sciatic administration: involvement of spinal cord glia, proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide.\n\n【129】Cytokine involvement in dynorphin-induced allodynia.\n\n【130】However, direct delivery of the recombinant IL-10 was found not to be feasible for clinical translation because of its high cost, its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and its half-life of only 2 hours in the cerebrospinal fluid after IT delivery.\n\n【131】Interleukin-10 as a CNS therapeutic: the obstacle of the blood-brain/blood-spinal cord barrier.\n\n【132】Controlling pathological pain by adenovirally driven spinal production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【133】### Pain-Modulating Neurotransmitters\n\n【134】Development and maintenance of chronic pain states is associated with alteration of the neurotransmitter milieu in the CNS.\n\n【135】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【136】The neuroinhibitory transmitter GABA is known to inhibit neuropathic pain signaling on the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【137】Partial peripheral nerve injury promotes a selective loss of GABAergic inhibition in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【138】Although 2 classes of GABAergic drugs—baclofen and benzodiazepines—are used in clinical practice in select patients, their effect is not selective to the nociceptive pathways, resulting in a very low therapeutic index in the context of pain management.\n\n【139】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【140】Despite substantial effort, novel and more selective analgesic agents using the GABAergic pathway are not clinically available.\n\n【141】Another neurotransmitter involved in pain signaling is substance P. Substance P is produced by neurons throughout the peripheral nervous system and CNS, and it exerts its effect by activating neurokinin type 1 (NK <sub>1 </sub> ) receptor.\n\n【142】Neurobiology of substance P and the NK1 receptor.\n\n【143】Studies using NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor knockout mice and NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists in rodents suggested that blocking substance P signaling would result in profound analgesia, thereby generating widespread enthusiasm regarding clinical translation.\n\n【144】The substance P receptor antagonist CP-99,994 reduces acute postoperative pain.\n\n【145】The NK1 receptor is essential for the full expression of noxious inhibitory controls in the mouse.\n\n【146】However, clinical studies of several NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists given by the systemic route reported an almost complete lack of analgesic efficacy in humans.\n\n【147】Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists: a comprehensive patent survey.\n\n【148】The failure of NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists may have been considered a breaking point in analgesic drug discovery and development as it brought the realization that there may be no magic bullet consisting of a chemical compound targeting a single nociceptive mechanism with a degree of nociceptive specificity that could rival (or exceed) the analgesic activity of opioids.\n\n【149】Locoregional Analgesics: An Alternative Approach to Drug Development\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【150】### Clinical Interventional Pain Procedures for Locoregional Pain Syndromes\n\n【151】Interventional drug delivery for locoregional chronic pain is one of the most common procedures performed in clinical practice.\n\n【152】The role of invasive pain management modalities in the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【153】Multiple techniques that target various pain generators under imaging guidance are used.\n\n【154】Interventional approaches to pain management.\n\n【155】The most frequent targets for interventional drug delivery are the spinal nerves, which are accessed either IT or via the epidural (ED) route under fluoroscopic guidance. More than 2.5 million ED injections were performed in 2013 in the United States.\n\n【156】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, _Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting_ , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.\n\n【157】Although all these procedures are remarkably safe, their efficacy has recently come under scrutiny.\n\n【158】Pain Management Injection Therapies for Low Back Pain.\n\n【159】Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , Rockville, MD 2015\n\n【160】For the ED injection, there is evidence of moderate efficacy for some pain syndromes, such as lumbar radiculitis, but no evidence of efficacy in others, such as spinal stenosis (neurogenic intermittent claudication).\n\n【161】A randomized trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis.\n\n【162】The chief reason for the limited efficacy of interventional procedures for chronic pain is the small repertoire of analgesic agents available for these routes of delivery. For IT delivery, the available drugs are limited to opioids, benzodiazepines, baclofen, ziconotide, local anesthetics, and ketamine.\n\n【163】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【164】For ED delivery, local anesthetics and corticosteroids constitute the only agents available to date. The pharmacologic effect of these agents is relatively nonspecific, and its duration is only transient in most patients, requiring either implantation of a pump for the IT route or repeated interventions for the ED route; on average patients receive 2 to 3 injections of ED corticosteroids per year.\n\n【165】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, _Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting_ , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.\n\n【166】Although the discovery of novel analgesic agents specifically designed for anatomically selective routes of delivery, such as ED, is a major unmet clinical need, this area has not been appreciably explored by the pharmaceutical industry and research laboratories. The search for novel molecular targets has focused on systemically administered drugs, whereas drug development for localized delivery mainly involved optimizing the formulation of already available agents for ED delivery, such as depot liposomal forms of corticosteroids extending their biological half-life (currently in the phase of preclinical development).\n\n【167】A lipid based depot (DepoFoam technology) for sustained release drug delivery.\n\n【168】It is notable that although the field of CDD focused on systemic analgesic drugs, the major truly innovative agent recently approved for the treatment of chronic pain, ziconotide, is a locally delivered (IT) agent.\n\n【169】### Requirements for a New Generation of Analgesic Drugs for Interventional Delivery\n\n【170】A desirable agent for localized, interventional delivery would ideally meet 2 requirements that differ from systemic drugs developed via CCD: (1) prolonged or even permanent activity after a single administration and (2) ability to penetrate the target tissue locally without a need for sufficient bioavailability after systemic administration and for lack of off-target toxicity. Although the first requirement raises a conceptual bar that the candidate interventional agents need to reach compared with most systemic drugs currently under development via CDD, the second requirement lowers this bar substantially. The combination of these 2 requirements, ie, the need for long-term effect after a single administration and lessened concern for off-target distribution and toxicity, seems to be uniquely suited for an emerging drug discovery and disease treatment paradigm: gene therapy.\n\n【171】Gene Therapy\n------------\n\n【172】### Beyond Hereditary Disorders\n\n【173】Gene therapy was initially developed to correct dysfunctional genes in rare monogenic disorders, such as inborn errors of metabolism or blood clotting disorders.\n\n【174】History of gene therapy.\n\n【175】However, the greatest potential impact of gene therapy may lie in the treatment of common, acquired disorders.\n\n【176】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【177】Cardioprotection by gene therapy: a review paper on behalf of the Working Group on Drug Cardiotoxicity and Cardioprotection of the Italian Society of Cardiology.\n\n【178】The field of gene therapy reached critical benchmarks during the past several years.\n\n【179】Gene therapy clinical trials worldwide to 2012: an update.\n\n【180】Gene therapy returns to centre stage.\n\n【181】In 2012, alipogene tiparvovec became the first gene therapy product to be commercially approved in Europe (for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency).\n\n【182】Endgame: glybera finally recommended for approval as the first gene therapy drug in the European Union.\n\n【183】In 2015, talimogene laherparepvec was the first gene vector brought to market in the United States (for the treatment of inoperable malignant melanoma and head and neck cancer).\n\n【184】Talimogene laherparepvec: first global approval.\n\n【185】Talimogene laherparepvec improves durable response rate in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n【186】### Gene Vectors: A Distinct Class of Therapeutic Agents\n\n【187】In gene therapy, a vector serves as an intracellular delivery mechanism for the instruction set provided by the therapeutic gene (transgene) to the targeted cells.\n\n【188】Gene therapy—basic principles and the road from bench to bedside.\n\n【189】in: Gad S.C. Rubany G.M. Pharmaceutical Sciences Encyclopedia. John Wiley & Sons Inc , Hoboken, NJ 2010\n\n【190】The encoded proteins or peptides are expressed by the target cells, thereby harnessing their machinery to produce the therapeutic substance locally. Vectors are the most commonly genetically engineered viruses whose ability to replicate is artificially disrupted and part or all of their genome is replaced by a transgene of choice.\n\n【191】Viral vectors for gene therapy: the art of turning infectious agents into vehicles of therapeutics.\n\n【192】Unique from other drug constructs, the viral vector–transgene package is modular. The surface characteristics of the viral shell (capsid serotype) will determine its tissue selectivity (tropism), and this can be varied independently of the carried transgene. This provides great flexibility in testing large numbers of potential transgene products directed at varying molecular targets. This approach also enables overexpressing, silencing, or de novo expressing of virtually any gene, thereby affecting any signaling pathway. A further variable that can be introduced is selective anatomic delivery, which may augment or overcome the challenges of insufficient tissue tropism.\n\n【193】### Primary Sensory Neurons as the Target of Gene Therapy for Pain\n\n【194】The primary sensory neurons, as the point of aggregation of nociceptive signaling from the periphery, are a rational target of gene therapy.\n\n【195】Nociceptors: the sensors of the pain pathway.\n\n【196】These neurons reside in the DRG, a structure that is anatomically accessible, obviating the risk of CNS instrumentation. There are also appropriate small-animal models of DRG access and peripheral nociceptive testing.\n\n【197】Tests and models of nociception and pain in rodents.\n\n【198】Targeted delivery of pharmacological agents into rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【199】These characteristics have focused attention on DRG neurons as the primary target for modulation of nociception. Gene therapy may be directed to DRG neurons either by transducing them directly or by transducing anatomically or functionally related structures, such as the glia or the meninges, whereby nociception is indirectly modulated by their interaction with DRG neurons.\n\n【200】### Targeting the Primary Sensory Neurons by Gene Vectors\n\n【201】To attain gene transfer to the primary sensory neurons, several routes of vector delivery have been explored. First, replication-incompetent herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors delivered by skin inoculation were pioneered by Fink, Glorioso, and others.\n\n【202】Deletion of multiple immediate-early genes from herpes simplex virus reduces cytotoxicity and permits long-term gene expression in neurons.\n\n【203】Engineering herpes simplex virus vectors for CNS applications.\n\n【204】This approach takes advantage of the inherent ability of this virus to undergo retrograde axonal transport from the sensory nerve terminal to the cell body and, thereby, to transduce DRG neurons whose dendrites originate in the injected sensory field of the skin. Although this selectivity makes HSV attractive for gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system, it also restricts its utility for other gene therapy applications; the overall translational experience with this vector remains, therefore, relatively limited.\n\n【205】Second, IT injection of several serotypes of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors was found to selectively transduce the primary sensory neurons.\n\n【206】AAV8(gfp) preferentially targets large diameter dorsal root ganglion neurones after both intra-dorsal root ganglion and intrathecal injection.\n\n【207】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【208】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【209】Recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (rAAV2/6)-mediated gene transfer to nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery.\n\n【210】Differential adeno-associated virus mediated gene transfer to sensory neurons following intrathecal delivery by direct lumbar puncture.\n\n【211】Adeno-associated virus is the leading vector type across many gene therapy fields because it is not associated with any disease in any species, is devoid of any viral genes, and yields stable gene expression for months to years.\n\n【212】Adeno-associated virus: from defective virus to effective vector.\n\n【213】The initial safety concerns regarding AAV vectors, which included insertional mutagenesis, germline transmission, replication escape, and dissemination of the vector to the public domain, have been thoroughly addressed in the field and do not seem to be applicable in the context of human trials, as previously reviewed in detail elsewhere.\n\n【214】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【215】Furthermore, the difficulties with large-scale manufacturing of AAV vectors, which were holding back the clinical translation of AAV-based gene therapy, have recently been overcome.\n\n【216】Large-scale recombinant adeno-associated virus production.\n\n【217】A relative restriction associated with AAV is the need to switch capsids if serial treatments are needed because serologic immunity renders the readministration of a vector with the same serotypes ineffective.\n\n【218】Immune responses to AAV vectors: overcoming barriers to successful gene therapy.\n\n【219】In addition to AAV, IT delivery of other vector types, such lentiviruses or AAV plasmid DNA, was also tested for gene therapy for pain. Although efficacious in certain therapeutic strategies, these vectors did not transduce the primary sensory neurons but rather glial cells or the meninges.\n\n【220】Gene therapy for the treatment of chronic peripheral nervous system pain.\n\n【221】Third, to further improve the efficiency of gene transfer, several groups have targeted the nociceptive neurons directly by intraganglionic injection of AAV in rodents.\n\n【222】Intraganglionic AAV6 results in efficient and long-term gene transfer to peripheral sensory nervous system in adult rats.\n\n【223】Comparison of AAV serotypes for gene delivery to dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【224】Direct injection into the dorsal root ganglion: technical, behavioral, and histological observations.\n\n【225】Although this approach led to highly efficacious and selective gene transfer to the DRGs in a rodent model, an open surgical procedure consisting of paravertebral exposure and foraminotomy was required.\n\n【226】Molecular Targets of Gene Therapy for Pain\n------------------------------------------\n\n【227】The molecular selectivity of gene therapy has been of great interest because it enables utilization of antinociceptive mechanisms that have not been accessible by conventional agents. A variety of approaches have been found to be efficacious in animal models of chronic pain. Important examples of the molecular targets used to date by gene therapy for pain are (1) spinal opioid delivery, (2) anti-inflammatory cytokines, and (3) ion channels and neurotrophic growth factor.\n\n【228】### Spinal Opioid Delivery\n\n【229】The opioid system is an attractive target for gene therapy because of the robust clinical experience with exogenous opioids. Although opioids modulate pain processing at multiple levels of the nervous system, delivery of exogenous opioids to the spinal IT space is sufficient to achieve analgesia.\n\n【230】Intrathecal opioids for intractable pain syndromes.\n\n【231】Gene transfer of opioid genes selectively to DRG neurons has been found to reduce chronic pain in animal models of locoregional pain (as reviewed next). This approach may eliminate the toxicity of exogenously administered opioids, which is attributed to their extraspinal effects in the CNS and in peripheral tissues.\n\n【232】Side effects of intrathecal and epidural opioids.\n\n【233】Long-term opioid management for chronic noncancer pain.\n\n【234】A systematic review of the use of opioid medication for those with moderate to severe cancer pain and renal impairment: a European Palliative Care Research Collaborative opioid guidelines project.\n\n【235】A review of potential adverse effects of long-term opioid therapy: a practitioner's guide.\n\n【236】The prevalence, severity, and impact of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: results of a US and European Patient Survey (PROBE 1).\n\n【237】The effects of opioids and opioid analogs on animal and human endocrine systems.\n\n【238】Coronary heart disease outcomes among chronic opioid and cyclooxygenase-2 users compared with a general population cohort.\n\n【239】Opioids and immune modulation: more questions than answers.\n\n【240】Two principal strategies using opioid signaling for analgesia by gene therapy have been described. First, several groups have used transgenes encoding endogenous opioid agonists delivered to the DRGs. Goss et al\n\n【241】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【242】used preproenkephalin, a δ-opioid receptor agonist, and endomorphine-2, a μ-opioid receptor agonist, delivered by HSV vectors. We used AAV to deliver prepro-ß-endorphin, an artificial opioid precursor of the μ-opioid agonist peptide ß-endorphin that is engineered to be secreted in a stimulus-independent manner via the constitutive secretory pathway.\n\n【243】Retrovirus-mediated expression of an artificial beta-endorphin precursor in primary fibroblasts.\n\n【244】Administration of these therapeutic genes resulted in robust reduction of allodynia or hyperalgesia in multiple rodent models of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain.\n\n【245】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【246】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【247】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【248】Herpes vector-mediated expression of proenkephalin reduces bone cancer pain.\n\n【249】The second strategy to harness the opioid system for gene therapy of pain consists of transferring genes that encode an opioid receptor. Xu et al\n\n【250】Adeno-associated viral transfer of opioid receptor gene to primary sensory neurons: a strategy to increase opioid antinociception.\n\n【251】Efficiencies of transgene expression in nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors.\n\n【252】reported this approach several years ago, but no recent follow-up studies seem to have been attempted. Another approach testing an opioid receptor mutant was reported more recently.\n\n【253】Intrathecal delivery of a mutant micro-opioid receptor activated by naloxone as a possible antinociceptive paradigm.\n\n【254】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【255】Gene transfer of IL-10 by several vector systems, including HSV and AAV, has been extensively tested in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【256】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【257】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【258】Controlling neuropathic pain by adeno-associated virus driven production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【259】HSV-mediated transfer of interleukin-10 reduces inflammatory pain through modulation of membrane tumor necrosis factor α in spinal cord microglia.\n\n【260】Production of IL-10 resulted in marked reduction of allodynia and hyperalgesia, a finding verified independently by multiple groups. In addition to IL-10, a tumor necrosis factor–soluble receptor delivered via HSV-mediated gene transfer reduced allodynia in a rodent model of varicella zoster virus–induced pain.\n\n【261】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【262】### Ion Channels\n\n【263】Discovery of the voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels that are specific to nociception and the failure to generate corresponding conventional analgesic drugs has prompted an effort to use these targets via gene therapy. Two approaches have been used: (1) overexpression of ion channels responsible for membrane hyperpolarization by delivering vectors that carry the gene encoding for the respective channel and (2) downregulation of ion channels responsible for membrane depolarization by RNA interference, ie, by delivering vectors encoding small interfering RNA or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) complementary to the sequence of the respective ion channel, or by gene transfer of genes whose products deactivate these channels.\n\n【264】In the first approach, AAV-mediated gene transfer of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 in a rat model of neuropathic pain resulted in normalization of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 expression that had been downregulated in the context of nerve injury. This was associated with a decrease in allodynia in the treated animals.\n\n【265】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【266】Similarly, overexpression of the glycine receptor (a ligand-gated chloride channel) in the sensory fibers mediated by HSV resulted in attenuation of hyperalgesia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【267】HSV delivery of a ligand-regulated endogenous ion channel gene to sensory neurons results in pain control following channel activation.\n\n【268】In the second approach, Samad et al\n\n【269】Virus-mediated shRNA knockdown of Na(v)1.3 in rat dorsal root ganglion attenuates nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.\n\n【270】found that knockout of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 by shRNA encoded by an AAV vector delivered into the DRGs attenuated allodynia in the experimental animals. Similarly, knockout of the NR subunit of the NMDA receptor in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord via AAV-mediated transfer of the respective small interfering RNA reduced spinal NMDA currents as well as nociceptive behavior in a model of chronic inflammatory pain.\n\n【271】siRNA-mediated knockdown of the NR1 subunit gene of the NMDA receptor attenuates formalin-induced pain behaviors in adult rats.\n\n【272】A conditional deletion of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in adult spinal cord dorsal horn reduces NMDA currents and injury-induced pain.\n\n【273】Downregulation of the TRPV1 signaling via gene transfer of either shRNA delivered by IT AAV or the dominant negative (poreless) form of the protein delivered by HSV has been found to reduce allodynia in rat models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【274】Intrathecal AAV serotype 9-mediated delivery of shRNA against TRPV1 attenuates thermal hyperalgesia in a mouse model of peripheral nerve injury.\n\n【275】Herpes simplex virus vector-mediated gene delivery of poreless TRPV1 channels reduces bladder overactivity and nociception in rats.\n\n【276】An HSV vector system for selection of ligand-gated ion channel modulators.\n\n【277】Fischer et al\n\n【278】Sustained relief of neuropathic pain by AAV-targeted expression of CBD3 peptide in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【279】downregulated Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 by AAV-mediated gene transfer of Ca  channel-binding peptide 3, also resulting in attenuation of neuropathic pain in the rat model. Ma et al\n\n【280】Expression of inwardly rectifying potassium channels by an inducible adenoviral vector reduced the neuronal hyperexcitability and hyperalgesia produced by chronic compression of the spinal ganglion.\n\n【281】found that overexpression of Kir2.1, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, delivered by an adenoviral vector into the DRGs suppresses neuronal excitability and prevents the development of hyperalgesia in rodents.\n\n【282】### Neurotransmitters and Growth Factors\n\n【283】Delivery of AAV or HSV vectors encoding several isoforms of the GABA gene showed reduction of allodynia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【284】Constitutive GABA expression via a recombinant adeno-associated virus consistently attenuates neuropathic pain.\n\n【285】Vector-mediated release of GABA attenuates pain-related behaviors and reduces Na(V)1.7 in DRG neurons.\n\n【286】The AAV- or HSV-mediated gene transfer of several neurotrophic growth factors has been investigated as a novel approach to treat chronic pain by reversing the synaptic remodeling described in chronic pain states. This approach could be tested only by gene therapy because conventional pharmacotherapy could not attain target-specific, long-term delivery of an active agent. Several neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, erythropoietin, glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, were found to reduce pain behavior in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【287】Amelioration of chronic neuropathic pain after partial nerve injury by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated over-expression of BDNF in the rat spinal cord.\n\n【288】Neuroprotective effect of herpes simplex virus-mediated gene transfer of erythropoietin in hyperglycemic dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【289】HSV-mediated gene transfer of the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor provides an antiallodynic effect on neuropathic pain.\n\n【290】Long-term neuroprotection achieved with latency-associated promoter-driven herpes simplex virus gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system.\n\n【291】### Gene Editing\n\n【292】Gene editing is a technique for highly targeted deletion, insertion, or substitution of a desired sequence of a genome.\n\n【293】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【294】Although multiple gene editing techniques have been described, the field underwent a breakthrough in 2012 when Barrangou, Doudna, Jinek, and others described the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in conjunction with CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9).\n\n【295】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【296】Genome-scale engineering for systems and synthetic biology.\n\n【297】A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.\n\n【298】The CRISPR craze.\n\n【299】CRISPR/Cas9 allows precise and cost-effective gene editing in vivo, and is poised to revolutionize gene therapy. It seems conceivable that in vivo gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 delivered by gene vector may give rise to a whole new field of pain therapy.\n\n【300】### Chemogenetics and Optogenetics\n\n【301】Chemogenetics and optogenetics represent 2 emerging approaches to selectively and, unlike traditional gene therapy, reversibly manipulate cell phenotypes via gene transfer.\n\n【302】Therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain: potential application of pharmacosynthetics and optogenetics.\n\n【303】Chemogenetics is based on designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). The DREADDs are G protein–coupled receptors artificially engineered to respond to nanomolar concentrations of otherwise biologically inert ligands, such as clozapine-N-oxide.\n\n【304】Controlling signaling with a specifically designed Gi-coupled receptor.\n\n【305】Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.\n\n【306】Preliminary studies in rodents suggest that selective expression of DREADDs in nociceptive neurons via gene transfer might allow efficient and highly precise exogenous control of nociceptive signaling.\n\n【307】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【308】Mu opioid receptor modulation of dopamine neurons in the periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe: a role in regulation of pain.\n\n【309】(457) Gi-DREADD expression in TRPV1-Cre mice produces ligand-dependent behavioral inhibition to noxious heat, but ligand-independent changes in sensory neurons.\n\n【310】Analogously, optogenetics enables tunable manipulation of cell phenotypes using light.\n\n【311】Orderly recruitment of motor units under optical control in vivo.\n\n【312】Iyer et al\n\n【313】Virally mediated optogenetic excitation and inhibition of pain in freely moving nontransgenic mice.\n\n【314】found that AAV-mediated gene transfer of eNpHR3.0, a chloride channel activated by yellow light, to the DRG sensory neurons results in reduction of allodynia in rodent models that is tunable by illumination by light of the respective wavelength.\n\n【315】### Pathways to Clinical Translation\n\n【316】Herpes simplex virus encoding preproenkephalin, administered as a series of intradermal injections for intractable locoregional pain caused by cancer, is the only vector so far tested in humans in the context of gene therapy for pain.\n\n【317】Gene therapy for pain: results of a phase I clinical trial.\n\n【318】A phase 1 clinical trial reported safety of the treatment, but the lack of a blinded control group, a design typical of a phase 1 trial, did not allow any conclusions regarding efficacy. A subsequent blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial was initiated in 2011 and completed in November 2013 (according to ClinicalTrials.gov ).\n\n【319】Of note, HSV was translated from rodent studies directly into clinical trials without testing the approach in a large-animal model as an intermediate step. Should the clinical trial fail to find analgesic efficacy, it may be difficult to discern whether the HSV gene transfer technology or the therapeutic gene was the cause of failure. In such a situation, only large-animal studies may be able to further the understanding.\n\n【320】Adeno-associated virus–based gene therapy has not been tested in patients with chronic pain but in numerous other clinical settings, including phase 1, 2, and 3 trials for a large variety of neurologic and nonneurologic therapeutic applications.\n\n【321】In the field of AAV for pain, we translated the approach into large-animal models, first reporting differences in gene transfer outcomes compared with rodents when the IT route was tested.\n\n【322】High cerebrospinal fluid levels of interleukin-10 attained by AAV in dogs.\n\n【323】Subsequently, we developed a method of locoregional delivery of AAV to DRG neurons in a large-animal (swine) model using computed tomography fluoroscopy.\n\n【324】Minimally invasive convection-enhanced delivery of biologics into dorsal root ganglia: validation in the pig model and prospective modeling in humans.\n\n【325】This study recreated the gene transfer outcomes of the original rodent studies of intraganglionic AAV delivery while introducing an image-guided intervention technique and thereby obviating the need for open surgical exposure of the DRG that was used in rodents. Examination of the comparative anatomy of porcine and human spines indicates that similar, minimally invasive intraganglionic injection could also be performed in the clinical setting.\n\n【326】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【327】Interventional pain specialists have a unique skill set to translate gene therapy–based treatment approaches into novel clinical treatments for locoregional pain. Future clinical progress may be driven not only by the rapid advances in gene vector design and clinical availability but also by advances in interventional delivery techniques. Image guidance available for clinical use to date can provide anatomic selectivity for gene vector delivery to select DRGs. Combining the molecular selectivity of gene vectors with the anatomic selectivity of image-guided delivery may spur a new era of interventions for pain using a dual selective approach to analgesic treatment, thereby offering novel treatment options for patients with hitherto intractable locoregional pain.", "index": 4988, "show": true, "start": 4988, "end": 5042, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【20】The National Academies Press , Washington, DC 2011", "content": "【0】Future Directions in Pain Management\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【1】Treatment for chronic, locoregional pain ranks among the most prevalent unmet medical needs. The failure of systemic analgesic drugs, such as opioids, is often due to their off-target toxicity, development of tolerance, and abuse potential. Interventional pain procedures provide target specificity but lack pharmacologically selective agents with long-term efficacy. Gene therapy vectors are a new tool for the development of molecularly selective pain therapies, which have already been proved to provide durable analgesia in preclinical models. Taken together, advances in image-guided delivery and gene therapy may lead to a new class of dual selective analgesic treatments integrating the molecular selectivity of analgesic genes with the anatomic selectivity of interventional delivery techniques.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AAV ( adeno-associated virus ), Cav ( voltage-gated calcium channel ), CCD ( conventional drug discovery ), CNS ( central nervous system ), CRISPR/Cas9 ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 ), DRG ( dorsal root ganglion ), DREADD ( designer receptors activated by designer drugs ), ED ( epidural ), GABA ( γ-aminobutyric acid ), HSV ( herpes simplex virus ), IL-10 ( interleukin 10 ), IT ( intrathecal ), Kv ( voltage-gated potassium channel ), Nav ( voltage-gated sodium channel ), NK1 ( neurokinin type 1 ), NMDA ( N-methyl-d-aspartate ), shRNA ( small hairpin RNA ), TRP ( transient receptor potential channel ), TRPV1 ( transient receptor potential channel, subfamily V, member 1 )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .™\n\n【9】Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【10】**MOC Credit Statement:** Successful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1 MOC points in the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program.

Specifically, the 2 most prevalent causes of chronic pain in the population were low back pain and knee pain, as documented by a survey performed by the National Center for Health Statistics, whereby 28.1% of adult Americans reported low back pain and 19.5% localized knee pain during the past 3 months.\n\n【23】Institute of Medicine  \nRelieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research.\n\n【24】The National Academies Press , Washington, DC 2011\n\n【25】Locoregional pain is also responsible for a substantial portion of the financial burden of chronic pain. Low back pain is estimated to cost $30 billion in direct health care expenditures and $100 to $200 billion in decreased wages and disability in the United States annually.\n\n【26】Soni A. Back problems: use and expenditures for the U.S. adult population. Statistical Brief #289, Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality, 2007.\n\n【27】The rising prevalence of chronic low back pain.\n\n【28】As for arthritic pain, annual direct health care expenses are estimated to approach $81 billion, with indirect costs reaching $189 billion annually.\n\n【29】Medical care expenditures and earnings losses among persons with arthritis and other rheumatic conditions in 2003, and comparisons with 1997.\n\n【30】Similar to musculoskeletal pain, cancer pain—a subset of chronic pain that is particularly challenging to manage—also frequently presents as a locoregional syndrome. Fifteen percent of patients with cancer pain experience anatomically localized pain, such as pain originating from bone metastases or neuropathic pain from nerve compression or invasion.\n\n【31】Cancer pain management.\n\n【32】Pain in these patients often cannot be adequately controlled by systemic analgesic treatments because the high doses needed for analgesia trigger intolerable adverse effects.\n\n【33】Understanding the experience of pain in terminally ill patients.\n\n【34】Although the best short-term outcomes in these patients are, therefore, frequently achieved by regional administration of local anesthetics or by selective neurolysis, neither approach is durable.\n\n【35】Cancer pain management.\n\n【36】The Search for Systemic Analgesic Therapies\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【37】### The Conventional Drug Discovery Paradigm\n\n【38】Current analgesic therapies fail in a substantial number of patients with chronic pain.\n\n【39】Cancer pain management.\n\n【40】This failure is most striking in cancer pain, where pain remains inadequately controlled in 50% of all patients.\n\n【41】Prevalence of undertreatment in cancer pain: a review of published literature.\n\n【42】Despite the search for novel analgesic treatments during the past few decades, currently available analgesic drugs exert their effect through very few categories of molecular targets.\n\n【43】A capsule history of pain management.\n\n【44】CT-guided injection of a TRPV1 agonist around dorsal root ganglia decreases pain transmission in swine.\n\n【45】Recent advances in neurobiology of nociception, however, identified a variety of candidate therapeutic targets located in the peripheral nervous system that are not used by current analgesic drugs. Important examples include ion channels expressed by primary sensory neurons, cytokines that play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, and several inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters that modulate nociceptive signaling.\n\n【46】Characterization of these nociceptive mechanisms led to a search for a new generation of analgesic drugs using the techniques of conventional drug discovery (CDD); CDD, ie, the search for new small-molecule therapeutic entities, largely relies on empirical screening of candidate compounds. Two approaches are used by the pharmaceutical industry and academic laboratories involved in CDD. First, phenotype-directed screening seeks to identify chemical entities that have a desirable effect on the phenotype of a disease model without previous knowledge of their molecular mechanism of action.\n\n【47】Phenotypic screening in cancer drug discovery: past, present and future.\n\n【48】Various assays modeling the disease phenotype on the level of a cell or an organism have been described.\n\n【49】Modern phenotypic drug discovery is a viable, neoclassic pharma strategy.\n\n【50】Efficacious compounds are then examined for molecular mechanism of action using reverse biology techniques. Second, target-directed screening relies on biochemical knowledge of specific molecular targets and uses small-molecule screening strategies, typically by examining large libraries of compounds.\n\n【51】Discovery of small molecule cancer drugs: successes, challenges and opportunities.\n\n【52】The actual biologic effect of thus discovered compounds is then tested in vivo in disease models. Although there has been a substantial effort to facilitate CDD by using high-throughput assays and by implementing genomic data, the discovery of new small-molecule drugs is declining in all medical fields. In fact, pharmaceutical industry data show that the number of truly innovative drugs (defined as new molecular entities) approved by the major regulatory bodies (such as the US Food and Drug Administration) has been decreasing by 50% every 5 years worldwide.\n\n【53】How to improve R&D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge.\n\n【54】PAREXEL Biopharmaceutical Statistical Sourcebook 2014/2015.\n\n【55】Parexel Intl Corp , Waltham, MA 2014\n\n【56】How were new medicines discovered?\n\n【57】Although multiple candidate analgesic agents that had been identified through CDD were tested in preclinical models, the success regarding clinical translation has been very limited, as reviewed next.\n\n【58】### Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels\n\n【59】Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na <sub>v </sub> ) are responsible for the formation of action potentials in all excitatory cells. Several Na <sub>v </sub> subtypes are expressed by primary sensory neurons but not by other excitatory cells, such as neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) or myocytes.\n\n【60】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【61】Specifically, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8, and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.9 have been found to be involved in nociception. All of these channels undergo upregulation in rodent models of nerve injury or inflammatory and neuropathic pain.\n\n【62】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【63】In addition, mutations in genes encoding these channels are associated with inherited pain disorders in humans. Gain-of-function mutations of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7 result in inherited erythromelalgia, an autosomal dominant disorder manifesting by extreme heat hyperalgesia.\n\n【64】Erythermalgia: molecular basis for an inherited pain syndrome.\n\n【65】Although clinical manifestations of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8 are less clearly defined, they have also been associated with the development of painful neuropathies and insensitivity to pain, respectively, in humans.\n\n【66】Pain as a channelopathy.\n\n【67】A variety of molecular entities have been tested in the preclinical setting that selectively inactivate Na <sub>v </sub> , including toxins isolated from tarantula venom or small-molecule compounds identified via target-directed screening.\n\n【68】Inhibitors of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7: patent applications since 2010.\n\n【69】Engineering potent and selective analogues of GpTx-1, a tarantula venom peptide antagonist of the Na(V)1.7 sodium channel.\n\n【70】Identification and characterization of proTx-III \\[μ-TRTX-Tp1a\\], a new voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor from venom of the tarantula thrixopelma pruriens.\n\n【71】Three peptide modulators of the human voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7, an important analgesic target, from the venom of an Australian tarantula.\n\n【72】Yet, despite an ongoing effort, none of these agents have been approved as a drug for use in humans.\n\n【73】### Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels\n\n【74】Similar to Na <sub>v </sub> , voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca <sub>v </sub> ) expressed in primary sensory neurons result in an increased firing frequency.\n\n【75】Voltage-gated calcium channels as targets for the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【76】At the level of the spinal cord, the upregulation of Ca <sub>v </sub> secondary to nerve injury has been described in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【77】The physiology, pathology, and pharmacology of voltage-gated calcium channels and their future therapeutic potential.\n\n【78】Specifically, Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 seems to play a critical role in neuropathic pain. Inactivation of this channel by channel-binding peptide 3 inhibits trafficking of Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 to the cytoplasmic membrane and, thereby, diminishes membrane excitability of nociceptive neurons, resulting in attenuation of nocifensive behavior in rodent models.\n\n【79】Suppression of inflammatory and neuropathic pain by uncoupling CRMP-2 from the presynaptic Ca  channel complex.\n\n【80】Gabapentinoids are the only class of systemic analgesic drugs that may exert their therapeutic effect through interacting with Ca <sub>v </sub> . Gabapentinoids were initially conceived as orally available analogues of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, for the treatment of seizure disorders.\n\n【81】Calcium channel a2–d ligands: gabapentin and pregabalin.\n\n【82】Although the antiepileptic efficacy of gabapentinoids did not hold up to the initial promise, they have been found to be efficacious for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【83】Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults.\n\n【84】Neuropathic pain: principles of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【85】Although the mechanism of action of gabapentinoids has not been fully elucidated, they have been found to bind to the α2δ-1 subunit of the Ca <sub>v </sub> , and it is, therefore, thought that they may, at least in part, exert analgesia through inhibition of Ca <sub>v </sub> .\n\n【86】Implications and mechanism of action of gabapentin in neuropathic pain.\n\n【87】A search for selective and potent Ca <sub>v </sub> antagonists identified ω-conotoxin MVIIA, a neurotoxic peptide isolated in the 1980s from the venom of marine snails belonging to the genus _Conus_ .\n\n【88】Neuronal calcium channel antagonists: discrimination between calcium channel subtypes using omega-conotoxin from _Conus magus_ venom.\n\n【89】Peptide neurotoxins from fish-hunting cone snails.\n\n【90】ω-Conotoxin MVIIA selectively blocks N-type Ca <sub>v </sub> present in nociceptive fibers. Despite efforts over 2 decades, a search for a drug with the mechanism of action analogous to ω-conotoxin MVIIA that would be efficacious and nontoxic after systemic administration has failed. Only in 2004, ziconotide, a ω-conotoxin MVIIA derivative, was approved for localized intrathecal (IT) delivery in patients with severe, otherwise intractable pain.\n\n【91】Intrathecal ziconotide: a review of its use in patients with chronic pain refractory to other systemic or intrathecal analgesics.\n\n【92】### Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels\n\n【93】Voltage-gated potassium channels (K <sub>v </sub> ) are also critical determinants of the firing frequency, and their downregulation results in membrane hyperexcitability.\n\n【94】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【95】Distinct potassium channels on pain-sensing neurons.\n\n【96】Although several potassium channels are expressed by primary nociceptive fibers, K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 has been most thoroughly studied in association with chronic pain and has been found to be markedly downregulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in the setting of nerve injury and neuropathic pain.\n\n【97】A long noncoding RNA contributes to neuropathic pain by silencing Kcna2 in primary afferent neurons.\n\n【98】Yet, no analgesic drugs that modulate nociceptive signaling through K <sub>v </sub> are clinically available.\n\n【99】### Ligand-Gated Cation Channels\n\n【100】Ligand-gated ion channels are an attractive target for drug development because their endogenous ligands can serve as a molecular pattern for discovery of compounds with analogous pharmacodynamics but therapeutically more favorable pharmacokinetics. The _N_ \\-methyl- d \\-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor mediates long-term potentiation, which has been found to play a key role in the development of chronic pain.\n\n【101】NMDA receptors and memory encoding.\n\n【102】Long-term potentiation at spinal C-fiber synapses: a target for pathological pain.\n\n【103】The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, a dissociative general anesthetic agent, is used in certain subgroups of chronic pain, but data on its efficacy are inconclusive.\n\n【104】Wherefore ketamine?\n\n【105】Effects of low-dose intranasal (S)-ketamine in patients with neuropathic pain.\n\n【106】Ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for cancer pain.\n\n【107】Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of subcutaneous ketamine in the management of cancer pain.\n\n【108】Ketamine as adjuvant analgesic to opioids: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review.\n\n【109】Despite an ongoing research effort, no clinically available NMDA antagonist more specific to nociception has been found.\n\n【110】Transient receptor potential channels (TRP) constitute another family of ligand-gated cation channels. Several TRP are expressed by the primary sensory neurons and are typically activated by noxious stimuli.\n\n【111】TRP channels and pain.\n\n【112】TRP, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) is a particularly attractive target for drug development because it is almost exclusively expressed by primary nociceptive neurons and its inactivation results in loss of pain and heat sensation while other sensory modalities remain intact.\n\n【113】The cloned capsaicin receptor integrates multiple pain-producing stimuli.\n\n【114】The capsaicin receptor: a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway.\n\n【115】Capsaicin, the pungent substance in chili peppers, is the only analgesic agent acting through TRPV1 clinically available to date and is used in the form of a patch to treat locoregional pain.\n\n【116】Topical capsaicin formulations in the management of neuropathic pain.\n\n【117】Capsaicin is a reversible TRPV1 agonist and is thought to induce analgesia by desensitizing TRPV1+ nerve fibers.\n\n【118】Capsaicin-based therapies for pain control.\n\n【119】A more intuitive approach to using the TRPV1 pathway is the use of TRPV1 receptor antagonists. Although a variety of TRPV1 antagonists have been tested in preclinical models, none have been successfully translated to the clinical setting owing to their off-target adverse effects, which included hyperthermia and impaired noxious heat sensation, after systemic delivery.\n\n【120】Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 antagonists: a patent review (2011-2014).\n\n【121】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【122】Glial cells have been reported to initiate and maintain neurogenic inflammation in the setting of chronic neuropathic pain, resulting in increased neuronal excitability.\n\n【123】Importance of glial activation in neuropathic pain.\n\n【124】The effect of glia on the primary sensory neurons may be mediated by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1β, and various chemokines.\n\n【125】Spinal interleukin-10 therapy to treat peripheral neuropathic pain.\n\n【126】The proinflammatory and pronociceptive effect of these cytokines is countered by anti-inflammatory cytokines. The principal anti-inflammatory cytokine is interleukin 10 (IL-10). Therefore, IL-10 is an attractive agent to treat neuropathic pain, which is known to be relatively refractory to opioid analgesics.\n\n【127】The IT administration of recombinant IL-10 has, indeed, been found to reduce neuroinflammation and allodynia in animal models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【128】Snake venom phospholipase A2s (Asp49 and Lys49) induce mechanical allodynia upon peri-sciatic administration: involvement of spinal cord glia, proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide.\n\n【129】Cytokine involvement in dynorphin-induced allodynia.\n\n【130】However, direct delivery of the recombinant IL-10 was found not to be feasible for clinical translation because of its high cost, its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and its half-life of only 2 hours in the cerebrospinal fluid after IT delivery.\n\n【131】Interleukin-10 as a CNS therapeutic: the obstacle of the blood-brain/blood-spinal cord barrier.\n\n【132】Controlling pathological pain by adenovirally driven spinal production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【133】### Pain-Modulating Neurotransmitters\n\n【134】Development and maintenance of chronic pain states is associated with alteration of the neurotransmitter milieu in the CNS.\n\n【135】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【136】The neuroinhibitory transmitter GABA is known to inhibit neuropathic pain signaling on the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【137】Partial peripheral nerve injury promotes a selective loss of GABAergic inhibition in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【138】Although 2 classes of GABAergic drugs—baclofen and benzodiazepines—are used in clinical practice in select patients, their effect is not selective to the nociceptive pathways, resulting in a very low therapeutic index in the context of pain management.\n\n【139】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【140】Despite substantial effort, novel and more selective analgesic agents using the GABAergic pathway are not clinically available.\n\n【141】Another neurotransmitter involved in pain signaling is substance P. Substance P is produced by neurons throughout the peripheral nervous system and CNS, and it exerts its effect by activating neurokinin type 1 (NK <sub>1 </sub> ) receptor.\n\n【142】Neurobiology of substance P and the NK1 receptor.\n\n【143】Studies using NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor knockout mice and NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists in rodents suggested that blocking substance P signaling would result in profound analgesia, thereby generating widespread enthusiasm regarding clinical translation.\n\n【144】The substance P receptor antagonist CP-99,994 reduces acute postoperative pain.\n\n【145】The NK1 receptor is essential for the full expression of noxious inhibitory controls in the mouse.\n\n【146】However, clinical studies of several NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists given by the systemic route reported an almost complete lack of analgesic efficacy in humans.\n\n【147】Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists: a comprehensive patent survey.\n\n【148】The failure of NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists may have been considered a breaking point in analgesic drug discovery and development as it brought the realization that there may be no magic bullet consisting of a chemical compound targeting a single nociceptive mechanism with a degree of nociceptive specificity that could rival (or exceed) the analgesic activity of opioids.\n\n【149】Locoregional Analgesics: An Alternative Approach to Drug Development\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【150】### Clinical Interventional Pain Procedures for Locoregional Pain Syndromes\n\n【151】Interventional drug delivery for locoregional chronic pain is one of the most common procedures performed in clinical practice.\n\n【152】The role of invasive pain management modalities in the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【153】Multiple techniques that target various pain generators under imaging guidance are used.\n\n【154】Interventional approaches to pain management.\n\n【155】The most frequent targets for interventional drug delivery are the spinal nerves, which are accessed either IT or via the epidural (ED) route under fluoroscopic guidance. More than 2.5 million ED injections were performed in 2013 in the United States.\n\n【156】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, _Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting_ , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.\n\n【157】Although all these procedures are remarkably safe, their efficacy has recently come under scrutiny.\n\n【158】Pain Management Injection Therapies for Low Back Pain.\n\n【159】Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , Rockville, MD 2015\n\n【160】For the ED injection, there is evidence of moderate efficacy for some pain syndromes, such as lumbar radiculitis, but no evidence of efficacy in others, such as spinal stenosis (neurogenic intermittent claudication).\n\n【161】A randomized trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis.\n\n【162】The chief reason for the limited efficacy of interventional procedures for chronic pain is the small repertoire of analgesic agents available for these routes of delivery. For IT delivery, the available drugs are limited to opioids, benzodiazepines, baclofen, ziconotide, local anesthetics, and ketamine.\n\n【163】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【164】For ED delivery, local anesthetics and corticosteroids constitute the only agents available to date. The pharmacologic effect of these agents is relatively nonspecific, and its duration is only transient in most patients, requiring either implantation of a pump for the IT route or repeated interventions for the ED route; on average patients receive 2 to 3 injections of ED corticosteroids per year.\n\n【165】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, _Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting_ , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.\n\n【166】Although the discovery of novel analgesic agents specifically designed for anatomically selective routes of delivery, such as ED, is a major unmet clinical need, this area has not been appreciably explored by the pharmaceutical industry and research laboratories. The search for novel molecular targets has focused on systemically administered drugs, whereas drug development for localized delivery mainly involved optimizing the formulation of already available agents for ED delivery, such as depot liposomal forms of corticosteroids extending their biological half-life (currently in the phase of preclinical development).\n\n【167】A lipid based depot (DepoFoam technology) for sustained release drug delivery.\n\n【168】It is notable that although the field of CDD focused on systemic analgesic drugs, the major truly innovative agent recently approved for the treatment of chronic pain, ziconotide, is a locally delivered (IT) agent.\n\n【169】### Requirements for a New Generation of Analgesic Drugs for Interventional Delivery\n\n【170】A desirable agent for localized, interventional delivery would ideally meet 2 requirements that differ from systemic drugs developed via CCD: (1) prolonged or even permanent activity after a single administration and (2) ability to penetrate the target tissue locally without a need for sufficient bioavailability after systemic administration and for lack of off-target toxicity. Although the first requirement raises a conceptual bar that the candidate interventional agents need to reach compared with most systemic drugs currently under development via CDD, the second requirement lowers this bar substantially. The combination of these 2 requirements, ie, the need for long-term effect after a single administration and lessened concern for off-target distribution and toxicity, seems to be uniquely suited for an emerging drug discovery and disease treatment paradigm: gene therapy.\n\n【171】Gene Therapy\n------------\n\n【172】### Beyond Hereditary Disorders\n\n【173】Gene therapy was initially developed to correct dysfunctional genes in rare monogenic disorders, such as inborn errors of metabolism or blood clotting disorders.\n\n【174】History of gene therapy.\n\n【175】However, the greatest potential impact of gene therapy may lie in the treatment of common, acquired disorders.\n\n【176】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【177】Cardioprotection by gene therapy: a review paper on behalf of the Working Group on Drug Cardiotoxicity and Cardioprotection of the Italian Society of Cardiology.\n\n【178】The field of gene therapy reached critical benchmarks during the past several years.\n\n【179】Gene therapy clinical trials worldwide to 2012: an update.\n\n【180】Gene therapy returns to centre stage.\n\n【181】In 2012, alipogene tiparvovec became the first gene therapy product to be commercially approved in Europe (for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency).\n\n【182】Endgame: glybera finally recommended for approval as the first gene therapy drug in the European Union.\n\n【183】In 2015, talimogene laherparepvec was the first gene vector brought to market in the United States (for the treatment of inoperable malignant melanoma and head and neck cancer).\n\n【184】Talimogene laherparepvec: first global approval.\n\n【185】Talimogene laherparepvec improves durable response rate in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n【186】### Gene Vectors: A Distinct Class of Therapeutic Agents\n\n【187】In gene therapy, a vector serves as an intracellular delivery mechanism for the instruction set provided by the therapeutic gene (transgene) to the targeted cells.\n\n【188】Gene therapy—basic principles and the road from bench to bedside.\n\n【189】in: Gad S.C. Rubany G.M. Pharmaceutical Sciences Encyclopedia. John Wiley & Sons Inc , Hoboken, NJ 2010\n\n【190】The encoded proteins or peptides are expressed by the target cells, thereby harnessing their machinery to produce the therapeutic substance locally. Vectors are the most commonly genetically engineered viruses whose ability to replicate is artificially disrupted and part or all of their genome is replaced by a transgene of choice.\n\n【191】Viral vectors for gene therapy: the art of turning infectious agents into vehicles of therapeutics.\n\n【192】Unique from other drug constructs, the viral vector–transgene package is modular. The surface characteristics of the viral shell (capsid serotype) will determine its tissue selectivity (tropism), and this can be varied independently of the carried transgene. This provides great flexibility in testing large numbers of potential transgene products directed at varying molecular targets. This approach also enables overexpressing, silencing, or de novo expressing of virtually any gene, thereby affecting any signaling pathway. A further variable that can be introduced is selective anatomic delivery, which may augment or overcome the challenges of insufficient tissue tropism.\n\n【193】### Primary Sensory Neurons as the Target of Gene Therapy for Pain\n\n【194】The primary sensory neurons, as the point of aggregation of nociceptive signaling from the periphery, are a rational target of gene therapy.\n\n【195】Nociceptors: the sensors of the pain pathway.\n\n【196】These neurons reside in the DRG, a structure that is anatomically accessible, obviating the risk of CNS instrumentation. There are also appropriate small-animal models of DRG access and peripheral nociceptive testing.\n\n【197】Tests and models of nociception and pain in rodents.\n\n【198】Targeted delivery of pharmacological agents into rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【199】These characteristics have focused attention on DRG neurons as the primary target for modulation of nociception. Gene therapy may be directed to DRG neurons either by transducing them directly or by transducing anatomically or functionally related structures, such as the glia or the meninges, whereby nociception is indirectly modulated by their interaction with DRG neurons.\n\n【200】### Targeting the Primary Sensory Neurons by Gene Vectors\n\n【201】To attain gene transfer to the primary sensory neurons, several routes of vector delivery have been explored. First, replication-incompetent herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors delivered by skin inoculation were pioneered by Fink, Glorioso, and others.\n\n【202】Deletion of multiple immediate-early genes from herpes simplex virus reduces cytotoxicity and permits long-term gene expression in neurons.\n\n【203】Engineering herpes simplex virus vectors for CNS applications.\n\n【204】This approach takes advantage of the inherent ability of this virus to undergo retrograde axonal transport from the sensory nerve terminal to the cell body and, thereby, to transduce DRG neurons whose dendrites originate in the injected sensory field of the skin. Although this selectivity makes HSV attractive for gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system, it also restricts its utility for other gene therapy applications; the overall translational experience with this vector remains, therefore, relatively limited.\n\n【205】Second, IT injection of several serotypes of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors was found to selectively transduce the primary sensory neurons.\n\n【206】AAV8(gfp) preferentially targets large diameter dorsal root ganglion neurones after both intra-dorsal root ganglion and intrathecal injection.\n\n【207】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【208】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【209】Recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (rAAV2/6)-mediated gene transfer to nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery.\n\n【210】Differential adeno-associated virus mediated gene transfer to sensory neurons following intrathecal delivery by direct lumbar puncture.\n\n【211】Adeno-associated virus is the leading vector type across many gene therapy fields because it is not associated with any disease in any species, is devoid of any viral genes, and yields stable gene expression for months to years.\n\n【212】Adeno-associated virus: from defective virus to effective vector.\n\n【213】The initial safety concerns regarding AAV vectors, which included insertional mutagenesis, germline transmission, replication escape, and dissemination of the vector to the public domain, have been thoroughly addressed in the field and do not seem to be applicable in the context of human trials, as previously reviewed in detail elsewhere.\n\n【214】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【215】Furthermore, the difficulties with large-scale manufacturing of AAV vectors, which were holding back the clinical translation of AAV-based gene therapy, have recently been overcome.\n\n【216】Large-scale recombinant adeno-associated virus production.\n\n【217】A relative restriction associated with AAV is the need to switch capsids if serial treatments are needed because serologic immunity renders the readministration of a vector with the same serotypes ineffective.\n\n【218】Immune responses to AAV vectors: overcoming barriers to successful gene therapy.\n\n【219】In addition to AAV, IT delivery of other vector types, such lentiviruses or AAV plasmid DNA, was also tested for gene therapy for pain. Although efficacious in certain therapeutic strategies, these vectors did not transduce the primary sensory neurons but rather glial cells or the meninges.\n\n【220】Gene therapy for the treatment of chronic peripheral nervous system pain.\n\n【221】Third, to further improve the efficiency of gene transfer, several groups have targeted the nociceptive neurons directly by intraganglionic injection of AAV in rodents.\n\n【222】Intraganglionic AAV6 results in efficient and long-term gene transfer to peripheral sensory nervous system in adult rats.\n\n【223】Comparison of AAV serotypes for gene delivery to dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【224】Direct injection into the dorsal root ganglion: technical, behavioral, and histological observations.\n\n【225】Although this approach led to highly efficacious and selective gene transfer to the DRGs in a rodent model, an open surgical procedure consisting of paravertebral exposure and foraminotomy was required.\n\n【226】Molecular Targets of Gene Therapy for Pain\n------------------------------------------\n\n【227】The molecular selectivity of gene therapy has been of great interest because it enables utilization of antinociceptive mechanisms that have not been accessible by conventional agents. A variety of approaches have been found to be efficacious in animal models of chronic pain. Important examples of the molecular targets used to date by gene therapy for pain are (1) spinal opioid delivery, (2) anti-inflammatory cytokines, and (3) ion channels and neurotrophic growth factor.\n\n【228】### Spinal Opioid Delivery\n\n【229】The opioid system is an attractive target for gene therapy because of the robust clinical experience with exogenous opioids. Although opioids modulate pain processing at multiple levels of the nervous system, delivery of exogenous opioids to the spinal IT space is sufficient to achieve analgesia.\n\n【230】Intrathecal opioids for intractable pain syndromes.\n\n【231】Gene transfer of opioid genes selectively to DRG neurons has been found to reduce chronic pain in animal models of locoregional pain (as reviewed next). This approach may eliminate the toxicity of exogenously administered opioids, which is attributed to their extraspinal effects in the CNS and in peripheral tissues.\n\n【232】Side effects of intrathecal and epidural opioids.\n\n【233】Long-term opioid management for chronic noncancer pain.\n\n【234】A systematic review of the use of opioid medication for those with moderate to severe cancer pain and renal impairment: a European Palliative Care Research Collaborative opioid guidelines project.\n\n【235】A review of potential adverse effects of long-term opioid therapy: a practitioner's guide.\n\n【236】The prevalence, severity, and impact of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: results of a US and European Patient Survey (PROBE 1).\n\n【237】The effects of opioids and opioid analogs on animal and human endocrine systems.\n\n【238】Coronary heart disease outcomes among chronic opioid and cyclooxygenase-2 users compared with a general population cohort.\n\n【239】Opioids and immune modulation: more questions than answers.\n\n【240】Two principal strategies using opioid signaling for analgesia by gene therapy have been described. First, several groups have used transgenes encoding endogenous opioid agonists delivered to the DRGs. Goss et al\n\n【241】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【242】used preproenkephalin, a δ-opioid receptor agonist, and endomorphine-2, a μ-opioid receptor agonist, delivered by HSV vectors. We used AAV to deliver prepro-ß-endorphin, an artificial opioid precursor of the μ-opioid agonist peptide ß-endorphin that is engineered to be secreted in a stimulus-independent manner via the constitutive secretory pathway.\n\n【243】Retrovirus-mediated expression of an artificial beta-endorphin precursor in primary fibroblasts.\n\n【244】Administration of these therapeutic genes resulted in robust reduction of allodynia or hyperalgesia in multiple rodent models of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain.\n\n【245】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【246】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【247】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【248】Herpes vector-mediated expression of proenkephalin reduces bone cancer pain.\n\n【249】The second strategy to harness the opioid system for gene therapy of pain consists of transferring genes that encode an opioid receptor. Xu et al\n\n【250】Adeno-associated viral transfer of opioid receptor gene to primary sensory neurons: a strategy to increase opioid antinociception.\n\n【251】Efficiencies of transgene expression in nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors.\n\n【252】reported this approach several years ago, but no recent follow-up studies seem to have been attempted. Another approach testing an opioid receptor mutant was reported more recently.\n\n【253】Intrathecal delivery of a mutant micro-opioid receptor activated by naloxone as a possible antinociceptive paradigm.\n\n【254】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【255】Gene transfer of IL-10 by several vector systems, including HSV and AAV, has been extensively tested in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【256】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【257】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【258】Controlling neuropathic pain by adeno-associated virus driven production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【259】HSV-mediated transfer of interleukin-10 reduces inflammatory pain through modulation of membrane tumor necrosis factor α in spinal cord microglia.\n\n【260】Production of IL-10 resulted in marked reduction of allodynia and hyperalgesia, a finding verified independently by multiple groups. In addition to IL-10, a tumor necrosis factor–soluble receptor delivered via HSV-mediated gene transfer reduced allodynia in a rodent model of varicella zoster virus–induced pain.\n\n【261】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【262】### Ion Channels\n\n【263】Discovery of the voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels that are specific to nociception and the failure to generate corresponding conventional analgesic drugs has prompted an effort to use these targets via gene therapy. Two approaches have been used: (1) overexpression of ion channels responsible for membrane hyperpolarization by delivering vectors that carry the gene encoding for the respective channel and (2) downregulation of ion channels responsible for membrane depolarization by RNA interference, ie, by delivering vectors encoding small interfering RNA or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) complementary to the sequence of the respective ion channel, or by gene transfer of genes whose products deactivate these channels.\n\n【264】In the first approach, AAV-mediated gene transfer of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 in a rat model of neuropathic pain resulted in normalization of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 expression that had been downregulated in the context of nerve injury. This was associated with a decrease in allodynia in the treated animals.\n\n【265】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【266】Similarly, overexpression of the glycine receptor (a ligand-gated chloride channel) in the sensory fibers mediated by HSV resulted in attenuation of hyperalgesia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【267】HSV delivery of a ligand-regulated endogenous ion channel gene to sensory neurons results in pain control following channel activation.\n\n【268】In the second approach, Samad et al\n\n【269】Virus-mediated shRNA knockdown of Na(v)1.3 in rat dorsal root ganglion attenuates nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.\n\n【270】found that knockout of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 by shRNA encoded by an AAV vector delivered into the DRGs attenuated allodynia in the experimental animals. Similarly, knockout of the NR subunit of the NMDA receptor in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord via AAV-mediated transfer of the respective small interfering RNA reduced spinal NMDA currents as well as nociceptive behavior in a model of chronic inflammatory pain.\n\n【271】siRNA-mediated knockdown of the NR1 subunit gene of the NMDA receptor attenuates formalin-induced pain behaviors in adult rats.\n\n【272】A conditional deletion of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in adult spinal cord dorsal horn reduces NMDA currents and injury-induced pain.\n\n【273】Downregulation of the TRPV1 signaling via gene transfer of either shRNA delivered by IT AAV or the dominant negative (poreless) form of the protein delivered by HSV has been found to reduce allodynia in rat models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【274】Intrathecal AAV serotype 9-mediated delivery of shRNA against TRPV1 attenuates thermal hyperalgesia in a mouse model of peripheral nerve injury.\n\n【275】Herpes simplex virus vector-mediated gene delivery of poreless TRPV1 channels reduces bladder overactivity and nociception in rats.\n\n【276】An HSV vector system for selection of ligand-gated ion channel modulators.\n\n【277】Fischer et al\n\n【278】Sustained relief of neuropathic pain by AAV-targeted expression of CBD3 peptide in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【279】downregulated Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 by AAV-mediated gene transfer of Ca  channel-binding peptide 3, also resulting in attenuation of neuropathic pain in the rat model. Ma et al\n\n【280】Expression of inwardly rectifying potassium channels by an inducible adenoviral vector reduced the neuronal hyperexcitability and hyperalgesia produced by chronic compression of the spinal ganglion.\n\n【281】found that overexpression of Kir2.1, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, delivered by an adenoviral vector into the DRGs suppresses neuronal excitability and prevents the development of hyperalgesia in rodents.\n\n【282】### Neurotransmitters and Growth Factors\n\n【283】Delivery of AAV or HSV vectors encoding several isoforms of the GABA gene showed reduction of allodynia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【284】Constitutive GABA expression via a recombinant adeno-associated virus consistently attenuates neuropathic pain.\n\n【285】Vector-mediated release of GABA attenuates pain-related behaviors and reduces Na(V)1.7 in DRG neurons.\n\n【286】The AAV- or HSV-mediated gene transfer of several neurotrophic growth factors has been investigated as a novel approach to treat chronic pain by reversing the synaptic remodeling described in chronic pain states. This approach could be tested only by gene therapy because conventional pharmacotherapy could not attain target-specific, long-term delivery of an active agent. Several neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, erythropoietin, glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, were found to reduce pain behavior in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【287】Amelioration of chronic neuropathic pain after partial nerve injury by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated over-expression of BDNF in the rat spinal cord.\n\n【288】Neuroprotective effect of herpes simplex virus-mediated gene transfer of erythropoietin in hyperglycemic dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【289】HSV-mediated gene transfer of the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor provides an antiallodynic effect on neuropathic pain.\n\n【290】Long-term neuroprotection achieved with latency-associated promoter-driven herpes simplex virus gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system.\n\n【291】### Gene Editing\n\n【292】Gene editing is a technique for highly targeted deletion, insertion, or substitution of a desired sequence of a genome.\n\n【293】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【294】Although multiple gene editing techniques have been described, the field underwent a breakthrough in 2012 when Barrangou, Doudna, Jinek, and others described the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in conjunction with CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9).\n\n【295】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【296】Genome-scale engineering for systems and synthetic biology.\n\n【297】A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.\n\n【298】The CRISPR craze.\n\n【299】CRISPR/Cas9 allows precise and cost-effective gene editing in vivo, and is poised to revolutionize gene therapy. It seems conceivable that in vivo gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 delivered by gene vector may give rise to a whole new field of pain therapy.\n\n【300】### Chemogenetics and Optogenetics\n\n【301】Chemogenetics and optogenetics represent 2 emerging approaches to selectively and, unlike traditional gene therapy, reversibly manipulate cell phenotypes via gene transfer.\n\n【302】Therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain: potential application of pharmacosynthetics and optogenetics.\n\n【303】Chemogenetics is based on designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). The DREADDs are G protein–coupled receptors artificially engineered to respond to nanomolar concentrations of otherwise biologically inert ligands, such as clozapine-N-oxide.\n\n【304】Controlling signaling with a specifically designed Gi-coupled receptor.\n\n【305】Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.\n\n【306】Preliminary studies in rodents suggest that selective expression of DREADDs in nociceptive neurons via gene transfer might allow efficient and highly precise exogenous control of nociceptive signaling.\n\n【307】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【308】Mu opioid receptor modulation of dopamine neurons in the periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe: a role in regulation of pain.\n\n【309】(457) Gi-DREADD expression in TRPV1-Cre mice produces ligand-dependent behavioral inhibition to noxious heat, but ligand-independent changes in sensory neurons.\n\n【310】Analogously, optogenetics enables tunable manipulation of cell phenotypes using light.\n\n【311】Orderly recruitment of motor units under optical control in vivo.\n\n【312】Iyer et al\n\n【313】Virally mediated optogenetic excitation and inhibition of pain in freely moving nontransgenic mice.\n\n【314】found that AAV-mediated gene transfer of eNpHR3.0, a chloride channel activated by yellow light, to the DRG sensory neurons results in reduction of allodynia in rodent models that is tunable by illumination by light of the respective wavelength.\n\n【315】### Pathways to Clinical Translation\n\n【316】Herpes simplex virus encoding preproenkephalin, administered as a series of intradermal injections for intractable locoregional pain caused by cancer, is the only vector so far tested in humans in the context of gene therapy for pain.\n\n【317】Gene therapy for pain: results of a phase I clinical trial.\n\n【318】A phase 1 clinical trial reported safety of the treatment, but the lack of a blinded control group, a design typical of a phase 1 trial, did not allow any conclusions regarding efficacy. A subsequent blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial was initiated in 2011 and completed in November 2013 (according to ClinicalTrials.gov ).\n\n【319】Of note, HSV was translated from rodent studies directly into clinical trials without testing the approach in a large-animal model as an intermediate step. Should the clinical trial fail to find analgesic efficacy, it may be difficult to discern whether the HSV gene transfer technology or the therapeutic gene was the cause of failure. In such a situation, only large-animal studies may be able to further the understanding.\n\n【320】Adeno-associated virus–based gene therapy has not been tested in patients with chronic pain but in numerous other clinical settings, including phase 1, 2, and 3 trials for a large variety of neurologic and nonneurologic therapeutic applications.\n\n【321】In the field of AAV for pain, we translated the approach into large-animal models, first reporting differences in gene transfer outcomes compared with rodents when the IT route was tested.\n\n【322】High cerebrospinal fluid levels of interleukin-10 attained by AAV in dogs.\n\n【323】Subsequently, we developed a method of locoregional delivery of AAV to DRG neurons in a large-animal (swine) model using computed tomography fluoroscopy.\n\n【324】Minimally invasive convection-enhanced delivery of biologics into dorsal root ganglia: validation in the pig model and prospective modeling in humans.\n\n【325】This study recreated the gene transfer outcomes of the original rodent studies of intraganglionic AAV delivery while introducing an image-guided intervention technique and thereby obviating the need for open surgical exposure of the DRG that was used in rodents. Examination of the comparative anatomy of porcine and human spines indicates that similar, minimally invasive intraganglionic injection could also be performed in the clinical setting.\n\n【326】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【327】Interventional pain specialists have a unique skill set to translate gene therapy–based treatment approaches into novel clinical treatments for locoregional pain. Future clinical progress may be driven not only by the rapid advances in gene vector design and clinical availability but also by advances in interventional delivery techniques. Image guidance available for clinical use to date can provide anatomic selectivity for gene vector delivery to select DRGs. Combining the molecular selectivity of gene vectors with the anatomic selectivity of image-guided delivery may spur a new era of interventions for pain using a dual selective approach to analgesic treatment, thereby offering novel treatment options for patients with hitherto intractable locoregional pain.", "index": 5374, "show": true, "start": 5361, "end": 5415, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【24】The National Academies Press , Washington, DC 2011", "content": "【0】Future Directions in Pain Management\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【1】Treatment for chronic, locoregional pain ranks among the most prevalent unmet medical needs. The failure of systemic analgesic drugs, such as opioids, is often due to their off-target toxicity, development of tolerance, and abuse potential. Interventional pain procedures provide target specificity but lack pharmacologically selective agents with long-term efficacy. Gene therapy vectors are a new tool for the development of molecularly selective pain therapies, which have already been proved to provide durable analgesia in preclinical models. Taken together, advances in image-guided delivery and gene therapy may lead to a new class of dual selective analgesic treatments integrating the molecular selectivity of analgesic genes with the anatomic selectivity of interventional delivery techniques.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AAV ( adeno-associated virus ), Cav ( voltage-gated calcium channel ), CCD ( conventional drug discovery ), CNS ( central nervous system ), CRISPR/Cas9 ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 ), DRG ( dorsal root ganglion ), DREADD ( designer receptors activated by designer drugs ), ED ( epidural ), GABA ( γ-aminobutyric acid ), HSV ( herpes simplex virus ), IL-10 ( interleukin 10 ), IT ( intrathecal ), Kv ( voltage-gated potassium channel ), Nav ( voltage-gated sodium channel ), NK1 ( neurokinin type 1 ), NMDA ( N-methyl-d-aspartate ), shRNA ( small hairpin RNA ), TRP ( transient receptor potential channel ), TRPV1 ( transient receptor potential channel, subfamily V, member 1 )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .™\n\n【9】Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【10】**MOC Credit Statement:** Successful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1 MOC points in the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program.

Specifically, the 2 most prevalent causes of chronic pain in the population were low back pain and knee pain, as documented by a survey performed by the National Center for Health Statistics, whereby 28.1% of adult Americans reported low back pain and 19.5% localized knee pain during the past 3 months.\n\n【23】Institute of Medicine  \nRelieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research.\n\n【24】The National Academies Press , Washington, DC 2011\n\n【25】Locoregional pain is also responsible for a substantial portion of the financial burden of chronic pain.

Important examples include ion channels expressed by primary sensory neurons, cytokines that play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, and several inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters that modulate nociceptive signaling.\n\n【46】Characterization of these nociceptive mechanisms led to a search for a new generation of analgesic drugs using the techniques of conventional drug discovery (CDD); CDD, ie, the search for new small-molecule therapeutic entities, largely relies on empirical screening of candidate compounds. Two approaches are used by the pharmaceutical industry and academic laboratories involved in CDD. First, phenotype-directed screening seeks to identify chemical entities that have a desirable effect on the phenotype of a disease model without previous knowledge of their molecular mechanism of action.\n\n【47】Phenotypic screening in cancer drug discovery: past, present and future.\n\n【48】Various assays modeling the disease phenotype on the level of a cell or an organism have been described.\n\n【49】Modern phenotypic drug discovery is a viable, neoclassic pharma strategy.\n\n【50】Efficacious compounds are then examined for molecular mechanism of action using reverse biology techniques. Second, target-directed screening relies on biochemical knowledge of specific molecular targets and uses small-molecule screening strategies, typically by examining large libraries of compounds.\n\n【51】Discovery of small molecule cancer drugs: successes, challenges and opportunities.\n\n【52】The actual biologic effect of thus discovered compounds is then tested in vivo in disease models. Although there has been a substantial effort to facilitate CDD by using high-throughput assays and by implementing genomic data, the discovery of new small-molecule drugs is declining in all medical fields. In fact, pharmaceutical industry data show that the number of truly innovative drugs (defined as new molecular entities) approved by the major regulatory bodies (such as the US Food and Drug Administration) has been decreasing by 50% every 5 years worldwide.\n\n【53】How to improve R&D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge.\n\n【54】PAREXEL Biopharmaceutical Statistical Sourcebook 2014/2015.\n\n【55】Parexel Intl Corp , Waltham, MA 2014\n\n【56】How were new medicines discovered?\n\n【57】Although multiple candidate analgesic agents that had been identified through CDD were tested in preclinical models, the success regarding clinical translation has been very limited, as reviewed next.\n\n【58】### Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels\n\n【59】Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na <sub>v </sub> ) are responsible for the formation of action potentials in all excitatory cells. Several Na <sub>v </sub> subtypes are expressed by primary sensory neurons but not by other excitatory cells, such as neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) or myocytes.\n\n【60】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【61】Specifically, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8, and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.9 have been found to be involved in nociception. All of these channels undergo upregulation in rodent models of nerve injury or inflammatory and neuropathic pain.\n\n【62】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【63】In addition, mutations in genes encoding these channels are associated with inherited pain disorders in humans. Gain-of-function mutations of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7 result in inherited erythromelalgia, an autosomal dominant disorder manifesting by extreme heat hyperalgesia.\n\n【64】Erythermalgia: molecular basis for an inherited pain syndrome.\n\n【65】Although clinical manifestations of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8 are less clearly defined, they have also been associated with the development of painful neuropathies and insensitivity to pain, respectively, in humans.\n\n【66】Pain as a channelopathy.\n\n【67】A variety of molecular entities have been tested in the preclinical setting that selectively inactivate Na <sub>v </sub> , including toxins isolated from tarantula venom or small-molecule compounds identified via target-directed screening.\n\n【68】Inhibitors of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7: patent applications since 2010.\n\n【69】Engineering potent and selective analogues of GpTx-1, a tarantula venom peptide antagonist of the Na(V)1.7 sodium channel.\n\n【70】Identification and characterization of proTx-III \\[μ-TRTX-Tp1a\\], a new voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor from venom of the tarantula thrixopelma pruriens.\n\n【71】Three peptide modulators of the human voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7, an important analgesic target, from the venom of an Australian tarantula.\n\n【72】Yet, despite an ongoing effort, none of these agents have been approved as a drug for use in humans.\n\n【73】### Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels\n\n【74】Similar to Na <sub>v </sub> , voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca <sub>v </sub> ) expressed in primary sensory neurons result in an increased firing frequency.\n\n【75】Voltage-gated calcium channels as targets for the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【76】At the level of the spinal cord, the upregulation of Ca <sub>v </sub> secondary to nerve injury has been described in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【77】The physiology, pathology, and pharmacology of voltage-gated calcium channels and their future therapeutic potential.\n\n【78】Specifically, Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 seems to play a critical role in neuropathic pain. Inactivation of this channel by channel-binding peptide 3 inhibits trafficking of Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 to the cytoplasmic membrane and, thereby, diminishes membrane excitability of nociceptive neurons, resulting in attenuation of nocifensive behavior in rodent models.\n\n【79】Suppression of inflammatory and neuropathic pain by uncoupling CRMP-2 from the presynaptic Ca  channel complex.\n\n【80】Gabapentinoids are the only class of systemic analgesic drugs that may exert their therapeutic effect through interacting with Ca <sub>v </sub> . Gabapentinoids were initially conceived as orally available analogues of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, for the treatment of seizure disorders.\n\n【81】Calcium channel a2–d ligands: gabapentin and pregabalin.\n\n【82】Although the antiepileptic efficacy of gabapentinoids did not hold up to the initial promise, they have been found to be efficacious for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【83】Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults.\n\n【84】Neuropathic pain: principles of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【85】Although the mechanism of action of gabapentinoids has not been fully elucidated, they have been found to bind to the α2δ-1 subunit of the Ca <sub>v </sub> , and it is, therefore, thought that they may, at least in part, exert analgesia through inhibition of Ca <sub>v </sub> .\n\n【86】Implications and mechanism of action of gabapentin in neuropathic pain.\n\n【87】A search for selective and potent Ca <sub>v </sub> antagonists identified ω-conotoxin MVIIA, a neurotoxic peptide isolated in the 1980s from the venom of marine snails belonging to the genus _Conus_ .\n\n【88】Neuronal calcium channel antagonists: discrimination between calcium channel subtypes using omega-conotoxin from _Conus magus_ venom.\n\n【89】Peptide neurotoxins from fish-hunting cone snails.\n\n【90】ω-Conotoxin MVIIA selectively blocks N-type Ca <sub>v </sub> present in nociceptive fibers. Despite efforts over 2 decades, a search for a drug with the mechanism of action analogous to ω-conotoxin MVIIA that would be efficacious and nontoxic after systemic administration has failed. Only in 2004, ziconotide, a ω-conotoxin MVIIA derivative, was approved for localized intrathecal (IT) delivery in patients with severe, otherwise intractable pain.\n\n【91】Intrathecal ziconotide: a review of its use in patients with chronic pain refractory to other systemic or intrathecal analgesics.\n\n【92】### Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels\n\n【93】Voltage-gated potassium channels (K <sub>v </sub> ) are also critical determinants of the firing frequency, and their downregulation results in membrane hyperexcitability.\n\n【94】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【95】Distinct potassium channels on pain-sensing neurons.\n\n【96】Although several potassium channels are expressed by primary nociceptive fibers, K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 has been most thoroughly studied in association with chronic pain and has been found to be markedly downregulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in the setting of nerve injury and neuropathic pain.\n\n【97】A long noncoding RNA contributes to neuropathic pain by silencing Kcna2 in primary afferent neurons.\n\n【98】Yet, no analgesic drugs that modulate nociceptive signaling through K <sub>v </sub> are clinically available.\n\n【99】### Ligand-Gated Cation Channels\n\n【100】Ligand-gated ion channels are an attractive target for drug development because their endogenous ligands can serve as a molecular pattern for discovery of compounds with analogous pharmacodynamics but therapeutically more favorable pharmacokinetics. The _N_ \\-methyl- d \\-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor mediates long-term potentiation, which has been found to play a key role in the development of chronic pain.\n\n【101】NMDA receptors and memory encoding.\n\n【102】Long-term potentiation at spinal C-fiber synapses: a target for pathological pain.\n\n【103】The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, a dissociative general anesthetic agent, is used in certain subgroups of chronic pain, but data on its efficacy are inconclusive.\n\n【104】Wherefore ketamine?\n\n【105】Effects of low-dose intranasal (S)-ketamine in patients with neuropathic pain.\n\n【106】Ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for cancer pain.\n\n【107】Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of subcutaneous ketamine in the management of cancer pain.\n\n【108】Ketamine as adjuvant analgesic to opioids: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review.\n\n【109】Despite an ongoing research effort, no clinically available NMDA antagonist more specific to nociception has been found.\n\n【110】Transient receptor potential channels (TRP) constitute another family of ligand-gated cation channels. Several TRP are expressed by the primary sensory neurons and are typically activated by noxious stimuli.\n\n【111】TRP channels and pain.\n\n【112】TRP, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) is a particularly attractive target for drug development because it is almost exclusively expressed by primary nociceptive neurons and its inactivation results in loss of pain and heat sensation while other sensory modalities remain intact.\n\n【113】The cloned capsaicin receptor integrates multiple pain-producing stimuli.\n\n【114】The capsaicin receptor: a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway.\n\n【115】Capsaicin, the pungent substance in chili peppers, is the only analgesic agent acting through TRPV1 clinically available to date and is used in the form of a patch to treat locoregional pain.\n\n【116】Topical capsaicin formulations in the management of neuropathic pain.\n\n【117】Capsaicin is a reversible TRPV1 agonist and is thought to induce analgesia by desensitizing TRPV1+ nerve fibers.\n\n【118】Capsaicin-based therapies for pain control.\n\n【119】A more intuitive approach to using the TRPV1 pathway is the use of TRPV1 receptor antagonists. Although a variety of TRPV1 antagonists have been tested in preclinical models, none have been successfully translated to the clinical setting owing to their off-target adverse effects, which included hyperthermia and impaired noxious heat sensation, after systemic delivery.\n\n【120】Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 antagonists: a patent review (2011-2014).\n\n【121】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【122】Glial cells have been reported to initiate and maintain neurogenic inflammation in the setting of chronic neuropathic pain, resulting in increased neuronal excitability.\n\n【123】Importance of glial activation in neuropathic pain.\n\n【124】The effect of glia on the primary sensory neurons may be mediated by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1β, and various chemokines.\n\n【125】Spinal interleukin-10 therapy to treat peripheral neuropathic pain.\n\n【126】The proinflammatory and pronociceptive effect of these cytokines is countered by anti-inflammatory cytokines. The principal anti-inflammatory cytokine is interleukin 10 (IL-10). Therefore, IL-10 is an attractive agent to treat neuropathic pain, which is known to be relatively refractory to opioid analgesics.\n\n【127】The IT administration of recombinant IL-10 has, indeed, been found to reduce neuroinflammation and allodynia in animal models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【128】Snake venom phospholipase A2s (Asp49 and Lys49) induce mechanical allodynia upon peri-sciatic administration: involvement of spinal cord glia, proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide.\n\n【129】Cytokine involvement in dynorphin-induced allodynia.\n\n【130】However, direct delivery of the recombinant IL-10 was found not to be feasible for clinical translation because of its high cost, its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and its half-life of only 2 hours in the cerebrospinal fluid after IT delivery.\n\n【131】Interleukin-10 as a CNS therapeutic: the obstacle of the blood-brain/blood-spinal cord barrier.\n\n【132】Controlling pathological pain by adenovirally driven spinal production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【133】### Pain-Modulating Neurotransmitters\n\n【134】Development and maintenance of chronic pain states is associated with alteration of the neurotransmitter milieu in the CNS.\n\n【135】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【136】The neuroinhibitory transmitter GABA is known to inhibit neuropathic pain signaling on the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【137】Partial peripheral nerve injury promotes a selective loss of GABAergic inhibition in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【138】Although 2 classes of GABAergic drugs—baclofen and benzodiazepines—are used in clinical practice in select patients, their effect is not selective to the nociceptive pathways, resulting in a very low therapeutic index in the context of pain management.\n\n【139】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【140】Despite substantial effort, novel and more selective analgesic agents using the GABAergic pathway are not clinically available.\n\n【141】Another neurotransmitter involved in pain signaling is substance P. Substance P is produced by neurons throughout the peripheral nervous system and CNS, and it exerts its effect by activating neurokinin type 1 (NK <sub>1 </sub> ) receptor.\n\n【142】Neurobiology of substance P and the NK1 receptor.\n\n【143】Studies using NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor knockout mice and NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists in rodents suggested that blocking substance P signaling would result in profound analgesia, thereby generating widespread enthusiasm regarding clinical translation.\n\n【144】The substance P receptor antagonist CP-99,994 reduces acute postoperative pain.\n\n【145】The NK1 receptor is essential for the full expression of noxious inhibitory controls in the mouse.\n\n【146】However, clinical studies of several NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists given by the systemic route reported an almost complete lack of analgesic efficacy in humans.\n\n【147】Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists: a comprehensive patent survey.\n\n【148】The failure of NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists may have been considered a breaking point in analgesic drug discovery and development as it brought the realization that there may be no magic bullet consisting of a chemical compound targeting a single nociceptive mechanism with a degree of nociceptive specificity that could rival (or exceed) the analgesic activity of opioids.\n\n【149】Locoregional Analgesics: An Alternative Approach to Drug Development\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【150】### Clinical Interventional Pain Procedures for Locoregional Pain Syndromes\n\n【151】Interventional drug delivery for locoregional chronic pain is one of the most common procedures performed in clinical practice.\n\n【152】The role of invasive pain management modalities in the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【153】Multiple techniques that target various pain generators under imaging guidance are used.\n\n【154】Interventional approaches to pain management.\n\n【155】The most frequent targets for interventional drug delivery are the spinal nerves, which are accessed either IT or via the epidural (ED) route under fluoroscopic guidance. More than 2.5 million ED injections were performed in 2013 in the United States.\n\n【156】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, _Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting_ , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.\n\n【157】Although all these procedures are remarkably safe, their efficacy has recently come under scrutiny.\n\n【158】Pain Management Injection Therapies for Low Back Pain.\n\n【159】Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , Rockville, MD 2015\n\n【160】For the ED injection, there is evidence of moderate efficacy for some pain syndromes, such as lumbar radiculitis, but no evidence of efficacy in others, such as spinal stenosis (neurogenic intermittent claudication).\n\n【161】A randomized trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis.\n\n【162】The chief reason for the limited efficacy of interventional procedures for chronic pain is the small repertoire of analgesic agents available for these routes of delivery. For IT delivery, the available drugs are limited to opioids, benzodiazepines, baclofen, ziconotide, local anesthetics, and ketamine.\n\n【163】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【164】For ED delivery, local anesthetics and corticosteroids constitute the only agents available to date. The pharmacologic effect of these agents is relatively nonspecific, and its duration is only transient in most patients, requiring either implantation of a pump for the IT route or repeated interventions for the ED route; on average patients receive 2 to 3 injections of ED corticosteroids per year.\n\n【165】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, _Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting_ , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.\n\n【166】Although the discovery of novel analgesic agents specifically designed for anatomically selective routes of delivery, such as ED, is a major unmet clinical need, this area has not been appreciably explored by the pharmaceutical industry and research laboratories. The search for novel molecular targets has focused on systemically administered drugs, whereas drug development for localized delivery mainly involved optimizing the formulation of already available agents for ED delivery, such as depot liposomal forms of corticosteroids extending their biological half-life (currently in the phase of preclinical development).\n\n【167】A lipid based depot (DepoFoam technology) for sustained release drug delivery.\n\n【168】It is notable that although the field of CDD focused on systemic analgesic drugs, the major truly innovative agent recently approved for the treatment of chronic pain, ziconotide, is a locally delivered (IT) agent.\n\n【169】### Requirements for a New Generation of Analgesic Drugs for Interventional Delivery\n\n【170】A desirable agent for localized, interventional delivery would ideally meet 2 requirements that differ from systemic drugs developed via CCD: (1) prolonged or even permanent activity after a single administration and (2) ability to penetrate the target tissue locally without a need for sufficient bioavailability after systemic administration and for lack of off-target toxicity. Although the first requirement raises a conceptual bar that the candidate interventional agents need to reach compared with most systemic drugs currently under development via CDD, the second requirement lowers this bar substantially. The combination of these 2 requirements, ie, the need for long-term effect after a single administration and lessened concern for off-target distribution and toxicity, seems to be uniquely suited for an emerging drug discovery and disease treatment paradigm: gene therapy.\n\n【171】Gene Therapy\n------------\n\n【172】### Beyond Hereditary Disorders\n\n【173】Gene therapy was initially developed to correct dysfunctional genes in rare monogenic disorders, such as inborn errors of metabolism or blood clotting disorders.\n\n【174】History of gene therapy.\n\n【175】However, the greatest potential impact of gene therapy may lie in the treatment of common, acquired disorders.\n\n【176】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【177】Cardioprotection by gene therapy: a review paper on behalf of the Working Group on Drug Cardiotoxicity and Cardioprotection of the Italian Society of Cardiology.\n\n【178】The field of gene therapy reached critical benchmarks during the past several years.\n\n【179】Gene therapy clinical trials worldwide to 2012: an update.\n\n【180】Gene therapy returns to centre stage.\n\n【181】In 2012, alipogene tiparvovec became the first gene therapy product to be commercially approved in Europe (for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency).\n\n【182】Endgame: glybera finally recommended for approval as the first gene therapy drug in the European Union.\n\n【183】In 2015, talimogene laherparepvec was the first gene vector brought to market in the United States (for the treatment of inoperable malignant melanoma and head and neck cancer).\n\n【184】Talimogene laherparepvec: first global approval.\n\n【185】Talimogene laherparepvec improves durable response rate in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n【186】### Gene Vectors: A Distinct Class of Therapeutic Agents\n\n【187】In gene therapy, a vector serves as an intracellular delivery mechanism for the instruction set provided by the therapeutic gene (transgene) to the targeted cells.\n\n【188】Gene therapy—basic principles and the road from bench to bedside.\n\n【189】in: Gad S.C. Rubany G.M. Pharmaceutical Sciences Encyclopedia. John Wiley & Sons Inc , Hoboken, NJ 2010\n\n【190】The encoded proteins or peptides are expressed by the target cells, thereby harnessing their machinery to produce the therapeutic substance locally. Vectors are the most commonly genetically engineered viruses whose ability to replicate is artificially disrupted and part or all of their genome is replaced by a transgene of choice.\n\n【191】Viral vectors for gene therapy: the art of turning infectious agents into vehicles of therapeutics.\n\n【192】Unique from other drug constructs, the viral vector–transgene package is modular. The surface characteristics of the viral shell (capsid serotype) will determine its tissue selectivity (tropism), and this can be varied independently of the carried transgene. This provides great flexibility in testing large numbers of potential transgene products directed at varying molecular targets. This approach also enables overexpressing, silencing, or de novo expressing of virtually any gene, thereby affecting any signaling pathway. A further variable that can be introduced is selective anatomic delivery, which may augment or overcome the challenges of insufficient tissue tropism.\n\n【193】### Primary Sensory Neurons as the Target of Gene Therapy for Pain\n\n【194】The primary sensory neurons, as the point of aggregation of nociceptive signaling from the periphery, are a rational target of gene therapy.\n\n【195】Nociceptors: the sensors of the pain pathway.\n\n【196】These neurons reside in the DRG, a structure that is anatomically accessible, obviating the risk of CNS instrumentation. There are also appropriate small-animal models of DRG access and peripheral nociceptive testing.\n\n【197】Tests and models of nociception and pain in rodents.\n\n【198】Targeted delivery of pharmacological agents into rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【199】These characteristics have focused attention on DRG neurons as the primary target for modulation of nociception. Gene therapy may be directed to DRG neurons either by transducing them directly or by transducing anatomically or functionally related structures, such as the glia or the meninges, whereby nociception is indirectly modulated by their interaction with DRG neurons.\n\n【200】### Targeting the Primary Sensory Neurons by Gene Vectors\n\n【201】To attain gene transfer to the primary sensory neurons, several routes of vector delivery have been explored. First, replication-incompetent herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors delivered by skin inoculation were pioneered by Fink, Glorioso, and others.\n\n【202】Deletion of multiple immediate-early genes from herpes simplex virus reduces cytotoxicity and permits long-term gene expression in neurons.\n\n【203】Engineering herpes simplex virus vectors for CNS applications.\n\n【204】This approach takes advantage of the inherent ability of this virus to undergo retrograde axonal transport from the sensory nerve terminal to the cell body and, thereby, to transduce DRG neurons whose dendrites originate in the injected sensory field of the skin. Although this selectivity makes HSV attractive for gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system, it also restricts its utility for other gene therapy applications; the overall translational experience with this vector remains, therefore, relatively limited.\n\n【205】Second, IT injection of several serotypes of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors was found to selectively transduce the primary sensory neurons.\n\n【206】AAV8(gfp) preferentially targets large diameter dorsal root ganglion neurones after both intra-dorsal root ganglion and intrathecal injection.\n\n【207】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【208】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【209】Recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (rAAV2/6)-mediated gene transfer to nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery.\n\n【210】Differential adeno-associated virus mediated gene transfer to sensory neurons following intrathecal delivery by direct lumbar puncture.\n\n【211】Adeno-associated virus is the leading vector type across many gene therapy fields because it is not associated with any disease in any species, is devoid of any viral genes, and yields stable gene expression for months to years.\n\n【212】Adeno-associated virus: from defective virus to effective vector.\n\n【213】The initial safety concerns regarding AAV vectors, which included insertional mutagenesis, germline transmission, replication escape, and dissemination of the vector to the public domain, have been thoroughly addressed in the field and do not seem to be applicable in the context of human trials, as previously reviewed in detail elsewhere.\n\n【214】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【215】Furthermore, the difficulties with large-scale manufacturing of AAV vectors, which were holding back the clinical translation of AAV-based gene therapy, have recently been overcome.\n\n【216】Large-scale recombinant adeno-associated virus production.\n\n【217】A relative restriction associated with AAV is the need to switch capsids if serial treatments are needed because serologic immunity renders the readministration of a vector with the same serotypes ineffective.\n\n【218】Immune responses to AAV vectors: overcoming barriers to successful gene therapy.\n\n【219】In addition to AAV, IT delivery of other vector types, such lentiviruses or AAV plasmid DNA, was also tested for gene therapy for pain. Although efficacious in certain therapeutic strategies, these vectors did not transduce the primary sensory neurons but rather glial cells or the meninges.\n\n【220】Gene therapy for the treatment of chronic peripheral nervous system pain.\n\n【221】Third, to further improve the efficiency of gene transfer, several groups have targeted the nociceptive neurons directly by intraganglionic injection of AAV in rodents.\n\n【222】Intraganglionic AAV6 results in efficient and long-term gene transfer to peripheral sensory nervous system in adult rats.\n\n【223】Comparison of AAV serotypes for gene delivery to dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【224】Direct injection into the dorsal root ganglion: technical, behavioral, and histological observations.\n\n【225】Although this approach led to highly efficacious and selective gene transfer to the DRGs in a rodent model, an open surgical procedure consisting of paravertebral exposure and foraminotomy was required.\n\n【226】Molecular Targets of Gene Therapy for Pain\n------------------------------------------\n\n【227】The molecular selectivity of gene therapy has been of great interest because it enables utilization of antinociceptive mechanisms that have not been accessible by conventional agents. A variety of approaches have been found to be efficacious in animal models of chronic pain. Important examples of the molecular targets used to date by gene therapy for pain are (1) spinal opioid delivery, (2) anti-inflammatory cytokines, and (3) ion channels and neurotrophic growth factor.\n\n【228】### Spinal Opioid Delivery\n\n【229】The opioid system is an attractive target for gene therapy because of the robust clinical experience with exogenous opioids. Although opioids modulate pain processing at multiple levels of the nervous system, delivery of exogenous opioids to the spinal IT space is sufficient to achieve analgesia.\n\n【230】Intrathecal opioids for intractable pain syndromes.\n\n【231】Gene transfer of opioid genes selectively to DRG neurons has been found to reduce chronic pain in animal models of locoregional pain (as reviewed next). This approach may eliminate the toxicity of exogenously administered opioids, which is attributed to their extraspinal effects in the CNS and in peripheral tissues.\n\n【232】Side effects of intrathecal and epidural opioids.\n\n【233】Long-term opioid management for chronic noncancer pain.\n\n【234】A systematic review of the use of opioid medication for those with moderate to severe cancer pain and renal impairment: a European Palliative Care Research Collaborative opioid guidelines project.\n\n【235】A review of potential adverse effects of long-term opioid therapy: a practitioner's guide.\n\n【236】The prevalence, severity, and impact of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: results of a US and European Patient Survey (PROBE 1).\n\n【237】The effects of opioids and opioid analogs on animal and human endocrine systems.\n\n【238】Coronary heart disease outcomes among chronic opioid and cyclooxygenase-2 users compared with a general population cohort.\n\n【239】Opioids and immune modulation: more questions than answers.\n\n【240】Two principal strategies using opioid signaling for analgesia by gene therapy have been described. First, several groups have used transgenes encoding endogenous opioid agonists delivered to the DRGs. Goss et al\n\n【241】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【242】used preproenkephalin, a δ-opioid receptor agonist, and endomorphine-2, a μ-opioid receptor agonist, delivered by HSV vectors. We used AAV to deliver prepro-ß-endorphin, an artificial opioid precursor of the μ-opioid agonist peptide ß-endorphin that is engineered to be secreted in a stimulus-independent manner via the constitutive secretory pathway.\n\n【243】Retrovirus-mediated expression of an artificial beta-endorphin precursor in primary fibroblasts.\n\n【244】Administration of these therapeutic genes resulted in robust reduction of allodynia or hyperalgesia in multiple rodent models of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain.\n\n【245】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【246】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【247】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【248】Herpes vector-mediated expression of proenkephalin reduces bone cancer pain.\n\n【249】The second strategy to harness the opioid system for gene therapy of pain consists of transferring genes that encode an opioid receptor. Xu et al\n\n【250】Adeno-associated viral transfer of opioid receptor gene to primary sensory neurons: a strategy to increase opioid antinociception.\n\n【251】Efficiencies of transgene expression in nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors.\n\n【252】reported this approach several years ago, but no recent follow-up studies seem to have been attempted. Another approach testing an opioid receptor mutant was reported more recently.\n\n【253】Intrathecal delivery of a mutant micro-opioid receptor activated by naloxone as a possible antinociceptive paradigm.\n\n【254】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【255】Gene transfer of IL-10 by several vector systems, including HSV and AAV, has been extensively tested in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【256】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【257】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【258】Controlling neuropathic pain by adeno-associated virus driven production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【259】HSV-mediated transfer of interleukin-10 reduces inflammatory pain through modulation of membrane tumor necrosis factor α in spinal cord microglia.\n\n【260】Production of IL-10 resulted in marked reduction of allodynia and hyperalgesia, a finding verified independently by multiple groups. In addition to IL-10, a tumor necrosis factor–soluble receptor delivered via HSV-mediated gene transfer reduced allodynia in a rodent model of varicella zoster virus–induced pain.\n\n【261】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【262】### Ion Channels\n\n【263】Discovery of the voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels that are specific to nociception and the failure to generate corresponding conventional analgesic drugs has prompted an effort to use these targets via gene therapy. Two approaches have been used: (1) overexpression of ion channels responsible for membrane hyperpolarization by delivering vectors that carry the gene encoding for the respective channel and (2) downregulation of ion channels responsible for membrane depolarization by RNA interference, ie, by delivering vectors encoding small interfering RNA or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) complementary to the sequence of the respective ion channel, or by gene transfer of genes whose products deactivate these channels.\n\n【264】In the first approach, AAV-mediated gene transfer of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 in a rat model of neuropathic pain resulted in normalization of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 expression that had been downregulated in the context of nerve injury. This was associated with a decrease in allodynia in the treated animals.\n\n【265】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【266】Similarly, overexpression of the glycine receptor (a ligand-gated chloride channel) in the sensory fibers mediated by HSV resulted in attenuation of hyperalgesia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【267】HSV delivery of a ligand-regulated endogenous ion channel gene to sensory neurons results in pain control following channel activation.\n\n【268】In the second approach, Samad et al\n\n【269】Virus-mediated shRNA knockdown of Na(v)1.3 in rat dorsal root ganglion attenuates nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.\n\n【270】found that knockout of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 by shRNA encoded by an AAV vector delivered into the DRGs attenuated allodynia in the experimental animals. Similarly, knockout of the NR subunit of the NMDA receptor in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord via AAV-mediated transfer of the respective small interfering RNA reduced spinal NMDA currents as well as nociceptive behavior in a model of chronic inflammatory pain.\n\n【271】siRNA-mediated knockdown of the NR1 subunit gene of the NMDA receptor attenuates formalin-induced pain behaviors in adult rats.\n\n【272】A conditional deletion of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in adult spinal cord dorsal horn reduces NMDA currents and injury-induced pain.\n\n【273】Downregulation of the TRPV1 signaling via gene transfer of either shRNA delivered by IT AAV or the dominant negative (poreless) form of the protein delivered by HSV has been found to reduce allodynia in rat models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【274】Intrathecal AAV serotype 9-mediated delivery of shRNA against TRPV1 attenuates thermal hyperalgesia in a mouse model of peripheral nerve injury.\n\n【275】Herpes simplex virus vector-mediated gene delivery of poreless TRPV1 channels reduces bladder overactivity and nociception in rats.\n\n【276】An HSV vector system for selection of ligand-gated ion channel modulators.\n\n【277】Fischer et al\n\n【278】Sustained relief of neuropathic pain by AAV-targeted expression of CBD3 peptide in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【279】downregulated Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 by AAV-mediated gene transfer of Ca  channel-binding peptide 3, also resulting in attenuation of neuropathic pain in the rat model. Ma et al\n\n【280】Expression of inwardly rectifying potassium channels by an inducible adenoviral vector reduced the neuronal hyperexcitability and hyperalgesia produced by chronic compression of the spinal ganglion.\n\n【281】found that overexpression of Kir2.1, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, delivered by an adenoviral vector into the DRGs suppresses neuronal excitability and prevents the development of hyperalgesia in rodents.\n\n【282】### Neurotransmitters and Growth Factors\n\n【283】Delivery of AAV or HSV vectors encoding several isoforms of the GABA gene showed reduction of allodynia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【284】Constitutive GABA expression via a recombinant adeno-associated virus consistently attenuates neuropathic pain.\n\n【285】Vector-mediated release of GABA attenuates pain-related behaviors and reduces Na(V)1.7 in DRG neurons.\n\n【286】The AAV- or HSV-mediated gene transfer of several neurotrophic growth factors has been investigated as a novel approach to treat chronic pain by reversing the synaptic remodeling described in chronic pain states. This approach could be tested only by gene therapy because conventional pharmacotherapy could not attain target-specific, long-term delivery of an active agent. Several neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, erythropoietin, glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, were found to reduce pain behavior in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【287】Amelioration of chronic neuropathic pain after partial nerve injury by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated over-expression of BDNF in the rat spinal cord.\n\n【288】Neuroprotective effect of herpes simplex virus-mediated gene transfer of erythropoietin in hyperglycemic dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【289】HSV-mediated gene transfer of the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor provides an antiallodynic effect on neuropathic pain.\n\n【290】Long-term neuroprotection achieved with latency-associated promoter-driven herpes simplex virus gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system.\n\n【291】### Gene Editing\n\n【292】Gene editing is a technique for highly targeted deletion, insertion, or substitution of a desired sequence of a genome.\n\n【293】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【294】Although multiple gene editing techniques have been described, the field underwent a breakthrough in 2012 when Barrangou, Doudna, Jinek, and others described the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in conjunction with CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9).\n\n【295】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【296】Genome-scale engineering for systems and synthetic biology.\n\n【297】A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.\n\n【298】The CRISPR craze.\n\n【299】CRISPR/Cas9 allows precise and cost-effective gene editing in vivo, and is poised to revolutionize gene therapy. It seems conceivable that in vivo gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 delivered by gene vector may give rise to a whole new field of pain therapy.\n\n【300】### Chemogenetics and Optogenetics\n\n【301】Chemogenetics and optogenetics represent 2 emerging approaches to selectively and, unlike traditional gene therapy, reversibly manipulate cell phenotypes via gene transfer.\n\n【302】Therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain: potential application of pharmacosynthetics and optogenetics.\n\n【303】Chemogenetics is based on designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). The DREADDs are G protein–coupled receptors artificially engineered to respond to nanomolar concentrations of otherwise biologically inert ligands, such as clozapine-N-oxide.\n\n【304】Controlling signaling with a specifically designed Gi-coupled receptor.\n\n【305】Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.\n\n【306】Preliminary studies in rodents suggest that selective expression of DREADDs in nociceptive neurons via gene transfer might allow efficient and highly precise exogenous control of nociceptive signaling.\n\n【307】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【308】Mu opioid receptor modulation of dopamine neurons in the periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe: a role in regulation of pain.\n\n【309】(457) Gi-DREADD expression in TRPV1-Cre mice produces ligand-dependent behavioral inhibition to noxious heat, but ligand-independent changes in sensory neurons.\n\n【310】Analogously, optogenetics enables tunable manipulation of cell phenotypes using light.\n\n【311】Orderly recruitment of motor units under optical control in vivo.\n\n【312】Iyer et al\n\n【313】Virally mediated optogenetic excitation and inhibition of pain in freely moving nontransgenic mice.\n\n【314】found that AAV-mediated gene transfer of eNpHR3.0, a chloride channel activated by yellow light, to the DRG sensory neurons results in reduction of allodynia in rodent models that is tunable by illumination by light of the respective wavelength.\n\n【315】### Pathways to Clinical Translation\n\n【316】Herpes simplex virus encoding preproenkephalin, administered as a series of intradermal injections for intractable locoregional pain caused by cancer, is the only vector so far tested in humans in the context of gene therapy for pain.\n\n【317】Gene therapy for pain: results of a phase I clinical trial.\n\n【318】A phase 1 clinical trial reported safety of the treatment, but the lack of a blinded control group, a design typical of a phase 1 trial, did not allow any conclusions regarding efficacy. A subsequent blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial was initiated in 2011 and completed in November 2013 (according to ClinicalTrials.gov ).\n\n【319】Of note, HSV was translated from rodent studies directly into clinical trials without testing the approach in a large-animal model as an intermediate step. Should the clinical trial fail to find analgesic efficacy, it may be difficult to discern whether the HSV gene transfer technology or the therapeutic gene was the cause of failure. In such a situation, only large-animal studies may be able to further the understanding.\n\n【320】Adeno-associated virus–based gene therapy has not been tested in patients with chronic pain but in numerous other clinical settings, including phase 1, 2, and 3 trials for a large variety of neurologic and nonneurologic therapeutic applications.\n\n【321】In the field of AAV for pain, we translated the approach into large-animal models, first reporting differences in gene transfer outcomes compared with rodents when the IT route was tested.\n\n【322】High cerebrospinal fluid levels of interleukin-10 attained by AAV in dogs.\n\n【323】Subsequently, we developed a method of locoregional delivery of AAV to DRG neurons in a large-animal (swine) model using computed tomography fluoroscopy.\n\n【324】Minimally invasive convection-enhanced delivery of biologics into dorsal root ganglia: validation in the pig model and prospective modeling in humans.\n\n【325】This study recreated the gene transfer outcomes of the original rodent studies of intraganglionic AAV delivery while introducing an image-guided intervention technique and thereby obviating the need for open surgical exposure of the DRG that was used in rodents. Examination of the comparative anatomy of porcine and human spines indicates that similar, minimally invasive intraganglionic injection could also be performed in the clinical setting.\n\n【326】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【327】Interventional pain specialists have a unique skill set to translate gene therapy–based treatment approaches into novel clinical treatments for locoregional pain. Future clinical progress may be driven not only by the rapid advances in gene vector design and clinical availability but also by advances in interventional delivery techniques. Image guidance available for clinical use to date can provide anatomic selectivity for gene vector delivery to select DRGs. Combining the molecular selectivity of gene vectors with the anatomic selectivity of image-guided delivery may spur a new era of interventions for pain using a dual selective approach to analgesic treatment, thereby offering novel treatment options for patients with hitherto intractable locoregional pain.", "index": 6278, "show": true, "start": 6252, "end": 6306, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【55】Parexel Intl Corp , Waltham, MA 2014", "content": "【0】Future Directions in Pain Management\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【1】Treatment for chronic, locoregional pain ranks among the most prevalent unmet medical needs. The failure of systemic analgesic drugs, such as opioids, is often due to their off-target toxicity, development of tolerance, and abuse potential. Interventional pain procedures provide target specificity but lack pharmacologically selective agents with long-term efficacy. Gene therapy vectors are a new tool for the development of molecularly selective pain therapies, which have already been proved to provide durable analgesia in preclinical models. Taken together, advances in image-guided delivery and gene therapy may lead to a new class of dual selective analgesic treatments integrating the molecular selectivity of analgesic genes with the anatomic selectivity of interventional delivery techniques.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AAV ( adeno-associated virus ), Cav ( voltage-gated calcium channel ), CCD ( conventional drug discovery ), CNS ( central nervous system ), CRISPR/Cas9 ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 ), DRG ( dorsal root ganglion ), DREADD ( designer receptors activated by designer drugs ), ED ( epidural ), GABA ( γ-aminobutyric acid ), HSV ( herpes simplex virus ), IL-10 ( interleukin 10 ), IT ( intrathecal ), Kv ( voltage-gated potassium channel ), Nav ( voltage-gated sodium channel ), NK1 ( neurokinin type 1 ), NMDA ( N-methyl-d-aspartate ), shRNA ( small hairpin RNA ), TRP ( transient receptor potential channel ), TRPV1 ( transient receptor potential channel, subfamily V, member 1 )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .™\n\n【9】Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【10】**MOC Credit Statement:** Successful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1 MOC points in the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program.

Specifically, the 2 most prevalent causes of chronic pain in the population were low back pain and knee pain, as documented by a survey performed by the National Center for Health Statistics, whereby 28.1% of adult Americans reported low back pain and 19.5% localized knee pain during the past 3 months.\n\n【23】Institute of Medicine  \nRelieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research.\n\n<mark>【24】The National Academies Press , Washington, DC 2011</mark>\n\n【25】Locoregional pain is also responsible for a substantial portion of the financial burden of chronic pain.

Fifteen percent of patients with cancer pain experience anatomically localized pain, such as pain originating from bone metastases or neuropathic pain from nerve compression or invasion.\n\n【31】Cancer pain management.\n\n【32】Pain in these patients often cannot be adequately controlled by systemic analgesic treatments because the high doses needed for analgesia trigger intolerable adverse effects.\n\n【33】Understanding the experience of pain in terminally ill patients.\n\n【34】Although the best short-term outcomes in these patients are, therefore, frequently achieved by regional administration of local anesthetics or by selective neurolysis, neither approach is durable.\n\n【35】Cancer pain management.\n\n【36】The Search for Systemic Analgesic Therapies\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【37】### The Conventional Drug Discovery Paradigm\n\n【38】Current analgesic therapies fail in a substantial number of patients with chronic pain.\n\n【39】Cancer pain management.\n\n【40】This failure is most striking in cancer pain, where pain remains inadequately controlled in 50% of all patients.\n\n【41】Prevalence of undertreatment in cancer pain: a review of published literature.\n\n【42】Despite the search for novel analgesic treatments during the past few decades, currently available analgesic drugs exert their effect through very few categories of molecular targets.\n\n【43】A capsule history of pain management.\n\n【44】CT-guided injection of a TRPV1 agonist around dorsal root ganglia decreases pain transmission in swine.\n\n【45】Recent advances in neurobiology of nociception, however, identified a variety of candidate therapeutic targets located in the peripheral nervous system that are not used by current analgesic drugs. Important examples include ion channels expressed by primary sensory neurons, cytokines that play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, and several inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters that modulate nociceptive signaling.\n\n【46】Characterization of these nociceptive mechanisms led to a search for a new generation of analgesic drugs using the techniques of conventional drug discovery (CDD); CDD, ie, the search for new small-molecule therapeutic entities, largely relies on empirical screening of candidate compounds. Two approaches are used by the pharmaceutical industry and academic laboratories involved in CDD. First, phenotype-directed screening seeks to identify chemical entities that have a desirable effect on the phenotype of a disease model without previous knowledge of their molecular mechanism of action.\n\n【47】Phenotypic screening in cancer drug discovery: past, present and future.\n\n【48】Various assays modeling the disease phenotype on the level of a cell or an organism have been described.\n\n【49】Modern phenotypic drug discovery is a viable, neoclassic pharma strategy.\n\n【50】Efficacious compounds are then examined for molecular mechanism of action using reverse biology techniques. Second, target-directed screening relies on biochemical knowledge of specific molecular targets and uses small-molecule screening strategies, typically by examining large libraries of compounds.\n\n【51】Discovery of small molecule cancer drugs: successes, challenges and opportunities.\n\n【52】The actual biologic effect of thus discovered compounds is then tested in vivo in disease models. Although there has been a substantial effort to facilitate CDD by using high-throughput assays and by implementing genomic data, the discovery of new small-molecule drugs is declining in all medical fields. In fact, pharmaceutical industry data show that the number of truly innovative drugs (defined as new molecular entities) approved by the major regulatory bodies (such as the US Food and Drug Administration) has been decreasing by 50% every 5 years worldwide.\n\n【53】How to improve R&D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge.\n\n【54】PAREXEL Biopharmaceutical Statistical Sourcebook 2014/2015.\n\n【55】Parexel Intl Corp , Waltham, MA 2014\n\n【56】How were new medicines discovered?\n\n【57】Although multiple candidate analgesic agents that had been identified through CDD were tested in preclinical models, the success regarding clinical translation has been very limited, as reviewed next.\n\n【58】### Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels\n\n【59】Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na <sub>v </sub> ) are responsible for the formation of action potentials in all excitatory cells. Several Na <sub>v </sub> subtypes are expressed by primary sensory neurons but not by other excitatory cells, such as neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) or myocytes.\n\n【60】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【61】Specifically, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8, and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.9 have been found to be involved in nociception. All of these channels undergo upregulation in rodent models of nerve injury or inflammatory and neuropathic pain.\n\n【62】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【63】In addition, mutations in genes encoding these channels are associated with inherited pain disorders in humans. Gain-of-function mutations of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7 result in inherited erythromelalgia, an autosomal dominant disorder manifesting by extreme heat hyperalgesia.\n\n【64】Erythermalgia: molecular basis for an inherited pain syndrome.\n\n【65】Although clinical manifestations of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8 are less clearly defined, they have also been associated with the development of painful neuropathies and insensitivity to pain, respectively, in humans.\n\n【66】Pain as a channelopathy.\n\n【67】A variety of molecular entities have been tested in the preclinical setting that selectively inactivate Na <sub>v </sub> , including toxins isolated from tarantula venom or small-molecule compounds identified via target-directed screening.\n\n【68】Inhibitors of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7: patent applications since 2010.\n\n【69】Engineering potent and selective analogues of GpTx-1, a tarantula venom peptide antagonist of the Na(V)1.7 sodium channel.\n\n【70】Identification and characterization of proTx-III \\[μ-TRTX-Tp1a\\], a new voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor from venom of the tarantula thrixopelma pruriens.\n\n【71】Three peptide modulators of the human voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7, an important analgesic target, from the venom of an Australian tarantula.\n\n【72】Yet, despite an ongoing effort, none of these agents have been approved as a drug for use in humans.\n\n【73】### Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels\n\n【74】Similar to Na <sub>v </sub> , voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca <sub>v </sub> ) expressed in primary sensory neurons result in an increased firing frequency.\n\n【75】Voltage-gated calcium channels as targets for the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【76】At the level of the spinal cord, the upregulation of Ca <sub>v </sub> secondary to nerve injury has been described in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【77】The physiology, pathology, and pharmacology of voltage-gated calcium channels and their future therapeutic potential.\n\n【78】Specifically, Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 seems to play a critical role in neuropathic pain. Inactivation of this channel by channel-binding peptide 3 inhibits trafficking of Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 to the cytoplasmic membrane and, thereby, diminishes membrane excitability of nociceptive neurons, resulting in attenuation of nocifensive behavior in rodent models.\n\n【79】Suppression of inflammatory and neuropathic pain by uncoupling CRMP-2 from the presynaptic Ca  channel complex.\n\n【80】Gabapentinoids are the only class of systemic analgesic drugs that may exert their therapeutic effect through interacting with Ca <sub>v </sub> . Gabapentinoids were initially conceived as orally available analogues of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, for the treatment of seizure disorders.\n\n【81】Calcium channel a2–d ligands: gabapentin and pregabalin.\n\n【82】Although the antiepileptic efficacy of gabapentinoids did not hold up to the initial promise, they have been found to be efficacious for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【83】Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults.\n\n【84】Neuropathic pain: principles of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【85】Although the mechanism of action of gabapentinoids has not been fully elucidated, they have been found to bind to the α2δ-1 subunit of the Ca <sub>v </sub> , and it is, therefore, thought that they may, at least in part, exert analgesia through inhibition of Ca <sub>v </sub> .\n\n【86】Implications and mechanism of action of gabapentin in neuropathic pain.\n\n【87】A search for selective and potent Ca <sub>v </sub> antagonists identified ω-conotoxin MVIIA, a neurotoxic peptide isolated in the 1980s from the venom of marine snails belonging to the genus _Conus_ .\n\n【88】Neuronal calcium channel antagonists: discrimination between calcium channel subtypes using omega-conotoxin from _Conus magus_ venom.\n\n【89】Peptide neurotoxins from fish-hunting cone snails.\n\n【90】ω-Conotoxin MVIIA selectively blocks N-type Ca <sub>v </sub> present in nociceptive fibers. Despite efforts over 2 decades, a search for a drug with the mechanism of action analogous to ω-conotoxin MVIIA that would be efficacious and nontoxic after systemic administration has failed. Only in 2004, ziconotide, a ω-conotoxin MVIIA derivative, was approved for localized intrathecal (IT) delivery in patients with severe, otherwise intractable pain.\n\n【91】Intrathecal ziconotide: a review of its use in patients with chronic pain refractory to other systemic or intrathecal analgesics.\n\n【92】### Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels\n\n【93】Voltage-gated potassium channels (K <sub>v </sub> ) are also critical determinants of the firing frequency, and their downregulation results in membrane hyperexcitability.\n\n【94】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【95】Distinct potassium channels on pain-sensing neurons.\n\n【96】Although several potassium channels are expressed by primary nociceptive fibers, K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 has been most thoroughly studied in association with chronic pain and has been found to be markedly downregulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in the setting of nerve injury and neuropathic pain.\n\n【97】A long noncoding RNA contributes to neuropathic pain by silencing Kcna2 in primary afferent neurons.\n\n【98】Yet, no analgesic drugs that modulate nociceptive signaling through K <sub>v </sub> are clinically available.\n\n【99】### Ligand-Gated Cation Channels\n\n【100】Ligand-gated ion channels are an attractive target for drug development because their endogenous ligands can serve as a molecular pattern for discovery of compounds with analogous pharmacodynamics but therapeutically more favorable pharmacokinetics. The _N_ \\-methyl- d \\-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor mediates long-term potentiation, which has been found to play a key role in the development of chronic pain.\n\n【101】NMDA receptors and memory encoding.\n\n【102】Long-term potentiation at spinal C-fiber synapses: a target for pathological pain.\n\n【103】The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, a dissociative general anesthetic agent, is used in certain subgroups of chronic pain, but data on its efficacy are inconclusive.\n\n【104】Wherefore ketamine?\n\n【105】Effects of low-dose intranasal (S)-ketamine in patients with neuropathic pain.\n\n【106】Ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for cancer pain.\n\n【107】Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of subcutaneous ketamine in the management of cancer pain.\n\n【108】Ketamine as adjuvant analgesic to opioids: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review.\n\n【109】Despite an ongoing research effort, no clinically available NMDA antagonist more specific to nociception has been found.\n\n【110】Transient receptor potential channels (TRP) constitute another family of ligand-gated cation channels. Several TRP are expressed by the primary sensory neurons and are typically activated by noxious stimuli.\n\n【111】TRP channels and pain.\n\n【112】TRP, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) is a particularly attractive target for drug development because it is almost exclusively expressed by primary nociceptive neurons and its inactivation results in loss of pain and heat sensation while other sensory modalities remain intact.\n\n【113】The cloned capsaicin receptor integrates multiple pain-producing stimuli.\n\n【114】The capsaicin receptor: a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway.\n\n【115】Capsaicin, the pungent substance in chili peppers, is the only analgesic agent acting through TRPV1 clinically available to date and is used in the form of a patch to treat locoregional pain.\n\n【116】Topical capsaicin formulations in the management of neuropathic pain.\n\n【117】Capsaicin is a reversible TRPV1 agonist and is thought to induce analgesia by desensitizing TRPV1+ nerve fibers.\n\n【118】Capsaicin-based therapies for pain control.\n\n【119】A more intuitive approach to using the TRPV1 pathway is the use of TRPV1 receptor antagonists. Although a variety of TRPV1 antagonists have been tested in preclinical models, none have been successfully translated to the clinical setting owing to their off-target adverse effects, which included hyperthermia and impaired noxious heat sensation, after systemic delivery.\n\n【120】Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 antagonists: a patent review (2011-2014).\n\n【121】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【122】Glial cells have been reported to initiate and maintain neurogenic inflammation in the setting of chronic neuropathic pain, resulting in increased neuronal excitability.\n\n【123】Importance of glial activation in neuropathic pain.\n\n【124】The effect of glia on the primary sensory neurons may be mediated by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1β, and various chemokines.\n\n【125】Spinal interleukin-10 therapy to treat peripheral neuropathic pain.\n\n【126】The proinflammatory and pronociceptive effect of these cytokines is countered by anti-inflammatory cytokines. The principal anti-inflammatory cytokine is interleukin 10 (IL-10). Therefore, IL-10 is an attractive agent to treat neuropathic pain, which is known to be relatively refractory to opioid analgesics.\n\n【127】The IT administration of recombinant IL-10 has, indeed, been found to reduce neuroinflammation and allodynia in animal models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【128】Snake venom phospholipase A2s (Asp49 and Lys49) induce mechanical allodynia upon peri-sciatic administration: involvement of spinal cord glia, proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide.\n\n【129】Cytokine involvement in dynorphin-induced allodynia.\n\n【130】However, direct delivery of the recombinant IL-10 was found not to be feasible for clinical translation because of its high cost, its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and its half-life of only 2 hours in the cerebrospinal fluid after IT delivery.\n\n【131】Interleukin-10 as a CNS therapeutic: the obstacle of the blood-brain/blood-spinal cord barrier.\n\n【132】Controlling pathological pain by adenovirally driven spinal production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【133】### Pain-Modulating Neurotransmitters\n\n【134】Development and maintenance of chronic pain states is associated with alteration of the neurotransmitter milieu in the CNS.\n\n【135】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【136】The neuroinhibitory transmitter GABA is known to inhibit neuropathic pain signaling on the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【137】Partial peripheral nerve injury promotes a selective loss of GABAergic inhibition in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【138】Although 2 classes of GABAergic drugs—baclofen and benzodiazepines—are used in clinical practice in select patients, their effect is not selective to the nociceptive pathways, resulting in a very low therapeutic index in the context of pain management.\n\n【139】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【140】Despite substantial effort, novel and more selective analgesic agents using the GABAergic pathway are not clinically available.\n\n【141】Another neurotransmitter involved in pain signaling is substance P. Substance P is produced by neurons throughout the peripheral nervous system and CNS, and it exerts its effect by activating neurokinin type 1 (NK <sub>1 </sub> ) receptor.\n\n【142】Neurobiology of substance P and the NK1 receptor.\n\n【143】Studies using NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor knockout mice and NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists in rodents suggested that blocking substance P signaling would result in profound analgesia, thereby generating widespread enthusiasm regarding clinical translation.\n\n【144】The substance P receptor antagonist CP-99,994 reduces acute postoperative pain.\n\n【145】The NK1 receptor is essential for the full expression of noxious inhibitory controls in the mouse.\n\n【146】However, clinical studies of several NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists given by the systemic route reported an almost complete lack of analgesic efficacy in humans.\n\n【147】Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists: a comprehensive patent survey.\n\n【148】The failure of NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists may have been considered a breaking point in analgesic drug discovery and development as it brought the realization that there may be no magic bullet consisting of a chemical compound targeting a single nociceptive mechanism with a degree of nociceptive specificity that could rival (or exceed) the analgesic activity of opioids.\n\n【149】Locoregional Analgesics: An Alternative Approach to Drug Development\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【150】### Clinical Interventional Pain Procedures for Locoregional Pain Syndromes\n\n【151】Interventional drug delivery for locoregional chronic pain is one of the most common procedures performed in clinical practice.\n\n【152】The role of invasive pain management modalities in the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【153】Multiple techniques that target various pain generators under imaging guidance are used.\n\n【154】Interventional approaches to pain management.\n\n【155】The most frequent targets for interventional drug delivery are the spinal nerves, which are accessed either IT or via the epidural (ED) route under fluoroscopic guidance. More than 2.5 million ED injections were performed in 2013 in the United States.\n\n【156】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, _Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting_ , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.\n\n【157】Although all these procedures are remarkably safe, their efficacy has recently come under scrutiny.\n\n【158】Pain Management Injection Therapies for Low Back Pain.\n\n【159】Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , Rockville, MD 2015\n\n【160】For the ED injection, there is evidence of moderate efficacy for some pain syndromes, such as lumbar radiculitis, but no evidence of efficacy in others, such as spinal stenosis (neurogenic intermittent claudication).\n\n【161】A randomized trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis.\n\n【162】The chief reason for the limited efficacy of interventional procedures for chronic pain is the small repertoire of analgesic agents available for these routes of delivery. For IT delivery, the available drugs are limited to opioids, benzodiazepines, baclofen, ziconotide, local anesthetics, and ketamine.\n\n【163】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【164】For ED delivery, local anesthetics and corticosteroids constitute the only agents available to date. The pharmacologic effect of these agents is relatively nonspecific, and its duration is only transient in most patients, requiring either implantation of a pump for the IT route or repeated interventions for the ED route; on average patients receive 2 to 3 injections of ED corticosteroids per year.\n\n【165】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, _Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting_ , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.\n\n【166】Although the discovery of novel analgesic agents specifically designed for anatomically selective routes of delivery, such as ED, is a major unmet clinical need, this area has not been appreciably explored by the pharmaceutical industry and research laboratories. The search for novel molecular targets has focused on systemically administered drugs, whereas drug development for localized delivery mainly involved optimizing the formulation of already available agents for ED delivery, such as depot liposomal forms of corticosteroids extending their biological half-life (currently in the phase of preclinical development).\n\n【167】A lipid based depot (DepoFoam technology) for sustained release drug delivery.\n\n【168】It is notable that although the field of CDD focused on systemic analgesic drugs, the major truly innovative agent recently approved for the treatment of chronic pain, ziconotide, is a locally delivered (IT) agent.\n\n【169】### Requirements for a New Generation of Analgesic Drugs for Interventional Delivery\n\n【170】A desirable agent for localized, interventional delivery would ideally meet 2 requirements that differ from systemic drugs developed via CCD: (1) prolonged or even permanent activity after a single administration and (2) ability to penetrate the target tissue locally without a need for sufficient bioavailability after systemic administration and for lack of off-target toxicity. Although the first requirement raises a conceptual bar that the candidate interventional agents need to reach compared with most systemic drugs currently under development via CDD, the second requirement lowers this bar substantially. The combination of these 2 requirements, ie, the need for long-term effect after a single administration and lessened concern for off-target distribution and toxicity, seems to be uniquely suited for an emerging drug discovery and disease treatment paradigm: gene therapy.\n\n【171】Gene Therapy\n------------\n\n【172】### Beyond Hereditary Disorders\n\n【173】Gene therapy was initially developed to correct dysfunctional genes in rare monogenic disorders, such as inborn errors of metabolism or blood clotting disorders.\n\n【174】History of gene therapy.\n\n【175】However, the greatest potential impact of gene therapy may lie in the treatment of common, acquired disorders.\n\n【176】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【177】Cardioprotection by gene therapy: a review paper on behalf of the Working Group on Drug Cardiotoxicity and Cardioprotection of the Italian Society of Cardiology.\n\n【178】The field of gene therapy reached critical benchmarks during the past several years.\n\n【179】Gene therapy clinical trials worldwide to 2012: an update.\n\n【180】Gene therapy returns to centre stage.\n\n【181】In 2012, alipogene tiparvovec became the first gene therapy product to be commercially approved in Europe (for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency).\n\n【182】Endgame: glybera finally recommended for approval as the first gene therapy drug in the European Union.\n\n【183】In 2015, talimogene laherparepvec was the first gene vector brought to market in the United States (for the treatment of inoperable malignant melanoma and head and neck cancer).\n\n【184】Talimogene laherparepvec: first global approval.\n\n【185】Talimogene laherparepvec improves durable response rate in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n【186】### Gene Vectors: A Distinct Class of Therapeutic Agents\n\n【187】In gene therapy, a vector serves as an intracellular delivery mechanism for the instruction set provided by the therapeutic gene (transgene) to the targeted cells.\n\n【188】Gene therapy—basic principles and the road from bench to bedside.\n\n【189】in: Gad S.C. Rubany G.M. Pharmaceutical Sciences Encyclopedia. John Wiley & Sons Inc , Hoboken, NJ 2010\n\n【190】The encoded proteins or peptides are expressed by the target cells, thereby harnessing their machinery to produce the therapeutic substance locally. Vectors are the most commonly genetically engineered viruses whose ability to replicate is artificially disrupted and part or all of their genome is replaced by a transgene of choice.\n\n【191】Viral vectors for gene therapy: the art of turning infectious agents into vehicles of therapeutics.\n\n【192】Unique from other drug constructs, the viral vector–transgene package is modular. The surface characteristics of the viral shell (capsid serotype) will determine its tissue selectivity (tropism), and this can be varied independently of the carried transgene. This provides great flexibility in testing large numbers of potential transgene products directed at varying molecular targets. This approach also enables overexpressing, silencing, or de novo expressing of virtually any gene, thereby affecting any signaling pathway. A further variable that can be introduced is selective anatomic delivery, which may augment or overcome the challenges of insufficient tissue tropism.\n\n【193】### Primary Sensory Neurons as the Target of Gene Therapy for Pain\n\n【194】The primary sensory neurons, as the point of aggregation of nociceptive signaling from the periphery, are a rational target of gene therapy.\n\n【195】Nociceptors: the sensors of the pain pathway.\n\n【196】These neurons reside in the DRG, a structure that is anatomically accessible, obviating the risk of CNS instrumentation. There are also appropriate small-animal models of DRG access and peripheral nociceptive testing.\n\n【197】Tests and models of nociception and pain in rodents.\n\n【198】Targeted delivery of pharmacological agents into rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【199】These characteristics have focused attention on DRG neurons as the primary target for modulation of nociception. Gene therapy may be directed to DRG neurons either by transducing them directly or by transducing anatomically or functionally related structures, such as the glia or the meninges, whereby nociception is indirectly modulated by their interaction with DRG neurons.\n\n【200】### Targeting the Primary Sensory Neurons by Gene Vectors\n\n【201】To attain gene transfer to the primary sensory neurons, several routes of vector delivery have been explored. First, replication-incompetent herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors delivered by skin inoculation were pioneered by Fink, Glorioso, and others.\n\n【202】Deletion of multiple immediate-early genes from herpes simplex virus reduces cytotoxicity and permits long-term gene expression in neurons.\n\n【203】Engineering herpes simplex virus vectors for CNS applications.\n\n【204】This approach takes advantage of the inherent ability of this virus to undergo retrograde axonal transport from the sensory nerve terminal to the cell body and, thereby, to transduce DRG neurons whose dendrites originate in the injected sensory field of the skin. Although this selectivity makes HSV attractive for gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system, it also restricts its utility for other gene therapy applications; the overall translational experience with this vector remains, therefore, relatively limited.\n\n【205】Second, IT injection of several serotypes of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors was found to selectively transduce the primary sensory neurons.\n\n【206】AAV8(gfp) preferentially targets large diameter dorsal root ganglion neurones after both intra-dorsal root ganglion and intrathecal injection.\n\n【207】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【208】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【209】Recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (rAAV2/6)-mediated gene transfer to nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery.\n\n【210】Differential adeno-associated virus mediated gene transfer to sensory neurons following intrathecal delivery by direct lumbar puncture.\n\n【211】Adeno-associated virus is the leading vector type across many gene therapy fields because it is not associated with any disease in any species, is devoid of any viral genes, and yields stable gene expression for months to years.\n\n【212】Adeno-associated virus: from defective virus to effective vector.\n\n【213】The initial safety concerns regarding AAV vectors, which included insertional mutagenesis, germline transmission, replication escape, and dissemination of the vector to the public domain, have been thoroughly addressed in the field and do not seem to be applicable in the context of human trials, as previously reviewed in detail elsewhere.\n\n【214】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【215】Furthermore, the difficulties with large-scale manufacturing of AAV vectors, which were holding back the clinical translation of AAV-based gene therapy, have recently been overcome.\n\n【216】Large-scale recombinant adeno-associated virus production.\n\n【217】A relative restriction associated with AAV is the need to switch capsids if serial treatments are needed because serologic immunity renders the readministration of a vector with the same serotypes ineffective.\n\n【218】Immune responses to AAV vectors: overcoming barriers to successful gene therapy.\n\n【219】In addition to AAV, IT delivery of other vector types, such lentiviruses or AAV plasmid DNA, was also tested for gene therapy for pain. Although efficacious in certain therapeutic strategies, these vectors did not transduce the primary sensory neurons but rather glial cells or the meninges.\n\n【220】Gene therapy for the treatment of chronic peripheral nervous system pain.\n\n【221】Third, to further improve the efficiency of gene transfer, several groups have targeted the nociceptive neurons directly by intraganglionic injection of AAV in rodents.\n\n【222】Intraganglionic AAV6 results in efficient and long-term gene transfer to peripheral sensory nervous system in adult rats.\n\n【223】Comparison of AAV serotypes for gene delivery to dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【224】Direct injection into the dorsal root ganglion: technical, behavioral, and histological observations.\n\n【225】Although this approach led to highly efficacious and selective gene transfer to the DRGs in a rodent model, an open surgical procedure consisting of paravertebral exposure and foraminotomy was required.\n\n【226】Molecular Targets of Gene Therapy for Pain\n------------------------------------------\n\n【227】The molecular selectivity of gene therapy has been of great interest because it enables utilization of antinociceptive mechanisms that have not been accessible by conventional agents. A variety of approaches have been found to be efficacious in animal models of chronic pain. Important examples of the molecular targets used to date by gene therapy for pain are (1) spinal opioid delivery, (2) anti-inflammatory cytokines, and (3) ion channels and neurotrophic growth factor.\n\n【228】### Spinal Opioid Delivery\n\n【229】The opioid system is an attractive target for gene therapy because of the robust clinical experience with exogenous opioids. Although opioids modulate pain processing at multiple levels of the nervous system, delivery of exogenous opioids to the spinal IT space is sufficient to achieve analgesia.\n\n【230】Intrathecal opioids for intractable pain syndromes.\n\n【231】Gene transfer of opioid genes selectively to DRG neurons has been found to reduce chronic pain in animal models of locoregional pain (as reviewed next). This approach may eliminate the toxicity of exogenously administered opioids, which is attributed to their extraspinal effects in the CNS and in peripheral tissues.\n\n【232】Side effects of intrathecal and epidural opioids.\n\n【233】Long-term opioid management for chronic noncancer pain.\n\n【234】A systematic review of the use of opioid medication for those with moderate to severe cancer pain and renal impairment: a European Palliative Care Research Collaborative opioid guidelines project.\n\n【235】A review of potential adverse effects of long-term opioid therapy: a practitioner's guide.\n\n【236】The prevalence, severity, and impact of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: results of a US and European Patient Survey (PROBE 1).\n\n【237】The effects of opioids and opioid analogs on animal and human endocrine systems.\n\n【238】Coronary heart disease outcomes among chronic opioid and cyclooxygenase-2 users compared with a general population cohort.\n\n【239】Opioids and immune modulation: more questions than answers.\n\n【240】Two principal strategies using opioid signaling for analgesia by gene therapy have been described. First, several groups have used transgenes encoding endogenous opioid agonists delivered to the DRGs. Goss et al\n\n【241】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【242】used preproenkephalin, a δ-opioid receptor agonist, and endomorphine-2, a μ-opioid receptor agonist, delivered by HSV vectors. We used AAV to deliver prepro-ß-endorphin, an artificial opioid precursor of the μ-opioid agonist peptide ß-endorphin that is engineered to be secreted in a stimulus-independent manner via the constitutive secretory pathway.\n\n【243】Retrovirus-mediated expression of an artificial beta-endorphin precursor in primary fibroblasts.\n\n【244】Administration of these therapeutic genes resulted in robust reduction of allodynia or hyperalgesia in multiple rodent models of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain.\n\n【245】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【246】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【247】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【248】Herpes vector-mediated expression of proenkephalin reduces bone cancer pain.\n\n【249】The second strategy to harness the opioid system for gene therapy of pain consists of transferring genes that encode an opioid receptor. Xu et al\n\n【250】Adeno-associated viral transfer of opioid receptor gene to primary sensory neurons: a strategy to increase opioid antinociception.\n\n【251】Efficiencies of transgene expression in nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors.\n\n【252】reported this approach several years ago, but no recent follow-up studies seem to have been attempted. Another approach testing an opioid receptor mutant was reported more recently.\n\n【253】Intrathecal delivery of a mutant micro-opioid receptor activated by naloxone as a possible antinociceptive paradigm.\n\n【254】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【255】Gene transfer of IL-10 by several vector systems, including HSV and AAV, has been extensively tested in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【256】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【257】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【258】Controlling neuropathic pain by adeno-associated virus driven production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【259】HSV-mediated transfer of interleukin-10 reduces inflammatory pain through modulation of membrane tumor necrosis factor α in spinal cord microglia.\n\n【260】Production of IL-10 resulted in marked reduction of allodynia and hyperalgesia, a finding verified independently by multiple groups. In addition to IL-10, a tumor necrosis factor–soluble receptor delivered via HSV-mediated gene transfer reduced allodynia in a rodent model of varicella zoster virus–induced pain.\n\n【261】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【262】### Ion Channels\n\n【263】Discovery of the voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels that are specific to nociception and the failure to generate corresponding conventional analgesic drugs has prompted an effort to use these targets via gene therapy. Two approaches have been used: (1) overexpression of ion channels responsible for membrane hyperpolarization by delivering vectors that carry the gene encoding for the respective channel and (2) downregulation of ion channels responsible for membrane depolarization by RNA interference, ie, by delivering vectors encoding small interfering RNA or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) complementary to the sequence of the respective ion channel, or by gene transfer of genes whose products deactivate these channels.\n\n【264】In the first approach, AAV-mediated gene transfer of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 in a rat model of neuropathic pain resulted in normalization of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 expression that had been downregulated in the context of nerve injury. This was associated with a decrease in allodynia in the treated animals.\n\n【265】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【266】Similarly, overexpression of the glycine receptor (a ligand-gated chloride channel) in the sensory fibers mediated by HSV resulted in attenuation of hyperalgesia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【267】HSV delivery of a ligand-regulated endogenous ion channel gene to sensory neurons results in pain control following channel activation.\n\n【268】In the second approach, Samad et al\n\n【269】Virus-mediated shRNA knockdown of Na(v)1.3 in rat dorsal root ganglion attenuates nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.\n\n【270】found that knockout of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 by shRNA encoded by an AAV vector delivered into the DRGs attenuated allodynia in the experimental animals. Similarly, knockout of the NR subunit of the NMDA receptor in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord via AAV-mediated transfer of the respective small interfering RNA reduced spinal NMDA currents as well as nociceptive behavior in a model of chronic inflammatory pain.\n\n【271】siRNA-mediated knockdown of the NR1 subunit gene of the NMDA receptor attenuates formalin-induced pain behaviors in adult rats.\n\n【272】A conditional deletion of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in adult spinal cord dorsal horn reduces NMDA currents and injury-induced pain.\n\n【273】Downregulation of the TRPV1 signaling via gene transfer of either shRNA delivered by IT AAV or the dominant negative (poreless) form of the protein delivered by HSV has been found to reduce allodynia in rat models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【274】Intrathecal AAV serotype 9-mediated delivery of shRNA against TRPV1 attenuates thermal hyperalgesia in a mouse model of peripheral nerve injury.\n\n【275】Herpes simplex virus vector-mediated gene delivery of poreless TRPV1 channels reduces bladder overactivity and nociception in rats.\n\n【276】An HSV vector system for selection of ligand-gated ion channel modulators.\n\n【277】Fischer et al\n\n【278】Sustained relief of neuropathic pain by AAV-targeted expression of CBD3 peptide in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【279】downregulated Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 by AAV-mediated gene transfer of Ca  channel-binding peptide 3, also resulting in attenuation of neuropathic pain in the rat model. Ma et al\n\n【280】Expression of inwardly rectifying potassium channels by an inducible adenoviral vector reduced the neuronal hyperexcitability and hyperalgesia produced by chronic compression of the spinal ganglion.\n\n【281】found that overexpression of Kir2.1, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, delivered by an adenoviral vector into the DRGs suppresses neuronal excitability and prevents the development of hyperalgesia in rodents.\n\n【282】### Neurotransmitters and Growth Factors\n\n【283】Delivery of AAV or HSV vectors encoding several isoforms of the GABA gene showed reduction of allodynia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【284】Constitutive GABA expression via a recombinant adeno-associated virus consistently attenuates neuropathic pain.\n\n【285】Vector-mediated release of GABA attenuates pain-related behaviors and reduces Na(V)1.7 in DRG neurons.\n\n【286】The AAV- or HSV-mediated gene transfer of several neurotrophic growth factors has been investigated as a novel approach to treat chronic pain by reversing the synaptic remodeling described in chronic pain states. This approach could be tested only by gene therapy because conventional pharmacotherapy could not attain target-specific, long-term delivery of an active agent. Several neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, erythropoietin, glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, were found to reduce pain behavior in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【287】Amelioration of chronic neuropathic pain after partial nerve injury by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated over-expression of BDNF in the rat spinal cord.\n\n【288】Neuroprotective effect of herpes simplex virus-mediated gene transfer of erythropoietin in hyperglycemic dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【289】HSV-mediated gene transfer of the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor provides an antiallodynic effect on neuropathic pain.\n\n【290】Long-term neuroprotection achieved with latency-associated promoter-driven herpes simplex virus gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system.\n\n【291】### Gene Editing\n\n【292】Gene editing is a technique for highly targeted deletion, insertion, or substitution of a desired sequence of a genome.\n\n【293】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【294】Although multiple gene editing techniques have been described, the field underwent a breakthrough in 2012 when Barrangou, Doudna, Jinek, and others described the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in conjunction with CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9).\n\n【295】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【296】Genome-scale engineering for systems and synthetic biology.\n\n【297】A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.\n\n【298】The CRISPR craze.\n\n【299】CRISPR/Cas9 allows precise and cost-effective gene editing in vivo, and is poised to revolutionize gene therapy. It seems conceivable that in vivo gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 delivered by gene vector may give rise to a whole new field of pain therapy.\n\n【300】### Chemogenetics and Optogenetics\n\n【301】Chemogenetics and optogenetics represent 2 emerging approaches to selectively and, unlike traditional gene therapy, reversibly manipulate cell phenotypes via gene transfer.\n\n【302】Therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain: potential application of pharmacosynthetics and optogenetics.\n\n【303】Chemogenetics is based on designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). The DREADDs are G protein–coupled receptors artificially engineered to respond to nanomolar concentrations of otherwise biologically inert ligands, such as clozapine-N-oxide.\n\n【304】Controlling signaling with a specifically designed Gi-coupled receptor.\n\n【305】Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.\n\n【306】Preliminary studies in rodents suggest that selective expression of DREADDs in nociceptive neurons via gene transfer might allow efficient and highly precise exogenous control of nociceptive signaling.\n\n【307】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【308】Mu opioid receptor modulation of dopamine neurons in the periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe: a role in regulation of pain.\n\n【309】(457) Gi-DREADD expression in TRPV1-Cre mice produces ligand-dependent behavioral inhibition to noxious heat, but ligand-independent changes in sensory neurons.\n\n【310】Analogously, optogenetics enables tunable manipulation of cell phenotypes using light.\n\n【311】Orderly recruitment of motor units under optical control in vivo.\n\n【312】Iyer et al\n\n【313】Virally mediated optogenetic excitation and inhibition of pain in freely moving nontransgenic mice.\n\n【314】found that AAV-mediated gene transfer of eNpHR3.0, a chloride channel activated by yellow light, to the DRG sensory neurons results in reduction of allodynia in rodent models that is tunable by illumination by light of the respective wavelength.\n\n【315】### Pathways to Clinical Translation\n\n【316】Herpes simplex virus encoding preproenkephalin, administered as a series of intradermal injections for intractable locoregional pain caused by cancer, is the only vector so far tested in humans in the context of gene therapy for pain.\n\n【317】Gene therapy for pain: results of a phase I clinical trial.\n\n【318】A phase 1 clinical trial reported safety of the treatment, but the lack of a blinded control group, a design typical of a phase 1 trial, did not allow any conclusions regarding efficacy. A subsequent blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial was initiated in 2011 and completed in November 2013 (according to ClinicalTrials.gov ).\n\n【319】Of note, HSV was translated from rodent studies directly into clinical trials without testing the approach in a large-animal model as an intermediate step. Should the clinical trial fail to find analgesic efficacy, it may be difficult to discern whether the HSV gene transfer technology or the therapeutic gene was the cause of failure. In such a situation, only large-animal studies may be able to further the understanding.\n\n【320】Adeno-associated virus–based gene therapy has not been tested in patients with chronic pain but in numerous other clinical settings, including phase 1, 2, and 3 trials for a large variety of neurologic and nonneurologic therapeutic applications.\n\n【321】In the field of AAV for pain, we translated the approach into large-animal models, first reporting differences in gene transfer outcomes compared with rodents when the IT route was tested.\n\n【322】High cerebrospinal fluid levels of interleukin-10 attained by AAV in dogs.\n\n【323】Subsequently, we developed a method of locoregional delivery of AAV to DRG neurons in a large-animal (swine) model using computed tomography fluoroscopy.\n\n【324】Minimally invasive convection-enhanced delivery of biologics into dorsal root ganglia: validation in the pig model and prospective modeling in humans.\n\n【325】This study recreated the gene transfer outcomes of the original rodent studies of intraganglionic AAV delivery while introducing an image-guided intervention technique and thereby obviating the need for open surgical exposure of the DRG that was used in rodents. Examination of the comparative anatomy of porcine and human spines indicates that similar, minimally invasive intraganglionic injection could also be performed in the clinical setting.\n\n【326】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【327】Interventional pain specialists have a unique skill set to translate gene therapy–based treatment approaches into novel clinical treatments for locoregional pain.

The failure of systemic analgesic drugs, such as opioids, is often due to their off-target toxicity, development of tolerance, and abuse potential. Interventional pain procedures provide target specificity but lack pharmacologically selective agents with long-term efficacy. Gene therapy vectors are a new tool for the development of molecularly selective pain therapies, which have already been proved to provide durable analgesia in preclinical models. Taken together, advances in image-guided delivery and gene therapy may lead to a new class of dual selective analgesic treatments integrating the molecular selectivity of analgesic genes with the anatomic selectivity of interventional delivery techniques.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AAV ( adeno-associated virus ), Cav ( voltage-gated calcium channel ), CCD ( conventional drug discovery ), CNS ( central nervous system ), CRISPR/Cas9 ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 ), DRG ( dorsal root ganglion ), DREADD ( designer receptors activated by designer drugs ), ED ( epidural ), GABA ( γ-aminobutyric acid ), HSV ( herpes simplex virus ), IL-10 ( interleukin 10 ), IT ( intrathecal ), Kv ( voltage-gated potassium channel ), Nav ( voltage-gated sodium channel ), NK1 ( neurokinin type 1 ), NMDA ( N-methyl-d-aspartate ), shRNA ( small hairpin RNA ), TRP ( transient receptor potential channel ), TRPV1 ( transient receptor potential channel, subfamily V, member 1 )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .™\n\n【9】Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【10】**MOC Credit Statement:** Successful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1 MOC points in the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program.

Specifically, the 2 most prevalent causes of chronic pain in the population were low back pain and knee pain, as documented by a survey performed by the National Center for Health Statistics, whereby 28.1% of adult Americans reported low back pain and 19.5% localized knee pain during the past 3 months.\n\n【23】Institute of Medicine  \nRelieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research.\n\n<mark>【24】The National Academies Press , Washington, DC 2011</mark>\n\n【25】Locoregional pain is also responsible for a substantial portion of the financial burden of chronic pain. Low back pain is estimated to cost $30 billion in direct health care expenditures and $100 to $200 billion in decreased wages and disability in the United States annually.\n\n【26】Soni A.

Fifteen percent of patients with cancer pain experience anatomically localized pain, such as pain originating from bone metastases or neuropathic pain from nerve compression or invasion.\n\n【31】Cancer pain management.\n\n【32】Pain in these patients often cannot be adequately controlled by systemic analgesic treatments because the high doses needed for analgesia trigger intolerable adverse effects.\n\n【33】Understanding the experience of pain in terminally ill patients.\n\n【34】Although the best short-term outcomes in these patients are, therefore, frequently achieved by regional administration of local anesthetics or by selective neurolysis, neither approach is durable.\n\n【35】Cancer pain management.\n\n【36】The Search for Systemic Analgesic Therapies\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【37】### The Conventional Drug Discovery Paradigm\n\n【38】Current analgesic therapies fail in a substantial number of patients with chronic pain.\n\n【39】Cancer pain management.\n\n【40】This failure is most striking in cancer pain, where pain remains inadequately controlled in 50% of all patients.\n\n【41】Prevalence of undertreatment in cancer pain: a review of published literature.\n\n【42】Despite the search for novel analgesic treatments during the past few decades, currently available analgesic drugs exert their effect through very few categories of molecular targets.\n\n【43】A capsule history of pain management.\n\n【44】CT-guided injection of a TRPV1 agonist around dorsal root ganglia decreases pain transmission in swine.\n\n【45】Recent advances in neurobiology of nociception, however, identified a variety of candidate therapeutic targets located in the peripheral nervous system that are not used by current analgesic drugs. Important examples include ion channels expressed by primary sensory neurons, cytokines that play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, and several inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters that modulate nociceptive signaling.\n\n【46】Characterization of these nociceptive mechanisms led to a search for a new generation of analgesic drugs using the techniques of conventional drug discovery (CDD); CDD, ie, the search for new small-molecule therapeutic entities, largely relies on empirical screening of candidate compounds. Two approaches are used by the pharmaceutical industry and academic laboratories involved in CDD. First, phenotype-directed screening seeks to identify chemical entities that have a desirable effect on the phenotype of a disease model without previous knowledge of their molecular mechanism of action.\n\n【47】Phenotypic screening in cancer drug discovery: past, present and future.\n\n【48】Various assays modeling the disease phenotype on the level of a cell or an organism have been described.\n\n【49】Modern phenotypic drug discovery is a viable, neoclassic pharma strategy.\n\n【50】Efficacious compounds are then examined for molecular mechanism of action using reverse biology techniques. Second, target-directed screening relies on biochemical knowledge of specific molecular targets and uses small-molecule screening strategies, typically by examining large libraries of compounds.\n\n【51】Discovery of small molecule cancer drugs: successes, challenges and opportunities.\n\n【52】The actual biologic effect of thus discovered compounds is then tested in vivo in disease models. Although there has been a substantial effort to facilitate CDD by using high-throughput assays and by implementing genomic data, the discovery of new small-molecule drugs is declining in all medical fields. In fact, pharmaceutical industry data show that the number of truly innovative drugs (defined as new molecular entities) approved by the major regulatory bodies (such as the US Food and Drug Administration) has been decreasing by 50% every 5 years worldwide.\n\n【53】How to improve R&D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge.\n\n【54】PAREXEL Biopharmaceutical Statistical Sourcebook 2014/2015.\n\n<mark>【55】Parexel Intl Corp , Waltham, MA 2014</mark>\n\n【56】How were new medicines discovered?\n\n【57】Although multiple candidate analgesic agents that had been identified through CDD were tested in preclinical models, the success regarding clinical translation has been very limited, as reviewed next.\n\n【58】### Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels\n\n【59】Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na <sub>v </sub> ) are responsible for the formation of action potentials in all excitatory cells. Several Na <sub>v </sub> subtypes are expressed by primary sensory neurons but not by other excitatory cells, such as neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) or myocytes.\n\n【60】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【61】Specifically, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8, and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.9 have been found to be involved in nociception. All of these channels undergo upregulation in rodent models of nerve injury or inflammatory and neuropathic pain.\n\n【62】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【63】In addition, mutations in genes encoding these channels are associated with inherited pain disorders in humans. Gain-of-function mutations of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7 result in inherited erythromelalgia, an autosomal dominant disorder manifesting by extreme heat hyperalgesia.\n\n【64】Erythermalgia: molecular basis for an inherited pain syndrome.\n\n【65】Although clinical manifestations of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8 are less clearly defined, they have also been associated with the development of painful neuropathies and insensitivity to pain, respectively, in humans.\n\n【66】Pain as a channelopathy.\n\n【67】A variety of molecular entities have been tested in the preclinical setting that selectively inactivate Na <sub>v </sub> , including toxins isolated from tarantula venom or small-molecule compounds identified via target-directed screening.\n\n【68】Inhibitors of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7: patent applications since 2010.\n\n【69】Engineering potent and selective analogues of GpTx-1, a tarantula venom peptide antagonist of the Na(V)1.7 sodium channel.\n\n【70】Identification and characterization of proTx-III \\[μ-TRTX-Tp1a\\], a new voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor from venom of the tarantula thrixopelma pruriens.\n\n【71】Three peptide modulators of the human voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7, an important analgesic target, from the venom of an Australian tarantula.\n\n【72】Yet, despite an ongoing effort, none of these agents have been approved as a drug for use in humans.\n\n【73】### Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels\n\n【74】Similar to Na <sub>v </sub> , voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca <sub>v </sub> ) expressed in primary sensory neurons result in an increased firing frequency.\n\n【75】Voltage-gated calcium channels as targets for the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【76】At the level of the spinal cord, the upregulation of Ca <sub>v </sub> secondary to nerve injury has been described in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【77】The physiology, pathology, and pharmacology of voltage-gated calcium channels and their future therapeutic potential.\n\n【78】Specifically, Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 seems to play a critical role in neuropathic pain. Inactivation of this channel by channel-binding peptide 3 inhibits trafficking of Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 to the cytoplasmic membrane and, thereby, diminishes membrane excitability of nociceptive neurons, resulting in attenuation of nocifensive behavior in rodent models.\n\n【79】Suppression of inflammatory and neuropathic pain by uncoupling CRMP-2 from the presynaptic Ca  channel complex.\n\n【80】Gabapentinoids are the only class of systemic analgesic drugs that may exert their therapeutic effect through interacting with Ca <sub>v </sub> . Gabapentinoids were initially conceived as orally available analogues of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, for the treatment of seizure disorders.\n\n【81】Calcium channel a2–d ligands: gabapentin and pregabalin.\n\n【82】Although the antiepileptic efficacy of gabapentinoids did not hold up to the initial promise, they have been found to be efficacious for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【83】Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults.\n\n【84】Neuropathic pain: principles of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【85】Although the mechanism of action of gabapentinoids has not been fully elucidated, they have been found to bind to the α2δ-1 subunit of the Ca <sub>v </sub> , and it is, therefore, thought that they may, at least in part, exert analgesia through inhibition of Ca <sub>v </sub> .\n\n【86】Implications and mechanism of action of gabapentin in neuropathic pain.\n\n【87】A search for selective and potent Ca <sub>v </sub> antagonists identified ω-conotoxin MVIIA, a neurotoxic peptide isolated in the 1980s from the venom of marine snails belonging to the genus _Conus_ .\n\n【88】Neuronal calcium channel antagonists: discrimination between calcium channel subtypes using omega-conotoxin from _Conus magus_ venom.\n\n【89】Peptide neurotoxins from fish-hunting cone snails.\n\n【90】ω-Conotoxin MVIIA selectively blocks N-type Ca <sub>v </sub> present in nociceptive fibers. Despite efforts over 2 decades, a search for a drug with the mechanism of action analogous to ω-conotoxin MVIIA that would be efficacious and nontoxic after systemic administration has failed. Only in 2004, ziconotide, a ω-conotoxin MVIIA derivative, was approved for localized intrathecal (IT) delivery in patients with severe, otherwise intractable pain.\n\n【91】Intrathecal ziconotide: a review of its use in patients with chronic pain refractory to other systemic or intrathecal analgesics.\n\n【92】### Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels\n\n【93】Voltage-gated potassium channels (K <sub>v </sub> ) are also critical determinants of the firing frequency, and their downregulation results in membrane hyperexcitability.\n\n【94】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【95】Distinct potassium channels on pain-sensing neurons.\n\n【96】Although several potassium channels are expressed by primary nociceptive fibers, K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 has been most thoroughly studied in association with chronic pain and has been found to be markedly downregulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in the setting of nerve injury and neuropathic pain.\n\n【97】A long noncoding RNA contributes to neuropathic pain by silencing Kcna2 in primary afferent neurons.\n\n【98】Yet, no analgesic drugs that modulate nociceptive signaling through K <sub>v </sub> are clinically available.\n\n【99】### Ligand-Gated Cation Channels\n\n【100】Ligand-gated ion channels are an attractive target for drug development because their endogenous ligands can serve as a molecular pattern for discovery of compounds with analogous pharmacodynamics but therapeutically more favorable pharmacokinetics. The _N_ \\-methyl- d \\-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor mediates long-term potentiation, which has been found to play a key role in the development of chronic pain.\n\n【101】NMDA receptors and memory encoding.\n\n【102】Long-term potentiation at spinal C-fiber synapses: a target for pathological pain.\n\n【103】The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, a dissociative general anesthetic agent, is used in certain subgroups of chronic pain, but data on its efficacy are inconclusive.\n\n【104】Wherefore ketamine?\n\n【105】Effects of low-dose intranasal (S)-ketamine in patients with neuropathic pain.\n\n【106】Ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for cancer pain.\n\n【107】Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of subcutaneous ketamine in the management of cancer pain.\n\n【108】Ketamine as adjuvant analgesic to opioids: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review.\n\n【109】Despite an ongoing research effort, no clinically available NMDA antagonist more specific to nociception has been found.\n\n【110】Transient receptor potential channels (TRP) constitute another family of ligand-gated cation channels. Several TRP are expressed by the primary sensory neurons and are typically activated by noxious stimuli.\n\n【111】TRP channels and pain.\n\n【112】TRP, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) is a particularly attractive target for drug development because it is almost exclusively expressed by primary nociceptive neurons and its inactivation results in loss of pain and heat sensation while other sensory modalities remain intact.\n\n【113】The cloned capsaicin receptor integrates multiple pain-producing stimuli.\n\n【114】The capsaicin receptor: a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway.\n\n【115】Capsaicin, the pungent substance in chili peppers, is the only analgesic agent acting through TRPV1 clinically available to date and is used in the form of a patch to treat locoregional pain.\n\n【116】Topical capsaicin formulations in the management of neuropathic pain.\n\n【117】Capsaicin is a reversible TRPV1 agonist and is thought to induce analgesia by desensitizing TRPV1+ nerve fibers.\n\n【118】Capsaicin-based therapies for pain control.\n\n【119】A more intuitive approach to using the TRPV1 pathway is the use of TRPV1 receptor antagonists. Although a variety of TRPV1 antagonists have been tested in preclinical models, none have been successfully translated to the clinical setting owing to their off-target adverse effects, which included hyperthermia and impaired noxious heat sensation, after systemic delivery.\n\n【120】Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 antagonists: a patent review (2011-2014).\n\n【121】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【122】Glial cells have been reported to initiate and maintain neurogenic inflammation in the setting of chronic neuropathic pain, resulting in increased neuronal excitability.\n\n【123】Importance of glial activation in neuropathic pain.\n\n【124】The effect of glia on the primary sensory neurons may be mediated by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1β, and various chemokines.\n\n【125】Spinal interleukin-10 therapy to treat peripheral neuropathic pain.\n\n【126】The proinflammatory and pronociceptive effect of these cytokines is countered by anti-inflammatory cytokines. The principal anti-inflammatory cytokine is interleukin 10 (IL-10). Therefore, IL-10 is an attractive agent to treat neuropathic pain, which is known to be relatively refractory to opioid analgesics.\n\n【127】The IT administration of recombinant IL-10 has, indeed, been found to reduce neuroinflammation and allodynia in animal models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【128】Snake venom phospholipase A2s (Asp49 and Lys49) induce mechanical allodynia upon peri-sciatic administration: involvement of spinal cord glia, proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide.\n\n【129】Cytokine involvement in dynorphin-induced allodynia.\n\n【130】However, direct delivery of the recombinant IL-10 was found not to be feasible for clinical translation because of its high cost, its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and its half-life of only 2 hours in the cerebrospinal fluid after IT delivery.\n\n【131】Interleukin-10 as a CNS therapeutic: the obstacle of the blood-brain/blood-spinal cord barrier.\n\n【132】Controlling pathological pain by adenovirally driven spinal production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【133】### Pain-Modulating Neurotransmitters\n\n【134】Development and maintenance of chronic pain states is associated with alteration of the neurotransmitter milieu in the CNS.\n\n【135】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【136】The neuroinhibitory transmitter GABA is known to inhibit neuropathic pain signaling on the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【137】Partial peripheral nerve injury promotes a selective loss of GABAergic inhibition in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【138】Although 2 classes of GABAergic drugs—baclofen and benzodiazepines—are used in clinical practice in select patients, their effect is not selective to the nociceptive pathways, resulting in a very low therapeutic index in the context of pain management.\n\n【139】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【140】Despite substantial effort, novel and more selective analgesic agents using the GABAergic pathway are not clinically available.\n\n【141】Another neurotransmitter involved in pain signaling is substance P. Substance P is produced by neurons throughout the peripheral nervous system and CNS, and it exerts its effect by activating neurokinin type 1 (NK <sub>1 </sub> ) receptor.\n\n【142】Neurobiology of substance P and the NK1 receptor.\n\n【143】Studies using NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor knockout mice and NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists in rodents suggested that blocking substance P signaling would result in profound analgesia, thereby generating widespread enthusiasm regarding clinical translation.\n\n【144】The substance P receptor antagonist CP-99,994 reduces acute postoperative pain.\n\n【145】The NK1 receptor is essential for the full expression of noxious inhibitory controls in the mouse.\n\n【146】However, clinical studies of several NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists given by the systemic route reported an almost complete lack of analgesic efficacy in humans.\n\n【147】Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists: a comprehensive patent survey.\n\n【148】The failure of NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists may have been considered a breaking point in analgesic drug discovery and development as it brought the realization that there may be no magic bullet consisting of a chemical compound targeting a single nociceptive mechanism with a degree of nociceptive specificity that could rival (or exceed) the analgesic activity of opioids.\n\n【149】Locoregional Analgesics: An Alternative Approach to Drug Development\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【150】### Clinical Interventional Pain Procedures for Locoregional Pain Syndromes\n\n【151】Interventional drug delivery for locoregional chronic pain is one of the most common procedures performed in clinical practice.\n\n【152】The role of invasive pain management modalities in the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【153】Multiple techniques that target various pain generators under imaging guidance are used.\n\n【154】Interventional approaches to pain management.\n\n【155】The most frequent targets for interventional drug delivery are the spinal nerves, which are accessed either IT or via the epidural (ED) route under fluoroscopic guidance. More than 2.5 million ED injections were performed in 2013 in the United States.\n\n【156】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, _Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting_ , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.\n\n【157】Although all these procedures are remarkably safe, their efficacy has recently come under scrutiny.\n\n【158】Pain Management Injection Therapies for Low Back Pain.\n\n【159】Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , Rockville, MD 2015\n\n【160】For the ED injection, there is evidence of moderate efficacy for some pain syndromes, such as lumbar radiculitis, but no evidence of efficacy in others, such as spinal stenosis (neurogenic intermittent claudication).\n\n【161】A randomized trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis.\n\n【162】The chief reason for the limited efficacy of interventional procedures for chronic pain is the small repertoire of analgesic agents available for these routes of delivery. For IT delivery, the available drugs are limited to opioids, benzodiazepines, baclofen, ziconotide, local anesthetics, and ketamine.\n\n【163】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【164】For ED delivery, local anesthetics and corticosteroids constitute the only agents available to date. The pharmacologic effect of these agents is relatively nonspecific, and its duration is only transient in most patients, requiring either implantation of a pump for the IT route or repeated interventions for the ED route; on average patients receive 2 to 3 injections of ED corticosteroids per year.\n\n【165】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, _Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting_ , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.\n\n【166】Although the discovery of novel analgesic agents specifically designed for anatomically selective routes of delivery, such as ED, is a major unmet clinical need, this area has not been appreciably explored by the pharmaceutical industry and research laboratories. The search for novel molecular targets has focused on systemically administered drugs, whereas drug development for localized delivery mainly involved optimizing the formulation of already available agents for ED delivery, such as depot liposomal forms of corticosteroids extending their biological half-life (currently in the phase of preclinical development).\n\n【167】A lipid based depot (DepoFoam technology) for sustained release drug delivery.\n\n【168】It is notable that although the field of CDD focused on systemic analgesic drugs, the major truly innovative agent recently approved for the treatment of chronic pain, ziconotide, is a locally delivered (IT) agent.\n\n【169】### Requirements for a New Generation of Analgesic Drugs for Interventional Delivery\n\n【170】A desirable agent for localized, interventional delivery would ideally meet 2 requirements that differ from systemic drugs developed via CCD: (1) prolonged or even permanent activity after a single administration and (2) ability to penetrate the target tissue locally without a need for sufficient bioavailability after systemic administration and for lack of off-target toxicity. Although the first requirement raises a conceptual bar that the candidate interventional agents need to reach compared with most systemic drugs currently under development via CDD, the second requirement lowers this bar substantially. The combination of these 2 requirements, ie, the need for long-term effect after a single administration and lessened concern for off-target distribution and toxicity, seems to be uniquely suited for an emerging drug discovery and disease treatment paradigm: gene therapy.\n\n【171】Gene Therapy\n------------\n\n【172】### Beyond Hereditary Disorders\n\n【173】Gene therapy was initially developed to correct dysfunctional genes in rare monogenic disorders, such as inborn errors of metabolism or blood clotting disorders.\n\n【174】History of gene therapy.\n\n【175】However, the greatest potential impact of gene therapy may lie in the treatment of common, acquired disorders.\n\n【176】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【177】Cardioprotection by gene therapy: a review paper on behalf of the Working Group on Drug Cardiotoxicity and Cardioprotection of the Italian Society of Cardiology.\n\n【178】The field of gene therapy reached critical benchmarks during the past several years.\n\n【179】Gene therapy clinical trials worldwide to 2012: an update.\n\n【180】Gene therapy returns to centre stage.\n\n【181】In 2012, alipogene tiparvovec became the first gene therapy product to be commercially approved in Europe (for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency).\n\n【182】Endgame: glybera finally recommended for approval as the first gene therapy drug in the European Union.\n\n【183】In 2015, talimogene laherparepvec was the first gene vector brought to market in the United States (for the treatment of inoperable malignant melanoma and head and neck cancer).\n\n【184】Talimogene laherparepvec: first global approval.\n\n【185】Talimogene laherparepvec improves durable response rate in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n【186】### Gene Vectors: A Distinct Class of Therapeutic Agents\n\n【187】In gene therapy, a vector serves as an intracellular delivery mechanism for the instruction set provided by the therapeutic gene (transgene) to the targeted cells.\n\n【188】Gene therapy—basic principles and the road from bench to bedside.\n\n【189】in: Gad S.C. Rubany G.M. Pharmaceutical Sciences Encyclopedia. John Wiley & Sons Inc , Hoboken, NJ 2010\n\n【190】The encoded proteins or peptides are expressed by the target cells, thereby harnessing their machinery to produce the therapeutic substance locally. Vectors are the most commonly genetically engineered viruses whose ability to replicate is artificially disrupted and part or all of their genome is replaced by a transgene of choice.\n\n【191】Viral vectors for gene therapy: the art of turning infectious agents into vehicles of therapeutics.\n\n【192】Unique from other drug constructs, the viral vector–transgene package is modular. The surface characteristics of the viral shell (capsid serotype) will determine its tissue selectivity (tropism), and this can be varied independently of the carried transgene. This provides great flexibility in testing large numbers of potential transgene products directed at varying molecular targets. This approach also enables overexpressing, silencing, or de novo expressing of virtually any gene, thereby affecting any signaling pathway. A further variable that can be introduced is selective anatomic delivery, which may augment or overcome the challenges of insufficient tissue tropism.\n\n【193】### Primary Sensory Neurons as the Target of Gene Therapy for Pain\n\n【194】The primary sensory neurons, as the point of aggregation of nociceptive signaling from the periphery, are a rational target of gene therapy.\n\n【195】Nociceptors: the sensors of the pain pathway.\n\n【196】These neurons reside in the DRG, a structure that is anatomically accessible, obviating the risk of CNS instrumentation.

Gene therapy may be directed to DRG neurons either by transducing them directly or by transducing anatomically or functionally related structures, such as the glia or the meninges, whereby nociception is indirectly modulated by their interaction with DRG neurons.\n\n【200】### Targeting the Primary Sensory Neurons by Gene Vectors\n\n【201】To attain gene transfer to the primary sensory neurons, several routes of vector delivery have been explored. First, replication-incompetent herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors delivered by skin inoculation were pioneered by Fink, Glorioso, and others.\n\n【202】Deletion of multiple immediate-early genes from herpes simplex virus reduces cytotoxicity and permits long-term gene expression in neurons.\n\n【203】Engineering herpes simplex virus vectors for CNS applications.\n\n【204】This approach takes advantage of the inherent ability of this virus to undergo retrograde axonal transport from the sensory nerve terminal to the cell body and, thereby, to transduce DRG neurons whose dendrites originate in the injected sensory field of the skin. Although this selectivity makes HSV attractive for gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system, it also restricts its utility for other gene therapy applications; the overall translational experience with this vector remains, therefore, relatively limited.\n\n【205】Second, IT injection of several serotypes of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors was found to selectively transduce the primary sensory neurons.\n\n【206】AAV8(gfp) preferentially targets large diameter dorsal root ganglion neurones after both intra-dorsal root ganglion and intrathecal injection.\n\n【207】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【208】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【209】Recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (rAAV2/6)-mediated gene transfer to nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery.\n\n【210】Differential adeno-associated virus mediated gene transfer to sensory neurons following intrathecal delivery by direct lumbar puncture.\n\n【211】Adeno-associated virus is the leading vector type across many gene therapy fields because it is not associated with any disease in any species, is devoid of any viral genes, and yields stable gene expression for months to years.\n\n【212】Adeno-associated virus: from defective virus to effective vector.\n\n【213】The initial safety concerns regarding AAV vectors, which included insertional mutagenesis, germline transmission, replication escape, and dissemination of the vector to the public domain, have been thoroughly addressed in the field and do not seem to be applicable in the context of human trials, as previously reviewed in detail elsewhere.\n\n【214】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【215】Furthermore, the difficulties with large-scale manufacturing of AAV vectors, which were holding back the clinical translation of AAV-based gene therapy, have recently been overcome.\n\n【216】Large-scale recombinant adeno-associated virus production.\n\n【217】A relative restriction associated with AAV is the need to switch capsids if serial treatments are needed because serologic immunity renders the readministration of a vector with the same serotypes ineffective.\n\n【218】Immune responses to AAV vectors: overcoming barriers to successful gene therapy.\n\n【219】In addition to AAV, IT delivery of other vector types, such lentiviruses or AAV plasmid DNA, was also tested for gene therapy for pain. Although efficacious in certain therapeutic strategies, these vectors did not transduce the primary sensory neurons but rather glial cells or the meninges.\n\n【220】Gene therapy for the treatment of chronic peripheral nervous system pain.\n\n【221】Third, to further improve the efficiency of gene transfer, several groups have targeted the nociceptive neurons directly by intraganglionic injection of AAV in rodents.\n\n【222】Intraganglionic AAV6 results in efficient and long-term gene transfer to peripheral sensory nervous system in adult rats.\n\n【223】Comparison of AAV serotypes for gene delivery to dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【224】Direct injection into the dorsal root ganglion: technical, behavioral, and histological observations.\n\n【225】Although this approach led to highly efficacious and selective gene transfer to the DRGs in a rodent model, an open surgical procedure consisting of paravertebral exposure and foraminotomy was required.\n\n【226】Molecular Targets of Gene Therapy for Pain\n------------------------------------------\n\n【227】The molecular selectivity of gene therapy has been of great interest because it enables utilization of antinociceptive mechanisms that have not been accessible by conventional agents. A variety of approaches have been found to be efficacious in animal models of chronic pain. Important examples of the molecular targets used to date by gene therapy for pain are (1) spinal opioid delivery, (2) anti-inflammatory cytokines, and (3) ion channels and neurotrophic growth factor.\n\n【228】### Spinal Opioid Delivery\n\n【229】The opioid system is an attractive target for gene therapy because of the robust clinical experience with exogenous opioids. Although opioids modulate pain processing at multiple levels of the nervous system, delivery of exogenous opioids to the spinal IT space is sufficient to achieve analgesia.\n\n【230】Intrathecal opioids for intractable pain syndromes.\n\n【231】Gene transfer of opioid genes selectively to DRG neurons has been found to reduce chronic pain in animal models of locoregional pain (as reviewed next). This approach may eliminate the toxicity of exogenously administered opioids, which is attributed to their extraspinal effects in the CNS and in peripheral tissues.\n\n【232】Side effects of intrathecal and epidural opioids.\n\n【233】Long-term opioid management for chronic noncancer pain.\n\n【234】A systematic review of the use of opioid medication for those with moderate to severe cancer pain and renal impairment: a European Palliative Care Research Collaborative opioid guidelines project.\n\n【235】A review of potential adverse effects of long-term opioid therapy: a practitioner's guide.\n\n【236】The prevalence, severity, and impact of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: results of a US and European Patient Survey (PROBE 1).\n\n【237】The effects of opioids and opioid analogs on animal and human endocrine systems.\n\n【238】Coronary heart disease outcomes among chronic opioid and cyclooxygenase-2 users compared with a general population cohort.\n\n【239】Opioids and immune modulation: more questions than answers.\n\n【240】Two principal strategies using opioid signaling for analgesia by gene therapy have been described. First, several groups have used transgenes encoding endogenous opioid agonists delivered to the DRGs. Goss et al\n\n【241】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【242】used preproenkephalin, a δ-opioid receptor agonist, and endomorphine-2, a μ-opioid receptor agonist, delivered by HSV vectors. We used AAV to deliver prepro-ß-endorphin, an artificial opioid precursor of the μ-opioid agonist peptide ß-endorphin that is engineered to be secreted in a stimulus-independent manner via the constitutive secretory pathway.\n\n【243】Retrovirus-mediated expression of an artificial beta-endorphin precursor in primary fibroblasts.\n\n【244】Administration of these therapeutic genes resulted in robust reduction of allodynia or hyperalgesia in multiple rodent models of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain.\n\n【245】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【246】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【247】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【248】Herpes vector-mediated expression of proenkephalin reduces bone cancer pain.\n\n【249】The second strategy to harness the opioid system for gene therapy of pain consists of transferring genes that encode an opioid receptor. Xu et al\n\n【250】Adeno-associated viral transfer of opioid receptor gene to primary sensory neurons: a strategy to increase opioid antinociception.\n\n【251】Efficiencies of transgene expression in nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors.\n\n【252】reported this approach several years ago, but no recent follow-up studies seem to have been attempted. Another approach testing an opioid receptor mutant was reported more recently.\n\n【253】Intrathecal delivery of a mutant micro-opioid receptor activated by naloxone as a possible antinociceptive paradigm.\n\n【254】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【255】Gene transfer of IL-10 by several vector systems, including HSV and AAV, has been extensively tested in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【256】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【257】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【258】Controlling neuropathic pain by adeno-associated virus driven production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【259】HSV-mediated transfer of interleukin-10 reduces inflammatory pain through modulation of membrane tumor necrosis factor α in spinal cord microglia.\n\n【260】Production of IL-10 resulted in marked reduction of allodynia and hyperalgesia, a finding verified independently by multiple groups. In addition to IL-10, a tumor necrosis factor–soluble receptor delivered via HSV-mediated gene transfer reduced allodynia in a rodent model of varicella zoster virus–induced pain.\n\n【261】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【262】### Ion Channels\n\n【263】Discovery of the voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels that are specific to nociception and the failure to generate corresponding conventional analgesic drugs has prompted an effort to use these targets via gene therapy. Two approaches have been used: (1) overexpression of ion channels responsible for membrane hyperpolarization by delivering vectors that carry the gene encoding for the respective channel and (2) downregulation of ion channels responsible for membrane depolarization by RNA interference, ie, by delivering vectors encoding small interfering RNA or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) complementary to the sequence of the respective ion channel, or by gene transfer of genes whose products deactivate these channels.\n\n【264】In the first approach, AAV-mediated gene transfer of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 in a rat model of neuropathic pain resulted in normalization of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 expression that had been downregulated in the context of nerve injury. This was associated with a decrease in allodynia in the treated animals.\n\n【265】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【266】Similarly, overexpression of the glycine receptor (a ligand-gated chloride channel) in the sensory fibers mediated by HSV resulted in attenuation of hyperalgesia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【267】HSV delivery of a ligand-regulated endogenous ion channel gene to sensory neurons results in pain control following channel activation.\n\n【268】In the second approach, Samad et al\n\n【269】Virus-mediated shRNA knockdown of Na(v)1.3 in rat dorsal root ganglion attenuates nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.\n\n【270】found that knockout of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 by shRNA encoded by an AAV vector delivered into the DRGs attenuated allodynia in the experimental animals. Similarly, knockout of the NR subunit of the NMDA receptor in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord via AAV-mediated transfer of the respective small interfering RNA reduced spinal NMDA currents as well as nociceptive behavior in a model of chronic inflammatory pain.\n\n【271】siRNA-mediated knockdown of the NR1 subunit gene of the NMDA receptor attenuates formalin-induced pain behaviors in adult rats.\n\n【272】A conditional deletion of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in adult spinal cord dorsal horn reduces NMDA currents and injury-induced pain.\n\n【273】Downregulation of the TRPV1 signaling via gene transfer of either shRNA delivered by IT AAV or the dominant negative (poreless) form of the protein delivered by HSV has been found to reduce allodynia in rat models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【274】Intrathecal AAV serotype 9-mediated delivery of shRNA against TRPV1 attenuates thermal hyperalgesia in a mouse model of peripheral nerve injury.\n\n【275】Herpes simplex virus vector-mediated gene delivery of poreless TRPV1 channels reduces bladder overactivity and nociception in rats.\n\n【276】An HSV vector system for selection of ligand-gated ion channel modulators.\n\n【277】Fischer et al\n\n【278】Sustained relief of neuropathic pain by AAV-targeted expression of CBD3 peptide in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【279】downregulated Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 by AAV-mediated gene transfer of Ca  channel-binding peptide 3, also resulting in attenuation of neuropathic pain in the rat model. Ma et al\n\n【280】Expression of inwardly rectifying potassium channels by an inducible adenoviral vector reduced the neuronal hyperexcitability and hyperalgesia produced by chronic compression of the spinal ganglion.\n\n【281】found that overexpression of Kir2.1, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, delivered by an adenoviral vector into the DRGs suppresses neuronal excitability and prevents the development of hyperalgesia in rodents.\n\n【282】### Neurotransmitters and Growth Factors\n\n【283】Delivery of AAV or HSV vectors encoding several isoforms of the GABA gene showed reduction of allodynia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【284】Constitutive GABA expression via a recombinant adeno-associated virus consistently attenuates neuropathic pain.\n\n【285】Vector-mediated release of GABA attenuates pain-related behaviors and reduces Na(V)1.7 in DRG neurons.\n\n【286】The AAV- or HSV-mediated gene transfer of several neurotrophic growth factors has been investigated as a novel approach to treat chronic pain by reversing the synaptic remodeling described in chronic pain states. This approach could be tested only by gene therapy because conventional pharmacotherapy could not attain target-specific, long-term delivery of an active agent. Several neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, erythropoietin, glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, were found to reduce pain behavior in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【287】Amelioration of chronic neuropathic pain after partial nerve injury by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated over-expression of BDNF in the rat spinal cord.\n\n【288】Neuroprotective effect of herpes simplex virus-mediated gene transfer of erythropoietin in hyperglycemic dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【289】HSV-mediated gene transfer of the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor provides an antiallodynic effect on neuropathic pain.\n\n【290】Long-term neuroprotection achieved with latency-associated promoter-driven herpes simplex virus gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system.\n\n【291】### Gene Editing\n\n【292】Gene editing is a technique for highly targeted deletion, insertion, or substitution of a desired sequence of a genome.\n\n【293】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【294】Although multiple gene editing techniques have been described, the field underwent a breakthrough in 2012 when Barrangou, Doudna, Jinek, and others described the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in conjunction with CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9).\n\n【295】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【296】Genome-scale engineering for systems and synthetic biology.\n\n【297】A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.\n\n【298】The CRISPR craze.\n\n【299】CRISPR/Cas9 allows precise and cost-effective gene editing in vivo, and is poised to revolutionize gene therapy. It seems conceivable that in vivo gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 delivered by gene vector may give rise to a whole new field of pain therapy.\n\n【300】### Chemogenetics and Optogenetics\n\n【301】Chemogenetics and optogenetics represent 2 emerging approaches to selectively and, unlike traditional gene therapy, reversibly manipulate cell phenotypes via gene transfer.\n\n【302】Therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain: potential application of pharmacosynthetics and optogenetics.\n\n【303】Chemogenetics is based on designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). The DREADDs are G protein–coupled receptors artificially engineered to respond to nanomolar concentrations of otherwise biologically inert ligands, such as clozapine-N-oxide.\n\n【304】Controlling signaling with a specifically designed Gi-coupled receptor.\n\n【305】Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.\n\n【306】Preliminary studies in rodents suggest that selective expression of DREADDs in nociceptive neurons via gene transfer might allow efficient and highly precise exogenous control of nociceptive signaling.\n\n【307】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【308】Mu opioid receptor modulation of dopamine neurons in the periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe: a role in regulation of pain.\n\n【309】(457) Gi-DREADD expression in TRPV1-Cre mice produces ligand-dependent behavioral inhibition to noxious heat, but ligand-independent changes in sensory neurons.\n\n【310】Analogously, optogenetics enables tunable manipulation of cell phenotypes using light.\n\n【311】Orderly recruitment of motor units under optical control in vivo.\n\n【312】Iyer et al\n\n【313】Virally mediated optogenetic excitation and inhibition of pain in freely moving nontransgenic mice.\n\n【314】found that AAV-mediated gene transfer of eNpHR3.0, a chloride channel activated by yellow light, to the DRG sensory neurons results in reduction of allodynia in rodent models that is tunable by illumination by light of the respective wavelength.\n\n【315】### Pathways to Clinical Translation\n\n【316】Herpes simplex virus encoding preproenkephalin, administered as a series of intradermal injections for intractable locoregional pain caused by cancer, is the only vector so far tested in humans in the context of gene therapy for pain.\n\n【317】Gene therapy for pain: results of a phase I clinical trial.\n\n【318】A phase 1 clinical trial reported safety of the treatment, but the lack of a blinded control group, a design typical of a phase 1 trial, did not allow any conclusions regarding efficacy. A subsequent blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial was initiated in 2011 and completed in November 2013 (according to ClinicalTrials.gov ).\n\n【319】Of note, HSV was translated from rodent studies directly into clinical trials without testing the approach in a large-animal model as an intermediate step. Should the clinical trial fail to find analgesic efficacy, it may be difficult to discern whether the HSV gene transfer technology or the therapeutic gene was the cause of failure. In such a situation, only large-animal studies may be able to further the understanding.\n\n【320】Adeno-associated virus–based gene therapy has not been tested in patients with chronic pain but in numerous other clinical settings, including phase 1, 2, and 3 trials for a large variety of neurologic and nonneurologic therapeutic applications.\n\n【321】In the field of AAV for pain, we translated the approach into large-animal models, first reporting differences in gene transfer outcomes compared with rodents when the IT route was tested.\n\n【322】High cerebrospinal fluid levels of interleukin-10 attained by AAV in dogs.\n\n【323】Subsequently, we developed a method of locoregional delivery of AAV to DRG neurons in a large-animal (swine) model using computed tomography fluoroscopy.\n\n【324】Minimally invasive convection-enhanced delivery of biologics into dorsal root ganglia: validation in the pig model and prospective modeling in humans.\n\n【325】This study recreated the gene transfer outcomes of the original rodent studies of intraganglionic AAV delivery while introducing an image-guided intervention technique and thereby obviating the need for open surgical exposure of the DRG that was used in rodents. Examination of the comparative anatomy of porcine and human spines indicates that similar, minimally invasive intraganglionic injection could also be performed in the clinical setting.\n\n【326】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【327】Interventional pain specialists have a unique skill set to translate gene therapy–based treatment approaches into novel clinical treatments for locoregional pain. Future clinical progress may be driven not only by the rapid advances in gene vector design and clinical availability but also by advances in interventional delivery techniques. Image guidance available for clinical use to date can provide anatomic selectivity for gene vector delivery to select DRGs. Combining the molecular selectivity of gene vectors with the anatomic selectivity of image-guided delivery may spur a new era of interventions for pain using a dual selective approach to analgesic treatment, thereby offering novel treatment options for patients with hitherto intractable locoregional pain.", "index": 25785, "show": true, "start": 25733, "end": 25897, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【165】S.

The failure of systemic analgesic drugs, such as opioids, is often due to their off-target toxicity, development of tolerance, and abuse potential. Interventional pain procedures provide target specificity but lack pharmacologically selective agents with long-term efficacy. Gene therapy vectors are a new tool for the development of molecularly selective pain therapies, which have already been proved to provide durable analgesia in preclinical models. Taken together, advances in image-guided delivery and gene therapy may lead to a new class of dual selective analgesic treatments integrating the molecular selectivity of analgesic genes with the anatomic selectivity of interventional delivery techniques.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AAV ( adeno-associated virus ), Cav ( voltage-gated calcium channel ), CCD ( conventional drug discovery ), CNS ( central nervous system ), CRISPR/Cas9 ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 ), DRG ( dorsal root ganglion ), DREADD ( designer receptors activated by designer drugs ), ED ( epidural ), GABA ( γ-aminobutyric acid ), HSV ( herpes simplex virus ), IL-10 ( interleukin 10 ), IT ( intrathecal ), Kv ( voltage-gated potassium channel ), Nav ( voltage-gated sodium channel ), NK1 ( neurokinin type 1 ), NMDA ( N-methyl-d-aspartate ), shRNA ( small hairpin RNA ), TRP ( transient receptor potential channel ), TRPV1 ( transient receptor potential channel, subfamily V, member 1 )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .™\n\n【9】Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【10】**MOC Credit Statement:** Successful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1 MOC points in the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program.

Specifically, the 2 most prevalent causes of chronic pain in the population were low back pain and knee pain, as documented by a survey performed by the National Center for Health Statistics, whereby 28.1% of adult Americans reported low back pain and 19.5% localized knee pain during the past 3 months.\n\n【23】Institute of Medicine  \nRelieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research.\n\n<mark>【24】The National Academies Press , Washington, DC 2011</mark>\n\n【25】Locoregional pain is also responsible for a substantial portion of the financial burden of chronic pain.

Important examples include ion channels expressed by primary sensory neurons, cytokines that play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, and several inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters that modulate nociceptive signaling.\n\n【46】Characterization of these nociceptive mechanisms led to a search for a new generation of analgesic drugs using the techniques of conventional drug discovery (CDD); CDD, ie, the search for new small-molecule therapeutic entities, largely relies on empirical screening of candidate compounds. Two approaches are used by the pharmaceutical industry and academic laboratories involved in CDD. First, phenotype-directed screening seeks to identify chemical entities that have a desirable effect on the phenotype of a disease model without previous knowledge of their molecular mechanism of action.\n\n【47】Phenotypic screening in cancer drug discovery: past, present and future.\n\n【48】Various assays modeling the disease phenotype on the level of a cell or an organism have been described.\n\n【49】Modern phenotypic drug discovery is a viable, neoclassic pharma strategy.\n\n【50】Efficacious compounds are then examined for molecular mechanism of action using reverse biology techniques. Second, target-directed screening relies on biochemical knowledge of specific molecular targets and uses small-molecule screening strategies, typically by examining large libraries of compounds.\n\n【51】Discovery of small molecule cancer drugs: successes, challenges and opportunities.\n\n【52】The actual biologic effect of thus discovered compounds is then tested in vivo in disease models. Although there has been a substantial effort to facilitate CDD by using high-throughput assays and by implementing genomic data, the discovery of new small-molecule drugs is declining in all medical fields. In fact, pharmaceutical industry data show that the number of truly innovative drugs (defined as new molecular entities) approved by the major regulatory bodies (such as the US Food and Drug Administration) has been decreasing by 50% every 5 years worldwide.\n\n【53】How to improve R&D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge.\n\n【54】PAREXEL Biopharmaceutical Statistical Sourcebook 2014/2015.\n\n<mark>【55】Parexel Intl Corp , Waltham, MA 2014</mark>\n\n【56】How were new medicines discovered?\n\n【57】Although multiple candidate analgesic agents that had been identified through CDD were tested in preclinical models, the success regarding clinical translation has been very limited, as reviewed next.\n\n【58】### Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels\n\n【59】Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na <sub>v </sub> ) are responsible for the formation of action potentials in all excitatory cells.

All of these channels undergo upregulation in rodent models of nerve injury or inflammatory and neuropathic pain.\n\n【62】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【63】In addition, mutations in genes encoding these channels are associated with inherited pain disorders in humans. Gain-of-function mutations of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7 result in inherited erythromelalgia, an autosomal dominant disorder manifesting by extreme heat hyperalgesia.\n\n【64】Erythermalgia: molecular basis for an inherited pain syndrome.\n\n【65】Although clinical manifestations of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8 are less clearly defined, they have also been associated with the development of painful neuropathies and insensitivity to pain, respectively, in humans.\n\n【66】Pain as a channelopathy.\n\n【67】A variety of molecular entities have been tested in the preclinical setting that selectively inactivate Na <sub>v </sub> , including toxins isolated from tarantula venom or small-molecule compounds identified via target-directed screening.\n\n【68】Inhibitors of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7: patent applications since 2010.\n\n【69】Engineering potent and selective analogues of GpTx-1, a tarantula venom peptide antagonist of the Na(V)1.7 sodium channel.\n\n【70】Identification and characterization of proTx-III \\[μ-TRTX-Tp1a\\], a new voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor from venom of the tarantula thrixopelma pruriens.\n\n【71】Three peptide modulators of the human voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7, an important analgesic target, from the venom of an Australian tarantula.\n\n【72】Yet, despite an ongoing effort, none of these agents have been approved as a drug for use in humans.\n\n【73】### Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels\n\n【74】Similar to Na <sub>v </sub> , voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca <sub>v </sub> ) expressed in primary sensory neurons result in an increased firing frequency.\n\n【75】Voltage-gated calcium channels as targets for the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【76】At the level of the spinal cord, the upregulation of Ca <sub>v </sub> secondary to nerve injury has been described in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【77】The physiology, pathology, and pharmacology of voltage-gated calcium channels and their future therapeutic potential.\n\n【78】Specifically, Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 seems to play a critical role in neuropathic pain. Inactivation of this channel by channel-binding peptide 3 inhibits trafficking of Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 to the cytoplasmic membrane and, thereby, diminishes membrane excitability of nociceptive neurons, resulting in attenuation of nocifensive behavior in rodent models.\n\n【79】Suppression of inflammatory and neuropathic pain by uncoupling CRMP-2 from the presynaptic Ca  channel complex.\n\n【80】Gabapentinoids are the only class of systemic analgesic drugs that may exert their therapeutic effect through interacting with Ca <sub>v </sub> . Gabapentinoids were initially conceived as orally available analogues of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, for the treatment of seizure disorders.\n\n【81】Calcium channel a2–d ligands: gabapentin and pregabalin.\n\n【82】Although the antiepileptic efficacy of gabapentinoids did not hold up to the initial promise, they have been found to be efficacious for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【83】Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults.\n\n【84】Neuropathic pain: principles of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【85】Although the mechanism of action of gabapentinoids has not been fully elucidated, they have been found to bind to the α2δ-1 subunit of the Ca <sub>v </sub> , and it is, therefore, thought that they may, at least in part, exert analgesia through inhibition of Ca <sub>v </sub> .\n\n【86】Implications and mechanism of action of gabapentin in neuropathic pain.\n\n【87】A search for selective and potent Ca <sub>v </sub> antagonists identified ω-conotoxin MVIIA, a neurotoxic peptide isolated in the 1980s from the venom of marine snails belonging to the genus _Conus_ .\n\n【88】Neuronal calcium channel antagonists: discrimination between calcium channel subtypes using omega-conotoxin from _Conus magus_ venom.\n\n【89】Peptide neurotoxins from fish-hunting cone snails.\n\n【90】ω-Conotoxin MVIIA selectively blocks N-type Ca <sub>v </sub> present in nociceptive fibers. Despite efforts over 2 decades, a search for a drug with the mechanism of action analogous to ω-conotoxin MVIIA that would be efficacious and nontoxic after systemic administration has failed. Only in 2004, ziconotide, a ω-conotoxin MVIIA derivative, was approved for localized intrathecal (IT) delivery in patients with severe, otherwise intractable pain.\n\n【91】Intrathecal ziconotide: a review of its use in patients with chronic pain refractory to other systemic or intrathecal analgesics.\n\n【92】### Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels\n\n【93】Voltage-gated potassium channels (K <sub>v </sub> ) are also critical determinants of the firing frequency, and their downregulation results in membrane hyperexcitability.\n\n【94】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【95】Distinct potassium channels on pain-sensing neurons.\n\n【96】Although several potassium channels are expressed by primary nociceptive fibers, K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 has been most thoroughly studied in association with chronic pain and has been found to be markedly downregulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in the setting of nerve injury and neuropathic pain.\n\n【97】A long noncoding RNA contributes to neuropathic pain by silencing Kcna2 in primary afferent neurons.\n\n【98】Yet, no analgesic drugs that modulate nociceptive signaling through K <sub>v </sub> are clinically available.\n\n【99】### Ligand-Gated Cation Channels\n\n【100】Ligand-gated ion channels are an attractive target for drug development because their endogenous ligands can serve as a molecular pattern for discovery of compounds with analogous pharmacodynamics but therapeutically more favorable pharmacokinetics. The _N_ \\-methyl- d \\-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor mediates long-term potentiation, which has been found to play a key role in the development of chronic pain.\n\n【101】NMDA receptors and memory encoding.\n\n【102】Long-term potentiation at spinal C-fiber synapses: a target for pathological pain.\n\n【103】The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, a dissociative general anesthetic agent, is used in certain subgroups of chronic pain, but data on its efficacy are inconclusive.\n\n【104】Wherefore ketamine?\n\n【105】Effects of low-dose intranasal (S)-ketamine in patients with neuropathic pain.\n\n【106】Ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for cancer pain.\n\n【107】Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of subcutaneous ketamine in the management of cancer pain.\n\n【108】Ketamine as adjuvant analgesic to opioids: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review.\n\n【109】Despite an ongoing research effort, no clinically available NMDA antagonist more specific to nociception has been found.\n\n【110】Transient receptor potential channels (TRP) constitute another family of ligand-gated cation channels. Several TRP are expressed by the primary sensory neurons and are typically activated by noxious stimuli.\n\n【111】TRP channels and pain.\n\n【112】TRP, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) is a particularly attractive target for drug development because it is almost exclusively expressed by primary nociceptive neurons and its inactivation results in loss of pain and heat sensation while other sensory modalities remain intact.\n\n【113】The cloned capsaicin receptor integrates multiple pain-producing stimuli.\n\n【114】The capsaicin receptor: a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway.\n\n【115】Capsaicin, the pungent substance in chili peppers, is the only analgesic agent acting through TRPV1 clinically available to date and is used in the form of a patch to treat locoregional pain.\n\n【116】Topical capsaicin formulations in the management of neuropathic pain.\n\n【117】Capsaicin is a reversible TRPV1 agonist and is thought to induce analgesia by desensitizing TRPV1+ nerve fibers.\n\n【118】Capsaicin-based therapies for pain control.\n\n【119】A more intuitive approach to using the TRPV1 pathway is the use of TRPV1 receptor antagonists. Although a variety of TRPV1 antagonists have been tested in preclinical models, none have been successfully translated to the clinical setting owing to their off-target adverse effects, which included hyperthermia and impaired noxious heat sensation, after systemic delivery.\n\n【120】Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 antagonists: a patent review (2011-2014).\n\n【121】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【122】Glial cells have been reported to initiate and maintain neurogenic inflammation in the setting of chronic neuropathic pain, resulting in increased neuronal excitability.\n\n【123】Importance of glial activation in neuropathic pain.\n\n【124】The effect of glia on the primary sensory neurons may be mediated by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1β, and various chemokines.\n\n【125】Spinal interleukin-10 therapy to treat peripheral neuropathic pain.\n\n【126】The proinflammatory and pronociceptive effect of these cytokines is countered by anti-inflammatory cytokines. The principal anti-inflammatory cytokine is interleukin 10 (IL-10). Therefore, IL-10 is an attractive agent to treat neuropathic pain, which is known to be relatively refractory to opioid analgesics.\n\n【127】The IT administration of recombinant IL-10 has, indeed, been found to reduce neuroinflammation and allodynia in animal models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【128】Snake venom phospholipase A2s (Asp49 and Lys49) induce mechanical allodynia upon peri-sciatic administration: involvement of spinal cord glia, proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide.\n\n【129】Cytokine involvement in dynorphin-induced allodynia.\n\n【130】However, direct delivery of the recombinant IL-10 was found not to be feasible for clinical translation because of its high cost, its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and its half-life of only 2 hours in the cerebrospinal fluid after IT delivery.\n\n【131】Interleukin-10 as a CNS therapeutic: the obstacle of the blood-brain/blood-spinal cord barrier.\n\n【132】Controlling pathological pain by adenovirally driven spinal production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【133】### Pain-Modulating Neurotransmitters\n\n【134】Development and maintenance of chronic pain states is associated with alteration of the neurotransmitter milieu in the CNS.\n\n【135】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【136】The neuroinhibitory transmitter GABA is known to inhibit neuropathic pain signaling on the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【137】Partial peripheral nerve injury promotes a selective loss of GABAergic inhibition in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【138】Although 2 classes of GABAergic drugs—baclofen and benzodiazepines—are used in clinical practice in select patients, their effect is not selective to the nociceptive pathways, resulting in a very low therapeutic index in the context of pain management.\n\n【139】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【140】Despite substantial effort, novel and more selective analgesic agents using the GABAergic pathway are not clinically available.\n\n【141】Another neurotransmitter involved in pain signaling is substance P. Substance P is produced by neurons throughout the peripheral nervous system and CNS, and it exerts its effect by activating neurokinin type 1 (NK <sub>1 </sub> ) receptor.\n\n【142】Neurobiology of substance P and the NK1 receptor.\n\n【143】Studies using NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor knockout mice and NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists in rodents suggested that blocking substance P signaling would result in profound analgesia, thereby generating widespread enthusiasm regarding clinical translation.\n\n【144】The substance P receptor antagonist CP-99,994 reduces acute postoperative pain.\n\n【145】The NK1 receptor is essential for the full expression of noxious inhibitory controls in the mouse.\n\n【146】However, clinical studies of several NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists given by the systemic route reported an almost complete lack of analgesic efficacy in humans.\n\n【147】Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists: a comprehensive patent survey.\n\n【148】The failure of NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists may have been considered a breaking point in analgesic drug discovery and development as it brought the realization that there may be no magic bullet consisting of a chemical compound targeting a single nociceptive mechanism with a degree of nociceptive specificity that could rival (or exceed) the analgesic activity of opioids.\n\n【149】Locoregional Analgesics: An Alternative Approach to Drug Development\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【150】### Clinical Interventional Pain Procedures for Locoregional Pain Syndromes\n\n【151】Interventional drug delivery for locoregional chronic pain is one of the most common procedures performed in clinical practice.\n\n【152】The role of invasive pain management modalities in the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【153】Multiple techniques that target various pain generators under imaging guidance are used.\n\n【154】Interventional approaches to pain management.\n\n【155】The most frequent targets for interventional drug delivery are the spinal nerves, which are accessed either IT or via the epidural (ED) route under fluoroscopic guidance. More than 2.5 million ED injections were performed in 2013 in the United States.\n\n<mark>【156】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.</mark>4.\n\n【157】Although all these procedures are remarkably safe, their efficacy has recently come under scrutiny.\n\n【158】Pain Management Injection Therapies for Low Back Pain.\n\n【159】Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , Rockville, MD 2015\n\n【160】For the ED injection, there is evidence of moderate efficacy for some pain syndromes, such as lumbar radiculitis, but no evidence of efficacy in others, such as spinal stenosis (neurogenic intermittent claudication).\n\n【161】A randomized trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis.\n\n【162】The chief reason for the limited efficacy of interventional procedures for chronic pain is the small repertoire of analgesic agents available for these routes of delivery. For IT delivery, the available drugs are limited to opioids, benzodiazepines, baclofen, ziconotide, local anesthetics, and ketamine.\n\n【163】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【164】For ED delivery, local anesthetics and corticosteroids constitute the only agents available to date. The pharmacologic effect of these agents is relatively nonspecific, and its duration is only transient in most patients, requiring either implantation of a pump for the IT route or repeated interventions for the ED route; on average patients receive 2 to 3 injections of ED corticosteroids per year.\n\n【165】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, _Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting_ , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.\n\n【166】Although the discovery of novel analgesic agents specifically designed for anatomically selective routes of delivery, such as ED, is a major unmet clinical need, this area has not been appreciably explored by the pharmaceutical industry and research laboratories. The search for novel molecular targets has focused on systemically administered drugs, whereas drug development for localized delivery mainly involved optimizing the formulation of already available agents for ED delivery, such as depot liposomal forms of corticosteroids extending their biological half-life (currently in the phase of preclinical development).\n\n【167】A lipid based depot (DepoFoam technology) for sustained release drug delivery.\n\n【168】It is notable that although the field of CDD focused on systemic analgesic drugs, the major truly innovative agent recently approved for the treatment of chronic pain, ziconotide, is a locally delivered (IT) agent.\n\n【169】### Requirements for a New Generation of Analgesic Drugs for Interventional Delivery\n\n【170】A desirable agent for localized, interventional delivery would ideally meet 2 requirements that differ from systemic drugs developed via CCD: (1) prolonged or even permanent activity after a single administration and (2) ability to penetrate the target tissue locally without a need for sufficient bioavailability after systemic administration and for lack of off-target toxicity. Although the first requirement raises a conceptual bar that the candidate interventional agents need to reach compared with most systemic drugs currently under development via CDD, the second requirement lowers this bar substantially. The combination of these 2 requirements, ie, the need for long-term effect after a single administration and lessened concern for off-target distribution and toxicity, seems to be uniquely suited for an emerging drug discovery and disease treatment paradigm: gene therapy.\n\n【171】Gene Therapy\n------------\n\n【172】### Beyond Hereditary Disorders\n\n【173】Gene therapy was initially developed to correct dysfunctional genes in rare monogenic disorders, such as inborn errors of metabolism or blood clotting disorders.\n\n【174】History of gene therapy.\n\n【175】However, the greatest potential impact of gene therapy may lie in the treatment of common, acquired disorders.\n\n【176】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【177】Cardioprotection by gene therapy: a review paper on behalf of the Working Group on Drug Cardiotoxicity and Cardioprotection of the Italian Society of Cardiology.\n\n【178】The field of gene therapy reached critical benchmarks during the past several years.\n\n【179】Gene therapy clinical trials worldwide to 2012: an update.\n\n【180】Gene therapy returns to centre stage.\n\n【181】In 2012, alipogene tiparvovec became the first gene therapy product to be commercially approved in Europe (for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency).\n\n【182】Endgame: glybera finally recommended for approval as the first gene therapy drug in the European Union.\n\n【183】In 2015, talimogene laherparepvec was the first gene vector brought to market in the United States (for the treatment of inoperable malignant melanoma and head and neck cancer).\n\n【184】Talimogene laherparepvec: first global approval.\n\n【185】Talimogene laherparepvec improves durable response rate in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n【186】### Gene Vectors: A Distinct Class of Therapeutic Agents\n\n【187】In gene therapy, a vector serves as an intracellular delivery mechanism for the instruction set provided by the therapeutic gene (transgene) to the targeted cells.\n\n【188】Gene therapy—basic principles and the road from bench to bedside.\n\n【189】in: Gad S.C. Rubany G.M. Pharmaceutical Sciences Encyclopedia. John Wiley & Sons Inc , Hoboken, NJ 2010\n\n【190】The encoded proteins or peptides are expressed by the target cells, thereby harnessing their machinery to produce the therapeutic substance locally. Vectors are the most commonly genetically engineered viruses whose ability to replicate is artificially disrupted and part or all of their genome is replaced by a transgene of choice.\n\n【191】Viral vectors for gene therapy: the art of turning infectious agents into vehicles of therapeutics.\n\n【192】Unique from other drug constructs, the viral vector–transgene package is modular. The surface characteristics of the viral shell (capsid serotype) will determine its tissue selectivity (tropism), and this can be varied independently of the carried transgene. This provides great flexibility in testing large numbers of potential transgene products directed at varying molecular targets. This approach also enables overexpressing, silencing, or de novo expressing of virtually any gene, thereby affecting any signaling pathway. A further variable that can be introduced is selective anatomic delivery, which may augment or overcome the challenges of insufficient tissue tropism.\n\n【193】### Primary Sensory Neurons as the Target of Gene Therapy for Pain\n\n【194】The primary sensory neurons, as the point of aggregation of nociceptive signaling from the periphery, are a rational target of gene therapy.\n\n【195】Nociceptors: the sensors of the pain pathway.\n\n【196】These neurons reside in the DRG, a structure that is anatomically accessible, obviating the risk of CNS instrumentation. There are also appropriate small-animal models of DRG access and peripheral nociceptive testing.\n\n【197】Tests and models of nociception and pain in rodents.\n\n【198】Targeted delivery of pharmacological agents into rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【199】These characteristics have focused attention on DRG neurons as the primary target for modulation of nociception. Gene therapy may be directed to DRG neurons either by transducing them directly or by transducing anatomically or functionally related structures, such as the glia or the meninges, whereby nociception is indirectly modulated by their interaction with DRG neurons.\n\n【200】### Targeting the Primary Sensory Neurons by Gene Vectors\n\n【201】To attain gene transfer to the primary sensory neurons, several routes of vector delivery have been explored. First, replication-incompetent herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors delivered by skin inoculation were pioneered by Fink, Glorioso, and others.\n\n【202】Deletion of multiple immediate-early genes from herpes simplex virus reduces cytotoxicity and permits long-term gene expression in neurons.\n\n【203】Engineering herpes simplex virus vectors for CNS applications.\n\n【204】This approach takes advantage of the inherent ability of this virus to undergo retrograde axonal transport from the sensory nerve terminal to the cell body and, thereby, to transduce DRG neurons whose dendrites originate in the injected sensory field of the skin. Although this selectivity makes HSV attractive for gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system, it also restricts its utility for other gene therapy applications; the overall translational experience with this vector remains, therefore, relatively limited.\n\n【205】Second, IT injection of several serotypes of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors was found to selectively transduce the primary sensory neurons.\n\n【206】AAV8(gfp) preferentially targets large diameter dorsal root ganglion neurones after both intra-dorsal root ganglion and intrathecal injection.\n\n【207】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【208】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【209】Recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (rAAV2/6)-mediated gene transfer to nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery.\n\n【210】Differential adeno-associated virus mediated gene transfer to sensory neurons following intrathecal delivery by direct lumbar puncture.\n\n【211】Adeno-associated virus is the leading vector type across many gene therapy fields because it is not associated with any disease in any species, is devoid of any viral genes, and yields stable gene expression for months to years.\n\n【212】Adeno-associated virus: from defective virus to effective vector.\n\n【213】The initial safety concerns regarding AAV vectors, which included insertional mutagenesis, germline transmission, replication escape, and dissemination of the vector to the public domain, have been thoroughly addressed in the field and do not seem to be applicable in the context of human trials, as previously reviewed in detail elsewhere.\n\n【214】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【215】Furthermore, the difficulties with large-scale manufacturing of AAV vectors, which were holding back the clinical translation of AAV-based gene therapy, have recently been overcome.\n\n【216】Large-scale recombinant adeno-associated virus production.\n\n【217】A relative restriction associated with AAV is the need to switch capsids if serial treatments are needed because serologic immunity renders the readministration of a vector with the same serotypes ineffective.\n\n【218】Immune responses to AAV vectors: overcoming barriers to successful gene therapy.\n\n【219】In addition to AAV, IT delivery of other vector types, such lentiviruses or AAV plasmid DNA, was also tested for gene therapy for pain. Although efficacious in certain therapeutic strategies, these vectors did not transduce the primary sensory neurons but rather glial cells or the meninges.\n\n【220】Gene therapy for the treatment of chronic peripheral nervous system pain.\n\n【221】Third, to further improve the efficiency of gene transfer, several groups have targeted the nociceptive neurons directly by intraganglionic injection of AAV in rodents.\n\n【222】Intraganglionic AAV6 results in efficient and long-term gene transfer to peripheral sensory nervous system in adult rats.\n\n【223】Comparison of AAV serotypes for gene delivery to dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【224】Direct injection into the dorsal root ganglion: technical, behavioral, and histological observations.\n\n【225】Although this approach led to highly efficacious and selective gene transfer to the DRGs in a rodent model, an open surgical procedure consisting of paravertebral exposure and foraminotomy was required.\n\n【226】Molecular Targets of Gene Therapy for Pain\n------------------------------------------\n\n【227】The molecular selectivity of gene therapy has been of great interest because it enables utilization of antinociceptive mechanisms that have not been accessible by conventional agents. A variety of approaches have been found to be efficacious in animal models of chronic pain. Important examples of the molecular targets used to date by gene therapy for pain are (1) spinal opioid delivery, (2) anti-inflammatory cytokines, and (3) ion channels and neurotrophic growth factor.\n\n【228】### Spinal Opioid Delivery\n\n【229】The opioid system is an attractive target for gene therapy because of the robust clinical experience with exogenous opioids. Although opioids modulate pain processing at multiple levels of the nervous system, delivery of exogenous opioids to the spinal IT space is sufficient to achieve analgesia.\n\n【230】Intrathecal opioids for intractable pain syndromes.\n\n【231】Gene transfer of opioid genes selectively to DRG neurons has been found to reduce chronic pain in animal models of locoregional pain (as reviewed next). This approach may eliminate the toxicity of exogenously administered opioids, which is attributed to their extraspinal effects in the CNS and in peripheral tissues.\n\n【232】Side effects of intrathecal and epidural opioids.\n\n【233】Long-term opioid management for chronic noncancer pain.\n\n【234】A systematic review of the use of opioid medication for those with moderate to severe cancer pain and renal impairment: a European Palliative Care Research Collaborative opioid guidelines project.\n\n【235】A review of potential adverse effects of long-term opioid therapy: a practitioner's guide.\n\n【236】The prevalence, severity, and impact of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: results of a US and European Patient Survey (PROBE 1).\n\n【237】The effects of opioids and opioid analogs on animal and human endocrine systems.\n\n【238】Coronary heart disease outcomes among chronic opioid and cyclooxygenase-2 users compared with a general population cohort.\n\n【239】Opioids and immune modulation: more questions than answers.\n\n【240】Two principal strategies using opioid signaling for analgesia by gene therapy have been described. First, several groups have used transgenes encoding endogenous opioid agonists delivered to the DRGs. Goss et al\n\n【241】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【242】used preproenkephalin, a δ-opioid receptor agonist, and endomorphine-2, a μ-opioid receptor agonist, delivered by HSV vectors. We used AAV to deliver prepro-ß-endorphin, an artificial opioid precursor of the μ-opioid agonist peptide ß-endorphin that is engineered to be secreted in a stimulus-independent manner via the constitutive secretory pathway.\n\n【243】Retrovirus-mediated expression of an artificial beta-endorphin precursor in primary fibroblasts.\n\n【244】Administration of these therapeutic genes resulted in robust reduction of allodynia or hyperalgesia in multiple rodent models of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain.\n\n【245】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【246】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【247】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【248】Herpes vector-mediated expression of proenkephalin reduces bone cancer pain.\n\n【249】The second strategy to harness the opioid system for gene therapy of pain consists of transferring genes that encode an opioid receptor. Xu et al\n\n【250】Adeno-associated viral transfer of opioid receptor gene to primary sensory neurons: a strategy to increase opioid antinociception.\n\n【251】Efficiencies of transgene expression in nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors.\n\n【252】reported this approach several years ago, but no recent follow-up studies seem to have been attempted. Another approach testing an opioid receptor mutant was reported more recently.\n\n【253】Intrathecal delivery of a mutant micro-opioid receptor activated by naloxone as a possible antinociceptive paradigm.\n\n【254】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【255】Gene transfer of IL-10 by several vector systems, including HSV and AAV, has been extensively tested in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【256】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【257】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【258】Controlling neuropathic pain by adeno-associated virus driven production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【259】HSV-mediated transfer of interleukin-10 reduces inflammatory pain through modulation of membrane tumor necrosis factor α in spinal cord microglia.\n\n【260】Production of IL-10 resulted in marked reduction of allodynia and hyperalgesia, a finding verified independently by multiple groups. In addition to IL-10, a tumor necrosis factor–soluble receptor delivered via HSV-mediated gene transfer reduced allodynia in a rodent model of varicella zoster virus–induced pain.\n\n【261】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【262】### Ion Channels\n\n【263】Discovery of the voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels that are specific to nociception and the failure to generate corresponding conventional analgesic drugs has prompted an effort to use these targets via gene therapy. Two approaches have been used: (1) overexpression of ion channels responsible for membrane hyperpolarization by delivering vectors that carry the gene encoding for the respective channel and (2) downregulation of ion channels responsible for membrane depolarization by RNA interference, ie, by delivering vectors encoding small interfering RNA or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) complementary to the sequence of the respective ion channel, or by gene transfer of genes whose products deactivate these channels.\n\n【264】In the first approach, AAV-mediated gene transfer of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 in a rat model of neuropathic pain resulted in normalization of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 expression that had been downregulated in the context of nerve injury. This was associated with a decrease in allodynia in the treated animals.\n\n【265】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【266】Similarly, overexpression of the glycine receptor (a ligand-gated chloride channel) in the sensory fibers mediated by HSV resulted in attenuation of hyperalgesia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【267】HSV delivery of a ligand-regulated endogenous ion channel gene to sensory neurons results in pain control following channel activation.\n\n【268】In the second approach, Samad et al\n\n【269】Virus-mediated shRNA knockdown of Na(v)1.3 in rat dorsal root ganglion attenuates nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.\n\n【270】found that knockout of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 by shRNA encoded by an AAV vector delivered into the DRGs attenuated allodynia in the experimental animals. Similarly, knockout of the NR subunit of the NMDA receptor in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord via AAV-mediated transfer of the respective small interfering RNA reduced spinal NMDA currents as well as nociceptive behavior in a model of chronic inflammatory pain.\n\n【271】siRNA-mediated knockdown of the NR1 subunit gene of the NMDA receptor attenuates formalin-induced pain behaviors in adult rats.\n\n【272】A conditional deletion of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in adult spinal cord dorsal horn reduces NMDA currents and injury-induced pain.\n\n【273】Downregulation of the TRPV1 signaling via gene transfer of either shRNA delivered by IT AAV or the dominant negative (poreless) form of the protein delivered by HSV has been found to reduce allodynia in rat models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【274】Intrathecal AAV serotype 9-mediated delivery of shRNA against TRPV1 attenuates thermal hyperalgesia in a mouse model of peripheral nerve injury.\n\n【275】Herpes simplex virus vector-mediated gene delivery of poreless TRPV1 channels reduces bladder overactivity and nociception in rats.\n\n【276】An HSV vector system for selection of ligand-gated ion channel modulators.\n\n【277】Fischer et al\n\n【278】Sustained relief of neuropathic pain by AAV-targeted expression of CBD3 peptide in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【279】downregulated Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 by AAV-mediated gene transfer of Ca  channel-binding peptide 3, also resulting in attenuation of neuropathic pain in the rat model. Ma et al\n\n【280】Expression of inwardly rectifying potassium channels by an inducible adenoviral vector reduced the neuronal hyperexcitability and hyperalgesia produced by chronic compression of the spinal ganglion.\n\n【281】found that overexpression of Kir2.1, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, delivered by an adenoviral vector into the DRGs suppresses neuronal excitability and prevents the development of hyperalgesia in rodents.\n\n【282】### Neurotransmitters and Growth Factors\n\n【283】Delivery of AAV or HSV vectors encoding several isoforms of the GABA gene showed reduction of allodynia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【284】Constitutive GABA expression via a recombinant adeno-associated virus consistently attenuates neuropathic pain.\n\n【285】Vector-mediated release of GABA attenuates pain-related behaviors and reduces Na(V)1.7 in DRG neurons.\n\n【286】The AAV- or HSV-mediated gene transfer of several neurotrophic growth factors has been investigated as a novel approach to treat chronic pain by reversing the synaptic remodeling described in chronic pain states. This approach could be tested only by gene therapy because conventional pharmacotherapy could not attain target-specific, long-term delivery of an active agent. Several neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, erythropoietin, glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, were found to reduce pain behavior in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【287】Amelioration of chronic neuropathic pain after partial nerve injury by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated over-expression of BDNF in the rat spinal cord.\n\n【288】Neuroprotective effect of herpes simplex virus-mediated gene transfer of erythropoietin in hyperglycemic dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【289】HSV-mediated gene transfer of the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor provides an antiallodynic effect on neuropathic pain.\n\n【290】Long-term neuroprotection achieved with latency-associated promoter-driven herpes simplex virus gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system.\n\n【291】### Gene Editing\n\n【292】Gene editing is a technique for highly targeted deletion, insertion, or substitution of a desired sequence of a genome.\n\n【293】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【294】Although multiple gene editing techniques have been described, the field underwent a breakthrough in 2012 when Barrangou, Doudna, Jinek, and others described the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in conjunction with CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9).\n\n【295】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【296】Genome-scale engineering for systems and synthetic biology.\n\n【297】A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.\n\n【298】The CRISPR craze.\n\n【299】CRISPR/Cas9 allows precise and cost-effective gene editing in vivo, and is poised to revolutionize gene therapy. It seems conceivable that in vivo gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 delivered by gene vector may give rise to a whole new field of pain therapy.\n\n【300】### Chemogenetics and Optogenetics\n\n【301】Chemogenetics and optogenetics represent 2 emerging approaches to selectively and, unlike traditional gene therapy, reversibly manipulate cell phenotypes via gene transfer.\n\n【302】Therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain: potential application of pharmacosynthetics and optogenetics.\n\n【303】Chemogenetics is based on designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). The DREADDs are G protein–coupled receptors artificially engineered to respond to nanomolar concentrations of otherwise biologically inert ligands, such as clozapine-N-oxide.\n\n【304】Controlling signaling with a specifically designed Gi-coupled receptor.\n\n【305】Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.\n\n【306】Preliminary studies in rodents suggest that selective expression of DREADDs in nociceptive neurons via gene transfer might allow efficient and highly precise exogenous control of nociceptive signaling.\n\n【307】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【308】Mu opioid receptor modulation of dopamine neurons in the periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe: a role in regulation of pain.\n\n【309】(457) Gi-DREADD expression in TRPV1-Cre mice produces ligand-dependent behavioral inhibition to noxious heat, but ligand-independent changes in sensory neurons.\n\n【310】Analogously, optogenetics enables tunable manipulation of cell phenotypes using light.\n\n【311】Orderly recruitment of motor units under optical control in vivo.\n\n【312】Iyer et al\n\n【313】Virally mediated optogenetic excitation and inhibition of pain in freely moving nontransgenic mice.\n\n【314】found that AAV-mediated gene transfer of eNpHR3.0, a chloride channel activated by yellow light, to the DRG sensory neurons results in reduction of allodynia in rodent models that is tunable by illumination by light of the respective wavelength.\n\n【315】### Pathways to Clinical Translation\n\n【316】Herpes simplex virus encoding preproenkephalin, administered as a series of intradermal injections for intractable locoregional pain caused by cancer, is the only vector so far tested in humans in the context of gene therapy for pain.\n\n【317】Gene therapy for pain: results of a phase I clinical trial.\n\n【318】A phase 1 clinical trial reported safety of the treatment, but the lack of a blinded control group, a design typical of a phase 1 trial, did not allow any conclusions regarding efficacy. A subsequent blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial was initiated in 2011 and completed in November 2013 (according to ClinicalTrials.gov ).\n\n【319】Of note, HSV was translated from rodent studies directly into clinical trials without testing the approach in a large-animal model as an intermediate step. Should the clinical trial fail to find analgesic efficacy, it may be difficult to discern whether the HSV gene transfer technology or the therapeutic gene was the cause of failure. In such a situation, only large-animal studies may be able to further the understanding.\n\n【320】Adeno-associated virus–based gene therapy has not been tested in patients with chronic pain but in numerous other clinical settings, including phase 1, 2, and 3 trials for a large variety of neurologic and nonneurologic therapeutic applications.\n\n【321】In the field of AAV for pain, we translated the approach into large-animal models, first reporting differences in gene transfer outcomes compared with rodents when the IT route was tested.\n\n【322】High cerebrospinal fluid levels of interleukin-10 attained by AAV in dogs.\n\n【323】Subsequently, we developed a method of locoregional delivery of AAV to DRG neurons in a large-animal (swine) model using computed tomography fluoroscopy.\n\n【324】Minimally invasive convection-enhanced delivery of biologics into dorsal root ganglia: validation in the pig model and prospective modeling in humans.\n\n【325】This study recreated the gene transfer outcomes of the original rodent studies of intraganglionic AAV delivery while introducing an image-guided intervention technique and thereby obviating the need for open surgical exposure of the DRG that was used in rodents. Examination of the comparative anatomy of porcine and human spines indicates that similar, minimally invasive intraganglionic injection could also be performed in the clinical setting.\n\n【326】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【327】Interventional pain specialists have a unique skill set to translate gene therapy–based treatment approaches into novel clinical treatments for locoregional pain. Future clinical progress may be driven not only by the rapid advances in gene vector design and clinical availability but also by advances in interventional delivery techniques. Image guidance available for clinical use to date can provide anatomic selectivity for gene vector delivery to select DRGs. Combining the molecular selectivity of gene vectors with the anatomic selectivity of image-guided delivery may spur a new era of interventions for pain using a dual selective approach to analgesic treatment, thereby offering novel treatment options for patients with hitherto intractable locoregional pain.", "index": 27293, "show": true, "start": 27228, "end": 27392, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【189】in: Gad S.C.

The failure of systemic analgesic drugs, such as opioids, is often due to their off-target toxicity, development of tolerance, and abuse potential. Interventional pain procedures provide target specificity but lack pharmacologically selective agents with long-term efficacy. Gene therapy vectors are a new tool for the development of molecularly selective pain therapies, which have already been proved to provide durable analgesia in preclinical models. Taken together, advances in image-guided delivery and gene therapy may lead to a new class of dual selective analgesic treatments integrating the molecular selectivity of analgesic genes with the anatomic selectivity of interventional delivery techniques.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AAV ( adeno-associated virus ), Cav ( voltage-gated calcium channel ), CCD ( conventional drug discovery ), CNS ( central nervous system ), CRISPR/Cas9 ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 ), DRG ( dorsal root ganglion ), DREADD ( designer receptors activated by designer drugs ), ED ( epidural ), GABA ( γ-aminobutyric acid ), HSV ( herpes simplex virus ), IL-10 ( interleukin 10 ), IT ( intrathecal ), Kv ( voltage-gated potassium channel ), Nav ( voltage-gated sodium channel ), NK1 ( neurokinin type 1 ), NMDA ( N-methyl-d-aspartate ), shRNA ( small hairpin RNA ), TRP ( transient receptor potential channel ), TRPV1 ( transient receptor potential channel, subfamily V, member 1 )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .™\n\n【9】Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【10】**MOC Credit Statement:** Successful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1 MOC points in the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program.

Specifically, the 2 most prevalent causes of chronic pain in the population were low back pain and knee pain, as documented by a survey performed by the National Center for Health Statistics, whereby 28.1% of adult Americans reported low back pain and 19.5% localized knee pain during the past 3 months.\n\n【23】Institute of Medicine  \nRelieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research.\n\n<mark>【24】The National Academies Press , Washington, DC 2011</mark>\n\n【25】Locoregional pain is also responsible for a substantial portion of the financial burden of chronic pain.

Fifteen percent of patients with cancer pain experience anatomically localized pain, such as pain originating from bone metastases or neuropathic pain from nerve compression or invasion.\n\n【31】Cancer pain management.\n\n【32】Pain in these patients often cannot be adequately controlled by systemic analgesic treatments because the high doses needed for analgesia trigger intolerable adverse effects.\n\n【33】Understanding the experience of pain in terminally ill patients.\n\n【34】Although the best short-term outcomes in these patients are, therefore, frequently achieved by regional administration of local anesthetics or by selective neurolysis, neither approach is durable.\n\n【35】Cancer pain management.\n\n【36】The Search for Systemic Analgesic Therapies\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【37】### The Conventional Drug Discovery Paradigm\n\n【38】Current analgesic therapies fail in a substantial number of patients with chronic pain.\n\n【39】Cancer pain management.\n\n【40】This failure is most striking in cancer pain, where pain remains inadequately controlled in 50% of all patients.\n\n【41】Prevalence of undertreatment in cancer pain: a review of published literature.\n\n【42】Despite the search for novel analgesic treatments during the past few decades, currently available analgesic drugs exert their effect through very few categories of molecular targets.\n\n【43】A capsule history of pain management.\n\n【44】CT-guided injection of a TRPV1 agonist around dorsal root ganglia decreases pain transmission in swine.\n\n【45】Recent advances in neurobiology of nociception, however, identified a variety of candidate therapeutic targets located in the peripheral nervous system that are not used by current analgesic drugs. Important examples include ion channels expressed by primary sensory neurons, cytokines that play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, and several inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters that modulate nociceptive signaling.\n\n【46】Characterization of these nociceptive mechanisms led to a search for a new generation of analgesic drugs using the techniques of conventional drug discovery (CDD); CDD, ie, the search for new small-molecule therapeutic entities, largely relies on empirical screening of candidate compounds. Two approaches are used by the pharmaceutical industry and academic laboratories involved in CDD. First, phenotype-directed screening seeks to identify chemical entities that have a desirable effect on the phenotype of a disease model without previous knowledge of their molecular mechanism of action.\n\n【47】Phenotypic screening in cancer drug discovery: past, present and future.\n\n【48】Various assays modeling the disease phenotype on the level of a cell or an organism have been described.\n\n【49】Modern phenotypic drug discovery is a viable, neoclassic pharma strategy.\n\n【50】Efficacious compounds are then examined for molecular mechanism of action using reverse biology techniques. Second, target-directed screening relies on biochemical knowledge of specific molecular targets and uses small-molecule screening strategies, typically by examining large libraries of compounds.\n\n【51】Discovery of small molecule cancer drugs: successes, challenges and opportunities.\n\n【52】The actual biologic effect of thus discovered compounds is then tested in vivo in disease models. Although there has been a substantial effort to facilitate CDD by using high-throughput assays and by implementing genomic data, the discovery of new small-molecule drugs is declining in all medical fields. In fact, pharmaceutical industry data show that the number of truly innovative drugs (defined as new molecular entities) approved by the major regulatory bodies (such as the US Food and Drug Administration) has been decreasing by 50% every 5 years worldwide.\n\n【53】How to improve R&D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge.\n\n【54】PAREXEL Biopharmaceutical Statistical Sourcebook 2014/2015.\n\n<mark>【55】Parexel Intl Corp , Waltham, MA 2014</mark>\n\n【56】How were new medicines discovered?\n\n【57】Although multiple candidate analgesic agents that had been identified through CDD were tested in preclinical models, the success regarding clinical translation has been very limited, as reviewed next.\n\n【58】### Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels\n\n【59】Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na <sub>v </sub> ) are responsible for the formation of action potentials in all excitatory cells. Several Na <sub>v </sub> subtypes are expressed by primary sensory neurons but not by other excitatory cells, such as neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) or myocytes.\n\n【60】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【61】Specifically, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7, Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8, and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.9 have been found to be involved in nociception. All of these channels undergo upregulation in rodent models of nerve injury or inflammatory and neuropathic pain.\n\n【62】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【63】In addition, mutations in genes encoding these channels are associated with inherited pain disorders in humans. Gain-of-function mutations of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.7 result in inherited erythromelalgia, an autosomal dominant disorder manifesting by extreme heat hyperalgesia.\n\n【64】Erythermalgia: molecular basis for an inherited pain syndrome.\n\n【65】Although clinical manifestations of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 and Na <sub>v </sub> 1.8 are less clearly defined, they have also been associated with the development of painful neuropathies and insensitivity to pain, respectively, in humans.\n\n【66】Pain as a channelopathy.\n\n【67】A variety of molecular entities have been tested in the preclinical setting that selectively inactivate Na <sub>v </sub> , including toxins isolated from tarantula venom or small-molecule compounds identified via target-directed screening.\n\n【68】Inhibitors of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7: patent applications since 2010.\n\n【69】Engineering potent and selective analogues of GpTx-1, a tarantula venom peptide antagonist of the Na(V)1.7 sodium channel.\n\n【70】Identification and characterization of proTx-III \\[μ-TRTX-Tp1a\\], a new voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor from venom of the tarantula thrixopelma pruriens.\n\n【71】Three peptide modulators of the human voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7, an important analgesic target, from the venom of an Australian tarantula.\n\n【72】Yet, despite an ongoing effort, none of these agents have been approved as a drug for use in humans.\n\n【73】### Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels\n\n【74】Similar to Na <sub>v </sub> , voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca <sub>v </sub> ) expressed in primary sensory neurons result in an increased firing frequency.\n\n【75】Voltage-gated calcium channels as targets for the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【76】At the level of the spinal cord, the upregulation of Ca <sub>v </sub> secondary to nerve injury has been described in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【77】The physiology, pathology, and pharmacology of voltage-gated calcium channels and their future therapeutic potential.\n\n【78】Specifically, Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 seems to play a critical role in neuropathic pain. Inactivation of this channel by channel-binding peptide 3 inhibits trafficking of Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 to the cytoplasmic membrane and, thereby, diminishes membrane excitability of nociceptive neurons, resulting in attenuation of nocifensive behavior in rodent models.\n\n【79】Suppression of inflammatory and neuropathic pain by uncoupling CRMP-2 from the presynaptic Ca  channel complex.\n\n【80】Gabapentinoids are the only class of systemic analgesic drugs that may exert their therapeutic effect through interacting with Ca <sub>v </sub> . Gabapentinoids were initially conceived as orally available analogues of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, for the treatment of seizure disorders.\n\n【81】Calcium channel a2–d ligands: gabapentin and pregabalin.\n\n【82】Although the antiepileptic efficacy of gabapentinoids did not hold up to the initial promise, they have been found to be efficacious for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【83】Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults.\n\n【84】Neuropathic pain: principles of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【85】Although the mechanism of action of gabapentinoids has not been fully elucidated, they have been found to bind to the α2δ-1 subunit of the Ca <sub>v </sub> , and it is, therefore, thought that they may, at least in part, exert analgesia through inhibition of Ca <sub>v </sub> .\n\n【86】Implications and mechanism of action of gabapentin in neuropathic pain.\n\n【87】A search for selective and potent Ca <sub>v </sub> antagonists identified ω-conotoxin MVIIA, a neurotoxic peptide isolated in the 1980s from the venom of marine snails belonging to the genus _Conus_ .\n\n【88】Neuronal calcium channel antagonists: discrimination between calcium channel subtypes using omega-conotoxin from _Conus magus_ venom.\n\n【89】Peptide neurotoxins from fish-hunting cone snails.\n\n【90】ω-Conotoxin MVIIA selectively blocks N-type Ca <sub>v </sub> present in nociceptive fibers. Despite efforts over 2 decades, a search for a drug with the mechanism of action analogous to ω-conotoxin MVIIA that would be efficacious and nontoxic after systemic administration has failed. Only in 2004, ziconotide, a ω-conotoxin MVIIA derivative, was approved for localized intrathecal (IT) delivery in patients with severe, otherwise intractable pain.\n\n【91】Intrathecal ziconotide: a review of its use in patients with chronic pain refractory to other systemic or intrathecal analgesics.\n\n【92】### Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels\n\n【93】Voltage-gated potassium channels (K <sub>v </sub> ) are also critical determinants of the firing frequency, and their downregulation results in membrane hyperexcitability.\n\n【94】Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.\n\n【95】Distinct potassium channels on pain-sensing neurons.\n\n【96】Although several potassium channels are expressed by primary nociceptive fibers, K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 has been most thoroughly studied in association with chronic pain and has been found to be markedly downregulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in the setting of nerve injury and neuropathic pain.\n\n【97】A long noncoding RNA contributes to neuropathic pain by silencing Kcna2 in primary afferent neurons.\n\n【98】Yet, no analgesic drugs that modulate nociceptive signaling through K <sub>v </sub> are clinically available.\n\n【99】### Ligand-Gated Cation Channels\n\n【100】Ligand-gated ion channels are an attractive target for drug development because their endogenous ligands can serve as a molecular pattern for discovery of compounds with analogous pharmacodynamics but therapeutically more favorable pharmacokinetics. The _N_ \\-methyl- d \\-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor mediates long-term potentiation, which has been found to play a key role in the development of chronic pain.\n\n【101】NMDA receptors and memory encoding.\n\n【102】Long-term potentiation at spinal C-fiber synapses: a target for pathological pain.\n\n【103】The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, a dissociative general anesthetic agent, is used in certain subgroups of chronic pain, but data on its efficacy are inconclusive.\n\n【104】Wherefore ketamine?\n\n【105】Effects of low-dose intranasal (S)-ketamine in patients with neuropathic pain.\n\n【106】Ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for cancer pain.\n\n【107】Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of subcutaneous ketamine in the management of cancer pain.\n\n【108】Ketamine as adjuvant analgesic to opioids: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review.\n\n【109】Despite an ongoing research effort, no clinically available NMDA antagonist more specific to nociception has been found.\n\n【110】Transient receptor potential channels (TRP) constitute another family of ligand-gated cation channels. Several TRP are expressed by the primary sensory neurons and are typically activated by noxious stimuli.\n\n【111】TRP channels and pain.\n\n【112】TRP, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) is a particularly attractive target for drug development because it is almost exclusively expressed by primary nociceptive neurons and its inactivation results in loss of pain and heat sensation while other sensory modalities remain intact.\n\n【113】The cloned capsaicin receptor integrates multiple pain-producing stimuli.\n\n【114】The capsaicin receptor: a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway.\n\n【115】Capsaicin, the pungent substance in chili peppers, is the only analgesic agent acting through TRPV1 clinically available to date and is used in the form of a patch to treat locoregional pain.\n\n【116】Topical capsaicin formulations in the management of neuropathic pain.\n\n【117】Capsaicin is a reversible TRPV1 agonist and is thought to induce analgesia by desensitizing TRPV1+ nerve fibers.\n\n【118】Capsaicin-based therapies for pain control.\n\n【119】A more intuitive approach to using the TRPV1 pathway is the use of TRPV1 receptor antagonists. Although a variety of TRPV1 antagonists have been tested in preclinical models, none have been successfully translated to the clinical setting owing to their off-target adverse effects, which included hyperthermia and impaired noxious heat sensation, after systemic delivery.\n\n【120】Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 antagonists: a patent review (2011-2014).\n\n【121】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【122】Glial cells have been reported to initiate and maintain neurogenic inflammation in the setting of chronic neuropathic pain, resulting in increased neuronal excitability.\n\n【123】Importance of glial activation in neuropathic pain.\n\n【124】The effect of glia on the primary sensory neurons may be mediated by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1β, and various chemokines.\n\n【125】Spinal interleukin-10 therapy to treat peripheral neuropathic pain.\n\n【126】The proinflammatory and pronociceptive effect of these cytokines is countered by anti-inflammatory cytokines. The principal anti-inflammatory cytokine is interleukin 10 (IL-10). Therefore, IL-10 is an attractive agent to treat neuropathic pain, which is known to be relatively refractory to opioid analgesics.\n\n【127】The IT administration of recombinant IL-10 has, indeed, been found to reduce neuroinflammation and allodynia in animal models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【128】Snake venom phospholipase A2s (Asp49 and Lys49) induce mechanical allodynia upon peri-sciatic administration: involvement of spinal cord glia, proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide.\n\n【129】Cytokine involvement in dynorphin-induced allodynia.\n\n【130】However, direct delivery of the recombinant IL-10 was found not to be feasible for clinical translation because of its high cost, its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and its half-life of only 2 hours in the cerebrospinal fluid after IT delivery.\n\n【131】Interleukin-10 as a CNS therapeutic: the obstacle of the blood-brain/blood-spinal cord barrier.\n\n【132】Controlling pathological pain by adenovirally driven spinal production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【133】### Pain-Modulating Neurotransmitters\n\n【134】Development and maintenance of chronic pain states is associated with alteration of the neurotransmitter milieu in the CNS.\n\n【135】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【136】The neuroinhibitory transmitter GABA is known to inhibit neuropathic pain signaling on the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【137】Partial peripheral nerve injury promotes a selective loss of GABAergic inhibition in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【138】Although 2 classes of GABAergic drugs—baclofen and benzodiazepines—are used in clinical practice in select patients, their effect is not selective to the nociceptive pathways, resulting in a very low therapeutic index in the context of pain management.\n\n【139】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【140】Despite substantial effort, novel and more selective analgesic agents using the GABAergic pathway are not clinically available.\n\n【141】Another neurotransmitter involved in pain signaling is substance P. Substance P is produced by neurons throughout the peripheral nervous system and CNS, and it exerts its effect by activating neurokinin type 1 (NK <sub>1 </sub> ) receptor.\n\n【142】Neurobiology of substance P and the NK1 receptor.\n\n【143】Studies using NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor knockout mice and NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists in rodents suggested that blocking substance P signaling would result in profound analgesia, thereby generating widespread enthusiasm regarding clinical translation.\n\n【144】The substance P receptor antagonist CP-99,994 reduces acute postoperative pain.\n\n【145】The NK1 receptor is essential for the full expression of noxious inhibitory controls in the mouse.\n\n【146】However, clinical studies of several NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists given by the systemic route reported an almost complete lack of analgesic efficacy in humans.\n\n【147】Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists: a comprehensive patent survey.\n\n【148】The failure of NK <sub>1 </sub> receptor antagonists may have been considered a breaking point in analgesic drug discovery and development as it brought the realization that there may be no magic bullet consisting of a chemical compound targeting a single nociceptive mechanism with a degree of nociceptive specificity that could rival (or exceed) the analgesic activity of opioids.\n\n【149】Locoregional Analgesics: An Alternative Approach to Drug Development\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【150】### Clinical Interventional Pain Procedures for Locoregional Pain Syndromes\n\n【151】Interventional drug delivery for locoregional chronic pain is one of the most common procedures performed in clinical practice.\n\n【152】The role of invasive pain management modalities in the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n【153】Multiple techniques that target various pain generators under imaging guidance are used.\n\n【154】Interventional approaches to pain management.\n\n【155】The most frequent targets for interventional drug delivery are the spinal nerves, which are accessed either IT or via the epidural (ED) route under fluoroscopic guidance. More than 2.5 million ED injections were performed in 2013 in the United States.\n\n<mark>【156】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.</mark>4.\n\n【157】Although all these procedures are remarkably safe, their efficacy has recently come under scrutiny.\n\n【158】Pain Management Injection Therapies for Low Back Pain.\n\n【159】Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , Rockville, MD 2015\n\n【160】For the ED injection, there is evidence of moderate efficacy for some pain syndromes, such as lumbar radiculitis, but no evidence of efficacy in others, such as spinal stenosis (neurogenic intermittent claudication).\n\n【161】A randomized trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis.\n\n【162】The chief reason for the limited efficacy of interventional procedures for chronic pain is the small repertoire of analgesic agents available for these routes of delivery. For IT delivery, the available drugs are limited to opioids, benzodiazepines, baclofen, ziconotide, local anesthetics, and ketamine.\n\n【163】Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.\n\n【164】For ED delivery, local anesthetics and corticosteroids constitute the only agents available to date. The pharmacologic effect of these agents is relatively nonspecific, and its duration is only transient in most patients, requiring either implantation of a pump for the IT route or repeated interventions for the ED route; on average patients receive 2 to 3 injections of ED corticosteroids per year.\n\n<mark>【165】S. Saymour, FDA Introductory Remarks, Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee Meeting , U.S. Food and Drug Administration, November 24, 2014.</mark>4.\n\n【166】Although the discovery of novel analgesic agents specifically designed for anatomically selective routes of delivery, such as ED, is a major unmet clinical need, this area has not been appreciably explored by the pharmaceutical industry and research laboratories. The search for novel molecular targets has focused on systemically administered drugs, whereas drug development for localized delivery mainly involved optimizing the formulation of already available agents for ED delivery, such as depot liposomal forms of corticosteroids extending their biological half-life (currently in the phase of preclinical development).\n\n【167】A lipid based depot (DepoFoam technology) for sustained release drug delivery.\n\n【168】It is notable that although the field of CDD focused on systemic analgesic drugs, the major truly innovative agent recently approved for the treatment of chronic pain, ziconotide, is a locally delivered (IT) agent.\n\n【169】### Requirements for a New Generation of Analgesic Drugs for Interventional Delivery\n\n【170】A desirable agent for localized, interventional delivery would ideally meet 2 requirements that differ from systemic drugs developed via CCD: (1) prolonged or even permanent activity after a single administration and (2) ability to penetrate the target tissue locally without a need for sufficient bioavailability after systemic administration and for lack of off-target toxicity. Although the first requirement raises a conceptual bar that the candidate interventional agents need to reach compared with most systemic drugs currently under development via CDD, the second requirement lowers this bar substantially. The combination of these 2 requirements, ie, the need for long-term effect after a single administration and lessened concern for off-target distribution and toxicity, seems to be uniquely suited for an emerging drug discovery and disease treatment paradigm: gene therapy.\n\n【171】Gene Therapy\n------------\n\n【172】### Beyond Hereditary Disorders\n\n【173】Gene therapy was initially developed to correct dysfunctional genes in rare monogenic disorders, such as inborn errors of metabolism or blood clotting disorders.\n\n【174】History of gene therapy.\n\n【175】However, the greatest potential impact of gene therapy may lie in the treatment of common, acquired disorders.\n\n【176】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【177】Cardioprotection by gene therapy: a review paper on behalf of the Working Group on Drug Cardiotoxicity and Cardioprotection of the Italian Society of Cardiology.\n\n【178】The field of gene therapy reached critical benchmarks during the past several years.\n\n【179】Gene therapy clinical trials worldwide to 2012: an update.\n\n【180】Gene therapy returns to centre stage.\n\n【181】In 2012, alipogene tiparvovec became the first gene therapy product to be commercially approved in Europe (for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency).\n\n【182】Endgame: glybera finally recommended for approval as the first gene therapy drug in the European Union.\n\n【183】In 2015, talimogene laherparepvec was the first gene vector brought to market in the United States (for the treatment of inoperable malignant melanoma and head and neck cancer).\n\n【184】Talimogene laherparepvec: first global approval.\n\n【185】Talimogene laherparepvec improves durable response rate in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n【186】### Gene Vectors: A Distinct Class of Therapeutic Agents\n\n【187】In gene therapy, a vector serves as an intracellular delivery mechanism for the instruction set provided by the therapeutic gene (transgene) to the targeted cells.\n\n【188】Gene therapy—basic principles and the road from bench to bedside.\n\n【189】in: Gad S.C. Rubany G.M. Pharmaceutical Sciences Encyclopedia. John Wiley & Sons Inc , Hoboken, NJ 2010\n\n【190】The encoded proteins or peptides are expressed by the target cells, thereby harnessing their machinery to produce the therapeutic substance locally. Vectors are the most commonly genetically engineered viruses whose ability to replicate is artificially disrupted and part or all of their genome is replaced by a transgene of choice.\n\n【191】Viral vectors for gene therapy: the art of turning infectious agents into vehicles of therapeutics.\n\n【192】Unique from other drug constructs, the viral vector–transgene package is modular. The surface characteristics of the viral shell (capsid serotype) will determine its tissue selectivity (tropism), and this can be varied independently of the carried transgene. This provides great flexibility in testing large numbers of potential transgene products directed at varying molecular targets. This approach also enables overexpressing, silencing, or de novo expressing of virtually any gene, thereby affecting any signaling pathway. A further variable that can be introduced is selective anatomic delivery, which may augment or overcome the challenges of insufficient tissue tropism.\n\n【193】### Primary Sensory Neurons as the Target of Gene Therapy for Pain\n\n【194】The primary sensory neurons, as the point of aggregation of nociceptive signaling from the periphery, are a rational target of gene therapy.\n\n【195】Nociceptors: the sensors of the pain pathway.\n\n【196】These neurons reside in the DRG, a structure that is anatomically accessible, obviating the risk of CNS instrumentation. There are also appropriate small-animal models of DRG access and peripheral nociceptive testing.\n\n【197】Tests and models of nociception and pain in rodents.\n\n【198】Targeted delivery of pharmacological agents into rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【199】These characteristics have focused attention on DRG neurons as the primary target for modulation of nociception. Gene therapy may be directed to DRG neurons either by transducing them directly or by transducing anatomically or functionally related structures, such as the glia or the meninges, whereby nociception is indirectly modulated by their interaction with DRG neurons.\n\n【200】### Targeting the Primary Sensory Neurons by Gene Vectors\n\n【201】To attain gene transfer to the primary sensory neurons, several routes of vector delivery have been explored. First, replication-incompetent herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors delivered by skin inoculation were pioneered by Fink, Glorioso, and others.\n\n【202】Deletion of multiple immediate-early genes from herpes simplex virus reduces cytotoxicity and permits long-term gene expression in neurons.\n\n【203】Engineering herpes simplex virus vectors for CNS applications.\n\n【204】This approach takes advantage of the inherent ability of this virus to undergo retrograde axonal transport from the sensory nerve terminal to the cell body and, thereby, to transduce DRG neurons whose dendrites originate in the injected sensory field of the skin. Although this selectivity makes HSV attractive for gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system, it also restricts its utility for other gene therapy applications; the overall translational experience with this vector remains, therefore, relatively limited.\n\n【205】Second, IT injection of several serotypes of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors was found to selectively transduce the primary sensory neurons.\n\n【206】AAV8(gfp) preferentially targets large diameter dorsal root ganglion neurones after both intra-dorsal root ganglion and intrathecal injection.\n\n【207】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【208】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【209】Recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (rAAV2/6)-mediated gene transfer to nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery.\n\n【210】Differential adeno-associated virus mediated gene transfer to sensory neurons following intrathecal delivery by direct lumbar puncture.\n\n【211】Adeno-associated virus is the leading vector type across many gene therapy fields because it is not associated with any disease in any species, is devoid of any viral genes, and yields stable gene expression for months to years.\n\n【212】Adeno-associated virus: from defective virus to effective vector.\n\n【213】The initial safety concerns regarding AAV vectors, which included insertional mutagenesis, germline transmission, replication escape, and dissemination of the vector to the public domain, have been thoroughly addressed in the field and do not seem to be applicable in the context of human trials, as previously reviewed in detail elsewhere.\n\n【214】Preclinical toxicity evaluation of AAV for pain: evidence from human AAV studies and from the pharmacology of analgesic drugs.\n\n【215】Furthermore, the difficulties with large-scale manufacturing of AAV vectors, which were holding back the clinical translation of AAV-based gene therapy, have recently been overcome.\n\n【216】Large-scale recombinant adeno-associated virus production.\n\n【217】A relative restriction associated with AAV is the need to switch capsids if serial treatments are needed because serologic immunity renders the readministration of a vector with the same serotypes ineffective.\n\n【218】Immune responses to AAV vectors: overcoming barriers to successful gene therapy.\n\n【219】In addition to AAV, IT delivery of other vector types, such lentiviruses or AAV plasmid DNA, was also tested for gene therapy for pain. Although efficacious in certain therapeutic strategies, these vectors did not transduce the primary sensory neurons but rather glial cells or the meninges.\n\n【220】Gene therapy for the treatment of chronic peripheral nervous system pain.\n\n【221】Third, to further improve the efficiency of gene transfer, several groups have targeted the nociceptive neurons directly by intraganglionic injection of AAV in rodents.\n\n【222】Intraganglionic AAV6 results in efficient and long-term gene transfer to peripheral sensory nervous system in adult rats.\n\n【223】Comparison of AAV serotypes for gene delivery to dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【224】Direct injection into the dorsal root ganglion: technical, behavioral, and histological observations.\n\n【225】Although this approach led to highly efficacious and selective gene transfer to the DRGs in a rodent model, an open surgical procedure consisting of paravertebral exposure and foraminotomy was required.\n\n【226】Molecular Targets of Gene Therapy for Pain\n------------------------------------------\n\n【227】The molecular selectivity of gene therapy has been of great interest because it enables utilization of antinociceptive mechanisms that have not been accessible by conventional agents. A variety of approaches have been found to be efficacious in animal models of chronic pain. Important examples of the molecular targets used to date by gene therapy for pain are (1) spinal opioid delivery, (2) anti-inflammatory cytokines, and (3) ion channels and neurotrophic growth factor.\n\n【228】### Spinal Opioid Delivery\n\n【229】The opioid system is an attractive target for gene therapy because of the robust clinical experience with exogenous opioids. Although opioids modulate pain processing at multiple levels of the nervous system, delivery of exogenous opioids to the spinal IT space is sufficient to achieve analgesia.\n\n【230】Intrathecal opioids for intractable pain syndromes.\n\n【231】Gene transfer of opioid genes selectively to DRG neurons has been found to reduce chronic pain in animal models of locoregional pain (as reviewed next). This approach may eliminate the toxicity of exogenously administered opioids, which is attributed to their extraspinal effects in the CNS and in peripheral tissues.\n\n【232】Side effects of intrathecal and epidural opioids.\n\n【233】Long-term opioid management for chronic noncancer pain.\n\n【234】A systematic review of the use of opioid medication for those with moderate to severe cancer pain and renal impairment: a European Palliative Care Research Collaborative opioid guidelines project.\n\n【235】A review of potential adverse effects of long-term opioid therapy: a practitioner's guide.\n\n【236】The prevalence, severity, and impact of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: results of a US and European Patient Survey (PROBE 1).\n\n【237】The effects of opioids and opioid analogs on animal and human endocrine systems.\n\n【238】Coronary heart disease outcomes among chronic opioid and cyclooxygenase-2 users compared with a general population cohort.\n\n【239】Opioids and immune modulation: more questions than answers.\n\n【240】Two principal strategies using opioid signaling for analgesia by gene therapy have been described. First, several groups have used transgenes encoding endogenous opioid agonists delivered to the DRGs. Goss et al\n\n【241】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【242】used preproenkephalin, a δ-opioid receptor agonist, and endomorphine-2, a μ-opioid receptor agonist, delivered by HSV vectors. We used AAV to deliver prepro-ß-endorphin, an artificial opioid precursor of the μ-opioid agonist peptide ß-endorphin that is engineered to be secreted in a stimulus-independent manner via the constitutive secretory pathway.\n\n【243】Retrovirus-mediated expression of an artificial beta-endorphin precursor in primary fibroblasts.\n\n【244】Administration of these therapeutic genes resulted in robust reduction of allodynia or hyperalgesia in multiple rodent models of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain.\n\n【245】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【246】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【247】Antinociceptive effect of a genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector expressing human proenkephalin in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【248】Herpes vector-mediated expression of proenkephalin reduces bone cancer pain.\n\n【249】The second strategy to harness the opioid system for gene therapy of pain consists of transferring genes that encode an opioid receptor. Xu et al\n\n【250】Adeno-associated viral transfer of opioid receptor gene to primary sensory neurons: a strategy to increase opioid antinociception.\n\n【251】Efficiencies of transgene expression in nociceptive neurons through different routes of delivery of adeno-associated viral vectors.\n\n【252】reported this approach several years ago, but no recent follow-up studies seem to have been attempted. Another approach testing an opioid receptor mutant was reported more recently.\n\n【253】Intrathecal delivery of a mutant micro-opioid receptor activated by naloxone as a possible antinociceptive paradigm.\n\n【254】### Anti-inflammatory Cytokines\n\n【255】Gene transfer of IL-10 by several vector systems, including HSV and AAV, has been extensively tested in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【256】Sensory neuron targeting by self-complementary AAV8 via lumbar puncture for chronic pain.\n\n【257】Intrathecal long-term gene expression by self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 1 suitable for chronic pain studies in rats.\n\n【258】Controlling neuropathic pain by adeno-associated virus driven production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.\n\n【259】HSV-mediated transfer of interleukin-10 reduces inflammatory pain through modulation of membrane tumor necrosis factor α in spinal cord microglia.\n\n【260】Production of IL-10 resulted in marked reduction of allodynia and hyperalgesia, a finding verified independently by multiple groups. In addition to IL-10, a tumor necrosis factor–soluble receptor delivered via HSV-mediated gene transfer reduced allodynia in a rodent model of varicella zoster virus–induced pain.\n\n【261】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【262】### Ion Channels\n\n【263】Discovery of the voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels that are specific to nociception and the failure to generate corresponding conventional analgesic drugs has prompted an effort to use these targets via gene therapy. Two approaches have been used: (1) overexpression of ion channels responsible for membrane hyperpolarization by delivering vectors that carry the gene encoding for the respective channel and (2) downregulation of ion channels responsible for membrane depolarization by RNA interference, ie, by delivering vectors encoding small interfering RNA or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) complementary to the sequence of the respective ion channel, or by gene transfer of genes whose products deactivate these channels.\n\n【264】In the first approach, AAV-mediated gene transfer of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 in a rat model of neuropathic pain resulted in normalization of K <sub>v </sub> 1.2 expression that had been downregulated in the context of nerve injury. This was associated with a decrease in allodynia in the treated animals.\n\n【265】Current gene therapy using viral vectors for chronic pain.\n\n【266】Similarly, overexpression of the glycine receptor (a ligand-gated chloride channel) in the sensory fibers mediated by HSV resulted in attenuation of hyperalgesia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【267】HSV delivery of a ligand-regulated endogenous ion channel gene to sensory neurons results in pain control following channel activation.\n\n【268】In the second approach, Samad et al\n\n【269】Virus-mediated shRNA knockdown of Na(v)1.3 in rat dorsal root ganglion attenuates nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.\n\n【270】found that knockout of Na <sub>v </sub> 1.3 by shRNA encoded by an AAV vector delivered into the DRGs attenuated allodynia in the experimental animals. Similarly, knockout of the NR subunit of the NMDA receptor in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord via AAV-mediated transfer of the respective small interfering RNA reduced spinal NMDA currents as well as nociceptive behavior in a model of chronic inflammatory pain.\n\n【271】siRNA-mediated knockdown of the NR1 subunit gene of the NMDA receptor attenuates formalin-induced pain behaviors in adult rats.\n\n【272】A conditional deletion of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in adult spinal cord dorsal horn reduces NMDA currents and injury-induced pain.\n\n【273】Downregulation of the TRPV1 signaling via gene transfer of either shRNA delivered by IT AAV or the dominant negative (poreless) form of the protein delivered by HSV has been found to reduce allodynia in rat models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【274】Intrathecal AAV serotype 9-mediated delivery of shRNA against TRPV1 attenuates thermal hyperalgesia in a mouse model of peripheral nerve injury.\n\n【275】Herpes simplex virus vector-mediated gene delivery of poreless TRPV1 channels reduces bladder overactivity and nociception in rats.\n\n【276】An HSV vector system for selection of ligand-gated ion channel modulators.\n\n【277】Fischer et al\n\n【278】Sustained relief of neuropathic pain by AAV-targeted expression of CBD3 peptide in rat dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【279】downregulated Ca <sub>v </sub> 2.2 by AAV-mediated gene transfer of Ca  channel-binding peptide 3, also resulting in attenuation of neuropathic pain in the rat model. Ma et al\n\n【280】Expression of inwardly rectifying potassium channels by an inducible adenoviral vector reduced the neuronal hyperexcitability and hyperalgesia produced by chronic compression of the spinal ganglion.\n\n【281】found that overexpression of Kir2.1, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, delivered by an adenoviral vector into the DRGs suppresses neuronal excitability and prevents the development of hyperalgesia in rodents.\n\n【282】### Neurotransmitters and Growth Factors\n\n【283】Delivery of AAV or HSV vectors encoding several isoforms of the GABA gene showed reduction of allodynia in rodent models of neuropathic pain.\n\n【284】Constitutive GABA expression via a recombinant adeno-associated virus consistently attenuates neuropathic pain.\n\n【285】Vector-mediated release of GABA attenuates pain-related behaviors and reduces Na(V)1.7 in DRG neurons.\n\n【286】The AAV- or HSV-mediated gene transfer of several neurotrophic growth factors has been investigated as a novel approach to treat chronic pain by reversing the synaptic remodeling described in chronic pain states. This approach could be tested only by gene therapy because conventional pharmacotherapy could not attain target-specific, long-term delivery of an active agent. Several neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, erythropoietin, glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, were found to reduce pain behavior in rodent models of chronic neuropathic pain.\n\n【287】Amelioration of chronic neuropathic pain after partial nerve injury by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated over-expression of BDNF in the rat spinal cord.\n\n【288】Neuroprotective effect of herpes simplex virus-mediated gene transfer of erythropoietin in hyperglycemic dorsal root ganglion neurons.\n\n【289】HSV-mediated gene transfer of the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor provides an antiallodynic effect on neuropathic pain.\n\n【290】Long-term neuroprotection achieved with latency-associated promoter-driven herpes simplex virus gene transfer to the peripheral nervous system.\n\n【291】### Gene Editing\n\n【292】Gene editing is a technique for highly targeted deletion, insertion, or substitution of a desired sequence of a genome.\n\n【293】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【294】Although multiple gene editing techniques have been described, the field underwent a breakthrough in 2012 when Barrangou, Doudna, Jinek, and others described the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in conjunction with CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9).\n\n【295】CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.\n\n【296】Genome-scale engineering for systems and synthetic biology.\n\n【297】A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.\n\n【298】The CRISPR craze.\n\n【299】CRISPR/Cas9 allows precise and cost-effective gene editing in vivo, and is poised to revolutionize gene therapy. It seems conceivable that in vivo gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 delivered by gene vector may give rise to a whole new field of pain therapy.\n\n【300】### Chemogenetics and Optogenetics\n\n【301】Chemogenetics and optogenetics represent 2 emerging approaches to selectively and, unlike traditional gene therapy, reversibly manipulate cell phenotypes via gene transfer.\n\n【302】Therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain: potential application of pharmacosynthetics and optogenetics.\n\n【303】Chemogenetics is based on designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). The DREADDs are G protein–coupled receptors artificially engineered to respond to nanomolar concentrations of otherwise biologically inert ligands, such as clozapine-N-oxide.\n\n【304】Controlling signaling with a specifically designed Gi-coupled receptor.\n\n【305】Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.\n\n【306】Preliminary studies in rodents suggest that selective expression of DREADDs in nociceptive neurons via gene transfer might allow efficient and highly precise exogenous control of nociceptive signaling.\n\n【307】Normal and abnormal coding of somatosensory stimuli causing pain.\n\n【308】Mu opioid receptor modulation of dopamine neurons in the periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe: a role in regulation of pain.\n\n【309】(457) Gi-DREADD expression in TRPV1-Cre mice produces ligand-dependent behavioral inhibition to noxious heat, but ligand-independent changes in sensory neurons.\n\n【310】Analogously, optogenetics enables tunable manipulation of cell phenotypes using light.\n\n【311】Orderly recruitment of motor units under optical control in vivo.\n\n【312】Iyer et al\n\n【313】Virally mediated optogenetic excitation and inhibition of pain in freely moving nontransgenic mice.\n\n【314】found that AAV-mediated gene transfer of eNpHR3.0, a chloride channel activated by yellow light, to the DRG sensory neurons results in reduction of allodynia in rodent models that is tunable by illumination by light of the respective wavelength.\n\n【315】### Pathways to Clinical Translation\n\n【316】Herpes simplex virus encoding preproenkephalin, administered as a series of intradermal injections for intractable locoregional pain caused by cancer, is the only vector so far tested in humans in the context of gene therapy for pain.\n\n【317】Gene therapy for pain: results of a phase I clinical trial.\n\n【318】A phase 1 clinical trial reported safety of the treatment, but the lack of a blinded control group, a design typical of a phase 1 trial, did not allow any conclusions regarding efficacy. A subsequent blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial was initiated in 2011 and completed in November 2013 (according to ClinicalTrials.gov ).\n\n【319】Of note, HSV was translated from rodent studies directly into clinical trials without testing the approach in a large-animal model as an intermediate step. Should the clinical trial fail to find analgesic efficacy, it may be difficult to discern whether the HSV gene transfer technology or the therapeutic gene was the cause of failure. In such a situation, only large-animal studies may be able to further the understanding.\n\n【320】Adeno-associated virus–based gene therapy has not been tested in patients with chronic pain but in numerous other clinical settings, including phase 1, 2, and 3 trials for a large variety of neurologic and nonneurologic therapeutic applications.\n\n【321】In the field of AAV for pain, we translated the approach into large-animal models, first reporting differences in gene transfer outcomes compared with rodents when the IT route was tested.\n\n【322】High cerebrospinal fluid levels of interleukin-10 attained by AAV in dogs.\n\n【323】Subsequently, we developed a method of locoregional delivery of AAV to DRG neurons in a large-animal (swine) model using computed tomography fluoroscopy.\n\n【324】Minimally invasive convection-enhanced delivery of biologics into dorsal root ganglia: validation in the pig model and prospective modeling in humans.\n\n【325】This study recreated the gene transfer outcomes of the original rodent studies of intraganglionic AAV delivery while introducing an image-guided intervention technique and thereby obviating the need for open surgical exposure of the DRG that was used in rodents. Examination of the comparative anatomy of porcine and human spines indicates that similar, minimally invasive intraganglionic injection could also be performed in the clinical setting.\n\n【326】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【327】Interventional pain specialists have a unique skill set to translate gene therapy–based treatment approaches into novel clinical treatments for locoregional pain. Future clinical progress may be driven not only by the rapid advances in gene vector design and clinical availability but also by advances in interventional delivery techniques. Image guidance available for clinical use to date can provide anatomic selectivity for gene vector delivery to select DRGs. Combining the molecular selectivity of gene vectors with the anatomic selectivity of image-guided delivery may spur a new era of interventions for pain using a dual selective approach to analgesic treatment, thereby offering novel treatment options for patients with hitherto intractable locoregional pain.", "index": 31203, "show": true, "start": 31125, "end": 31233, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:22:07", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:26:52", "cost": 285.269}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:38", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:26:51", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:22:05"}

Glucotrol\n2.  Glucotrol XL\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Glipizide is used to treat high blood sugar levels caused by a type of diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes) called type 2 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, your body does not work properly to store excess sugar and the sugar remains in your bloodstream. Chronic high blood sugar can lead to serious health problems in the future.\n\n【4】Proper diet is the first step in managing type 2 diabetes, but often medicines are needed to help your body. Glipizide belongs to a class of drugs called sulfonylureas. It stimulates the release of insulin from the pancreas, directing your body to store blood sugar. This helps lower blood sugar and restore the way you use food to make energy.\n\n【5】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【6】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【7】*   Tablet, Extended Release\n*   Tablet\n\n【8】Before Using\n------------\n\n【9】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

The extended-release tablet may cause obstruction in patients with this condition.\n\n【37】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【38】Follow carefully the special meal plan your doctor gave you. This is the most important part of controlling your condition, and is necessary if the medicine is to work properly. Also, exercise regularly and test for sugar in your blood or urine as directed.\n\n【39】This medicine comes with a patient information insert. Read and follow the instructions in the insert carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【40】Swallow the extended release tablet whole. Do not split, crush, or chew it.\n\n【41】If you are taking the extended release tablet, part of the tablet may pass into your stool after your body has absorbed the medicine. This is normal and nothing to worry about.\n\n【42】### Dosing\n\n【43】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【44】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【45】*   For type 2 diabetes:\n\n【46】    *   For oral dosage form (extended-release tablets):\n        *   Adults—At first, 5 milligrams (mg) once a day taken with breakfast. Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed. The dose is usually not more than 20 mg per day.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【47】    *   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n        *   Adults—At first, 5 milligrams (mg) once a day taken at least 30 minutes before breakfast. Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed. The dose is usually not more than 40 mg per day.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【48】### Missed Dose\n\n【49】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【50】### Storage\n\n【51】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【52】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【53】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【54】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【55】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【56】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【57】It is very important to follow carefully any instructions from your health care team about:\n\n【58】*   Alcohol—Drinking alcohol may cause severe low blood sugar. Discuss this with your health care team.\n*   Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, patients with diabetes may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur in patients with diabetes during pregnancy.\n*   Travel—Keep your recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.\n*   In case of emergency—There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.\n\n【59】Check with your doctor right away if you start having chest pain or discomfort; nausea; pain or discomfort in the arms, jaw, back, or neck; shortness of breath; sweating; or vomiting while you are using this medicine. These may be symptoms of a serious heart problem, including a heart attack.\n\n【60】Glipizide can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). However, this can also occur if you delay or miss a meal or snack, drink alcohol, exercise more than usual, cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting, take certain medicines, or take glipizide with another type of diabetes medicine. The symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they lead to unconsciousness (passing out). Different people feel different symptoms of low blood sugar. It is important that you learn which symptoms of low blood sugar you usually have so you can treat it quickly.\n\n【61】Symptoms of low blood sugar include anxiety; behavior change similar to being drunk; blurred vision; cold sweats; confusion; cool, pale skin; difficulty with thinking; drowsiness; excessive hunger; fast heartbeat; headache (continuing); nausea; nervousness; nightmares; restless sleep; shakiness; slurred speech; or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【62】If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel, corn syrup, honey, or sugar cubes; or drink fruit juice, non-diet soft drink, or sugar dissolved in water. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Glucagon is used in emergency situations when severe symptoms such as seizures (convulsions) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe or needle, and know how to use it. Members of your household also should know how to use it.\n\n【63】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【64】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【65】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【66】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【67】#### Less common\n\n【68】1.

Clinical Pearls is designed with the 3 qualities of physician-learners in mind. First, we physicians enjoy learning from cases. Second, we like concise, practical points that we can use in our practice. Finally, we take pleasure in problem solving.\n\n【1】In the Clinical Pearls format, speakers present a number of short cases in their specialty to a general internal medicine audience. Each case is followed by a multiple-choice question answered live by attendees using an audience response system. The answer distribution is shown to attendees. The correct answer is then displayed and the speaker discusses teaching points, clarifying why one answer is most appropriate. Each case presentation ends with a Clinical Pearl, defined as a practical teaching point that is supported by the literature but generally not well known to most internists.\n\n【2】Clinical Pearls is currently one of the most popular sessions at the American College of Physicians meeting. As a service to its readers, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ has invited a selected number of these Clinical Pearl presentations to be published in our Concise Reviews for Clinicians section. “Clinical Pearls in Neurology” is one of them.\n\n【3】Case 1\n------\n\n【4】A 70-year-old man with a history of smoking and hypertension is seen in urgent care 3 hours after awakening with first-ever acute vertigo, vomiting, and imbalance in the absence of headache or other focal neurologic or otologic symptoms. Vertigo persists even while sitting upright with his head still. He is unable to walk unassisted due to ataxia.\n\n【5】### Question\n\n【6】**Which physical examination test is _most useful_ in this setting to differentiate between acute vestibular neuritis and cerebellar infarction?**\n\n【7】*   a\n\n【8】    Head impulse test (HIT)\n\n【9】*   b\n\n【10】    Dix-Hallpike test\n\n【11】*   c\n\n【12】    Cover testing for skew deviation\n\n【13】*   d\n\n【14】    Romberg test\n\n【15】*   e\n\n【16】    Examination for Babinski sign\n\n【17】### Discussion\n\n【18】Distinguishing an acute peripheral vestibulopathy (vestibular neuritis) from a posterior circulation infarction in the acutely vertiginous patient is challenging. Focal neurologic signs are often lacking in cerebellar infarction. Proper management differs widely between the 2 conditions, and computed tomography has poor sensitivity for brainstem and cerebellar ischemic strokes in the acute setting. The Dix-Hallpike test is used specifically to test for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is unlikely in this case given the persisting vertigo while sitting still. Romberg test may be abnormal in both conditions (although patients with cerebellar infarction may have such severe truncal ataxia as to be unable to sit or stand), and the Babinski sign would be absent in both. Fortunately, several features elicited on bedside examination have been found to be very useful for distinguishing benign from dangerous causes of acute vertigo .\n\n【19】The head impulse test is a simple bedside examination technique to evaluate the integrity of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) generated from stimulating each horizontal semicircular canal.\n\n【20】A clinical sign of canal paresis.\n\n【21】With the patient watching the examiner's nose, the examiner very rapidly rotates the patient's head 15 degrees to one side and watches to see if the VOR is able to keep the eyes fixed on the examiner's nose. In a peripheral vestibulopathy, rapid rotation toward the side of the lesion does not generate a sufficient VOR to keep the eyes on target, and a small “catch-up” saccadic (fast) eye movement will be required immediately after the head rotation to refixate on the target . However, acute vertigo from a cerebellar infarction spares the VOR and results in a normal HIT. In addition, skew deviation (supranuclear vertical eye misalignment) can be assessed at the bedside with alternate cover testing and is a specific but quite insensitive marker for brainstem or cerebellar lesions in acute vertigo. Finally, spontaneous nystagmus direction reflects the origin of the vertigo: Acute peripheral vestibulopathy produces unidirectional horizontal nystagmus with quick phases beating away from the side of the lesion, whereas central lesions may cause direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus and/or dominantly vertical or torsional spontaneous nystagmus. The combination of these 3 examination findings (HIT, skew deviation, and spontaneous nystagmus direction) appears to be more sensitive than diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in acute vertigo.\n\n【22】HINTS to diagnose stroke in the acute vestibular syndrome: three-step bedside oculomotor examination more sensitive than early MRI diffusion-weighted imaging.\n\n【23】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【24】The HIT is the most sensitive and specific bedside test for distinguishing central from peripheral causes in the acute vestibular syndrome when other focal neurologic or otologic findings are lacking.\n\n【25】Case 2\n------\n\n【26】A 66-year-old woman is seen for evaluation of a 3-week history of positional vertigo episodes. Symptoms began 2 days after bumping her head under a counter. Since then, she may experience 20-second-long episodes of vertigo upon rolling over in bed or first sitting up in the morning, and she feels unsteady making quick head turns while walking. She has no history of vertigo or other neurologic symptoms. Examination is normal. Dix-Hallpike test is negative bilaterally, without producing any vertigo or nystagmus.\n\n【27】### Question\n\n【28】**What should be the _next step_ in evaluation or management?**\n\n【29】*   a\n\n【30】    Vestibular function testing\n\n【31】*   b\n\n【32】    MRI of the brain and internal auditory canals\n\n【33】*   c\n\n【34】    Testing for horizontal canal BPPV (hc-BPPV)\n\n【35】*   d\n\n【36】    Epley maneuver\n\n【37】*   e\n\n【38】    Meclizine and reassurance\n\n【39】### Discussion\n\n【40】The patient's history strongly suggests BPPV, the most common vestibular disorder with a cumulative incidence of nearly 10% by age 80 years.\n\n【41】Epidemiology of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a population based study.\n\n【42】Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is caused by dislodged otoconia from the labyrinthine utricle that float into a semicircular canal and render it abnormally excited by changes in head position with respect to gravity. Few conditions other than BPPV cause brief, purely positional episodes of isolated vertigo. Cerebellar or craniocervical junction abnormalities can cause positional nystagmus that is typically purely vertical or torsional, persists for the duration that the head position is maintained, and does not produce severe vertiginous symptoms.\n\n【43】Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo affecting the posterior semicircular canal (pc-BPPV) occurs in 85% of patients, causing a transient mixed upbeat/torsional nystagmus on the Dix-Hallpike test. Once the affected side is determined, it can be treated effectively with the Epley canalith repositioning procedure. About 10% of BPPV affects the horizontal canal (hc-BPPV). Symptoms are essentially identical to those of pc-BPPV, so it should be suspected with the typical history when Dix-Hallpike test is negative. A supine roll test \n\n【44】Quality Standards Subcommittee, American Academy of Neurology  \nPractice parameter: therapies for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (an evidence-based review): a report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n【45】Horizontal semicircular canal variant of benign positional vertigo.\n\n【46】should be performed from the supine position by turning the head 90 degrees to the right and then to the left. Nystagmus elicited in hc-BPPV is horizontal and changes direction depending on which ear is down. Most commonly, the horizontal nystagmus beats toward the ground (geotropic) with the head to either side, and the strongest nystagmus occurs with the affected ear down. If all positional testing results are negative but the history suggests BPPV, it is more useful to repeat positional testing another day than to order an MRI.\n\n【47】Several treatment options exist for hc-BPPV, the simplest of which is the Lempert (barbecue roll) maneuver\n\n【48】Quality Standards Subcommittee, American Academy of Neurology  \nPractice parameter: therapies for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (an evidence-based review): a report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n【49】: With the patient supine and the affected ear down, the head (and body as required) is rotated in 90-degree increments toward the healthy side, holding each position for 10 to 30 seconds, until the patient makes a full circle with the affected ear down again. The patient is then simultaneously returned to supine face up and rapidly sat up. Like the Epley maneuver for the posterior canal, the concept is to move the head in such a way as to liberate the otoconia from the canal back into the utricle.\n\n【50】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【51】Horizontal canal BPPV is less common than pc-BPPV but is also treatable with a simple repositioning maneuver in the office.\n\n【52】Case 3\n------\n\n【53】A 41-year-old woman sees you for a 3-year history of spontaneous episodes consisting of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and imbalance, each lasting hours to a few days. She has had a total of 10 attacks and reports a concurrent headache with 3 of them; she usually has associated photophobia. Sometimes the episodes seem triggered by missed meals, stress, or menses. She feels well between attacks. You elicit a lifelong history of motion sickness and a 20-year history of occasional migraine headaches without aura. Her grandmother had Ménière disease, and 2 family members have migraine.\n\n【54】### Question\n\n【55】**What is the _most likely_ cause of this patient's recurrent spontaneous episodes of vertigo?**\n\n【56】*   a\n\n【57】    Vestibular migraine (VM)\n\n【58】*   b\n\n【59】    Ménière disease\n\n【60】*   c\n\n【61】    Vertebrobasilar insufficiency\n\n【62】*   d\n\n【63】    Superior canal dehiscence syndrome\n\n【64】*   e\n\n【65】    Basilar-type migraine\n\n【66】### Discussion\n\n【67】Ménière disease is a condition producing attacks of vertigo, tinnitus, fluctuating ipsilateral hearing loss, and aural fullness typically lasting 2 to 3 hours and is thought to result from distortion of the membranous labyrinth leading to endolymphatic hydrops. The absence of auditory symptoms and the history of some episodes lasting for days would make Meniere disease unlikely in this case. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency would be an unlikely cause of episodes lasting hours to days and recurring over years. Superior canal dehiscence syndrome is an uncommon condition in which dehiscence of the thin petrous bone separating the roof of the superior semicircular canal from the middle cranial fossa leads to sound- and pressure-induced auditory and vestibular symptoms. Manifestations may include brief episodes of noise- or Valsalva maneuver–induced vertigo, hyperacusis for bone-conducted sound (such as pulsatile tinnitus and hearing one's own voice loudly in the affected ear), and apparent conductive hearing loss on audiometry, none of which is present in this patient.\n\n【68】Vestibular migraine (or migrainous vertigo) is the most common cause of recurrent spontaneous episodes of vertigo, with a prevalence estimated at 1% in the general population.\n\n【69】Migrainous vertigo: prevalence and impact on quality of life.\n\n【70】Studies from tertiary dizziness clinics\n\n【71】Migraine and isolated recurrent vertigo of unknown cause.\n\n【72】Association of benign recurrent vertigo and migraine in 208 patients.\n\n【73】have found that among patients who have chronic recurrent attacks of vertigo without otologic symptoms and no other cause for their symptoms, 61% to 87% are also migraine sufferers. Vestibular migraine affects predominantly women, peaks in the third to fifth decades, and is typically preceded by migraine headaches for years (although the headaches may be mild enough not to be mentioned by the patient). The pathophysiology of VM remains unclear but likely involves central and peripheral vestibular pathways. It is diagnosed by history (and typically normal examination findings), although tests may be needed to rule out other conditions. Diagnostic criteria include episodic vestibular symptoms of at least moderate severity in which migrainous symptoms (headache, photophobia, phonophobia, aura) accompany at least 2 attacks in a patient with a current or previous history of migraine.\n\n【74】Vestibular migraine.\n\n【75】Supporting features include vertigo precipitated by food triggers, sleep irregularities, or hormonal changes; strong family history of migraine; and reduction in attacks with migraine preventative medications. Less than 10% of VM patients meet criteria for basilar-type migraine, which requires 2 or more basilar-distribution neurologic symptoms lasting between 5 and 60 minutes. Although both VM and Meniere disease can cause vertigo lasting for hours, findings favoring VM include vertigo attacks also lasting a day or more and only minimal or bilateral aural symptoms with a normal audiogram.\n\n【76】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【77】Vestibular migraine is a common but underdiagnosed cause of recurrent vertigo most commonly affecting young to middle-aged women. Diagnosed on clinical grounds, management typically begins with migraine preventive strategies similar to those for migraine headaches.\n\n【78】Case 4\n------\n\n【79】Your 62-year-old patient returns 1 month after neurologic consultation confirming your suspicion of idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) causing new-onset asymmetric rest tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and a shuffling gait. A treatment regimen of carbidopa/levodopa, 25/100-mg tablets 3 times per day with meals, was initiated and has been titrated up to 2½ tablets per dose. Very little benefit has been noticed, however.\n\n【80】### Question\n\n【81】**What is the _most likely_ cause of the poor medication response?**\n\n【82】*   a\n\n【83】    He should have been given controlled-release carbidopa/levodopa\n\n【84】*   b\n\n【85】    He should be taking the carbidopa/levodopa on an empty stomach\n\n【86】*   c\n\n【87】    He should titrate up to 3 tablets per dose\n\n【88】*   d\n\n【89】    A dopamine agonist would be more potent\n\n【90】*   e\n\n【91】    He has a different disorder such as multiple system atrophy or progressive supranuclear palsy\n\n【92】### Discussion\n\n【93】In the absence of additional clinical features such as dementia, autonomic failure, or cerebellar ataxia, the presence of asymmetric parkinsonism with rest tremor suggests a diagnosis of idiopathic PD. Initial levodopa treatment is the most efficacious therapy, and a good clinical response to a proper trial provides confirmatory diagnostic evidence for idiopathic PD.\n\n【94】When levodopa was introduced in the 1960s, nausea and vomiting were frequent problems due to premature conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, which then stimulates the brainstem chemoreceptor trigger zone to cause nausea. Taking levodopa with food helped reduce nausea. Unfortunately, if taken with food, levodopa must compete with other ingested large neutral amino acids to cross the intestinal mucosa and blood-brain barrier via saturable transport mechanisms, leading to reduced bioavailability of the medication.\n\n【95】Pharmacokinetics of levodopa.\n\n【96】The addition of carbidopa to levodopa formulations in 1973 reduced peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine and greatly improved tolerability. The tradename Sinemet is derived from _sin_ (Latin), meaning _without_ , and _emet_ (Greek), meaning _emesis_ . Still, well-meaning pharmacists may instruct patients to take it with food. Carbidopa/levodopa is best started as 25/100-mg immediate-release (yellow) tablets in 3 doses, each given 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals. Each dose is titrated from one-half or 1 tablet in half-tablet increments up to 3 tablets based on clinical benefit, which is typically seen at 400 to 800 mg/d of levodopa.\n\n【97】Levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\n\n【98】Individual doses above 3 tablets have little added benefit and are more likely to cause peak-dose dyskinesias. If nausea develops, it is usually mild, resolves with continued administration, and can be countered with soda crackers (low protein) eaten with each dose. Most newly treated patients do not have short-duration responses or clinical fluctuations with this regimen. Immediate-release carbidopa/levodopa is also substantially cheaper than any alternative.\n\n【99】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【100】Carbidopa/levodopa should be taken on an empty stomach to maximize absorption and bioavailability. If nausea develops, it is usually mild, transient, and countered by eating a few soda crackers.\n\n【101】Case 5\n------\n\n【102】A healthy 32-year-old woman with a 1-year history of increasingly frequent episodic unilateral headaches associated with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia is evaluated in the clinic between headaches. Neurologic examination is normal. She undergoes MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head, which demonstrate a 4-mm saccular aneurysm at the junction of the internal carotid and ophthalmic arteries. There is no known personal or family history of ruptured or unruptured aneurysms.\n\n【103】### Question\n\n【104】**What are the _most appropriate_ interpretation and course of action at this time?**\n\n【105】*   a\n\n【106】    Headaches are migraines. Aneurysm is incidental. No further action required\n\n【107】*   b\n\n【108】    Enlarging aneurysm is likely causing headaches. Emergent coiling/clipping is needed\n\n【109】*   c\n\n【110】    Aneurysm is incidental, but rupture risk is high. Needs urgent intervention\n\n【111】*   d\n\n【112】    Rupture risk is 10% in the next 6 months. Obtain prompt cerebrovascular consultation\n\n【113】*   e\n\n【114】    Rupture risk is extremely low. Reassure patient. Routine cerebrovascular consultation to consider options and surveillance\n\n【115】### Discussion\n\n【116】Intracranial aneurysms are acquired lesions at intracranial arterial branching sites. About 2% of the general population or 3 to 6 million Americans harbor intracranial aneurysms, which are increasingly detected with routine use of advanced neuroimaging. About 25,000 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages occur each year in the United States, so most aneurysms do not rupture; however, the case fatality rate from rupture is 30% to 40%. Women have aneurysms 3 times as commonly as men. Patients with coarctation of the aorta or adult polycystic kidney disease have a prevalence of 10% and should be screened with MRA.\n\n【117】Rupture risk is most closely linked to aneurysm size and location, although smoking, hypertension, and a personal or family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage also increases rupture risk. Fortunately, aneurysms most commonly affect the anterior circulation (internal carotid, middle or anterior cerebral arteries) and are less than 7 mm in size, both features associated with an extremely low rupture rate.\n\n【118】International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms Investigators  \nUnruptured intracranial aneurysms: natural history, clinical outcome, and risks of surgical and endovascular treatment.\n\n【119】The 5-year cumulative rupture rate for anterior circulation aneurysms smaller than 7 mm is nearly 0%. However, a 7- to 12-mm posterior cerebral or vertebrobasilar aneurysm has a 14.5% 5-year rupture rate. Thus, this woman with migraine can be reassured, queried for conditions or family history that would increase rupture risk, and referred routinely for cerebrovascular evaluation. Follow-up imaging is typically performed at 6 months and then yearly for 3 years since 5% to 10% of aneurysms will grow during this time, especially if they are larger when first detected (83% if over 12 mm).\n\n【120】Intracranial aneurysm enlargement on serial magnetic resonance angiography: frequency and risk factors.\n\n【121】Younger patients with posterior circulation aneurysms or aneurysms smaller than 7 mm may be candidates for treatment with coiling or clipping, whereas risks and benefits must be more carefully weighed in older patients.\n\n【122】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【123】Intracranial aneurysm rupture rates are exceedingly low with asymptomatic aneurysms smaller than 7 mm affecting the anterior circulation. Larger size and posterior location as well as personal and family risk factors increase the rupture rate.\n\n【124】Case 6\n------\n\n【125】You are seeing a 58-year-old woman in the clinic because she awoke that morning with complete left-side ptosis. She had complained of dull left orbital pain the day before. Her history is significant for migraines, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Examination reveals complete left-side ptosis, 2 mm of anisocoria (left pupil larger than right), and impaired left ocular motility. She cannot adduct the eye past the primary position, has impaired upgaze, and develops intorsion on attempted downgaze . The rest of the examation findings are normal.\n\n【126】### Question\n\n【127】**What are the _most likely_ diagnosis and _best_ next step?**\n\n【128】*   a\n\n【129】    Ophthalmoplegic migraine; sumatriptan\n\n【130】*   b\n\n【131】    Isolated third cranial nerve palsy; angiography\n\n【132】*   c\n\n【133】    Ischemic fourth cranial nerve palsy; erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n\n【134】*   d\n\n【135】    Myasthenia gravis; refer for edrophonium test\n\n【136】*   e\n\n【137】    Dorsal midbrain infarction; MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging\n\n【138】### Discussion\n\n【139】The patient has an acute, isolated, complete third (oculomotor) cranial nerve palsy. The third cranial nerve travels from the midbrain to the orbit to innervate the superior, inferior, and medial recti, the inferior oblique, levator palpebrae, and the iris sphincter and ciliary muscles of the lens. Abduction from the lateral rectus (abducens nerve) is intact. Intorsion on downgaze implies preserved superior oblique (fourth cranial nerve) function. Although myasthenia gravis can mimic virtually any ocular motor palsy, its onset is rarely so acute, unilateral, and specific for third cranial nerve–innervated muscles (and the pupil is unaffected in myasthenia gravis). Ophthalmoplegic migraine most commonly affects the third cranial nerve but is rare, typically preceded by prolonged migraine headache, and mainly affects children.\n\n【140】An enlarging posterior communicating artery aneurysm is the dreaded and presumed cause of an acquired isolated third cranial nerve palsy until proven otherwise. Since microvascular ischemia within the third cranial nerve is a more common cause in older patients with vascular risk factors, the “rule of the pupil” traditionally helped predict the likelihood of an aneurysm. Because the pupillomotor fibers sit on the surface of the nerve, a compressive aneurysmal third cranial nerve palsy would be expected to cause a dilated pupil. Thus, an otherwise _complete_ isolated third cranial nerve palsy that _spared_ the pupil was presumed to be ischemic. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (to rule out giant cell arteritis) and serum glucose level were determined, and the patient could be closely observed for expected recovery within 8 to 12 weeks. The footnote to the rule was that if there was _incomplete_ ptosis or ophthalmoparesis, a normal pupil provides no reassurance against an aneurysm. Given the risks of catheter cerebral angiography, this rule has proved useful in guiding selection of those who need angiography.\n\n【141】Unfortunately, clinical features do not allow perfect guidance on the aneurysm risk. The presence of headache or orbital pain is nonspecific. Up to 20% of patients with microvascular ischemic third cranial nerve palsy have anisocoria, but rarely more than 1.5 mm difference. Although microvascular ischemia is much more likely in a pupil- _sparing_ complete third cranial nerve palsy, the high morbidity of an enlarging symptomatic aneurysm and imperfect discrimination on clinical grounds support some neuroimaging in all acquired isolated third cranial nerve palsies, regardless of pupil status, especially in patients younger than age 50 years. Fortunately, given the continued improvements in computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and MRA at detecting clinically relevant aneurysms smaller than 4 mm,\n\n【142】Management of intracranial aneurysm causing a third cranial nerve palsy: MRA, CTA or DSA?\n\n【143】experts now generally recommend prompt CTA or MRA in virtually all patients with acquired isolated third cranial nerve palsy.\n\n【144】Searching for brain aneurysm in third cranial nerve palsy.\n\n【145】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【146】When the pupil is affected in an acquired isolated third cranial nerve palsy, the risk of an enlarging aneurysm is high, and urgent vascular imaging is required, generally with cerebral angiography. Even when the pupil is spared, CTA or MRA are now generally recommended, given the high morbidity of aneurysmal rupture.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": []}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:38", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:17:03", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:07:37"}

Over time, the LES may begin to fail, leading to acid and chemical damage of the esophagus, a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is often accompanied by symptoms such as heartburn or regurgitation. In some people, this GERD may trigger a change in the cells lining the lower esophagus, causing Barrett's esophagus.\n\n【3】Barrett's esophagus is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer. Although the risk of developing esophageal cancer is small, it's important to have regular checkups with careful imaging and extensive biopsies of the esophagus to check for precancerous cells (dysplasia). If precancerous cells are discovered, they can be treated to prevent esophageal cancer.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The development of Barrett's esophagus is most often attributed to long-standing GERD, which may include these signs and symptoms:\n\n【6】*   Frequent heartburn and regurgitation of stomach contents\n*   Difficulty swallowing food\n*   Less commonly, chest pain\n\n【7】Curiously, approximately half of the people diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus report little if any symptoms of acid reflux.

Macleod—Nobel Prize for Discovery of Insulin", "text": "【0】John J. R. Macleod—Nobel Prize for Discovery of Insulin\n**A** lthough Canadian surgeon Frederick G. Banting (1891-1941) and Canadian physiologist Charles H. Best (1899-1978) are given credit for the discovery of insulin, Scottish physiologist John James Rickard Macleod shared the 1923 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine for “his discovery of insulin.” A stamp (Scott No. 3701) issued in 2002 by Guyana honored Macleod as a Nobel laureate.\n\n【1】Macleod, the son of a clergyman, was born on September 6, 1876, in Cluny, near Dienkeld, Perthshire, in central Scotland. He received his early education at Aberdeen Grammar School (northeastern Scotland). In 1893, he enrolled in Marischal College of the University of Aberdeen to study medicine and received MB and ChB degrees in 1898. Macleod was awarded an Anderson Traveling Fellowship that enabled him to spend 1899 at the Institute of Physiology of the University of Leipzig (Germany), where he studied biochemistry.\n\n【2】Macleod returned to England and obtained a position as demonstrator in physiology at the London Hospital Medical School in 1899. He was appointed lecturer in biochemistry at the same institution in 1902 and was also selected as Mackinnon research scholar of The Royal Society. That same year, he was awarded a DPH degree from Cambridge University (England).\n\n【3】After he received his doctorate in public health, Macleod was appointed professor of physiology at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, where he remained until 1918. While at Western Reserve University, he became interested (1905) in diabetes and began investigating the metabolism of carbohydrates, particularly the physiology of diabetes mellitus. He also investigated air sickness, electric shock, purine bases, carbamates, and bacterium that causes tuberculosis.\n\n【4】In 1918, Macleod joined the University of Toronto (Canada) as associate dean of medicine and subsequently became director of its physiology laboratory. In May 1921, Macleod gave Banting permission to use the laboratory for his research on insulin.\n\n【5】Best, who was an undergraduate medical student in Macleod's classes, joined Banting, and together they began investigating the secretions of the pancreas. Eventually (1921), Banting and Best succeeded in isolating and purifying insulin. The name “insulin” was provided by Macleod, who changed the original name “insuline,” suggested by the British physiologist Edward A. Sharpey-Schafer (1850-1935), who had been one of the first investigators to support the hypothesis of a pancreatic hormone. During this time, Macleod was made dean of the faculty of medicine at the University of Toronto.\n\n【6】The Canadian researchers were aware of the work of German physician Joseph von Mering (1849-1908) and German physiologist Oskar Minkowski (1858-1931), who in 1889 announced their discovery that removal of the pancreas in dogs led to their death.\n\n【7】Controversy surrounded the 1923 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine because it was awarded only to Banting and Macleod. Banting suggested that Best also be included. Although Best was never added as a recipient, Banting shared the prize money with him. Many historians believe that Macleod should not have been awarded the prize because he had little or nothing to do with the actual work on insulin. Macleod credited the work done on the project by Canadian biochemist James Bertram Collip (1892-1965), who assisted in the purification of insulin.\n\n【8】In 1928, Macleod was appointed Regius Professor of Physiology at the University of Aberdeen. On March 16, 1935, after years of crippling arthritis, Macleod died in Aberdeen at the age of 58 years. He was honored by many scientific groups and societies. Among his numerous publications are _Practical Physiology_ (1903), _Physiology and Biochemistry in Modern Medicine_ (1918), _Insulin and Its Use in Diabetes_ (1925), and _Carbohydrate Metabolism and Insulin_ (1926).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:40:45", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:40:54", "cost": 9.602}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:38", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:40:54", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:40:44"}

Someone who has tongue-tie might have difficulty sticking out his or her tongue. Tongue-tie can also affect the way a child eats, speaks and swallows.\n\n【3】Sometimes tongue-tie may not cause problems. Some cases may require a simple surgical procedure for correction.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of tongue-tie include:\n\n【6】*   Difficulty lifting the tongue to the upper teeth or moving the tongue from side to side\n*   Trouble sticking out the tongue past the lower front teeth\n*   A tongue that appears notched or heart shaped when stuck out\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】See a doctor if:\n\n【9】*   Your baby has signs of tongue-tie that cause problems, such as having trouble breast-feeding\n*   A speech-language pathologist thinks your child's speech is affected by tongue-tie\n*   Your older child complains of tongue problems that interfere with eating, speaking or reaching the back teeth\n*   You're bothered by your own symptoms of tongue-tie\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Typically, the lingual frenulum separates before birth, allowing the tongue free range of motion. With tongue-tie, the lingual frenulum remains attached to the bottom of the tongue. Why this happens is largely unknown, although some cases of tongue-tie have been associated with certain genetic factors.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】Although tongue-tie can affect anyone, it's more common in boys than girls. Tongue-tie sometimes runs in families.\n\n【14】Complications\n-------------\n\n【15】Tongue-tie can affect a baby's oral development, as well as the way he or she eats, speaks and swallows.\n\n【16】For example, tongue-tie can lead to:\n\n【17】*   **Breast-feeding problems.** Breast-feeding requires a baby to keep his or her tongue over the lower gum while sucking. If unable to move the tongue or keep it in the right position, the baby might chew instead of suck on the nipple. This can cause significant nipple pain and interfere with a baby's ability to get breast milk. Ultimately, poor breast-feeding can lead to inadequate nutrition and failure to thrive.\n*   **Speech difficulties.** Tongue-tie can interfere with the ability to make certain sounds — such as \"t,\" \"d,\" \"z,\" \"s,\" \"th,\" \"r\" and \"l.\"\n*   **Poor oral hygiene.** For an older child or adult, tongue-tie can make it difficult to sweep food debris from the teeth. This can contribute to tooth decay and inflammation of the gums (gingivitis). Tongue-tie can also lead to the formation of a gap or space between the two bottom front teeth.\n*   **Challenges with other oral activities.** Tongue-tie can interfere with activities such as licking an ice cream cone, licking the lips, kissing or playing a wind instrument.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:37:04", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:37:32", "cost": 27.828}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:38", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:37:30", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:37:02"}

Her symptoms had started 2 days before transfer to our facility with a worsening daily headache. The headache was located in the right frontotemporal region and associated with nausea and vomiting. She described the headache as a continuous ache with intermittent throbbing but no associated aura, photophobia, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, or jaw pain. For several days before the onset of symptoms, she had intermittent fever with a maximum temperature of 39.0°C (reference range, 36.0°C-38.0°C), rigors, generalized malaise, light-headedness, and myalgias. She did not have diplopia, blurry vision, dysarthria, paresthesias, productive cough, wheezing, dyspnea, urinary urgency or frequency, dysuria, abdominal pain, loose stools, or any incontinence. A central line had not been placed at the outside facility.\n\n【1】The patient's medical history was notable for untreated hypertension, Bell palsy, and anemia. She was a native of the Ivory Coast and had traveled to Togo and Ghana before arriving in the United States to visit her son 3 months previously. She had no pets, did not consume undercooked meats, and did not take any medications.\n\n【2】On admission, vital signs were notable for a temperature of 37.6°C, a regular pulse rate of 86 beats/min, blood pressure of 152/89 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, and normal oxygen saturation while breathing ambient air. Physical examination findings were notable for a mildly erythematous oropharynx and scleral icterus; there was no lymphadenopathy or neck stiffness, and Kernig and Brudzinski signs were absent. Laboratory studies yielded the following notable findings (reference ranges provided parenthetically): white blood cell count of 8.7 × 10  /L (3.5-10.5 × 10  /L) with a normal differentiation and platelet count of 83 × 10  /L (150-450 × 10  /L). The total bilirubin level was 1.3 mg/dL (≤1.2 mg/dL) with a conjugated fraction of 0.3 mg/dL (0.0-0.3 mg/dL). Results of an electrolyte panel and liver function studies were otherwise normal. The patient underwent chest radiography, which revealed no consolidations. Urinalysis results were normal. Testing for serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin was negative.\n\n【3】Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a 6-mm left ophthalmic internal carotid artery aneurysm and a possible cavernous sinus meningioma on the right. On hospital day 2, the patient was scheduled for endovascular treament of the aneurysm, but the development of a fever (temperature, 39.4°C) prompted us to cancel the procedure.\n\n【4】*   1.\n\n【5】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ explanation for this patient's fever?**\n\n【6】    *   a.\n\n【7】        Lower respiratory tract infection\n\n【8】    *   b.\n\n【9】        Urinary tract infection\n\n【10】    *   c.\n\n【11】        Central line–associated infection\n\n【12】    *   d.\n\n【13】        Tropical illness\n\n【14】    *   e.\n\n【15】        Liver abscess\n\n【16】Lower respiratory tract infection is unlikely because the patient did not have respiratory symptoms and no abnormalities were noted on chest radiography. She had no signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection and no history of central line placement. Because the patient is from West Africa, she is at risk of acquiring a tropical illness, which is the most likely diagnosis. Tropical illnesses encountered in West Africa include Ebola, typhoid or enteric fever, yellow fever, dengue fever, malaria, schistosomiasis, and chikungunya. In a patient with liver abscess, fever is typically accompanied by abdominal pain and elevated levels on liver function tests. The patient did not have this presentation.\n\n【17】Further infectious work-up including urine culture, throat culture, rapid _Streptococcus_ test, influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR), QuantiFERON-TB Gold tuberculosis test, and serologies for dengue virus, _Toxoplasma_ , _Cryptococcus_ antigen, _Histoplasma_ , _Coccidioides_ , and human immunodeficiency virus yielded negative results. Blood culture results were also negative. In the hospital, the patient's fever was treated with acetaminophen.\n\n【18】*   2.\n\n【19】    **At this time, which _one_ of the following is the _best_ next step?**\n\n【20】    *   a.\n\n【21】        PCR for Ebola\n\n【22】    *   b.\n\n【23】        Test for yellow fever–specific IgM\n\n【24】    *   c.\n\n【25】        Thick and thin blood smears for malaria\n\n【26】    *   d.\n\n【27】        Test for dengue-specific IgM\n\n【28】    *   e.\n\n【29】        Test for chikungunya-specific IgM\n\n【30】Ebola is included in the differential diagnosis given that the patient is from West Africa. Ebola is a viral illness spread from person to person via contact with contaminated blood or bodily fluids up to 21 days after exposure. Symptoms include fever, headache, myalgias, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and, in some cases, hemorrhage.\n\n【31】Our patient has been away from home for 3 months. To date, there have been no cases of Ebola in the Ivory Coast, although it shares a border with Guinea and Liberia where there has been an outbreak. Therefore, she is not likely to have Ebola and will not benefit from PCR testing of the blood. There have been outbreaks of yellow fever in the Ivory Coast, and because of this, yellow fever vaccine is recommended for travelers to this country. Illness begins 3 to 6 days after a bite from an infected mosquito. Symptoms include fever, myalgias, headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Following symptom remission, some patients have progression to a toxic phase that manifests with organ dysfunction and hemorrhage.\n\n【32】Malaria.\n\n【33】Our patient has been away from the endemic region for 90 days, much longer than the incubation period for yellow fever, and is unlikely to have this disease. Conversely, malaria can manifest months or even years after initial exposure, especially if one was previously exposed and developed partial immunity or received prophylaxis. Thick and thin blood smear for malaria is the criterion standard for diagnosis and is the most appropriate step at this time.\n\n【34】The thick film concentrates the parasites and increases diagnostic sensitivity. Nonimmune individuals may be symptomatic at very low parasite densities that initially may be undetectable by blood smear. In such cases, the smear should be repeated every 12 to 24 hours for 3 sets.\n\n【35】Dengue fever, also known as “break-bone fever,” is a mosquito-borne viral illness associated with urban environments and manifests with fever, severe headache with retro-orbital pain, and severe myalgias and arthralgias, The incubation period is several days.\n\n【36】Given that the patient has been out of the endemic area for a longer period of time, it is unlikely that she has dengue fever. Chikungunya is another mosquito-borne illness included in the differential diagnosis. Similar to dengue fever, it is associated with urban environments; the incubation period is a few days, and the illness is characterized by sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain.\n\n【37】Our patient is unlikely to have chikungunya because she has been out of the endemic area for longer than just a few days.\n\n【38】A blood parasite smear revealed parasitemia with 0.5% of cells infected with _Plasmodium_ that was confirmed by PCR as _Plasmodium falciparum_ .\n\n【39】*   3.\n\n【40】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _best_ treatment option for a patient who did not take malaria prophylaxis?**\n\n【41】    *   a.\n\n【42】        Chloroquine\n\n【43】    *   b.\n\n【44】        Atovaquone-proguanil\n\n【45】    *   c.\n\n【46】        Artesunate\n\n【47】    *   d.\n\n【48】        Intravenous quinidine gluconate plus doxycycline\n\n【49】    *   e.\n\n【50】        Exchange transfusion\n\n【51】The treatment choice depends on the malaria species, the clinical status of the patient, and the drug susceptibility of the infecting parasites as determined by the geographic area where the infection was acquired and the previous use of antimalarial medicines.\n\n【52】World Health Organization  \nGuidelines for the Treatment of Malaria.\n\n【53】2nd ed. World Health Organization , Geneva, Switzerland 2010\n\n【54】The initial decision is whether the patient has _P falciparum_ malaria or malaria due to _Plasmodium vivax_ , _Plasmodium ovale_ , _Plasmodium malariae_ , or _Plasmodium knowlesi_ . _Plasmodium falciparum_ and _P knowlesi_ infections can cause rapidly progressive severe illness or death, whereas the other species are less likely to have severe manifestations. Also, _P vivax_ and _P ovale_ infections require treatment for the hypnozoite forms that remain dormant in the liver and can cause relapsing infection.\n\n【55】Subsequent treatment decisions are based on classification of the disease as severe (ie, having end-organ damage) or uncomplicated. Uncomplicated disease is treated with oral antimalarial medications, and severe disease is treated with intravenous antimalarials. Our patient had no evidence of end-organ damage including impaired consciousness, hemoglobin level of less than 7 mg/dL, renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypotension, acidosis, and/or parasitemia with 5% or more of cells infected. The patient had uncomplicated _P falciparum_ malaria. Although she had headache, there was no suspicion for cerebral malaria, which is a manifestation of severe malaria presenting with end-organ damage including alteration in consciousness. Further, the choice of antimalarial is based on the origin of the disease, the susceptibility of the malaria species, and the adverse effects, availability, and cost of the medication.\n\n【56】In general, _P falciparum_ malaria acquired anywhere with the exception of the Caribbean, Central America west of the Panama Canal, and most of the Middle East is chloroquine resistant. Non– _P falciparum_ malaria is susceptible to chloroquine, but resistance is increasing in Indonesia, Oceania, and Peru. In this patient, _P falciparum_ malaria was acquired in West Africa. Chloroquine would not be a good choice because the organism would most likely be resistant to it. Atovaquone-proguanil is the treatment of choice for uncomplicated _P falciparum_ malaria in the United States and hence is the most appropriate treatment for this patient.\n\n【57】In most of the world, artemisinin combination therapies are first-line treatment for _P falciparum_ , but this is not the case in the United States because of low availability. For cases of severe malaria, intravenous artesunate should be used over intravenous quinine or quinidine because of markedly reduced parasitemia and risk of death when compared head-to-head.\n\n【58】Artesunate versus quinine for treating severe malaria.\n\n【59】In the United States, quinidine is used more often because it is more readily available than artemisinin derivatives. Doxycycline is used only in combination with artesunate or quinine as second-line therapy. The evidence for exchange blood transfusions in severe malaria is anecdotal, and no comparative trials have established efficacy.\n\n【60】Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Malaria. Clinical Guidance. Available at: cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/clinicalguidance.pdf . Accessed September 9, 2015.\n\n【61】In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) performed an analysis of exchange transfusion as an adjunct to antimalarial drugs for treatment of severe malaria and concluded that it did not affect survival.\n\n【62】Exchange transfusion for severe malaria: evidence base and literature review.\n\n【63】As a result of this analysis, the CDC no longer recommends this treatment.\n\n【64】Our patient was treated with atovaquone-proguanil in the hospital. She tolerated the medication well. Her fever subsided, and her headache and nausea improved. The aneurysm was determined to be stable and did not require immediate intervention.\n\n【65】*   4.\n\n【66】    **Which _one_ of the following tests should be performed _next_ ?**\n\n【67】    *   a.\n\n【68】        Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing\n\n【69】    *   b.\n\n【70】        Hemoglobin electrophoresis\n\n【71】    *   c.\n\n【72】        Repeated thick and thin blood smear\n\n【73】    *   d.\n\n【74】        No additional testing\n\n【75】    *   e.\n\n【76】        PCR testing for drug resistance\n\n【77】Testing for G6PD is not indicated in this case because patients with G6PD deficiency experience hemolytic anemia from use of primaquine or fluoroquinolones,\n\n【78】G6PD Deficiency Working Group  \nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and antimalarial drug development.\n\n【79】which our patient has not received. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is helpful in diagnosing sickle cell disease or thalassemia, conditions that are protective against malaria. Thick and thin blood smear remains the criterion standard for diagnosing malaria, but there is no indication to repeat the smear once the diagnosis is established, especially in uncomplicated cases unless the patient has a relapse. In patients with severe malaria, the clinician may consider repeating daily smears to monitor progress with treatment. No additional testing is required for cases of malaria diagnosed outside the United States. The CDC recommends malaria testing including PCR for confirmation of species and identification of drug-resistant mutations because of the growing resistance to antimalarials and because most of the infections are acquired outside the United States. A PCR test is not done in most areas endemic for malaria because of the high cost and the requirement for a specialized laboratory. Rapid diagnostic tests using _Plasmodium_ antigens are also available for the diagnosis of malaria, but they are less sensitive in low parasitemia and may not be specific for the species. In that case, the smear is necessary for diagnosis.\n\n【80】The patient was discharged from the hospital with a 3-day regimen of atovaquone-proguanil. She followed up with a neurosurgeon for elective coiling of the aneurysm 1 week after completing treatment of the malaria. She remained afebrile and headache free. Following the neurosurgical procedure, she received dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel. The patient planned to return home to the Ivory Coast.\n\n【81】*   5.\n\n【82】    **Which _one_ of the following is recommended to prevent malaria reinfection when the patient returns home to the Ivory Coast?**\n\n【83】    *   a.\n\n【84】        Chloroquine once weekly\n\n【85】    *   b.\n\n【86】        Atovaquone-proguanil once daily\n\n【87】    *   c.\n\n【88】        Bed nets, spraying the house with insecticide, draining stagnant water\n\n【89】    *   d.\n\n【90】        Vaccine\n\n【91】    *   e.\n\n【92】        Intermittent presumptive treatment\n\n【93】Chemoprophylaxis for malaria is recommended for travelers to an endemic area, including expatriates who lose their immunity to malaria after approximately 5 years. Chemoprophylaxis consists of chloroquine once weekly in chloroquine-sensitive areas or atovaquone-proguanil once daily when traveling to areas with chloroquine-resistant malaria. Chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for people living in endemic areas. Because our patient lives in the Ivory Coast, an endemic area, chemoprophylaxis is not recommended. Use of insecticide-impregnated bed nets, spraying the house with insecticide, draining stagnant water, using mosquito repellant on exposed skin and clothing, and avoiding the peak mosquito feeding period of dusk to dawn are measures to decrease mosquito bites and risk of infection with malaria. These measures are recommended for travelers as well as for natives of malaria-endemic regions, such as our patient. Another promising preventive therapy is a malaria vaccine, which is not currently available on the market but is in development.\n\n【94】RTS, S Clinical Trials Partnership  \nA phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in African infants.\n\n【95】Intermittent presumptive treatment can be used in high-risk populations (ie, pregnant women and infants) in endemic areas.\n\n【96】Infections in returning travelers.\n\n【97】Our patient is not in the high-risk group.\n\n【98】Discussion\n----------\n\n【99】Malaria is a major global health problem, with an estimated 207 million cases and 627,000 deaths worldwide in 2012. Malaria is endemic in more than 100 countries, and 3.4 billion individuals are at risk worldwide. Although malaria was eliminated from the United States in the early 1950s, approximately 1500 to 2000 cases of malaria are reported each year, almost exclusively in returned international travelers.\n\n【100】World Health Organization  \nWorld Malaria Report 2013.\n\n【101】World Health Organization , Geneva, Switzerland 2013\n\n【102】Malaria is transmitted by the female _Anopheles_ mosquito, and infection in humans is caused by 5 protozoan species of the genus _Plasmodium_ — _P falciparum_ , _P vivax_ , _P ovale_ , _P malariae_ , and _P knowlesi_ . Most cases reported in the United States are caused by _P falciparum_ (58%) or _P vivax_ (17%).\n\n【103】Malaria should be part of the differential diagnosis for all patients who present with fever within 1 year after international travel to an endemic area, even if the patient has had previous exposure and developed partial immunity or has received prophylaxis. More than 90% of cases occur within 30 days of exposure.\n\n【104】Malaria surveillance—United States, 2012.\n\n【105】The differential diagnosis for fever in a returned traveler also includes infections common in nontravelers (urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, community-acquired pneumonia) as well as typhoidal and nontyphoidal salmonellosis, dengue fever, viral hepatitis, and rickettsial infections. Nearly 95% of patients with malaria in the United States report a history of fever, but only half have a fever the day of presentation. Malaria presents with a “cold” stage in which a patient shakes with rigors, followed by a “hot” stage in which the temperature can exceed 40°C, after which the patient sweats and the temperature returns to normal.\n\n【106】Malaria.\n\n【107】Although the fever is traditionally described as occurring in discrete episodes lasting a few hours every 2 to 3 days, the fever can have an irregular pattern throughout the day. Additional symptoms are generally nonspecific and can include headache, malaise, and myalgias. Patients may also report gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea or nausea. The most common physical examination abnormality aside from fever is splenomegaly.\n\n【108】Malaria.\n\n【109】Laboratory abnormalities are generally mild and may include transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia. Patients with _P falciparum_ malaria may decompensate rapidly, and infection with this species is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment, particularly in nonimmune travelers. Complications may include impaired consciousness or coma, seizure, respiratory distress, severe anemia, renal failure, jaundice, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n【110】The criterion standard for diagnosis of malaria is microscopic identification of malaria parasites on Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears. If the initial smear results are negative and malaria is suspected, blood smears should be repeated at 12- to 24-hour intervals for 48 to 72 hours. Other methods of diagnosis include rapid tests and PCR. Patients with malaria should be treated immediately. If a patient's presentation is strongly suggestive of severe malaria and there is a compatible travel history, diagnostic testing should not delay treatment. The optimal treatment regimen varies depending on several factors, including severity, the species of malaria, the likelihood of drug resistance (based on where the infection was acquired), patient age, and pregnancy status. Oral treatment options for uncomplicated malaria include chloroquine (in sensitive areas), atovaquone-proguanil, or artemisinin combinations. Severe malaria—characterized by end-organ damage, hemoglobin level less than 7 mg/dL, parasitemia (>5% infected cells), or acidosis—is treated with intravenous artesunate or quinidine. Pregnant women are treated with mefloquine or quinidine and clindamycin for uncomplicated malaria. Detailed treatment guidelines and recommendations are available on the CDC website.\n\n【111】Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Malaria treatment table.

However, stone formers have sustained higher cystatin C levels and proteinuria that may affect long-term risk of chronic kidney disease.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), eGFRCr ( serum creatinine–based estimated glomerular filtration rate ), GFR ( glomerular filtration rate ), OR ( odds ratio )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:55:34", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:55:54", "cost": 19.906}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:37", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:55:53", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:55:32"}

All 160 patients referred by NPs and PAs combined and a random sample of 160 patients referred by physicians were studied. Five experienced physicians blinded to the source of referral used a 7-item instrument to assess the quality of referrals. Internal consistency, interrater reliability, and dimensionality of item scores were determined. Differences between item scores for patients referred by physicians and those for patients referred by NPs and PAs combined were analyzed by using multivariate ordinal logistical regression adjusted for patient age, sex, distance of the referral source from Mayo Clinic, and Charlson Index.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Factor analysis revealed a 1-dimensional measure of the quality of patient referrals. Interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient for individual items: range, 0.77-0.93; overall, 0.92) and internal consistency for items combined (Cronbach α=0.75) were excellent. Referrals from physicians were scored higher (percentage of agree/strongly agree responses) than were referrals from NPs and PAs for each of the following items: referral question clearly articulated (86.3% vs 76.0%; _P_ \\=.0007), clinical information provided (72.6% vs 54.1%; _P_ \\=.003), documented understanding of the patient's pathophysiology (51.0% vs 30.3%; _P_ <.0001), appropriate evaluation performed locally (60.3% vs 39.0%; _P_ <.0001), appropriate management performed locally (53.5% vs 24.1%; _P_ <.0001), and confidence returning patient to referring health care professional (67.8% vs 41.4%; _P_ <.0001). Referrals from physicians were also less likely to be evaluated as having been unnecessary (30.1% vs 56.2%; _P_ <.0001).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The quality of referrals to an academic medical center was higher for physicians than for NPs and PAs regarding the clarity of the referral question, understanding of pathophysiology, and adequate prereferral evaluation and documentation.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】NP ( nurse practitioner ), PA ( physician assistant )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:01:09", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:01:14", "cost": 4.526}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:37", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:01:14", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:01:09"}

The exposed bladder can't store urine or function normally, resulting in urine leakage (incontinence).\n\n【2】Problems caused by bladder exstrophy vary in severity. They can include defects in the bladder, genitals and pelvic bones, as well as defects in the intestines and reproductive organs.\n\n【3】Bladder exstrophy may be spotted on a routine ultrasound during pregnancy. Sometimes, though, the defect isn't visible until the baby is born. Babies born with bladder exstrophy will need surgery to correct the defects.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Bladder exstrophy is the most common in the larger group of birth defects called the bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC). Children with BEEC have one of the following:\n\n【6】*   **Epispadias.** This is the least severe form of BEEC, in which the tube to expel urine (urethra) doesn't fully develop.\n*   **Bladder exstrophy.** This defect causes the bladder to form on the outside of the body. The bladder is also turned inside out. Usually, bladder exstrophy will involve organs of the urinary tract, as well as the digestive and reproductive systems. Defects of the abdominal wall, bladder, genitals, pelvic bones, final section of the large intestine (rectum) and opening at the end of the rectum (anus) can occur.\n\n【7】    Children with bladder exstrophy also have vesicoureteral reflux. This condition causes urine to flow the wrong way — from the bladder back up into the tubes that connect to the kidneys (ureters). Children with bladder exstrophy also have epispadias.\n\n【8】*   **Cloacal exstrophy.** Cloacal exstrophy (kloe-A-kul EK-stroh-fee) is the most serious form of BEEC. In this condition, the rectum, bladder and genitals don't fully separate as the fetus develops. These organs may not be correctly formed, and the pelvic bones are affected as well.\n\n【9】    The kidneys, backbone and spinal cord also may be affected. Most children with cloacal exstrophy have spinal abnormalities, including spina bifida. Children born with protruding abdominal organs probably also have cloacal exstrophy or bladder exstrophy.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】The cause of bladder exstrophy is unknown. Researchers think that a combination of genetic and environmental factors likely plays a role.\n\n【12】What is known is that as the fetus grows, a structure called the cloaca (klo-A-kuh) — where reproductive, urinary and digestive openings all come together — doesn't develop properly in babies who develop bladder exstrophy. Defects in the cloaca can vary a lot depending on the age of the fetus when the developmental error occurs.\n\n【13】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【14】Factors that increase the risk of bladder exstrophy include:\n\n【15】*   **Family history.** Firstborn children, children of a parent with bladder exstrophy or siblings of a child with bladder exstrophy have an increased chance of being born with the condition.\n*   **Race.** Bladder exstrophy is more common in whites than in other races.\n*   **Sex.** More boys than girls are born with bladder exstrophy.\n*   **Use of assisted reproduction.** Children born through assisted reproductive technology, such as IVF, have a higher risk of bladder exstrophy.\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】### Without surgery\n\n【18】Without treatment, children with bladder exstrophy won't be able to hold urine (urinary incontinence). They're also at risk of sexual dysfunction and have an increased risk of bladder cancer.\n\n【19】### After surgery\n\n【20】Surgery can reduce complications. The success of surgery depends on how severe the defect is. Many children who have surgical repair are able to hold urine. Young children with bladder exstrophy may walk with their legs turned somewhat outward due to the separation of their pelvic bones.\n\n【21】### Long-term complications\n\n【22】People born with bladder exstrophy can go on to have normal sexual function, including the ability to have children. However, pregnancy will be high risk for both mother and baby, and a planned cesarean birth may be needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:47:40", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:48:32", "cost": 51.697}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:37", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:48:32", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 01:13:42"}

I did speak of a woman's morally permissible discretion to decline an intrauterine embryo transfer. In consequence of any such declination, the embryo in question will not develop beyond about day 10. From this we may draw inferences about how we should treat that embryo. Neither those inferences nor applying a generic name to such an embryo implies any ontological change.\n\n【1】It does not suffice for ensoulment, as Dr Nelson contends, that a being is alive and of the species _Homo sapiens_ ; any living human cell would satisfy that condition. In Aristotle's metaphysics-which is presupposed by talk of substance, accident, and soul as the principle of life-there comes to bear the hylomorphic view, followed consistently by the fathers of the Catholic church (including Boethius) and their successors until 1869, that the _intellectiva anima_ , the rational soul distinguishing humans as such, does not infuse any earlier than day 40 of development.\n\n【2】Aristotle. Historia Animalium, 583b.\n\n【3】The modern Catholic magisterium does not follow Aristotle or any other view on ensoulment. It has abandoned the attempt to ascertain when a soul infuses, declaring that “the matter will not ever be established” ( _non enim de re unquam constabit_ ).\n\n【4】Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Declarato de Abortu Procurato, Vatican City; 1974.\n\n【5】The magisterium instead makes its stand on zygotic personhood. For that it offers the argument that I related, to wit, that “modern genetic science” has delivered “valuable confirmation” that fertilization creates a new person: “it has demonstrated that, from the first instant, the program is fixed as to what this living being will be: a man, this individual man with his characteristic aspects already well determined.”\n\n【6】Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Donum Vitae. Vatican City; 1987.\n\n【7】This argument appeals to the premise that a genome suffices for a person. That premise not only expresses a radical version of genetic determinism, it works an internal contradiction. It contradicts the doctrine that a human person is a union of body and soul. (In mentioning that doctrine, I referred only to human persons.) By dint of contradicting a bedrock doctrine, this argument from genome to person cannot stand.\n\n【8】Does there obtain any other reason to treat every embryo as a person for purposes of the duty not to kill? If we think about in what instances we hold killing wrong, it becomes relevant to observe that an embryo cannot feel pain, and cannot form ends or preferences-not even a preference to live-that anyone else's action could frustrate. Thinking more broadly, we come to realize that we cannot gain anything for an embryo that will never enter a uterus (an “unenabled” embryo), or gain anything for anyone else, by forbidding use of the embryo in experiment.\n\n【9】To say that a view that takes account of gain or suffering as a consequence of human action or inaction is utilitarian betrays a misapprehension of utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is the thesis that right conduct consists in maximizing aggregate utility, a thesis to which my argument nowhere appeals. “All ethical doctrines worth our attention,” observed John Rawls, himself no utilitarian, “take consequences into account in judging rightness. One which did not would simply be irrational, crazy.”\n\n【10】A Theory of Justice. Harvard University Press , Cambridge, Mass 1971 : 30\n\n【11】But Dr Nelson goes on to say that my view neglects potential (or what he calls “potencies”). A claim that predicates obligations to an entity on its potential succumbs to the standard objection that potential to become an entity of valued attributes is not the same as being such an entity. An acorn is not an oak; we, most of us, do not consider it wrong to sacrifice an unfertilized oocyte. A more cogent claim predicated on potential asserts that we ought not thwart the coming into being of any possible person corresponding to a developing organism. My argument from nonenablement directly engages that claim. A consequence of the circumstance that an embryo will never enter a uterus is that there does not correspond to the embryo any possible person.\n\n【12】Dr Madden is correct that an opening premise of the argument from nonenablement is that the decision whether anyone will transfer her embryo into her, or into another, falls within a woman's discretion. He holds to the contrary that as to this decision, “authority rests only in God.” This belief-I do not think that anything important turns on characterizing it as a bias rather than a belief-would seem to entail that any human decision about an in vitro embryo, including that of a woman who becomes pregnant by in vitro fertilization (IVF), is wrongful for usurping divine authority. (Official Catholic teaching condemns IVF, but on the ground that it is nonconjugal and risks eugenics.) In any system of religious belief, it may be held that some decisions (eg, at the Last Judgment) belong to God. But in everyday human life, it is impossible for humans to avoid decision, if only by inaction. Hence a more compelling version of Dr Madden's view would assert that divine will is the ultimate arbiter of morality, that humans ought to act in accordance with God's wishes, and that humans are obligated to ascertain those wishes. In such case one would have to ask, “What does God wish?” Who can claim to know the answer? We can only reason as best we can. The Catholic magisterium has condemned IVF and therefore does not regard intrauterine embryo transfer as God's wish.\n\n【13】Assuming then the existence-even if one disapproves of their creation-of embryos that will never enter a uterus, I do not know of a plausible argument that an all-loving and all-merciful God would prefer that such embryos perish in vain rather than be used by us in aid of our neighbors.\n\n【14】To Dr Madeira I would say that life begins before conception-gametes, neurons, all extant cells are alive, and further they are all beings of the species _Homo sapiens_ \\-which is why “human life” and “human being” are not morally significant classifications. The crucial classification is “person.” As noted, we cannot achieve anything for anyone by treating an unenabled embryo as a person, nor does any possible person correspond to it. My argument does not rest the justification of embryo use solely on imminent death.

An acorn is not an oak; we, most of us, do not consider it wrong to sacrifice an unfertilized oocyte. A more cogent claim predicated on potential asserts that we ought not thwart the coming into being of any possible person corresponding to a developing organism. My argument from nonenablement directly engages that claim. A consequence of the circumstance that an embryo will never enter a uterus is that there does not correspond to the embryo any possible person.\n\n【12】Dr Madden is correct that an opening premise of the argument from nonenablement is that the decision whether anyone will transfer her embryo into her, or into another, falls within a woman's discretion. He holds to the contrary that as to this decision, “authority rests only in God.” This belief-I do not think that anything important turns on characterizing it as a bias rather than a belief-would seem to entail that any human decision about an in vitro embryo, including that of a woman who becomes pregnant by in vitro fertilization (IVF), is wrongful for usurping divine authority. (Official Catholic teaching condemns IVF, but on the ground that it is nonconjugal and risks eugenics.) In any system of religious belief, it may be held that some decisions (eg, at the Last Judgment) belong to God. But in everyday human life, it is impossible for humans to avoid decision, if only by inaction. Hence a more compelling version of Dr Madden's view would assert that divine will is the ultimate arbiter of morality, that humans ought to act in accordance with God's wishes, and that humans are obligated to ascertain those wishes. In such case one would have to ask, “What does God wish?” Who can claim to know the answer? We can only reason as best we can.

Protonix\n2.  Protonix IV\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Pantoprazole injection is used to treat certain conditions in which there is too much acid in the stomach. It is used for short-term treatment (7 to 10 days) of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a history of erosive esophagitis. GERD is a condition in which the acid in the stomach washes back up into the esophagus. This medicine may also be used to treat Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or other conditions (eg, cancer) in which the stomach produces too much acid.\n\n【4】Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.\n\n【5】This medicine is given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.\n\n【6】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【7】*   Powder for Solution\n\n【8】Before Using\n------------\n\n【9】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【10】### Allergies\n\n【11】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

Daily MELD score during the first 7 days of ICU admission were retrospectively abstracted. The performances of MELD-D1 to MELD-D7 and changes in MELD score on consecutive days (Δ-MELD) in predicting 90-day mortality were determined using logistic regression.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】MELD-D1 was an independent predictor of mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.10; _P_ <.001), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.72.

This screening consisted of an initial screening decision tree and subsequent construction of a Markov model. One-way sensitivity analysis on various disease and cost parameters to evaluate cost-effectiveness at both $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and $100,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We found that for universal screening at age 65, the novel AI-ECG algorithm would cost $43,351 per QALY gained, test performance, disease characteristics, and testing cost parameters significantly affect cost-effectiveness, and screening at ages 55 and 75 would cost $48,649 and $52,072 per QALY gained, respectively. Overall, under most of the clinical scenarios modeled, coupled with its robust test performance in both testing and validation cohorts, screening with the novel AI-ECG algorithm appears to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Universal screening for ALVD with the novel AI-ECG appears to be cost-effective under most clinical scenarios with a cost of <$50,000 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness is particularly sensitive to both the probability of disease progression and the cost of screening and downstream testing. To improve cost-effectiveness modeling, further study of the natural progression and treatment of ALVD and external validation of AI-ECG should be undertaken.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AI-ECG ( artificial intelligence electrocardiogram algorithm ), ALVD ( asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction ), ICER ( incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ), LVEF ( left ventricular ejection fraction ), PSA ( probabilistic sensitivity analysis ), QALY ( quality-adjusted life-year ), QOL ( quality of life ), TTE ( transthoracic echocardiogram )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:28:41", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:28:45", "cost": 4.269}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:37", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:28:45", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:28:41"}

Since March 2020, the American Medical Association (AMA) has surveyed clinicians and other health care workers as part of the COVID Caring for Caregivers initiative. In a cohort of 20,947 health care workers, those who moderately or greatly endorsed “I feel valued by my organization” had 40% lower odds of burnout ( _P_ <.001).\n\n【10】Prevalence and correlates of stress and burnout among U.S. healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national cross-sectional survey study.\n\n【11】In a cohort of 2373 physicians, those who answered the same question similarly had significantly lower summary stress scores ( _P_ <.001).

While these sessions were semistructured and responded to the needs raised with each group, several questions and approaches emerged that led to more engaging conversations with participants. Informed by these experiences, and review of the AMA COVID Caring for Caregivers data, we developed four questions health care leaders at all levels can ask to show value and appreciation to their clinicians: How has the pandemic impacted your life? What does value and appreciation look and feel like at work? What gets in the way of doing a job you’d feel proud of? What do you need to move forward? The Table details potential examples one might expect to hear in response to these questions.\n\n【14】Table Four Key Questions Leaders Can Ask to Support Clinicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic Recovery Phase\n\n| Question | Example responses |\n| --- | --- |\n| What are the ways your life has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic? | Loss of all kinds (family, friends, patients, human connection)LonelinessLimited emotional reserve, exhaustionAltered routinesChange in work roles/responsibilitiesLack of work-life balanceSense of languishingExtreme workloadsMoral dilemmas of careUncertainty and worry — professional, health, personal, financial, family |\n| What does value and appreciation at work feel like for you? | Transparent communicationCommunicating early and often (don’t wait until its perfect)Including their experience into future planningFlexibility (telehealth, remote work, schedule, redeployment environment)Eliminating unnecessary burden (documentation, password updates, and mandatory quality and safety trainings) |\n| What prevents you from doing a job that you are proud of? | People cannot continue to do all they were doing before plus more, so things need to be removed from their plate, resources need to be built in, or expectations need to changeLeaders need to show more flexibility and grace in expectations and acknowledge that this time is not normalNeed to adjust our expectations for ourselves — my patients still need me, but I also may have kids screaming in the background |\n| What can be done to move forward and help you do a job you are proud of? | Rather than ask someone how they are doing, ask “how can I help make your day better?”Meet one-on-one with clinicians to identify what they have lost academically or monetarily and help create an action plan to get that back on track (and check back in regularly!)Create financial relief programs for those affected by unforeseen costs or who have suffered funding lossesRespect work and home boundariesEncourage self-careEncourage time offAdjust clinical volume expectations and job descriptions to reflect post–COVID-19 workloadCreate opportunities for grieving and sharing loss |\n\n【16】We learned that simply asking clinicians “how are you” or “how can we help” did not generate much input or provide direction — the mental and emotional lift of coming up with ideas proved to be an unwanted additional burden, particularly when loss and grief seemed to cloud creative problem solving. In contrast, using this semistructured approach framed with the four questions can help leaders connect with their workforce and walk clinicians through a process where they can articulate loss and impact of their experiences, identify what value feels like, what doing a job they feel proud of looks like, and what is getting in the way of that vision. The final step takes this new perspective and creates a space to provide recommendations for how leadership can respond.\n\n【17】What Are the Ways Your Life Has Been Impacted by the Covid-19 Pandemic?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Acknowledging the many losses people have experienced is a first step in helping them feel seen and heard by leaders. Some losses may have gone unrecognized in the chaotic experiences of the workplace during crisis. In fact, until this conversation, many may not have realized what they were feeling was loss or grief. Naming those losses begins the process of grieving and can promote post-traumatic growth through development of one’s narrative.\n\n【19】Radiologist Well-Being and Professional Fulfillment in the COVID-19 Era: Fostering Posttraumatic Growth.\n\n【20】It also provides an opportunity for leaders to understand the areas of greatest need for resource development and support.\n\n【21】What Does Value and Appreciation at Work Feel Like for You?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Hearing directly from people what value and appreciation feels like will give leaders a clearer understanding of their needs and help to ensure values alignment. Guided by their responses, a mutually agreed upon vision for future success can be crafted and referenced back to in the future.\n\n【23】What Prevents You From Doing A Job That You Are Proud Of?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Is it enough to “just try to survive”? Or, even in crisis, should leaders look for ways to help the workforce thrive? Providing space to focus on what an individual clinician needs to do a job they can feel proud of sends a message of being valued by leadership. It also creates a space to promote self-compassion rather than self-condemnation during a time when the workforce is overwhelmed, both at work and at home.\n\n【25】What Can Be Done to Move Forward and Help You Do a Job You Are Proud Of?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】This is the opportunity question. Now that they have named their losses, the barriers to doing work that makes them feel proud, and how being valued at work looks, clinicians can ask leaders for what they need. Consider a follow-up question of “what can we take off of your plate?” The AMA has developed a “de-implementation checklist” as a resource to remove unnecessary burdens and improve clinician well-being through subtraction, rather than addition.\n\n【27】AMA Steps Forward De-Implementation Checklist. American Medical Association; :2.\n\n【28】How leaders respond shows their investment.\n\n【29】The requests to leadership that result from these conversations do not need to be realistic or well thought out. Rather, this is a brainstorming place where even the grandest idea that seems impossible may have something that can be drawn from to show value and appreciation. This is helpful to keep in mind as many health care organizations are operating in a resource-constrained environment due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this reality can be acknowledged during these conversations to identify areas that may be “off limits” (ie, changes in salary, benefits, space, staffing, etc), to create a generative space, participants should be encouraged to not be hindered by financial constraints when sharing ideas, nor should leaders promise to be able to fulfill all the wishes shared.\n\n【30】We recommend providing a range of opportunities for clinicians to engage with these questions and respond, including open listening sessions with skilled facilitators, one-on-one meetings with clinicians, hallway conversations during leadership walk rounds, or in qualitative surveys. Meeting clinicians where they are, such as typical practice meetings, rounds, or conferences can be particularly useful, so as not to ask “one more thing” of them or their time. Consider providing the questions in advance so people have time to consider their responses or consult with their colleagues.\n\n【31】Following these discussions, it is important for leaders to share what they heard with those they listened to and those who are part of the leadership teams. These conversations should open an ongoing dialogue, not a one-time offering. Small working groups can be formed to engage those who are passionate and have ideas, which can serve to reinforce value and appreciation in these clinicians.

Cysts are noncancerous round sacs containing fluid. The cysts vary in size, and they can grow very large. Having many cysts or large cysts can damage your kidneys.\n\n【2】Polycystic kidney disease can also cause cysts to develop in your liver and elsewhere in your body. The disease can cause serious complications, including high blood pressure and kidney failure.\n\n【3】PKD varies greatly in its severity, and some complications are preventable. Lifestyle changes and treatments might help reduce damage to your kidneys from complications.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Polycystic kidney disease symptoms can include:\n\n【6】*   High blood pressure\n*   Back or side pain\n*   Blood in your urine\n*   A feeling of fullness in your abdomen\n*   Increased size of your abdomen due to enlarged kidneys\n*   Headaches\n*   Kidney stones\n*   Kidney failure\n*   Urinary tract or kidney infections\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】It's not uncommon for people to have polycystic kidney disease for years without knowing it.\n\n【9】If you develop some of the signs and symptoms of polycystic kidney disease, see your doctor. If you have a first-degree relative — parent, sibling or child — with polycystic kidney disease, see your doctor to discuss screening for this disorder.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Abnormal genes cause polycystic kidney disease, which means that in most cases, the disease runs in families. Sometimes, a genetic mutation occurs on its own (spontaneous), so that neither parent has a copy of the mutated gene.\n\n【12】The two main types of polycystic kidney disease, caused by different genetic flaws, are:\n\n【13】*   **Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).** Signs and symptoms of ADPKD often develop between the ages of 30 and 40. In the past, this type was called adult polycystic kidney disease, but children can develop the disorder.\n\n【14】    Only one parent needs to have the disease for it to pass to the children. If one parent has ADPKD, each child has a 50% chance of getting the disease. This form accounts for most of the cases of polycystic kidney disease.\n\n【15】*   **Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD).** This type is far less common than is ADPKD. The signs and symptoms often appear shortly after birth. Sometimes, symptoms don't appear until later in childhood or during adolescence.\n\n【16】    Both parents must have abnormal genes to pass on this form of the disease. If both parents carry a gene for this disorder, each child has a 25% chance of getting the disease.\n\n【17】Complications\n-------------\n\n【18】Complications associated with polycystic kidney disease include:\n\n【19】*   **High blood pressure.** Elevated blood pressure is a common complication of polycystic kidney disease. Untreated, high blood pressure can cause further damage to your kidneys and increase your risk of heart disease and strokes.\n*   **Loss of kidney function.** Progressive loss of kidney function is one of the most serious complications of polycystic kidney disease. Nearly half of those with the disease have kidney failure by age 60.\n\n【20】    PKD can interfere with the ability of your kidneys to keep wastes from building to toxic levels, a condition called uremia. As the disease worsens, end-stage kidney (renal) disease may result, necessitating ongoing kidney dialysis or a transplant to prolong your life.\n\n【21】*   **Chronic pain.** Pain is a common symptom for people with polycystic kidney disease. It often occurs in your side or back. The pain can also be associated with a urinary tract infection, a kidney stone or a malignancy.\n*   **Growth of cysts in the liver.** The likelihood of developing liver cysts for someone with polycystic kidney disease increases with age. While both men and women develop cysts, women often develop larger cysts. Female hormones and multiple pregnancies might contribute to liver cyst development.\n*   **Development of an aneurysm in the brain.** A balloon-like bulge in a blood vessel (aneurysm) in your brain can cause bleeding (hemorrhage) if it ruptures. People with polycystic kidney disease have a higher risk of aneurysms. People with a family history of aneurysms seem to be at highest risk. Ask your doctor if screening is needed in your case. If screening reveals that you don't have an aneurysm, your doctor may recommend repeating the screening exam in a few years or after several years as a follow-up. The timing of repeat screening depends on your risk.\n*   **Pregnancy complications.** Pregnancy is successful for most women with polycystic kidney disease. In some cases, however, women may develop a life-threatening disorder called preeclampsia. Those most at risk have high blood pressure or a decline in kidney function before they become pregnant.\n*   **Heart valve abnormalities.** As many as 1 in 4 adults with polycystic kidney disease develops mitral valve prolapse. When this happens, the heart valve no longer closes properly, which allows blood to leak backward.\n*   **Colon problems.** Weaknesses and pouches or sacs in the wall of the colon (diverticulosis) may develop in people with polycystic kidney disease.\n\n【22】Prevention\n----------\n\n【23】If you have polycystic kidney disease and you're considering having children, a genetic counselor can help you assess your risk of passing the disease to your offspring.\n\n【24】Keeping your kidneys as healthy as possible may help prevent some of the complications of this disease. One of the most important ways you can protect your kidneys is by managing your blood pressure.\n\n【25】Here are some tips for keeping your blood pressure in check:\n\n【26】*   Take the blood pressure medications prescribed by your doctor as directed.\n*   Eat a low-salt diet containing plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\n*   Maintain a healthy weight. Ask your doctor what the right weight is for you.\n*   If you smoke, quit.\n*   Exercise regularly. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week.\n*   Limit alcohol use.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:03:41", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:03:48", "cost": 6.965}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:37", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:03:48", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:03:41"}

Nuclear imaging involves using small amounts of radioactive substances (radiotracers), a special camera that can detect the radioactivity and a computer to see structures such as bones inside the body.\n\n【2】The tracer is absorbed more by cells and tissues that are changing. As a result, a bone scan can be used to find the source of unexplained skeletal pain, a bone infection or a bone injury that can't be seen on a standard X-ray.\n\n【3】A bone scan can also be an important tool for detecting cancer that has spread (metastasized) to the bone from the tumor's original location, such as the breast or prostate.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】A bone scan might help determine the cause of unexplained bone pain. The test is sensitive to differences in bone metabolism, which are highlighted in the body by the radioactive tracer. Scanning the whole skeleton helps in diagnosing a wide range of bone disorders, including:\n\n【6】*   Fractures\n*   Arthritis\n*   Paget's disease of bone\n*   Cancer originating in bone\n*   Cancer that has metastasized to bone from a different site\n*   Infection of the joints, joint replacements or bones\n\n【7】Risks\n-----\n\n【8】Although the test relies on radioactive tracers to produce the images, these tracers produce little radiation exposure — less than a CT scan.\n\n【9】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【10】You typically don't need to restrict your diet or restrict activities before a bone scan. Let your health care provider know if you've taken a medicine containing bismuth, such as Pepto-Bismol, or if you've had an X-ray test using barium contrast material within the past four days. Barium and bismuth can interfere with bone scan results.\n\n【11】Wear loose clothing and leave jewelry at home. You might be asked to wear a gown for the scan.\n\n【12】Bone scans aren't usually performed on pregnant women or nursing mothers because of concerns about radiation exposure to the baby. Tell your health care provider if you're pregnant — or think you might be pregnant — or if you're nursing.\n\n【13】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【14】A bone scan procedure includes both an injection and the actual scan.\n\n【15】### The injection\n\n【16】Tiny amounts of radioactive materials (tracers) are injected into a vein in the hand or arm. The amount of time between the injection and scan varies, depending on the reason for the scan.\n\n【17】Some images might be taken immediately after the injection. But the main images are taken 2 to 4 hours later to allow the tracer to circulate and be absorbed by your bones. You might be asked to drink several glasses of water while you wait.\n\n【18】You'll likely be asked to empty your bladder before the scan to remove the unabsorbed tracer from your body.\n\n【19】### The scan\n\n【20】You'll lie still on a table while an armlike device supporting a tracer-sensitive camera passes back and forth over your body. The scan itself can take up to an hour. The procedure is painless.\n\n【21】Your health care provider might order a three-phase bone scan, which includes a series of images taken at different times. A number of images are taken as the tracer is injected, then shortly after the injection, and again 3 to 5 hours after the injection.\n\n【22】To better see some bones in your body, your doctor might order additional imaging called single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). This imaging can help with conditions that are especially deep in your bone or in places that are difficult to see. During a SPECT scan, the camera takes images as it rotates around your body.\n\n【23】### After the test\n\n【24】A bone scan generally has no side effects, and no follow-up care is needed. You might be asked to drink a lot of water for the next day or two to flush the tracer from your system. The radioactivity from the tracers is usually completely eliminated two days after the scan.\n\n【25】Results\n-------\n\n【26】A specialist in reading images (radiologist) looks for evidence of unusual bone metabolism on the scans. These areas appear as darker \"hot spots\" and lighter \"cold spots\" where the tracers have or haven't accumulated.\n\n【27】Although a bone scan is sensitive to differences in bone metabolism, it's less helpful in determining the cause of the differences. If you have a bone scan that shows hot spots, you might need more tests to determine the cause.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:59:20", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:59:34", "cost": 13.981}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:37", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:59:33", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:59:19"}

The cancer forms growths of cells, called lesions, on the skin. The lesions often form on the face, arms and legs. The lesions may look pink, red, purple or brown.\n\n【2】Lesions also can appear on the genitals or in the mouth. In severe Kaposi sarcoma, lesions can be in the digestive tract and lungs.\n\n【3】The cause of Kaposi sarcoma is infection with the virus human herpes virus 8, also called HHV-8. In healthy people, this infection usually causes no symptoms because the immune system keeps it under control. In someone with a weakened immune system, however, HHV-8 can lead to Kaposi sarcoma.\n\n【4】There are four types of Kaposi sarcoma:\n\n【5】*   **AIDS\\-related or epidemic Kaposi sarcoma.** This type happens in people infected with human immunodeficiency virus, also called HIV. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.\n*   **Transplant-associated or iatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma.** This type happens in people who take medicine to control the immune system after an organ transplant.\n*   **Classic Kaposi sarcoma.** This type occurs in older men of Eastern European, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent. It usually grows slowly and can cause swelling in areas such as the legs.\n*   **Endemic Kaposi sarcoma.** This type affects young people in Africa. It can grow slowly on the skin or quickly inside the body.\n\n【6】### Diagnosis\n\n【7】#### Taking a piece of skin for testing\n\n【8】A health care professional may recommend removing a small piece of a skin lesion for testing. This procedure is called a skin biopsy. The sample is sent to a lab for testing. Lab tests can look for signs of cancer.\n\n【9】A skin biopsy can confirm Kaposi sarcoma.\n\n【10】#### Testing for Kaposi sarcoma inside the body\n\n【11】Other tests might be needed to look for Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs or the digestive tract.\n\n【12】Test to find Kaposi sarcoma in the digestive tract might include:\n\n【13】*   **Fecal occult blood test.** This test detects hidden blood in stool. If it shows hidden blood, other tests might be needed to find the source. Other tests include an endoscopy or colonoscopy. These tests are used to see if Kaposi sarcoma is causing the bleeding.\n*   **Endoscopy.** In this test, a thin tube, called an endoscope, is passed through the mouth. It allows a health care professional to look at the esophagus, stomach and first part of the small intestine.\n*   **Colonoscopy.** In this test, a thin tube called a colonoscope goes through the rectum and into the colon. It allows a health professional to look at the walls of these organs.\n\n【14】Tests to find Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs might include:\n\n【15】*   **Chest X-ray.** A chest X-ray might show something unusual in the lungs. If so, a CT scan of the chest or a bronchoscopy might be used to see to see if the unusual finding is Kaposi sarcoma.\n*   **CT scan.** This imaging test uses X-rays to make detailed images of the lungs.\n*   **Bronchoscopy.** In this test, a thin tube called a bronchoscope passes through the nose or mouth into the lungs. This allows for viewing the lining of the lungs and taking samples of lung tissue.\n\n【16】### Treatment\n\n【17】There's no cure for Kaposi sarcoma. But there are many treatment options that can help control it. Some people may not need treatment right away. Instead, the condition might be monitored to make sure it's not getting worse. Treatment depends on:\n\n【18】*   The type of Kaposi sarcoma.\n*   Number of lesions and where they are.\n*   Effects of the lesions, such as causing pain or getting in the way of eating or breathing.\n*   Your overall health.\n\n【19】#### Treatment for AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma\n\n【20】Thanks to better antiviral medicines to treat AIDS and ways to prevent it, Kaposi sarcoma has become less common and less severe in people with AIDS. Taking antiviral medicines can lower the amount of the virus that causes HIV/AIDS and make the immune system stronger. This might be the only treatment needed for Kaposi sarcoma.\n\n【21】#### Treatment for transplant-related Kaposi sarcoma\n\n【22】Some people with transplant-related Kaposi sarcoma may be able to stop taking the medicines that are controlling the immune system or switch to another medicine.\n\n【23】#### Treatment for small skin lesions\n\n【24】These might include:\n\n【25】*   Minor surgery, also called excision.\n*   Burning, called electrodessication, or freezing, called cryotherapy.\n*   Low-dose radiation, which is also helpful for lesions in the mouth.\n*   Laser therapy.\n*   An injection of the chemotherapy drug vinblastine into lesions.\n*   Applying a vitamin A-like medicine called a retinoid to the skin.\n\n【26】Lesions treated in any of these ways are likely to return within a couple of years. When this happens, treatment often can be repeated.\n\n【27】#### Treatment if there are many skin lesions\n\n【28】If the Kaposi sarcoma causes many skin lesions, other treatments might be needed, such as:\n\n【29】*   **Radiation therapy.** Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams to kill cancer cells. This is a treatment option if there are many skin lesions, but not enough to need chemotherapy.\n*   **Chemotherapy.** Chemotherapy uses strong medicines to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy might an option when Kaposi sarcoma affects multiple parts of the body. For Kaposi sarcoma that's getting worse quickly, chemotherapy might help.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:48:44", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:51:07", "cost": 142.864}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:37", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:51:05", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:48:42"}

Arguably, and a point made in the cited Walker et al reference,\n\n【3】Gender distribution among American Board of Medical Specialties boards of directors.\n\n【4】a better goal might be “overrepresentation” of women directors so as to be more representative of the near-future workforce and closer to the proportion of women in training. Increasing the proportion of women in leadership roles, especially those positions that determine policy and practice for training and certification, has the potential to influence important structural change while also providing role models for women aspiring to leadership. It remains to be seen if having more women in director roles will lead to an increase in women seeking careers in these more highly compensated specialties or in closing the gender pay and opportunity gaps. Structural change is slow and typically does not occur without intentional goal setting, leadership accountability, and regular review of progress toward measurable goals. We hope that these boards will lead these necessary changes.\n\n【5】As stated in our article,\n\n【6】A structured compensation plan results in equitable physician compensation: a single-center analysis.\n\n【7】even when physician compensation is equitable, inequities in access, opportunity, and power often remain. As a result, we read with interest the results of a gender-focused analysis from the Mayo Clinic Department of Emergency Medicine by Raukar et al.\n\n【8】Departmental and specialty boards: an analysis of equity II.\n\n【9】They explored gender differences in faculty representation, leadership, and academic rank attainment as well as timing and amount of paid (“protected”) time away from clinical practice. Although most measured outcomes were equitable, they found that compared with women physicians, early career men were on average twice as likely to have been awarded protected time. This arguably provided a “head start” to those individuals who had more time during the regular work week to devote to academic pursuits and leadership activities. It is striking that women “caught up” over time, both in receipt of paid time away from practice and in academic rank attainment. This suggests that women overcame these early disadvantages, possibly by more often doing their scholarly activities on unpaid/personal time and subsequently “earning” the time that was subsequently granted. Although the authors do not provide explanations for their findings, contributing factors could include the fact that women in medicine have been found to be less likely to be mentored or advised on departmental and organizational “hidden curricula” and are less likely to negotiate and, when they do, are less successful.\n\n【10】Social incentives for gender differences in the propensity to initiate negotiations: sometimes it does hurt to ask.\n\n【11】Our original analysis revealed that creating and adhering to a compensation plan led to equitable physician pay. An analogous and transparent approach to granting opportunity and other nonmonetary forms of compensation has the potential to also drive gender equity in medicine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:43:50", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:44:29", "cost": 38.959}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:37", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:44:27", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:43:48"}

Using these medicines together with ezetimibe and simvastatin may increase your risk of muscle injury and could result in kidney problems.\n\n【59】Chinese patients who are taking large amounts of niacin (greater than 1 gram or 1000 milligrams per day) together with this medicine may have an increased risk for muscle injury. Talk to your doctor if you are Chinese or have Chinese ancestry and take large amounts of niacin (Niacor®, Niaspan®).\n\n【60】Call your doctor right away if you have unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, especially if you also have unusual tiredness or a fever. These may be symptoms of serious muscle problems, such as myopathy or immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM). Myopathy is more common when high doses of simvastatin (80 milligrams) with ezetimibe (10 mg) are used, but some people get myopathy with lower doses.\n\n【61】Check with your doctor right away if you have dark-colored urine, diarrhea, a fever, muscle cramps or spasms, muscle pain or stiffness, or feel very tired or weak. These could be symptoms of a serious muscle problem called rhabdomyolysis, which can cause kidney problems.\n\n【62】Call your doctor right away if you get a headache, stomach pain, vomiting, dark-colored urine, loss of appetite, weight loss, general feeling of tiredness or weakness, light-colored stools, upper right stomach pain, or yellow eyes or skin.

With age, eyelids stretch, and the muscles supporting them weaken. As a result, excess skin and fat can gather above and below your eyelids. This can cause sagging eyebrows, droopy upper lids and bags under the eyes.\n\n【2】Besides aging, severely sagging skin around the eyes can reduce side vision (peripheral vision), especially the upper and outer parts of the visual field. Blepharoplasty can reduce or get rid of these vision problems. The surgery can also make eyes look younger and more alert.\n\n【3】Learn how blepharoplasty is done and about the benefits and risk of the procedure.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Blepharoplasty might be an option for:\n\n【6】*   Baggy or droopy upper eyelids\n*   Excess skin of the upper eyelids that partially blocks peripheral vision\n*   Excess skin on the lower eyelids\n*   Bags under the eyes\n\n【7】Blepharoplasty can be done at the same time as another procedure, such as a brow lift, face-lift or skin resurfacing.\n\n【8】Insurance coverage might depend on whether the surgery repairs a condition that harms vision. Surgery only to improve appearance probably won't be covered by insurance.\n\n【9】Risks\n-----\n\n【10】All surgery has risks, including reaction to anesthesia and blood clots. Besides those, rare risks of eyelid surgery include:\n\n【11】*   Infection and bleeding\n*   Dry, irritated eyes\n*   Difficulty closing the eyes or other eyelid problems\n*   Noticeable scarring\n*   Injury to eye muscles\n*   Skin discoloration\n*   Temporarily blurred vision or, rarely, loss of eyesight\n*   The need for follow-up surgery\n\n【12】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【13】Before scheduling blepharoplasty, you'll meet with a health care provider. Providers you meet with may include a plastic surgeon, an eye specialist (ophthalmologist), or an ophthalmologist who specializes in plastic surgery around the eyes (oculoplastic surgeon). The discussion includes:\n\n【14】*   **Your medical history.** Your care provider will ask about previous surgeries. Your provider may also ask about past or current conditions such as dry eyes, glaucoma, allergies, circulatory problems, thyroid problems and diabetes. Your provider will also ask about your use of drugs, vitamins, herbal supplements, alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs.\n*   **Your goals.** A discussion of what you want from the surgery will help set the stage for a good outcome. Your care provider will discuss with you whether the procedure is likely to work well for you.\n\n【15】Before your eyelid surgery, you'll likely have a physical exam and the following:\n\n【16】*   **Complete eye exam.** This might include testing tear production and measuring parts of the eyelids.\n*   **Visual field testing.** This is to see if there are blind spots in the corners of the eyes (peripheral vision). This is needed to support an insurance claim.\n*   **Eyelid photography.** Photos from different angles help with planning the surgery, and documenting whether there's a medical reason for it, which might support an insurance claim.\n\n【17】And your provider will likely ask you to do the following:\n\n【18】*   Stop taking warfarin (Jantoven), aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve, others), naproxen (Naprosyn), and other drugs or herbal supplements that can increase bleeding. Ask your health care provider how long before surgery to stop taking these drugs. Take only drugs approved by your surgeon.\n*   Quit smoking several weeks before surgery. Smoking can reduce the ability to heal after surgery.\n*   Arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery if you are having outpatient surgery. Plan to have someone stay with you for the first night after returning home from surgery.\n\n【19】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【20】### Before the procedure\n\n【21】Blepharoplasty is usually done in an outpatient setting. You might be given drugs such as injections into the eyelids to numb them and drugs through an IV to help you relax.\n\n【22】### During the procedure\n\n【23】For upper eyelids, the surgeon cuts along the fold of the eyelid. The surgeon removes some excess skin, muscle and possibly fat. Then the surgeon closes the cut.\n\n【24】On the lower lid, the surgeon makes a cut just below the lashes in your eye's natural crease or inside the lower lid. The surgeon removes or redistributes excess fat, muscle and sagging skin. Then the surgeon closes the cut.\n\n【25】If your upper eyelid droops close to your pupil, your surgeon may do blepharoplasty combined with a procedure called ptosis (TOE-sis). Ptosis is designed to lift the eyelid as well as remove excess eyelid skin.\n\n【26】### After the procedure\n\n【27】After surgery you spend time in a recovery room where staff members monitor you for complications. You can leave later that day to heal at home.\n\n【28】After surgery you might temporarily have:\n\n【29】*   Blurred vision from the lubricating ointment applied to your eyes\n*   Watering eyes\n*   Light sensitivity\n*   Double vision\n*   Puffy, numb eyelids\n*   Swelling and bruising similar to having black eyes\n*   Pain or discomfort\n\n【30】Take the following steps to help you recover from surgery unless your surgeon gives you different instructions.\n\n【31】#### Do:\n\n【32】*   Use ice packs on your eyes for 10 minutes every hour the night after surgery. The following day, use ice packs on your eyes 4 to 5 times throughout the day.\n*   Use prescribed eye drops or ointments.\n*   Sleep with your head raised higher than your chest for a few days.\n*   Apply cool compresses to reduce swelling.\n*   Wear dark sunglasses to protect the skin of your eyelids from sun and wind.\n*   If needed, use acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) to control pain.\n\n【33】#### Don't:\n\n【34】*   Do anything strenuous for a week — no heavy lifting, swimming, jogging or aerobics.\n*   Smoke.\n*   Rub your eyes.\n*   Wear contact lenses for about two weeks.\n*   Take aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve, others), naproxen (Naprosyn), and other drugs or herbal supplements that can increase bleeding.\n\n【35】As instructed, return to the care provider's office to have stitches removed, if needed.\n\n【36】Seek medical attention immediately if you have any of the following symptoms:\n\n【37】*   Shortness of breath\n*   Chest pain\n*   An unusual heart rate\n*   Severe new eye pain\n*   Bleeding\n*   Vision problems\n\n【38】Results\n-------\n\n【39】Many people who have blepharoplasty say they feel more self-confident and feel they look younger and more rested. For some people, surgery results may last a lifetime. For others, droopy eyelids can recur.\n\n【40】Bruising and swelling generally lessen slowly in about 10 to 14 days. Scars from the surgical cuts may take months to fade.

The philosopher Richard Hare once said, “I like to give arguments for my position. They come in handy when people don't agree with me.” Consider then the inclination of many among us—perhaps by virtue of being busy, or for other reasons—to pronounce a verdict, when a moral controversy comes along, by consulting aphorisms or slogans. By following this inclination, earnest people may unwittingly betray the moral views that they aspire to uphold. For they may fail to take account of the depth and subtlety of their respective moral views.\n\n【1】I should like to discuss arguments offered in support of using human embryos in research and therapy. I plan to survey both arguments that work and arguments that do not. I shall first review six arguments that I place in the latter category. Each of these purports to justify research that I happen to support. But inasmuch as a good case is not made better by overstatement, and no case is made by an unsound argument, I am going to disavow those six arguments. I urge other supporters of donated embryo use to disavow them as well, because, as Bernard Williams once said, openness to criticism is the homage that candor pays to truth. To support my own view, I shall go on to sketch arguments that, so I shall suggest, are sound. I shall then say a bit more about cloning in particular, and shall close by remarking on the risk of abuses.\n\n【2】ARGUMENTS THAT DO NOT WORK\n--------------------------\n\n【3】### Imminent Death as Justification for Killing\n\n【4】Consider the argument that the imminent death of an embryo—for instance, a surplus embryo in a fertility clinic—justifies its consumption in research. A more extreme proposal, recently offered by Frederick Grinnell, would have us define a concept of embryo death according to which embryos not destined for intrauterine transfer are dead. This concept of death seems to defy common sense. The embryos that I contemplate as research subjects are alive. About this concept of death I doubt that it is necessary to say anything more.\n\n【5】Let us consider the plain argument that imminent death of an admittedly living embryo justifies killing it in research. In refutation of that argument, consider the following Wild West example. One day the notorious varmint Hatfield is riding about on his horse. Feeling tired, Hatfield elects to dismount beside the railroad tracks. He sits down, and eventually dozes off, stretching out across the tracks. Sometime later, as Hatfield lies sound asleep astride the tracks, a train approaches at high speed. Whereupon there happens to ride onto the scene Hatfield's archenemy, McCoy. Spotting Hatfield, McCoy gallops to the tracks, dismounts, and—just in the nick of time before the train arrives—yanks Hatfield from the tracks. McCoy then immediately pulls out his rifle, trains it on Hatfield, and kills Hatfield. In this case, even though Hatfield would have died under the wheels of the train a split second earlier, we hold McCoy guilty of wrongful killing. In general, the imminent death of a victim does not justify its killing. Embryo research will not be justifiable solely on the ground of imminent embryo death.\n\n【6】### Nonindividuation Objection to Zygotic Personhood\n\n【7】The nonindividuation objection to zygotic personhood runs as follows. Prior to formation of an embryo's primitive streak at day 14 of development, it can happen that the embryo splits into monozygotic twins. And if twinning occurs, the twins can fuse. Hence it has been suggested that in respect of any embryo, one cannot say until day 14 whether there exists one individual or more. If one cannot say how many persons exist, it is untenable to say that any person exists. Another version of the nonindividuation objection begins from the premise that in twinning, an embryo vanishes and leaves no earthly remains. How could an individual person die leaving no earthly remains? If no corpse ever exists, there could not earlier have existed a person.\n\n【8】Thus does the nonindividuation objection characterize zygotic personhood as metaphysically impossible. The objection's biological sophistication has led many scientists to regard it as a clinching argument for embryo use. Despite that sophistication, the nonindividuation objection is susceptible to the following refutation owed to David Oderberg.\n\n【9】Modal properties, moral status, and identity.\n\n【10】Suppose at time _t_ <sub>0 </sub> a somatic cell _x_ . By _t_ <sub>1 </sub> , _x_ has divided, and there exist _x_ ’s daughter cells _d_ <sub>1 </sub> and _d_ <sub>2 </sub> . The process by which this has occurred, namely, mitosis, is routine. Notice that as we look back at the history of _x_ up to _t_ <sub>1 </sub> , we do not have any doubt that _x_ was an individual cell. Plainly _x_ had the capability of dividing, and in fact, _x_ did divide, but it is not incoherent to say, and we unhesitatingly do say, that for so long as _x_ existed, _x_ was an individual. As for the apparent puzzle of dying without leaving earthly remains, again a reflection on mitosis sheds light. Necrosis is not the only means by which a life form may cease to exist. Dividing is another means. And it happens that after division, there is no corpse. So it is not metaphysically incoherent to say that an embryo capable of dividing is an individual. Or that an embryo that does divide was an individual before it divided.\n\n【11】To rehabilitate the nonindividuation objection, a proponent might contend that indivisibility is somehow intrinsic to the individuality of a person as it may not be to the individuality of a cell, so that a being that is divisible cannot be or correspond to a person. To buttress this claim, the proponent might offer the example that an adult individual cannot divide into surviving individuals. Or the proponent might contend that even if adult individual _x_ could be split into surviving individuals—say, by a brain split and transplant operation in which, as imagined by philosophers of mind, _x_ ’s brain is split and each half is transferred into a new body so that each successor retains memories and otherwise achieves psychological continuity with _x_ —it would not be the case that _x_ is the same individual as either of its successors. One reply to this, owed to the whimsy of Peter King, is that it is possible to survive with only half a brain, though in such case one is restricted to a career in politics. But we may leave aside what adults can do.\n\n【12】We may reply to the proponent of the nonindividuation objection with two thoughts. First, what is feasible for an adult ought not constrain our thinking, because we know of the remarkable ability of an early embryo to split into surviving individuals. Second, the individuality of a being does not depend on its being the same individual, if it happens to split, as any of its successors. When an embryo has split, we may simply say that it was one individual until it split, that the individual ceased to exist when it split, and that two individuals have succeeded it. Thus may we render not only the possibility but the actuality of twinning consistent with individuality of the original embryo and with individuality of its twin successors. Given that the case of an embryo that does split resolves in this way, no impediment arises to individuality of an embryo that has not split.\n\n【13】According to this analysis, the nonindividuation objection fails to establish that an embryo cannot be a person. When monozygotic twinning occurs, it may be said that two persons succeed one person that ceases. But even if we defeat the contention that an embryo cannot be a person, there remains the question whether, for purposes of the duty not to kill, we should treat every embryo as a person. That a being “is a person” is not an empirical observation or an _a priori_ truth. Calling a being a person is a shorthand reply to the moral question, “How should we treat it for this purpose?” The shorthand signifies our conclusion that we should classify the being among those to whom we think all of us should accord a particular treatment. Whereupon we may fairly be asked what argument supports that conclusion. Failure of the nonindividuation objection leaves the door open to introduce, or oppose, arguments that we are obliged to treat all embryos as persons for purposes of the duty not to kill.\n\n【14】### The Utilitarian Defense of Embryo Use\n\n【15】Utilitarianism commands us to maximize aggregate preference satisfaction for the universe of affected sentient beings. A familiar argument is that if, in regenerative medicine, we sacrifice a relatively small number of embryos in order to help millions, perhaps billions, of suffering people, we can achieve higher aggregate preference satisfaction than we would achieve were we to classify every embryo as a person for purposes of the duty not to kill.\n\n【16】John Stuart Mill, who with Bentham brought utilitarianism to prominence, learned calculus at the age of five, but Mill did not envision the mathematical defect of his moral theory. The infirmity came to light through the work of economists in the twentieth century. Consider that the number of affected sentient beings in respect of many policy issues, embryo use among them, is enormous. Collecting utility data from so many people would be a monumental task. A more fundamental failing is that there obtains no method of measuring utility. Utilitarianism presupposes a utility function for each member of the set of affected beings. A utility function is nowadays understood as a real-valued order homomorphism representing a transitive and connected binary relation defined by an individual on a set of alternatives. This understanding no doubt explains why many scientists have felt comfortable with utilitarianism and with a utilitarian defense of embryo research. Utilitarianism seems empirical, quantitative, precise. For physician scientists, utilitarianism evokes some of the thinking to which outcome studies, comparing benefits and costs, have accustomed them.\n\n【17】But if, for two or more individuals, a utilitarian seeks to sum the utilities of a given alternative, there obtains no common unit of measure. Indeed there does not exist a standard measure even for a single person. While it is easy to define, as a representation of an individual's positioning of alternatives, a real-valued order homomorphism, any of infinitely many other functions formed by affine transformations from that order homomorphism will also represent the positioning.\n\n【18】Though the problem of interpersonal incommensurability of utilities remains unsolved, on many occasions a utilitarian's audience either will be unaware of the problem, or willing to overlook it. For example, if a hospital were to propose construction of a new facility, and if that project would require demolition of the homes of 100 people, displacing those residents in exchange for reimbursement of their homes’ fair market value and their moving expenses, a utilitarian might argue that future gains in utility produced by the project for perhaps hundreds of thousands of patients in future decades will exceed the disutility of the 100 who must presently relocate. Listeners will follow an argument such as this without worrying much about whether the utility calculation has been performed. For it may seem in such a case that for any plausible conversion ratio of units of measure, the comparison of utility between alternatives will be lopsided.\n\n【19】On the other hand, if an advocated alternative is the killing of a life form that some people sincerely believe to be a person, not much tolerance will be found for an argument whose proponents cannot produce the calculation on which the argument purportedly rests. The root of the difficulty is the same as in the blinkered attempt to order, on the basis of supposed measures of quality, incommensurable college football teams.\n\n【20】### Appeal to “Fact-based Reasoning” Alone\n\n【21】The next argument, also not infrequently invoked by scientists, proceeds by asserting that public advocacy concerning embryo use should appeal to “fact-based reasoning” alone, and that it therefore follows that objections resting on any other ground must give way to the progress of biomedical science. This argument serves as a euphemism for saying that appeals to religion and various “insular” moral views do not have a place in public debate about science. In reply, we must observe that the view that scientific work grounded in fact-based reasoning should go forward without obstruction by moral views is itself a moral view. When an objection lies on grounds of wrongful killing, it is neither appropriate nor feasible to oust religion or moral views from the conversation. Of course we all agree that we should rest on facts as opposed to errors, but given facts, a normative discussion awaits.\n\n【22】A more sophisticated cousin of the foregoing argument, the call to “public reason” of John Rawls, would have us employ in public discourse only premises that others could not reasonably reject.\n\n【23】Political Liberalism. Columbia University Press , New York, NY 1993\n\n【24】That, in a moment, is what I shall try to do in stating my own view.\n\n【25】### Noncomplicity Defenses\n\n【26】It has been suggested that even if the consumption of embryos in research is wrong, a government could support derivative research by eschewing complicity in the destruction of embryos. As it has been put by proponents of this move, one could distinguish between embryonic stem cell derivation and embryonic stem cell use. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) at one time adopted this view.\n\n【27】65 Fed. Reg. 51976-51981 (2000).\n\n【28】It announced that it would fund projects classified as embryonic stem cell use. The notion seemed to be that this would avoid complicity in wrongful embryo-destructive derivation of stem cells.\n\n【29】In another scheme for purportedly conducting embryo research without complicity in embryo killing, fertility clinicians would perform the immunosurgery by which embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos. This scheme is probably impractical, because fertility clinicians do not do that kind of work. They do not customarily derive cell lines from embryos; they customarily nurture and transfer embryos so as to achieve pregnancies. Even if the scheme were practical, it shares with the derivation-use distinction the problem that when a chain of supply runs from someone who sacrifices an embryo to someone who experiments with the sacrificed embryo's derivatives, we seem compelled to say from a moral point of view that the source and the recipient ride in the same boat. It is untenable to say that the experimenter is not complicit in the work of the supplier.\n\n【30】Another noncomplicity strategy, recently played out in the United States, might be called “government surprise.” It would begin as a government announces that it will not fund research that effects or is consequent on destruction of embryos. Then, after this policy has become widely known, the government suddenly announces—in the United States, we saw this happen on August 9, 2001—that in the future it will disperse public funds for studies using derivatives of embryos already then sacrificed. The most cogent philosophical defense of this gambit that occurs to me might be to say that the government had not, prior to the second announcement, induced any destruction of embryos. One would say this on the hypothesis that theretofore, the government had given everyone to believe that it would not support such research. (The hypothesis may not be true with respect to the recent history of US government policy. Between the first and second announcements came the just mentioned NIH announcement that it would fund research on embryonic derivatives. What I am here calling the first announcement was a prohibition enacted by Congress as a rider to an appropriations bill.\n\n【31】Pub. L. No. 104-99, Title I, §128, 110 Stat. 26, 34 (1996).\n\n【32】) But apart from this historical contingency, the government surprise scheme succumbs to the same objection that lodges against the two other schemes that I have just mentioned. The government surprise scheme would place those who participate in funded embryonic stem cell studies in the same boat with those who participate in nonfunded embryodestructive stem cell derivation.\n\n【33】### Denying That Clones Are Embryos\n\n【34】The last in my roster of arguments that do not work consists in the claim that somatic cell nuclear transfer performed in research is not cloning, and does not produce clones or embryos, this because a suggested new semantic regimen would withhold the term “cloning” from any instance of somatic cell nuclear transfer in research, would instead call the process “nuclear transplantation,” and would withhold “clone” and “embryo” from the products of that process.\n\n【35】For this context, I have elsewhere tried to sort out the relevant entities and events in a manner informed by biological and moral considerations. My analysis leads me to reject the proposed semantic regimen as to both process and products. The proposed terminology risks the appearance of trying to smuggle in a morally significant event— initiation of embryogenesis—by not mentioning it. In trying to withhold “cloning” and “clone” from processes and products of research, a proponent of the proposed terminology would contradict the ordinary and morally significant understanding of cloning as a genetic event, an event completed shortly after oocyte activation, regardless whether transfer to a uterus ensues. The goal that has motivated the proposed terminology, the goal of offering the public a sharp distinction between research and producing children, does not require legerdemain to attain. Rather we may implement a simple distinction, a distinction between “procreative cloning” and “nonprocreative cloning.” The distinction turns on a single observable event, intrauterine transfer.\n\n【36】The set of embryo subjects.\n\n【37】As for “embryo,” any being that is of a kind capable of developing into a neonate upon transfer to a uterus is an object of moral concern. We implicitly acknowledge that concern when we classify every prefetal developing organism as an embryo. (In both scientific writing and popular speech, we have abandoned the textbook definition according to which “embryo” applies only to a conceptus older than two weeks.) Recognition of a being as an embryo does not end our moral investigation. We may conclude—for reasons that I shall shortly present, I believe that we should conclude—that we are not obliged to treat every embryo in the same way. But in respect of a product of somatic cell nuclear transfer, recognizing its inclusion within a discussant's universe of moral concern is the place from which to begin our discussion with one who does not agree with us.\n\n【38】ARGUMENTS THAT WORK\n-------------------\n\n【39】### Argument from Nonenablement\n\n【40】To advance the proposition that embryonic stem cell research is virtuous if not obligatory, I have elsewhere presented an argument that I call “the argument from nonenablement.”\n\n【41】Morals and primordials.\n\n【42】I refer to an embryo that will never enter a uterus as an “unenabled” embryo. In the first instance, I have in mind a situation, which often arises with fertility patients, in which the one person in the world who, together with her partner, is empowered to decide about intrauterine transfer of an embryo formed from her oocyte decides that neither does she wish to have that embryo transferred unto her nor does she wish to give the embryo to anyone else for intrauterine transfer.\n\n【43】There is no moral view of which I know that asserts a duty of intrauterine embryo transfer. That is to say that there is no moral view that asserts that a woman lies under a duty to undergo a transfer unto her of an embryo that lies outside her. About such a procedure, we respect her autonomy. Imagine, therefore, that a woman declines intrauterine transfer, and in fact, forbids it. She, with her partner, donates to medicine either an embryo created during her fertility treatment, or an embryo that will be created by a scientist from their donated cells. Let us assume that this decision is final and that the embryo has left parental control. Such a donation to medicine I call an “epidosembryo.” I take this name from the Greek _epidosis_ for a citizen's great beneficence to the common weal. What Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie Mayo left to Minnesota, and to the world, was an _epidosis_ . So too may we describe a couple's gift to medicine of a life form that, were they to decide otherwise, could become their child.\n\n【44】A distinction obtains between the developmental potential of an embryo that lies in a petri dish and will remain there, and an embryo that lies in a uterus, however it got there. In consequence of parental instructions that an epidosembryo shall be used in research or therapy and shall not be transferred to a uterus, there does not obtain any morally significant chance that from such an embryo, an infant will develop. To put the matter in language that I owe to Hare,\n\n【45】Essays on Bioethics. Clarendon Press , Oxford, England 1993\n\n【46】no possible person corresponds to an epidosembryo. We also know, and this is purely empirical knowledge, that an embryo is not sentient. And that, for lack of a cortex, an embryo cannot form preferences. Nor can an embryo adopt ends. Therefore nothing that we might do to an epidosembryo can cause it discomfort or frustrate it. Under these circumstances, and when we consider the duty of mutual aid asserted within each of the leading moral views of our time, I claim that it is permissible to use some embryos, namely epidosembryos, in medicine.\n\n【47】As the preceding discussion makes clear, I rest the permissibility and virtuousness of epidosembryo use on the autonomous decisions of couples from whose cells such embryos originate. The moral analysis flows entirely from what it is that they decide. If it is permissible for those donations to be made, then it is permissible for recipient scientists to use epidosembryos as instructed.\n\n【48】Suppose that someone interjects that precisely because epidosembryos cannot form preferences, it is our obligation to act according to their advantage. I reply that we cannot promote any advantage of epidosembryos. Were we to refrain from using epidosembryos in research, we could not gain anything for them. Entry into the only environment by which they could attain birth has been forbidden by the only persons in the world empowered to decide on entry into that environment.\n\n【49】I also point out that the argument from nonenablement differs from an appeal to imminent death as a means of justifying a killing. Nonenablement precludes a conceptus from attaining any of the attributes—autonomy, ability to feel pain, preferences, and, according to the traditional Thomist-Aristotelian teaching of Christianity, the attainment of a soul—whose infringement makes killing wrong. Nonenablement entails that there does not even correspond to an epidosembryo a possible person. It is not that death is imminent, but that development is bounded.\n\n【50】### Replies to Objections\n\n【51】Let me now reply to a couple objections. The first objection asserts that the sacrifice of an embryo violates the second form of Kant's categorical imperative, the precept that we should treat “humanity … always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.”\n\n【52】*   Kant\n\n【53】Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals.\n\n【54】in: Gregor MJ The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant, Practical Philosophy. 4\\. Cambridge University Press , Cambridge, England 1996 : 429\n\n【55】(This, not the Declaration of Helsinki, is the origin of the requirement of informed consent.) In this formulation, by “humanity” Kant understands rational nature. For this reason, the objection misapprehends Kant's view, which applies only to rational beings. The second form of the categorical imperative does not apply to mentally incompetent adults, infants, or embryos. That is not to say that Kant would take a cavalier view of the helpless. Kant would analyze our moral obligations toward these nonrational human beings as he would analyze moral questions in general. (“Human being,” by the way, is not a decisive moral classification; the phrase obviously applies to any being of the species _Homo sapiens_ , including any somatic cell.) Kant would ask whether we could without contradiction of the will adopt as a universal law whatever maxim we propose about how we shall treat such a being. We do not contradict our will by adopting as a universal law that we shall use epidosembryos, at no cost in potential lives, to provide to those who suffer the aid that we would wish were we in their shoes.\n\n【56】A second objection is the simple declaration that a zygote is a person. The most influential version of that objection appears in the official teaching issued within the latter part of the twentieth century by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith of the Roman Catholic Church. The reasoning begins from the premise that all artificial methods of reproduction, including in vitro fertilization, are illicit. In adopting that stance, the magisterium anticipated a situation now upon us—a set of surplus embryos whose creators have effectively consigned them, as the magisterium puts it, to an “absurd fate.” Such embryos will either perish as waste or be frozen indefinitely, never entering a womb. So when the magisterium condemns embryo destruction, it speaks consistently. It condemns destruction of embryos in research just as it condemns artificial reproductive practices that inexorably lead to destruction of embryos as waste. Others who approve of in vitro fertilization as presently practiced but oppose use of embryos in research fall into inconsistency. They implicitly approve the destruction of surplus embryos as waste while condemning the use of surplus embryos to help others.\n\n【57】Although the official Catholic view cannot be accused of inconsistency in the foregoing respect, on what ground does that view rest? Why condemn the destruction of an unenabled embryo in research? As one studies the magisterial instructions and looks for arguments, one finds a single argument. The argument is not scriptural. The ancients did not understand fertilization or embryogenesis, and were not thinking of embryos in petri dishes. The argument purports to be biological. The argument is that because fertilization creates a new genome, fertilization creates a person.\n\n【58】Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. _Donum Vitae._ Vatican City; 1987.\n\n【59】This is an argument whose premise one must admit— the biology is correct, fertilization does produce a new genome—but whose conclusion does not follow. The argument presupposes a radical version of genetic reductionism. To say that a person is a genome is a view that even a materialist would not venture. It is a view contradicting the belief, held within the religious tradition from within which the argument is offered, that a person is a _corpore et anima unus_ , a union of body and soul. I imagine that one reason that many people have not heard this argument is that it cannot be maintained consistently with the rest of Christian teaching. I suspect that eventually the argument will fade.\n\n【60】Another interpretation of Catholicism might lay stress on the notion, also advanced by the magisterium, that because we do not know whether an embryo is a person, we should exercise caution, and act as if it were a person. But suppose that we could have a conversation with God. We would say that as of 1998, we discovered how to culture embryonic stem cells. We would explain that we have plans to relieve human suffering by the use of embryos that will never enter a womb. Is it plausible that He would tell us that He regards embryos that will never enter a womb as persons in the sense that He includes them in the universe of beings that He wishes us not to consume? I do not know of a tenable argument according to which an all-merciful and omniscient God would assert that preference. For He would know that unenabled embryos will never develop into infants. He would know that our efforts to aid actual lives would exact no cost in potential lives. Under these circumstances, there inexorably come to bear Christian social teachings, including the duty to love thy neighbor as thyself, and “the law of charity.”\n\n【61】Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. _Declarato de Abortu Procurato_ Vatican City; 1974.\n\n【62】### Cloning as a Special Case\n\n【63】You may have heard some people say that the justification of embryonic stem cell research lies in the circumstance that the embryo donors initially intended procreation when they created the embryos now regarded as surplus. The argument from nonenablement does not rely on any assumption of initial procreative intent. Hence the argument from nonenablement justifies not only embryonic stem cell research, but nonprocreative cloning.\n\n【64】An objection peculiar to cloning might be this. An oocyte is created for a purpose, namely to issue in offspring, and it is wrong to divert an oocyte to any other purpose. This objection rests on an Aristotelian teleology that, since Darwin, does not exert much grip on our thought. We have learned from the history of medicine how mistaken we humans have often been in inferring purposes of various cells and structures of the human body. Our forbears would have said that bones are what hold us up; today we think of the marrow as a blood factory, and think it entirely appropriate to transfer marrow from one patient to another. We have learned the remarkable adaptability of tissues and cells. We now actively engage in directing tissues and cells to serve chosen purposes in aid of sick patients, calling this treatment “conventional” drug therapy. It is unpersuasive to say that an oocyte can or should serve only one purpose.\n\n【65】From a religious point of view—and the teleological objection that I have just described now finds its greatest support in religious traditions—the ultimate arbiter is divine will. Imagine again that we could have a conversation with God. Would He say that oocytes may serve only the purpose of procreation? This rule would seem harsh inasmuch as we should have to measure its implementation in suffering unrelieved. It would also seem puzzling insofar as every human female possesses from birth a quarter million or more immature oocytes.\n\n【66】That is all that I shall say here about the argument from nonenablement in general. I shall say a bit more about procreative cloning, the baggage of which those waiting to do nonprocreative cloning in research would like to rid themselves. About procreative cloning, we have developed a social consensus. We know from animal studies that the odds of producing healthy offspring in mammalian procreative cloning are so dismal that it would be irresponsible to attempt it in humans.\n\n【67】We have heard a considerable stir about legislating that consensus. I should only like to point out that the need for legislation is probably illusory. A couple years ago, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dispatched a two-page letter to fertility clinicians and to others known to have an appetite for procreative cloning. The letter declared that, first, if anyone wishes to attempt human procreative cloning, they must file an investigational drug application, and second, if anyone files such an application, the FDA will deny it. This letter evidently scared the daylights out of even mavericks. You will notice that those reported by the press to be attempting cloning are not attempting it within the United States. In consequence, there seems no need for legislation duplicating the FDA's interdiction.\n\n【68】I mention this because concern abounds that legislators, in their zeal to appear vigilant to their constituents, will sweep valuable research within the maw of a prohibition. That would be a shame when the likely incidence of procreative cloning seems nil. In a book that I am writing on the morality of new uses of embryos, I am studying a number of situations in which, so it has been suggested, people might resort to cloning as a means of having children. Among prospective parents usually imagined for the procedure are carriers of alleles for recessive diseases and those affected by them, infertile couples, homosexual couples, and others. I have concluded that cloning will seldom be a first choice. A more likely choice will be in vitro fertilization followed by prenatal genetic diagnosis as a screening technique. Germ line intervention would also draw interest when it is feasible. Perhaps someday we shall even see the use of artificial chromosomes. Cloning does not offer the flexibility, safety, and other advantages of such alternatives.\n\n【69】Still there will arise objections to procreative cloning when the day comes, if it does, that the procedure is as safe as natural conception. One objection will be that the motivation of people who want to clone is a kind of unworthy narcissism. To this I reply that if narcissism motivates some instances of asexual reproduction, it may motivate many more instances of natural reproduction. Perhaps we ought to shelve that objection.\n\n【70】There also abounds the prediction that a clone will undergo an identity crisis. As the scenario goes, a clone's knowledge that it shares the nuclear genome of a source will so burden the clone that the clone will not understand that he or she is a distinct person. I find this objection implausible. In a typical case, a clone will be about 25 years or more younger than the source, will grow up in a different environment, will meet different people, will have different experiences, and so forth.\n\n【71】We also hear speculation that asexual reproduction will threaten the nuclear family, and even that copying genomes by cloning will adversely affect the gene pool. Both eventualities seem improbable, the latter highly improbable unless the incidence of cloning becomes very high. In any case, we can respond to all these speculations by saying that if the day arrives that cloning is safe, we should revisit the question of its propriety. At that time, anyone proposing a governmental prohibition of cloning will need to explain why, if every other method of reproduction is private, this one should not be.\n\n【72】### Minimizing Risk of Abuses\n\n【73】I would like to close with some thoughts about minimizing the risk of abuses. I first mention how we learn about such risks. We did not learn about the risks of recombinant DNA research, germ line intervention, or embryonic stem cell research and cloning from moralists hovering about scientific laboratories. We learned about those risks from the scientists who made the enabling discoveries. They and their colleagues in each case envisioned what might come of their discoveries, and acted promptly to bring before the public the question whether it would be moral to proceed. We should give credit to these scientists for their welltuned moral barometers.\n\n【74】For the present task, we ought first to define the sorts of research in which donated embryos would be eligible subjects. We, most of us, I suspect, would be appalled if human embryos were used—as were animals in studies of which we learned not so long ago—in testing industrial chemicals or cosmetics. Hence we may stipulate—and the concept of epidosembryo embeds this condition—that only in humanitarian work may one consume a human embryo. Only epidosembryos, in other words, may be subjects.\n\n【75】We would also sensibly prohibit ectogenesis. That is, we would prohibit the development of an embryo in the laboratory beyond some specified number of days. British law prohibits development of an embryo beyond day 14.\n\n【76】Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 ch. 37, §3(3)(a).\n\n【77】Some have taken the laying down of the primitive streak as the first stage in the development of a nervous system. But the nonindividuation objection has become the most influential reason for adopting day 14 as a boundary. The demise of the nonindividuation objection would explode that rationale. Still we shall have to set some boundary if we wish to preclude ectogenesis. As Bernard Williams once remarked, it is not uniquely reasonable that we draw a line at fourteen days, but it is reasonable that we draw it.\n\n【78】Types of moral argument against embryo research.\n\n【79】in: Ciba Foundation Bock G O'Connor M Human Embryo Research: Yes or No? Tavistock , London, England 1986 : 190\n\n【80】There looms a risk of abuse in obtaining oocytes for use in cloning. Research might create an aggregate demand for substantial numbers of oocytes. This, it has been said, might lead to the exploitation of women. If asked, a circumspect scientist will say that science should use only the fruits of fully voluntary donations by women who want to help others. On the other hand, one could present a libertarian argument that a woman should be permitted to donate oocytes, and to receive compensation, as she wishes. If that practice were to become widespread, concern would understandably arise about ushering in the commodification of oocytes. I suggest that if we eventually elect to allow a market in this or other human body parts, we regulate the market. We may seek mechanisms to balance, on the one hand, protections against induced self-damaging acts, and, on the other, demand for subjects with which to conduct humanitarian research and therapy. One technological innovation that could greatly relieve any tension here consists in the production of oocytes by induced differentiation of embryonic stem cells.\n\n【81】We also have to decide whether to allow patents on embryos. A product of somatic cell nuclear transfer may well be new, useful, and nonobvious, and not be a product of nature, in which case it will meet the criteria for the award of a patent. But think what that would mean. A patent on a method of forming a clone would cause a human conception or birth to be assailable as a patent infringement. That would be a perverse result. The result already looms by dint of patents on DNA sequences, a subject unto itself.\n\n【82】Norms for patents concerning human and other life forms.\n\n【83】I observe here that in the case of both DNA and embryo patents, we can avoid untoward results by introducing a simple rule. Each country could amend its patent laws to say that “No claim of infringement shall lie against a parent or child as such.” This provision would leave commercial patent owners free to pursue each other on claims of infringement, but would render parents and children immune from claims of infringement in their capacities as such.\n\n【84】Any new technology poses some risk of abuse. It would be misleading to suggest that the risks of abuse in the case of embryo use are insubstantial. No one could claim to know that. But it would be uncaring of us to neglect the humanitarian work of which we are capable within the protective constraints that we have the power to impose. Given our prospects of relieving suffering in actual lives at no cost in potential lives, we have a duty to act. I leave you with the thought that the case for this conclusion, the argument from nonenablement, is a consensus argument. It commands assent across a wide range of moral views. It beckons us to recognize that sometimes we are called upon to derive good from bad.

Columbia University Press , New York, NY 1993", "content": "【0】The Morality of Unenabled Embryo Use—Arguments That Work and Arguments That Don't\nAs natural phenomena are to the scientist, so are arguments to the philosopher. The philosopher Richard Hare once said, “I like to give arguments for my position. They come in handy when people don't agree with me.” Consider then the inclination of many among us—perhaps by virtue of being busy, or for other reasons—to pronounce a verdict, when a moral controversy comes along, by consulting aphorisms or slogans. By following this inclination, earnest people may unwittingly betray the moral views that they aspire to uphold. For they may fail to take account of the depth and subtlety of their respective moral views.\n\n【1】I should like to discuss arguments offered in support of using human embryos in research and therapy. I plan to survey both arguments that work and arguments that do not. I shall first review six arguments that I place in the latter category. Each of these purports to justify research that I happen to support. But inasmuch as a good case is not made better by overstatement, and no case is made by an unsound argument, I am going to disavow those six arguments. I urge other supporters of donated embryo use to disavow them as well, because, as Bernard Williams once said, openness to criticism is the homage that candor pays to truth. To support my own view, I shall go on to sketch arguments that, so I shall suggest, are sound. I shall then say a bit more about cloning in particular, and shall close by remarking on the risk of abuses.\n\n【2】ARGUMENTS THAT DO NOT WORK\n--------------------------\n\n【3】### Imminent Death as Justification for Killing\n\n【4】Consider the argument that the imminent death of an embryo—for instance, a surplus embryo in a fertility clinic—justifies its consumption in research. A more extreme proposal, recently offered by Frederick Grinnell, would have us define a concept of embryo death according to which embryos not destined for intrauterine transfer are dead. This concept of death seems to defy common sense. The embryos that I contemplate as research subjects are alive. About this concept of death I doubt that it is necessary to say anything more.\n\n【5】Let us consider the plain argument that imminent death of an admittedly living embryo justifies killing it in research. In refutation of that argument, consider the following Wild West example. One day the notorious varmint Hatfield is riding about on his horse. Feeling tired, Hatfield elects to dismount beside the railroad tracks. He sits down, and eventually dozes off, stretching out across the tracks. Sometime later, as Hatfield lies sound asleep astride the tracks, a train approaches at high speed. Whereupon there happens to ride onto the scene Hatfield's archenemy, McCoy. Spotting Hatfield, McCoy gallops to the tracks, dismounts, and—just in the nick of time before the train arrives—yanks Hatfield from the tracks. McCoy then immediately pulls out his rifle, trains it on Hatfield, and kills Hatfield. In this case, even though Hatfield would have died under the wheels of the train a split second earlier, we hold McCoy guilty of wrongful killing. In general, the imminent death of a victim does not justify its killing. Embryo research will not be justifiable solely on the ground of imminent embryo death.\n\n【6】### Nonindividuation Objection to Zygotic Personhood\n\n【7】The nonindividuation objection to zygotic personhood runs as follows. Prior to formation of an embryo's primitive streak at day 14 of development, it can happen that the embryo splits into monozygotic twins. And if twinning occurs, the twins can fuse. Hence it has been suggested that in respect of any embryo, one cannot say until day 14 whether there exists one individual or more. If one cannot say how many persons exist, it is untenable to say that any person exists. Another version of the nonindividuation objection begins from the premise that in twinning, an embryo vanishes and leaves no earthly remains. How could an individual person die leaving no earthly remains? If no corpse ever exists, there could not earlier have existed a person.\n\n【8】Thus does the nonindividuation objection characterize zygotic personhood as metaphysically impossible. The objection's biological sophistication has led many scientists to regard it as a clinching argument for embryo use. Despite that sophistication, the nonindividuation objection is susceptible to the following refutation owed to David Oderberg.\n\n【9】Modal properties, moral status, and identity.\n\n【10】Suppose at time _t_ <sub>0 </sub> a somatic cell _x_ . By _t_ <sub>1 </sub> , _x_ has divided, and there exist _x_ ’s daughter cells _d_ <sub>1 </sub> and _d_ <sub>2 </sub> . The process by which this has occurred, namely, mitosis, is routine. Notice that as we look back at the history of _x_ up to _t_ <sub>1 </sub> , we do not have any doubt that _x_ was an individual cell. Plainly _x_ had the capability of dividing, and in fact, _x_ did divide, but it is not incoherent to say, and we unhesitatingly do say, that for so long as _x_ existed, _x_ was an individual. As for the apparent puzzle of dying without leaving earthly remains, again a reflection on mitosis sheds light. Necrosis is not the only means by which a life form may cease to exist. Dividing is another means. And it happens that after division, there is no corpse. So it is not metaphysically incoherent to say that an embryo capable of dividing is an individual. Or that an embryo that does divide was an individual before it divided.\n\n【11】To rehabilitate the nonindividuation objection, a proponent might contend that indivisibility is somehow intrinsic to the individuality of a person as it may not be to the individuality of a cell, so that a being that is divisible cannot be or correspond to a person. To buttress this claim, the proponent might offer the example that an adult individual cannot divide into surviving individuals. Or the proponent might contend that even if adult individual _x_ could be split into surviving individuals—say, by a brain split and transplant operation in which, as imagined by philosophers of mind, _x_ ’s brain is split and each half is transferred into a new body so that each successor retains memories and otherwise achieves psychological continuity with _x_ —it would not be the case that _x_ is the same individual as either of its successors. One reply to this, owed to the whimsy of Peter King, is that it is possible to survive with only half a brain, though in such case one is restricted to a career in politics. But we may leave aside what adults can do.\n\n【12】We may reply to the proponent of the nonindividuation objection with two thoughts. First, what is feasible for an adult ought not constrain our thinking, because we know of the remarkable ability of an early embryo to split into surviving individuals. Second, the individuality of a being does not depend on its being the same individual, if it happens to split, as any of its successors. When an embryo has split, we may simply say that it was one individual until it split, that the individual ceased to exist when it split, and that two individuals have succeeded it. Thus may we render not only the possibility but the actuality of twinning consistent with individuality of the original embryo and with individuality of its twin successors. Given that the case of an embryo that does split resolves in this way, no impediment arises to individuality of an embryo that has not split.\n\n【13】According to this analysis, the nonindividuation objection fails to establish that an embryo cannot be a person. When monozygotic twinning occurs, it may be said that two persons succeed one person that ceases. But even if we defeat the contention that an embryo cannot be a person, there remains the question whether, for purposes of the duty not to kill, we should treat every embryo as a person. That a being “is a person” is not an empirical observation or an _a priori_ truth. Calling a being a person is a shorthand reply to the moral question, “How should we treat it for this purpose?” The shorthand signifies our conclusion that we should classify the being among those to whom we think all of us should accord a particular treatment. Whereupon we may fairly be asked what argument supports that conclusion. Failure of the nonindividuation objection leaves the door open to introduce, or oppose, arguments that we are obliged to treat all embryos as persons for purposes of the duty not to kill.\n\n【14】### The Utilitarian Defense of Embryo Use\n\n【15】Utilitarianism commands us to maximize aggregate preference satisfaction for the universe of affected sentient beings. A familiar argument is that if, in regenerative medicine, we sacrifice a relatively small number of embryos in order to help millions, perhaps billions, of suffering people, we can achieve higher aggregate preference satisfaction than we would achieve were we to classify every embryo as a person for purposes of the duty not to kill.\n\n【16】John Stuart Mill, who with Bentham brought utilitarianism to prominence, learned calculus at the age of five, but Mill did not envision the mathematical defect of his moral theory. The infirmity came to light through the work of economists in the twentieth century. Consider that the number of affected sentient beings in respect of many policy issues, embryo use among them, is enormous. Collecting utility data from so many people would be a monumental task. A more fundamental failing is that there obtains no method of measuring utility. Utilitarianism presupposes a utility function for each member of the set of affected beings. A utility function is nowadays understood as a real-valued order homomorphism representing a transitive and connected binary relation defined by an individual on a set of alternatives. This understanding no doubt explains why many scientists have felt comfortable with utilitarianism and with a utilitarian defense of embryo research. Utilitarianism seems empirical, quantitative, precise. For physician scientists, utilitarianism evokes some of the thinking to which outcome studies, comparing benefits and costs, have accustomed them.\n\n【17】But if, for two or more individuals, a utilitarian seeks to sum the utilities of a given alternative, there obtains no common unit of measure. Indeed there does not exist a standard measure even for a single person. While it is easy to define, as a representation of an individual's positioning of alternatives, a real-valued order homomorphism, any of infinitely many other functions formed by affine transformations from that order homomorphism will also represent the positioning.\n\n【18】Though the problem of interpersonal incommensurability of utilities remains unsolved, on many occasions a utilitarian's audience either will be unaware of the problem, or willing to overlook it. For example, if a hospital were to propose construction of a new facility, and if that project would require demolition of the homes of 100 people, displacing those residents in exchange for reimbursement of their homes’ fair market value and their moving expenses, a utilitarian might argue that future gains in utility produced by the project for perhaps hundreds of thousands of patients in future decades will exceed the disutility of the 100 who must presently relocate. Listeners will follow an argument such as this without worrying much about whether the utility calculation has been performed. For it may seem in such a case that for any plausible conversion ratio of units of measure, the comparison of utility between alternatives will be lopsided.\n\n【19】On the other hand, if an advocated alternative is the killing of a life form that some people sincerely believe to be a person, not much tolerance will be found for an argument whose proponents cannot produce the calculation on which the argument purportedly rests. The root of the difficulty is the same as in the blinkered attempt to order, on the basis of supposed measures of quality, incommensurable college football teams.\n\n【20】### Appeal to “Fact-based Reasoning” Alone\n\n【21】The next argument, also not infrequently invoked by scientists, proceeds by asserting that public advocacy concerning embryo use should appeal to “fact-based reasoning” alone, and that it therefore follows that objections resting on any other ground must give way to the progress of biomedical science. This argument serves as a euphemism for saying that appeals to religion and various “insular” moral views do not have a place in public debate about science. In reply, we must observe that the view that scientific work grounded in fact-based reasoning should go forward without obstruction by moral views is itself a moral view. When an objection lies on grounds of wrongful killing, it is neither appropriate nor feasible to oust religion or moral views from the conversation. Of course we all agree that we should rest on facts as opposed to errors, but given facts, a normative discussion awaits.\n\n【22】A more sophisticated cousin of the foregoing argument, the call to “public reason” of John Rawls, would have us employ in public discourse only premises that others could not reasonably reject.\n\n【23】Political Liberalism. Columbia University Press , New York, NY 1993\n\n【24】That, in a moment, is what I shall try to do in stating my own view.\n\n【25】### Noncomplicity Defenses\n\n【26】It has been suggested that even if the consumption of embryos in research is wrong, a government could support derivative research by eschewing complicity in the destruction of embryos. As it has been put by proponents of this move, one could distinguish between embryonic stem cell derivation and embryonic stem cell use. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) at one time adopted this view.\n\n【27】65 Fed. Reg. 51976-51981 (2000).\n\n【28】It announced that it would fund projects classified as embryonic stem cell use. The notion seemed to be that this would avoid complicity in wrongful embryo-destructive derivation of stem cells.\n\n【29】In another scheme for purportedly conducting embryo research without complicity in embryo killing, fertility clinicians would perform the immunosurgery by which embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos. This scheme is probably impractical, because fertility clinicians do not do that kind of work. They do not customarily derive cell lines from embryos; they customarily nurture and transfer embryos so as to achieve pregnancies. Even if the scheme were practical, it shares with the derivation-use distinction the problem that when a chain of supply runs from someone who sacrifices an embryo to someone who experiments with the sacrificed embryo's derivatives, we seem compelled to say from a moral point of view that the source and the recipient ride in the same boat. It is untenable to say that the experimenter is not complicit in the work of the supplier.\n\n【30】Another noncomplicity strategy, recently played out in the United States, might be called “government surprise.” It would begin as a government announces that it will not fund research that effects or is consequent on destruction of embryos. Then, after this policy has become widely known, the government suddenly announces—in the United States, we saw this happen on August 9, 2001—that in the future it will disperse public funds for studies using derivatives of embryos already then sacrificed. The most cogent philosophical defense of this gambit that occurs to me might be to say that the government had not, prior to the second announcement, induced any destruction of embryos. One would say this on the hypothesis that theretofore, the government had given everyone to believe that it would not support such research. (The hypothesis may not be true with respect to the recent history of US government policy. Between the first and second announcements came the just mentioned NIH announcement that it would fund research on embryonic derivatives. What I am here calling the first announcement was a prohibition enacted by Congress as a rider to an appropriations bill.\n\n【31】Pub. L. No. 104-99, Title I, §128, 110 Stat. 26, 34 (1996).\n\n【32】) But apart from this historical contingency, the government surprise scheme succumbs to the same objection that lodges against the two other schemes that I have just mentioned. The government surprise scheme would place those who participate in funded embryonic stem cell studies in the same boat with those who participate in nonfunded embryodestructive stem cell derivation.\n\n【33】### Denying That Clones Are Embryos\n\n【34】The last in my roster of arguments that do not work consists in the claim that somatic cell nuclear transfer performed in research is not cloning, and does not produce clones or embryos, this because a suggested new semantic regimen would withhold the term “cloning” from any instance of somatic cell nuclear transfer in research, would instead call the process “nuclear transplantation,” and would withhold “clone” and “embryo” from the products of that process.\n\n【35】For this context, I have elsewhere tried to sort out the relevant entities and events in a manner informed by biological and moral considerations. My analysis leads me to reject the proposed semantic regimen as to both process and products. The proposed terminology risks the appearance of trying to smuggle in a morally significant event— initiation of embryogenesis—by not mentioning it. In trying to withhold “cloning” and “clone” from processes and products of research, a proponent of the proposed terminology would contradict the ordinary and morally significant understanding of cloning as a genetic event, an event completed shortly after oocyte activation, regardless whether transfer to a uterus ensues. The goal that has motivated the proposed terminology, the goal of offering the public a sharp distinction between research and producing children, does not require legerdemain to attain. Rather we may implement a simple distinction, a distinction between “procreative cloning” and “nonprocreative cloning.” The distinction turns on a single observable event, intrauterine transfer.\n\n【36】The set of embryo subjects.\n\n【37】As for “embryo,” any being that is of a kind capable of developing into a neonate upon transfer to a uterus is an object of moral concern. We implicitly acknowledge that concern when we classify every prefetal developing organism as an embryo. (In both scientific writing and popular speech, we have abandoned the textbook definition according to which “embryo” applies only to a conceptus older than two weeks.) Recognition of a being as an embryo does not end our moral investigation. We may conclude—for reasons that I shall shortly present, I believe that we should conclude—that we are not obliged to treat every embryo in the same way. But in respect of a product of somatic cell nuclear transfer, recognizing its inclusion within a discussant's universe of moral concern is the place from which to begin our discussion with one who does not agree with us.\n\n【38】ARGUMENTS THAT WORK\n-------------------\n\n【39】### Argument from Nonenablement\n\n【40】To advance the proposition that embryonic stem cell research is virtuous if not obligatory, I have elsewhere presented an argument that I call “the argument from nonenablement.”\n\n【41】Morals and primordials.\n\n【42】I refer to an embryo that will never enter a uterus as an “unenabled” embryo. In the first instance, I have in mind a situation, which often arises with fertility patients, in which the one person in the world who, together with her partner, is empowered to decide about intrauterine transfer of an embryo formed from her oocyte decides that neither does she wish to have that embryo transferred unto her nor does she wish to give the embryo to anyone else for intrauterine transfer.\n\n【43】There is no moral view of which I know that asserts a duty of intrauterine embryo transfer. That is to say that there is no moral view that asserts that a woman lies under a duty to undergo a transfer unto her of an embryo that lies outside her. About such a procedure, we respect her autonomy. Imagine, therefore, that a woman declines intrauterine transfer, and in fact, forbids it. She, with her partner, donates to medicine either an embryo created during her fertility treatment, or an embryo that will be created by a scientist from their donated cells. Let us assume that this decision is final and that the embryo has left parental control. Such a donation to medicine I call an “epidosembryo.” I take this name from the Greek _epidosis_ for a citizen's great beneficence to the common weal. What Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie Mayo left to Minnesota, and to the world, was an _epidosis_ . So too may we describe a couple's gift to medicine of a life form that, were they to decide otherwise, could become their child.\n\n【44】A distinction obtains between the developmental potential of an embryo that lies in a petri dish and will remain there, and an embryo that lies in a uterus, however it got there. In consequence of parental instructions that an epidosembryo shall be used in research or therapy and shall not be transferred to a uterus, there does not obtain any morally significant chance that from such an embryo, an infant will develop. To put the matter in language that I owe to Hare,\n\n【45】Essays on Bioethics. Clarendon Press , Oxford, England 1993\n\n【46】no possible person corresponds to an epidosembryo. We also know, and this is purely empirical knowledge, that an embryo is not sentient. And that, for lack of a cortex, an embryo cannot form preferences. Nor can an embryo adopt ends. Therefore nothing that we might do to an epidosembryo can cause it discomfort or frustrate it. Under these circumstances, and when we consider the duty of mutual aid asserted within each of the leading moral views of our time, I claim that it is permissible to use some embryos, namely epidosembryos, in medicine.\n\n【47】As the preceding discussion makes clear, I rest the permissibility and virtuousness of epidosembryo use on the autonomous decisions of couples from whose cells such embryos originate. The moral analysis flows entirely from what it is that they decide. If it is permissible for those donations to be made, then it is permissible for recipient scientists to use epidosembryos as instructed.\n\n【48】Suppose that someone interjects that precisely because epidosembryos cannot form preferences, it is our obligation to act according to their advantage. I reply that we cannot promote any advantage of epidosembryos. Were we to refrain from using epidosembryos in research, we could not gain anything for them. Entry into the only environment by which they could attain birth has been forbidden by the only persons in the world empowered to decide on entry into that environment.\n\n【49】I also point out that the argument from nonenablement differs from an appeal to imminent death as a means of justifying a killing. Nonenablement precludes a conceptus from attaining any of the attributes—autonomy, ability to feel pain, preferences, and, according to the traditional Thomist-Aristotelian teaching of Christianity, the attainment of a soul—whose infringement makes killing wrong. Nonenablement entails that there does not even correspond to an epidosembryo a possible person. It is not that death is imminent, but that development is bounded.\n\n【50】### Replies to Objections\n\n【51】Let me now reply to a couple objections. The first objection asserts that the sacrifice of an embryo violates the second form of Kant's categorical imperative, the precept that we should treat “humanity … always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.”\n\n【52】*   Kant\n\n【53】Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals.\n\n【54】in: Gregor MJ The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant, Practical Philosophy. 4\\. Cambridge University Press , Cambridge, England 1996 : 429\n\n【55】(This, not the Declaration of Helsinki, is the origin of the requirement of informed consent.) In this formulation, by “humanity” Kant understands rational nature. For this reason, the objection misapprehends Kant's view, which applies only to rational beings. The second form of the categorical imperative does not apply to mentally incompetent adults, infants, or embryos. That is not to say that Kant would take a cavalier view of the helpless. Kant would analyze our moral obligations toward these nonrational human beings as he would analyze moral questions in general. (“Human being,” by the way, is not a decisive moral classification; the phrase obviously applies to any being of the species _Homo sapiens_ , including any somatic cell.) Kant would ask whether we could without contradiction of the will adopt as a universal law whatever maxim we propose about how we shall treat such a being. We do not contradict our will by adopting as a universal law that we shall use epidosembryos, at no cost in potential lives, to provide to those who suffer the aid that we would wish were we in their shoes.\n\n【56】A second objection is the simple declaration that a zygote is a person. The most influential version of that objection appears in the official teaching issued within the latter part of the twentieth century by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith of the Roman Catholic Church. The reasoning begins from the premise that all artificial methods of reproduction, including in vitro fertilization, are illicit. In adopting that stance, the magisterium anticipated a situation now upon us—a set of surplus embryos whose creators have effectively consigned them, as the magisterium puts it, to an “absurd fate.” Such embryos will either perish as waste or be frozen indefinitely, never entering a womb. So when the magisterium condemns embryo destruction, it speaks consistently. It condemns destruction of embryos in research just as it condemns artificial reproductive practices that inexorably lead to destruction of embryos as waste. Others who approve of in vitro fertilization as presently practiced but oppose use of embryos in research fall into inconsistency. They implicitly approve the destruction of surplus embryos as waste while condemning the use of surplus embryos to help others.\n\n【57】Although the official Catholic view cannot be accused of inconsistency in the foregoing respect, on what ground does that view rest? Why condemn the destruction of an unenabled embryo in research? As one studies the magisterial instructions and looks for arguments, one finds a single argument. The argument is not scriptural. The ancients did not understand fertilization or embryogenesis, and were not thinking of embryos in petri dishes. The argument purports to be biological. The argument is that because fertilization creates a new genome, fertilization creates a person.\n\n【58】Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. _Donum Vitae._ Vatican City; 1987.\n\n【59】This is an argument whose premise one must admit— the biology is correct, fertilization does produce a new genome—but whose conclusion does not follow. The argument presupposes a radical version of genetic reductionism. To say that a person is a genome is a view that even a materialist would not venture. It is a view contradicting the belief, held within the religious tradition from within which the argument is offered, that a person is a _corpore et anima unus_ , a union of body and soul. I imagine that one reason that many people have not heard this argument is that it cannot be maintained consistently with the rest of Christian teaching. I suspect that eventually the argument will fade.\n\n【60】Another interpretation of Catholicism might lay stress on the notion, also advanced by the magisterium, that because we do not know whether an embryo is a person, we should exercise caution, and act as if it were a person. But suppose that we could have a conversation with God. We would say that as of 1998, we discovered how to culture embryonic stem cells. We would explain that we have plans to relieve human suffering by the use of embryos that will never enter a womb. Is it plausible that He would tell us that He regards embryos that will never enter a womb as persons in the sense that He includes them in the universe of beings that He wishes us not to consume? I do not know of a tenable argument according to which an all-merciful and omniscient God would assert that preference. For He would know that unenabled embryos will never develop into infants. He would know that our efforts to aid actual lives would exact no cost in potential lives. Under these circumstances, there inexorably come to bear Christian social teachings, including the duty to love thy neighbor as thyself, and “the law of charity.”\n\n【61】Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. _Declarato de Abortu Procurato_ Vatican City; 1974.\n\n【62】### Cloning as a Special Case\n\n【63】You may have heard some people say that the justification of embryonic stem cell research lies in the circumstance that the embryo donors initially intended procreation when they created the embryos now regarded as surplus. The argument from nonenablement does not rely on any assumption of initial procreative intent. Hence the argument from nonenablement justifies not only embryonic stem cell research, but nonprocreative cloning.\n\n【64】An objection peculiar to cloning might be this. An oocyte is created for a purpose, namely to issue in offspring, and it is wrong to divert an oocyte to any other purpose. This objection rests on an Aristotelian teleology that, since Darwin, does not exert much grip on our thought. We have learned from the history of medicine how mistaken we humans have often been in inferring purposes of various cells and structures of the human body. Our forbears would have said that bones are what hold us up; today we think of the marrow as a blood factory, and think it entirely appropriate to transfer marrow from one patient to another. We have learned the remarkable adaptability of tissues and cells. We now actively engage in directing tissues and cells to serve chosen purposes in aid of sick patients, calling this treatment “conventional” drug therapy. It is unpersuasive to say that an oocyte can or should serve only one purpose.\n\n【65】From a religious point of view—and the teleological objection that I have just described now finds its greatest support in religious traditions—the ultimate arbiter is divine will. Imagine again that we could have a conversation with God. Would He say that oocytes may serve only the purpose of procreation? This rule would seem harsh inasmuch as we should have to measure its implementation in suffering unrelieved. It would also seem puzzling insofar as every human female possesses from birth a quarter million or more immature oocytes.\n\n【66】That is all that I shall say here about the argument from nonenablement in general. I shall say a bit more about procreative cloning, the baggage of which those waiting to do nonprocreative cloning in research would like to rid themselves. About procreative cloning, we have developed a social consensus. We know from animal studies that the odds of producing healthy offspring in mammalian procreative cloning are so dismal that it would be irresponsible to attempt it in humans.\n\n【67】We have heard a considerable stir about legislating that consensus. I should only like to point out that the need for legislation is probably illusory. A couple years ago, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dispatched a two-page letter to fertility clinicians and to others known to have an appetite for procreative cloning. The letter declared that, first, if anyone wishes to attempt human procreative cloning, they must file an investigational drug application, and second, if anyone files such an application, the FDA will deny it. This letter evidently scared the daylights out of even mavericks. You will notice that those reported by the press to be attempting cloning are not attempting it within the United States. In consequence, there seems no need for legislation duplicating the FDA's interdiction.\n\n【68】I mention this because concern abounds that legislators, in their zeal to appear vigilant to their constituents, will sweep valuable research within the maw of a prohibition. That would be a shame when the likely incidence of procreative cloning seems nil. In a book that I am writing on the morality of new uses of embryos, I am studying a number of situations in which, so it has been suggested, people might resort to cloning as a means of having children. Among prospective parents usually imagined for the procedure are carriers of alleles for recessive diseases and those affected by them, infertile couples, homosexual couples, and others. I have concluded that cloning will seldom be a first choice. A more likely choice will be in vitro fertilization followed by prenatal genetic diagnosis as a screening technique. Germ line intervention would also draw interest when it is feasible. Perhaps someday we shall even see the use of artificial chromosomes. Cloning does not offer the flexibility, safety, and other advantages of such alternatives.\n\n【69】Still there will arise objections to procreative cloning when the day comes, if it does, that the procedure is as safe as natural conception. One objection will be that the motivation of people who want to clone is a kind of unworthy narcissism. To this I reply that if narcissism motivates some instances of asexual reproduction, it may motivate many more instances of natural reproduction. Perhaps we ought to shelve that objection.\n\n【70】There also abounds the prediction that a clone will undergo an identity crisis. As the scenario goes, a clone's knowledge that it shares the nuclear genome of a source will so burden the clone that the clone will not understand that he or she is a distinct person. I find this objection implausible. In a typical case, a clone will be about 25 years or more younger than the source, will grow up in a different environment, will meet different people, will have different experiences, and so forth.\n\n【71】We also hear speculation that asexual reproduction will threaten the nuclear family, and even that copying genomes by cloning will adversely affect the gene pool. Both eventualities seem improbable, the latter highly improbable unless the incidence of cloning becomes very high. In any case, we can respond to all these speculations by saying that if the day arrives that cloning is safe, we should revisit the question of its propriety. At that time, anyone proposing a governmental prohibition of cloning will need to explain why, if every other method of reproduction is private, this one should not be.\n\n【72】### Minimizing Risk of Abuses\n\n【73】I would like to close with some thoughts about minimizing the risk of abuses. I first mention how we learn about such risks. We did not learn about the risks of recombinant DNA research, germ line intervention, or embryonic stem cell research and cloning from moralists hovering about scientific laboratories. We learned about those risks from the scientists who made the enabling discoveries. They and their colleagues in each case envisioned what might come of their discoveries, and acted promptly to bring before the public the question whether it would be moral to proceed. We should give credit to these scientists for their welltuned moral barometers.\n\n【74】For the present task, we ought first to define the sorts of research in which donated embryos would be eligible subjects. We, most of us, I suspect, would be appalled if human embryos were used—as were animals in studies of which we learned not so long ago—in testing industrial chemicals or cosmetics. Hence we may stipulate—and the concept of epidosembryo embeds this condition—that only in humanitarian work may one consume a human embryo. Only epidosembryos, in other words, may be subjects.\n\n【75】We would also sensibly prohibit ectogenesis. That is, we would prohibit the development of an embryo in the laboratory beyond some specified number of days. British law prohibits development of an embryo beyond day 14.\n\n【76】Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 ch. 37, §3(3)(a).\n\n【77】Some have taken the laying down of the primitive streak as the first stage in the development of a nervous system. But the nonindividuation objection has become the most influential reason for adopting day 14 as a boundary. The demise of the nonindividuation objection would explode that rationale. Still we shall have to set some boundary if we wish to preclude ectogenesis. As Bernard Williams once remarked, it is not uniquely reasonable that we draw a line at fourteen days, but it is reasonable that we draw it.\n\n【78】Types of moral argument against embryo research.\n\n【79】in: Ciba Foundation Bock G O'Connor M Human Embryo Research: Yes or No? Tavistock , London, England 1986 : 190\n\n【80】There looms a risk of abuse in obtaining oocytes for use in cloning. Research might create an aggregate demand for substantial numbers of oocytes. This, it has been said, might lead to the exploitation of women. If asked, a circumspect scientist will say that science should use only the fruits of fully voluntary donations by women who want to help others. On the other hand, one could present a libertarian argument that a woman should be permitted to donate oocytes, and to receive compensation, as she wishes. If that practice were to become widespread, concern would understandably arise about ushering in the commodification of oocytes. I suggest that if we eventually elect to allow a market in this or other human body parts, we regulate the market. We may seek mechanisms to balance, on the one hand, protections against induced self-damaging acts, and, on the other, demand for subjects with which to conduct humanitarian research and therapy. One technological innovation that could greatly relieve any tension here consists in the production of oocytes by induced differentiation of embryonic stem cells.\n\n【81】We also have to decide whether to allow patents on embryos. A product of somatic cell nuclear transfer may well be new, useful, and nonobvious, and not be a product of nature, in which case it will meet the criteria for the award of a patent. But think what that would mean. A patent on a method of forming a clone would cause a human conception or birth to be assailable as a patent infringement. That would be a perverse result. The result already looms by dint of patents on DNA sequences, a subject unto itself.\n\n【82】Norms for patents concerning human and other life forms.\n\n【83】I observe here that in the case of both DNA and embryo patents, we can avoid untoward results by introducing a simple rule. Each country could amend its patent laws to say that “No claim of infringement shall lie against a parent or child as such.” This provision would leave commercial patent owners free to pursue each other on claims of infringement, but would render parents and children immune from claims of infringement in their capacities as such.\n\n【84】Any new technology poses some risk of abuse. It would be misleading to suggest that the risks of abuse in the case of embryo use are insubstantial. No one could claim to know that. But it would be uncaring of us to neglect the humanitarian work of which we are capable within the protective constraints that we have the power to impose. Given our prospects of relieving suffering in actual lives at no cost in potential lives, we have a duty to act. I leave you with the thought that the case for this conclusion, the argument from nonenablement, is a consensus argument. It commands assent across a wide range of moral views. It beckons us to recognize that sometimes we are called upon to derive good from bad.

Tavistock , London, England 1986 : 190", "content": "【0】The Morality of Unenabled Embryo Use—Arguments That Work and Arguments That Don't\nAs natural phenomena are to the scientist, so are arguments to the philosopher. The philosopher Richard Hare once said, “I like to give arguments for my position. They come in handy when people don't agree with me.” Consider then the inclination of many among us—perhaps by virtue of being busy, or for other reasons—to pronounce a verdict, when a moral controversy comes along, by consulting aphorisms or slogans. By following this inclination, earnest people may unwittingly betray the moral views that they aspire to uphold. For they may fail to take account of the depth and subtlety of their respective moral views.\n\n【1】I should like to discuss arguments offered in support of using human embryos in research and therapy. I plan to survey both arguments that work and arguments that do not. I shall first review six arguments that I place in the latter category. Each of these purports to justify research that I happen to support. But inasmuch as a good case is not made better by overstatement, and no case is made by an unsound argument, I am going to disavow those six arguments. I urge other supporters of donated embryo use to disavow them as well, because, as Bernard Williams once said, openness to criticism is the homage that candor pays to truth. To support my own view, I shall go on to sketch arguments that, so I shall suggest, are sound. I shall then say a bit more about cloning in particular, and shall close by remarking on the risk of abuses.\n\n【2】ARGUMENTS THAT DO NOT WORK\n--------------------------\n\n【3】### Imminent Death as Justification for Killing\n\n【4】Consider the argument that the imminent death of an embryo—for instance, a surplus embryo in a fertility clinic—justifies its consumption in research. A more extreme proposal, recently offered by Frederick Grinnell, would have us define a concept of embryo death according to which embryos not destined for intrauterine transfer are dead. This concept of death seems to defy common sense. The embryos that I contemplate as research subjects are alive. About this concept of death I doubt that it is necessary to say anything more.\n\n【5】Let us consider the plain argument that imminent death of an admittedly living embryo justifies killing it in research. In refutation of that argument, consider the following Wild West example. One day the notorious varmint Hatfield is riding about on his horse. Feeling tired, Hatfield elects to dismount beside the railroad tracks. He sits down, and eventually dozes off, stretching out across the tracks. Sometime later, as Hatfield lies sound asleep astride the tracks, a train approaches at high speed. Whereupon there happens to ride onto the scene Hatfield's archenemy, McCoy. Spotting Hatfield, McCoy gallops to the tracks, dismounts, and—just in the nick of time before the train arrives—yanks Hatfield from the tracks. McCoy then immediately pulls out his rifle, trains it on Hatfield, and kills Hatfield. In this case, even though Hatfield would have died under the wheels of the train a split second earlier, we hold McCoy guilty of wrongful killing. In general, the imminent death of a victim does not justify its killing. Embryo research will not be justifiable solely on the ground of imminent embryo death.\n\n【6】### Nonindividuation Objection to Zygotic Personhood\n\n【7】The nonindividuation objection to zygotic personhood runs as follows. Prior to formation of an embryo's primitive streak at day 14 of development, it can happen that the embryo splits into monozygotic twins. And if twinning occurs, the twins can fuse. Hence it has been suggested that in respect of any embryo, one cannot say until day 14 whether there exists one individual or more. If one cannot say how many persons exist, it is untenable to say that any person exists. Another version of the nonindividuation objection begins from the premise that in twinning, an embryo vanishes and leaves no earthly remains. How could an individual person die leaving no earthly remains? If no corpse ever exists, there could not earlier have existed a person.\n\n【8】Thus does the nonindividuation objection characterize zygotic personhood as metaphysically impossible. The objection's biological sophistication has led many scientists to regard it as a clinching argument for embryo use. Despite that sophistication, the nonindividuation objection is susceptible to the following refutation owed to David Oderberg.\n\n【9】Modal properties, moral status, and identity.\n\n【10】Suppose at time _t_ <sub>0 </sub> a somatic cell _x_ . By _t_ <sub>1 </sub> , _x_ has divided, and there exist _x_ ’s daughter cells _d_ <sub>1 </sub> and _d_ <sub>2 </sub> . The process by which this has occurred, namely, mitosis, is routine. Notice that as we look back at the history of _x_ up to _t_ <sub>1 </sub> , we do not have any doubt that _x_ was an individual cell. Plainly _x_ had the capability of dividing, and in fact, _x_ did divide, but it is not incoherent to say, and we unhesitatingly do say, that for so long as _x_ existed, _x_ was an individual. As for the apparent puzzle of dying without leaving earthly remains, again a reflection on mitosis sheds light. Necrosis is not the only means by which a life form may cease to exist. Dividing is another means. And it happens that after division, there is no corpse. So it is not metaphysically incoherent to say that an embryo capable of dividing is an individual. Or that an embryo that does divide was an individual before it divided.\n\n【11】To rehabilitate the nonindividuation objection, a proponent might contend that indivisibility is somehow intrinsic to the individuality of a person as it may not be to the individuality of a cell, so that a being that is divisible cannot be or correspond to a person. To buttress this claim, the proponent might offer the example that an adult individual cannot divide into surviving individuals. Or the proponent might contend that even if adult individual _x_ could be split into surviving individuals—say, by a brain split and transplant operation in which, as imagined by philosophers of mind, _x_ ’s brain is split and each half is transferred into a new body so that each successor retains memories and otherwise achieves psychological continuity with _x_ —it would not be the case that _x_ is the same individual as either of its successors. One reply to this, owed to the whimsy of Peter King, is that it is possible to survive with only half a brain, though in such case one is restricted to a career in politics. But we may leave aside what adults can do.\n\n【12】We may reply to the proponent of the nonindividuation objection with two thoughts. First, what is feasible for an adult ought not constrain our thinking, because we know of the remarkable ability of an early embryo to split into surviving individuals. Second, the individuality of a being does not depend on its being the same individual, if it happens to split, as any of its successors. When an embryo has split, we may simply say that it was one individual until it split, that the individual ceased to exist when it split, and that two individuals have succeeded it. Thus may we render not only the possibility but the actuality of twinning consistent with individuality of the original embryo and with individuality of its twin successors. Given that the case of an embryo that does split resolves in this way, no impediment arises to individuality of an embryo that has not split.\n\n【13】According to this analysis, the nonindividuation objection fails to establish that an embryo cannot be a person. When monozygotic twinning occurs, it may be said that two persons succeed one person that ceases. But even if we defeat the contention that an embryo cannot be a person, there remains the question whether, for purposes of the duty not to kill, we should treat every embryo as a person. That a being “is a person” is not an empirical observation or an _a priori_ truth. Calling a being a person is a shorthand reply to the moral question, “How should we treat it for this purpose?” The shorthand signifies our conclusion that we should classify the being among those to whom we think all of us should accord a particular treatment. Whereupon we may fairly be asked what argument supports that conclusion. Failure of the nonindividuation objection leaves the door open to introduce, or oppose, arguments that we are obliged to treat all embryos as persons for purposes of the duty not to kill.\n\n【14】### The Utilitarian Defense of Embryo Use\n\n【15】Utilitarianism commands us to maximize aggregate preference satisfaction for the universe of affected sentient beings. A familiar argument is that if, in regenerative medicine, we sacrifice a relatively small number of embryos in order to help millions, perhaps billions, of suffering people, we can achieve higher aggregate preference satisfaction than we would achieve were we to classify every embryo as a person for purposes of the duty not to kill.\n\n【16】John Stuart Mill, who with Bentham brought utilitarianism to prominence, learned calculus at the age of five, but Mill did not envision the mathematical defect of his moral theory. The infirmity came to light through the work of economists in the twentieth century. Consider that the number of affected sentient beings in respect of many policy issues, embryo use among them, is enormous. Collecting utility data from so many people would be a monumental task. A more fundamental failing is that there obtains no method of measuring utility. Utilitarianism presupposes a utility function for each member of the set of affected beings. A utility function is nowadays understood as a real-valued order homomorphism representing a transitive and connected binary relation defined by an individual on a set of alternatives. This understanding no doubt explains why many scientists have felt comfortable with utilitarianism and with a utilitarian defense of embryo research. Utilitarianism seems empirical, quantitative, precise. For physician scientists, utilitarianism evokes some of the thinking to which outcome studies, comparing benefits and costs, have accustomed them.\n\n【17】But if, for two or more individuals, a utilitarian seeks to sum the utilities of a given alternative, there obtains no common unit of measure. Indeed there does not exist a standard measure even for a single person. While it is easy to define, as a representation of an individual's positioning of alternatives, a real-valued order homomorphism, any of infinitely many other functions formed by affine transformations from that order homomorphism will also represent the positioning.\n\n【18】Though the problem of interpersonal incommensurability of utilities remains unsolved, on many occasions a utilitarian's audience either will be unaware of the problem, or willing to overlook it. For example, if a hospital were to propose construction of a new facility, and if that project would require demolition of the homes of 100 people, displacing those residents in exchange for reimbursement of their homes’ fair market value and their moving expenses, a utilitarian might argue that future gains in utility produced by the project for perhaps hundreds of thousands of patients in future decades will exceed the disutility of the 100 who must presently relocate. Listeners will follow an argument such as this without worrying much about whether the utility calculation has been performed. For it may seem in such a case that for any plausible conversion ratio of units of measure, the comparison of utility between alternatives will be lopsided.\n\n【19】On the other hand, if an advocated alternative is the killing of a life form that some people sincerely believe to be a person, not much tolerance will be found for an argument whose proponents cannot produce the calculation on which the argument purportedly rests. The root of the difficulty is the same as in the blinkered attempt to order, on the basis of supposed measures of quality, incommensurable college football teams.\n\n【20】### Appeal to “Fact-based Reasoning” Alone\n\n【21】The next argument, also not infrequently invoked by scientists, proceeds by asserting that public advocacy concerning embryo use should appeal to “fact-based reasoning” alone, and that it therefore follows that objections resting on any other ground must give way to the progress of biomedical science. This argument serves as a euphemism for saying that appeals to religion and various “insular” moral views do not have a place in public debate about science. In reply, we must observe that the view that scientific work grounded in fact-based reasoning should go forward without obstruction by moral views is itself a moral view. When an objection lies on grounds of wrongful killing, it is neither appropriate nor feasible to oust religion or moral views from the conversation. Of course we all agree that we should rest on facts as opposed to errors, but given facts, a normative discussion awaits.\n\n【22】A more sophisticated cousin of the foregoing argument, the call to “public reason” of John Rawls, would have us employ in public discourse only premises that others could not reasonably reject.\n\n<mark>【23】Political Liberalism. Columbia University Press , New York, NY 1993</mark>\n\n【24】That, in a moment, is what I shall try to do in stating my own view.\n\n【25】### Noncomplicity Defenses\n\n【26】It has been suggested that even if the consumption of embryos in research is wrong, a government could support derivative research by eschewing complicity in the destruction of embryos. As it has been put by proponents of this move, one could distinguish between embryonic stem cell derivation and embryonic stem cell use. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) at one time adopted this view.\n\n【27】65 Fed. Reg. 51976-51981 (2000).\n\n【28】It announced that it would fund projects classified as embryonic stem cell use. The notion seemed to be that this would avoid complicity in wrongful embryo-destructive derivation of stem cells.\n\n【29】In another scheme for purportedly conducting embryo research without complicity in embryo killing, fertility clinicians would perform the immunosurgery by which embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos. This scheme is probably impractical, because fertility clinicians do not do that kind of work. They do not customarily derive cell lines from embryos; they customarily nurture and transfer embryos so as to achieve pregnancies. Even if the scheme were practical, it shares with the derivation-use distinction the problem that when a chain of supply runs from someone who sacrifices an embryo to someone who experiments with the sacrificed embryo's derivatives, we seem compelled to say from a moral point of view that the source and the recipient ride in the same boat. It is untenable to say that the experimenter is not complicit in the work of the supplier.\n\n【30】Another noncomplicity strategy, recently played out in the United States, might be called “government surprise.” It would begin as a government announces that it will not fund research that effects or is consequent on destruction of embryos. Then, after this policy has become widely known, the government suddenly announces—in the United States, we saw this happen on August 9, 2001—that in the future it will disperse public funds for studies using derivatives of embryos already then sacrificed. The most cogent philosophical defense of this gambit that occurs to me might be to say that the government had not, prior to the second announcement, induced any destruction of embryos. One would say this on the hypothesis that theretofore, the government had given everyone to believe that it would not support such research. (The hypothesis may not be true with respect to the recent history of US government policy. Between the first and second announcements came the just mentioned NIH announcement that it would fund research on embryonic derivatives. What I am here calling the first announcement was a prohibition enacted by Congress as a rider to an appropriations bill.\n\n【31】Pub. L. No. 104-99, Title I, §128, 110 Stat. 26, 34 (1996).\n\n【32】) But apart from this historical contingency, the government surprise scheme succumbs to the same objection that lodges against the two other schemes that I have just mentioned. The government surprise scheme would place those who participate in funded embryonic stem cell studies in the same boat with those who participate in nonfunded embryodestructive stem cell derivation.\n\n【33】### Denying That Clones Are Embryos\n\n【34】The last in my roster of arguments that do not work consists in the claim that somatic cell nuclear transfer performed in research is not cloning, and does not produce clones or embryos, this because a suggested new semantic regimen would withhold the term “cloning” from any instance of somatic cell nuclear transfer in research, would instead call the process “nuclear transplantation,” and would withhold “clone” and “embryo” from the products of that process.\n\n【35】For this context, I have elsewhere tried to sort out the relevant entities and events in a manner informed by biological and moral considerations. My analysis leads me to reject the proposed semantic regimen as to both process and products. The proposed terminology risks the appearance of trying to smuggle in a morally significant event— initiation of embryogenesis—by not mentioning it. In trying to withhold “cloning” and “clone” from processes and products of research, a proponent of the proposed terminology would contradict the ordinary and morally significant understanding of cloning as a genetic event, an event completed shortly after oocyte activation, regardless whether transfer to a uterus ensues. The goal that has motivated the proposed terminology, the goal of offering the public a sharp distinction between research and producing children, does not require legerdemain to attain. Rather we may implement a simple distinction, a distinction between “procreative cloning” and “nonprocreative cloning.” The distinction turns on a single observable event, intrauterine transfer.\n\n【36】The set of embryo subjects.\n\n【37】As for “embryo,” any being that is of a kind capable of developing into a neonate upon transfer to a uterus is an object of moral concern. We implicitly acknowledge that concern when we classify every prefetal developing organism as an embryo. (In both scientific writing and popular speech, we have abandoned the textbook definition according to which “embryo” applies only to a conceptus older than two weeks.) Recognition of a being as an embryo does not end our moral investigation. We may conclude—for reasons that I shall shortly present, I believe that we should conclude—that we are not obliged to treat every embryo in the same way. But in respect of a product of somatic cell nuclear transfer, recognizing its inclusion within a discussant's universe of moral concern is the place from which to begin our discussion with one who does not agree with us.\n\n【38】ARGUMENTS THAT WORK\n-------------------\n\n【39】### Argument from Nonenablement\n\n【40】To advance the proposition that embryonic stem cell research is virtuous if not obligatory, I have elsewhere presented an argument that I call “the argument from nonenablement.”\n\n【41】Morals and primordials.\n\n【42】I refer to an embryo that will never enter a uterus as an “unenabled” embryo. In the first instance, I have in mind a situation, which often arises with fertility patients, in which the one person in the world who, together with her partner, is empowered to decide about intrauterine transfer of an embryo formed from her oocyte decides that neither does she wish to have that embryo transferred unto her nor does she wish to give the embryo to anyone else for intrauterine transfer.\n\n【43】There is no moral view of which I know that asserts a duty of intrauterine embryo transfer. That is to say that there is no moral view that asserts that a woman lies under a duty to undergo a transfer unto her of an embryo that lies outside her. About such a procedure, we respect her autonomy. Imagine, therefore, that a woman declines intrauterine transfer, and in fact, forbids it. She, with her partner, donates to medicine either an embryo created during her fertility treatment, or an embryo that will be created by a scientist from their donated cells. Let us assume that this decision is final and that the embryo has left parental control. Such a donation to medicine I call an “epidosembryo.” I take this name from the Greek _epidosis_ for a citizen's great beneficence to the common weal. What Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie Mayo left to Minnesota, and to the world, was an _epidosis_ . So too may we describe a couple's gift to medicine of a life form that, were they to decide otherwise, could become their child.\n\n【44】A distinction obtains between the developmental potential of an embryo that lies in a petri dish and will remain there, and an embryo that lies in a uterus, however it got there. In consequence of parental instructions that an epidosembryo shall be used in research or therapy and shall not be transferred to a uterus, there does not obtain any morally significant chance that from such an embryo, an infant will develop. To put the matter in language that I owe to Hare,\n\n【45】Essays on Bioethics. Clarendon Press , Oxford, England 1993\n\n【46】no possible person corresponds to an epidosembryo. We also know, and this is purely empirical knowledge, that an embryo is not sentient. And that, for lack of a cortex, an embryo cannot form preferences. Nor can an embryo adopt ends. Therefore nothing that we might do to an epidosembryo can cause it discomfort or frustrate it. Under these circumstances, and when we consider the duty of mutual aid asserted within each of the leading moral views of our time, I claim that it is permissible to use some embryos, namely epidosembryos, in medicine.\n\n【47】As the preceding discussion makes clear, I rest the permissibility and virtuousness of epidosembryo use on the autonomous decisions of couples from whose cells such embryos originate. The moral analysis flows entirely from what it is that they decide. If it is permissible for those donations to be made, then it is permissible for recipient scientists to use epidosembryos as instructed.\n\n【48】Suppose that someone interjects that precisely because epidosembryos cannot form preferences, it is our obligation to act according to their advantage. I reply that we cannot promote any advantage of epidosembryos. Were we to refrain from using epidosembryos in research, we could not gain anything for them. Entry into the only environment by which they could attain birth has been forbidden by the only persons in the world empowered to decide on entry into that environment.\n\n【49】I also point out that the argument from nonenablement differs from an appeal to imminent death as a means of justifying a killing. Nonenablement precludes a conceptus from attaining any of the attributes—autonomy, ability to feel pain, preferences, and, according to the traditional Thomist-Aristotelian teaching of Christianity, the attainment of a soul—whose infringement makes killing wrong. Nonenablement entails that there does not even correspond to an epidosembryo a possible person. It is not that death is imminent, but that development is bounded.\n\n【50】### Replies to Objections\n\n【51】Let me now reply to a couple objections. The first objection asserts that the sacrifice of an embryo violates the second form of Kant's categorical imperative, the precept that we should treat “humanity … always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.”\n\n【52】*   Kant\n\n【53】Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals.\n\n【54】in: Gregor MJ The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant, Practical Philosophy. 4\\. Cambridge University Press , Cambridge, England 1996 : 429\n\n【55】(This, not the Declaration of Helsinki, is the origin of the requirement of informed consent.) In this formulation, by “humanity” Kant understands rational nature. For this reason, the objection misapprehends Kant's view, which applies only to rational beings. The second form of the categorical imperative does not apply to mentally incompetent adults, infants, or embryos. That is not to say that Kant would take a cavalier view of the helpless. Kant would analyze our moral obligations toward these nonrational human beings as he would analyze moral questions in general. (“Human being,” by the way, is not a decisive moral classification; the phrase obviously applies to any being of the species _Homo sapiens_ , including any somatic cell.) Kant would ask whether we could without contradiction of the will adopt as a universal law whatever maxim we propose about how we shall treat such a being. We do not contradict our will by adopting as a universal law that we shall use epidosembryos, at no cost in potential lives, to provide to those who suffer the aid that we would wish were we in their shoes.\n\n【56】A second objection is the simple declaration that a zygote is a person. The most influential version of that objection appears in the official teaching issued within the latter part of the twentieth century by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith of the Roman Catholic Church. The reasoning begins from the premise that all artificial methods of reproduction, including in vitro fertilization, are illicit. In adopting that stance, the magisterium anticipated a situation now upon us—a set of surplus embryos whose creators have effectively consigned them, as the magisterium puts it, to an “absurd fate.” Such embryos will either perish as waste or be frozen indefinitely, never entering a womb. So when the magisterium condemns embryo destruction, it speaks consistently. It condemns destruction of embryos in research just as it condemns artificial reproductive practices that inexorably lead to destruction of embryos as waste. Others who approve of in vitro fertilization as presently practiced but oppose use of embryos in research fall into inconsistency. They implicitly approve the destruction of surplus embryos as waste while condemning the use of surplus embryos to help others.\n\n【57】Although the official Catholic view cannot be accused of inconsistency in the foregoing respect, on what ground does that view rest? Why condemn the destruction of an unenabled embryo in research? As one studies the magisterial instructions and looks for arguments, one finds a single argument. The argument is not scriptural. The ancients did not understand fertilization or embryogenesis, and were not thinking of embryos in petri dishes. The argument purports to be biological. The argument is that because fertilization creates a new genome, fertilization creates a person.\n\n【58】Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. _Donum Vitae._ Vatican City; 1987.\n\n【59】This is an argument whose premise one must admit— the biology is correct, fertilization does produce a new genome—but whose conclusion does not follow. The argument presupposes a radical version of genetic reductionism. To say that a person is a genome is a view that even a materialist would not venture. It is a view contradicting the belief, held within the religious tradition from within which the argument is offered, that a person is a _corpore et anima unus_ , a union of body and soul. I imagine that one reason that many people have not heard this argument is that it cannot be maintained consistently with the rest of Christian teaching. I suspect that eventually the argument will fade.\n\n【60】Another interpretation of Catholicism might lay stress on the notion, also advanced by the magisterium, that because we do not know whether an embryo is a person, we should exercise caution, and act as if it were a person. But suppose that we could have a conversation with God. We would say that as of 1998, we discovered how to culture embryonic stem cells. We would explain that we have plans to relieve human suffering by the use of embryos that will never enter a womb. Is it plausible that He would tell us that He regards embryos that will never enter a womb as persons in the sense that He includes them in the universe of beings that He wishes us not to consume? I do not know of a tenable argument according to which an all-merciful and omniscient God would assert that preference. For He would know that unenabled embryos will never develop into infants. He would know that our efforts to aid actual lives would exact no cost in potential lives. Under these circumstances, there inexorably come to bear Christian social teachings, including the duty to love thy neighbor as thyself, and “the law of charity.”\n\n【61】Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. _Declarato de Abortu Procurato_ Vatican City; 1974.\n\n【62】### Cloning as a Special Case\n\n【63】You may have heard some people say that the justification of embryonic stem cell research lies in the circumstance that the embryo donors initially intended procreation when they created the embryos now regarded as surplus. The argument from nonenablement does not rely on any assumption of initial procreative intent. Hence the argument from nonenablement justifies not only embryonic stem cell research, but nonprocreative cloning.\n\n【64】An objection peculiar to cloning might be this. An oocyte is created for a purpose, namely to issue in offspring, and it is wrong to divert an oocyte to any other purpose. This objection rests on an Aristotelian teleology that, since Darwin, does not exert much grip on our thought. We have learned from the history of medicine how mistaken we humans have often been in inferring purposes of various cells and structures of the human body. Our forbears would have said that bones are what hold us up; today we think of the marrow as a blood factory, and think it entirely appropriate to transfer marrow from one patient to another. We have learned the remarkable adaptability of tissues and cells. We now actively engage in directing tissues and cells to serve chosen purposes in aid of sick patients, calling this treatment “conventional” drug therapy. It is unpersuasive to say that an oocyte can or should serve only one purpose.\n\n【65】From a religious point of view—and the teleological objection that I have just described now finds its greatest support in religious traditions—the ultimate arbiter is divine will. Imagine again that we could have a conversation with God. Would He say that oocytes may serve only the purpose of procreation? This rule would seem harsh inasmuch as we should have to measure its implementation in suffering unrelieved. It would also seem puzzling insofar as every human female possesses from birth a quarter million or more immature oocytes.\n\n【66】That is all that I shall say here about the argument from nonenablement in general. I shall say a bit more about procreative cloning, the baggage of which those waiting to do nonprocreative cloning in research would like to rid themselves. About procreative cloning, we have developed a social consensus. We know from animal studies that the odds of producing healthy offspring in mammalian procreative cloning are so dismal that it would be irresponsible to attempt it in humans.\n\n【67】We have heard a considerable stir about legislating that consensus. I should only like to point out that the need for legislation is probably illusory. A couple years ago, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dispatched a two-page letter to fertility clinicians and to others known to have an appetite for procreative cloning. The letter declared that, first, if anyone wishes to attempt human procreative cloning, they must file an investigational drug application, and second, if anyone files such an application, the FDA will deny it. This letter evidently scared the daylights out of even mavericks. You will notice that those reported by the press to be attempting cloning are not attempting it within the United States. In consequence, there seems no need for legislation duplicating the FDA's interdiction.\n\n【68】I mention this because concern abounds that legislators, in their zeal to appear vigilant to their constituents, will sweep valuable research within the maw of a prohibition. That would be a shame when the likely incidence of procreative cloning seems nil. In a book that I am writing on the morality of new uses of embryos, I am studying a number of situations in which, so it has been suggested, people might resort to cloning as a means of having children. Among prospective parents usually imagined for the procedure are carriers of alleles for recessive diseases and those affected by them, infertile couples, homosexual couples, and others. I have concluded that cloning will seldom be a first choice. A more likely choice will be in vitro fertilization followed by prenatal genetic diagnosis as a screening technique. Germ line intervention would also draw interest when it is feasible. Perhaps someday we shall even see the use of artificial chromosomes. Cloning does not offer the flexibility, safety, and other advantages of such alternatives.\n\n【69】Still there will arise objections to procreative cloning when the day comes, if it does, that the procedure is as safe as natural conception. One objection will be that the motivation of people who want to clone is a kind of unworthy narcissism. To this I reply that if narcissism motivates some instances of asexual reproduction, it may motivate many more instances of natural reproduction. Perhaps we ought to shelve that objection.\n\n【70】There also abounds the prediction that a clone will undergo an identity crisis. As the scenario goes, a clone's knowledge that it shares the nuclear genome of a source will so burden the clone that the clone will not understand that he or she is a distinct person. I find this objection implausible. In a typical case, a clone will be about 25 years or more younger than the source, will grow up in a different environment, will meet different people, will have different experiences, and so forth.\n\n【71】We also hear speculation that asexual reproduction will threaten the nuclear family, and even that copying genomes by cloning will adversely affect the gene pool. Both eventualities seem improbable, the latter highly improbable unless the incidence of cloning becomes very high. In any case, we can respond to all these speculations by saying that if the day arrives that cloning is safe, we should revisit the question of its propriety. At that time, anyone proposing a governmental prohibition of cloning will need to explain why, if every other method of reproduction is private, this one should not be.\n\n【72】### Minimizing Risk of Abuses\n\n【73】I would like to close with some thoughts about minimizing the risk of abuses. I first mention how we learn about such risks. We did not learn about the risks of recombinant DNA research, germ line intervention, or embryonic stem cell research and cloning from moralists hovering about scientific laboratories. We learned about those risks from the scientists who made the enabling discoveries. They and their colleagues in each case envisioned what might come of their discoveries, and acted promptly to bring before the public the question whether it would be moral to proceed. We should give credit to these scientists for their welltuned moral barometers.\n\n【74】For the present task, we ought first to define the sorts of research in which donated embryos would be eligible subjects. We, most of us, I suspect, would be appalled if human embryos were used—as were animals in studies of which we learned not so long ago—in testing industrial chemicals or cosmetics. Hence we may stipulate—and the concept of epidosembryo embeds this condition—that only in humanitarian work may one consume a human embryo. Only epidosembryos, in other words, may be subjects.\n\n【75】We would also sensibly prohibit ectogenesis. That is, we would prohibit the development of an embryo in the laboratory beyond some specified number of days. British law prohibits development of an embryo beyond day 14.\n\n【76】Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 ch. 37, §3(3)(a).\n\n【77】Some have taken the laying down of the primitive streak as the first stage in the development of a nervous system. But the nonindividuation objection has become the most influential reason for adopting day 14 as a boundary. The demise of the nonindividuation objection would explode that rationale. Still we shall have to set some boundary if we wish to preclude ectogenesis. As Bernard Williams once remarked, it is not uniquely reasonable that we draw a line at fourteen days, but it is reasonable that we draw it.\n\n【78】Types of moral argument against embryo research.\n\n【79】in: Ciba Foundation Bock G O'Connor M Human Embryo Research: Yes or No? Tavistock , London, England 1986 : 190\n\n【80】There looms a risk of abuse in obtaining oocytes for use in cloning. Research might create an aggregate demand for substantial numbers of oocytes. This, it has been said, might lead to the exploitation of women. If asked, a circumspect scientist will say that science should use only the fruits of fully voluntary donations by women who want to help others. On the other hand, one could present a libertarian argument that a woman should be permitted to donate oocytes, and to receive compensation, as she wishes. If that practice were to become widespread, concern would understandably arise about ushering in the commodification of oocytes. I suggest that if we eventually elect to allow a market in this or other human body parts, we regulate the market. We may seek mechanisms to balance, on the one hand, protections against induced self-damaging acts, and, on the other, demand for subjects with which to conduct humanitarian research and therapy. One technological innovation that could greatly relieve any tension here consists in the production of oocytes by induced differentiation of embryonic stem cells.\n\n【81】We also have to decide whether to allow patents on embryos. A product of somatic cell nuclear transfer may well be new, useful, and nonobvious, and not be a product of nature, in which case it will meet the criteria for the award of a patent. But think what that would mean. A patent on a method of forming a clone would cause a human conception or birth to be assailable as a patent infringement. That would be a perverse result. The result already looms by dint of patents on DNA sequences, a subject unto itself.\n\n【82】Norms for patents concerning human and other life forms.\n\n【83】I observe here that in the case of both DNA and embryo patents, we can avoid untoward results by introducing a simple rule. Each country could amend its patent laws to say that “No claim of infringement shall lie against a parent or child as such.” This provision would leave commercial patent owners free to pursue each other on claims of infringement, but would render parents and children immune from claims of infringement in their capacities as such.\n\n【84】Any new technology poses some risk of abuse. It would be misleading to suggest that the risks of abuse in the case of embryo use are insubstantial. No one could claim to know that. But it would be uncaring of us to neglect the humanitarian work of which we are capable within the protective constraints that we have the power to impose. Given our prospects of relieving suffering in actual lives at no cost in potential lives, we have a duty to act. I leave you with the thought that the case for this conclusion, the argument from nonenablement, is a consensus argument. It commands assent across a wide range of moral views. It beckons us to recognize that sometimes we are called upon to derive good from bad.

The philosopher Richard Hare once said, “I like to give arguments for my position. They come in handy when people don't agree with me.” Consider then the inclination of many among us—perhaps by virtue of being busy, or for other reasons—to pronounce a verdict, when a moral controversy comes along, by consulting aphorisms or slogans. By following this inclination, earnest people may unwittingly betray the moral views that they aspire to uphold. For they may fail to take account of the depth and subtlety of their respective moral views.\n\n【1】I should like to discuss arguments offered in support of using human embryos in research and therapy. I plan to survey both arguments that work and arguments that do not. I shall first review six arguments that I place in the latter category. Each of these purports to justify research that I happen to support. But inasmuch as a good case is not made better by overstatement, and no case is made by an unsound argument, I am going to disavow those six arguments. I urge other supporters of donated embryo use to disavow them as well, because, as Bernard Williams once said, openness to criticism is the homage that candor pays to truth. To support my own view, I shall go on to sketch arguments that, so I shall suggest, are sound. I shall then say a bit more about cloning in particular, and shall close by remarking on the risk of abuses.\n\n【2】ARGUMENTS THAT DO NOT WORK\n--------------------------\n\n【3】### Imminent Death as Justification for Killing\n\n【4】Consider the argument that the imminent death of an embryo—for instance, a surplus embryo in a fertility clinic—justifies its consumption in research. A more extreme proposal, recently offered by Frederick Grinnell, would have us define a concept of embryo death according to which embryos not destined for intrauterine transfer are dead. This concept of death seems to defy common sense. The embryos that I contemplate as research subjects are alive. About this concept of death I doubt that it is necessary to say anything more.\n\n【5】Let us consider the plain argument that imminent death of an admittedly living embryo justifies killing it in research. In refutation of that argument, consider the following Wild West example. One day the notorious varmint Hatfield is riding about on his horse. Feeling tired, Hatfield elects to dismount beside the railroad tracks. He sits down, and eventually dozes off, stretching out across the tracks. Sometime later, as Hatfield lies sound asleep astride the tracks, a train approaches at high speed. Whereupon there happens to ride onto the scene Hatfield's archenemy, McCoy. Spotting Hatfield, McCoy gallops to the tracks, dismounts, and—just in the nick of time before the train arrives—yanks Hatfield from the tracks. McCoy then immediately pulls out his rifle, trains it on Hatfield, and kills Hatfield. In this case, even though Hatfield would have died under the wheels of the train a split second earlier, we hold McCoy guilty of wrongful killing. In general, the imminent death of a victim does not justify its killing. Embryo research will not be justifiable solely on the ground of imminent embryo death.\n\n【6】### Nonindividuation Objection to Zygotic Personhood\n\n【7】The nonindividuation objection to zygotic personhood runs as follows. Prior to formation of an embryo's primitive streak at day 14 of development, it can happen that the embryo splits into monozygotic twins. And if twinning occurs, the twins can fuse. Hence it has been suggested that in respect of any embryo, one cannot say until day 14 whether there exists one individual or more. If one cannot say how many persons exist, it is untenable to say that any person exists. Another version of the nonindividuation objection begins from the premise that in twinning, an embryo vanishes and leaves no earthly remains. How could an individual person die leaving no earthly remains? If no corpse ever exists, there could not earlier have existed a person.\n\n【8】Thus does the nonindividuation objection characterize zygotic personhood as metaphysically impossible. The objection's biological sophistication has led many scientists to regard it as a clinching argument for embryo use. Despite that sophistication, the nonindividuation objection is susceptible to the following refutation owed to David Oderberg.\n\n【9】Modal properties, moral status, and identity.\n\n【10】Suppose at time _t_ <sub>0 </sub> a somatic cell _x_ . By _t_ <sub>1 </sub> , _x_ has divided, and there exist _x_ ’s daughter cells _d_ <sub>1 </sub> and _d_ <sub>2 </sub> . The process by which this has occurred, namely, mitosis, is routine. Notice that as we look back at the history of _x_ up to _t_ <sub>1 </sub> , we do not have any doubt that _x_ was an individual cell. Plainly _x_ had the capability of dividing, and in fact, _x_ did divide, but it is not incoherent to say, and we unhesitatingly do say, that for so long as _x_ existed, _x_ was an individual. As for the apparent puzzle of dying without leaving earthly remains, again a reflection on mitosis sheds light. Necrosis is not the only means by which a life form may cease to exist. Dividing is another means. And it happens that after division, there is no corpse. So it is not metaphysically incoherent to say that an embryo capable of dividing is an individual. Or that an embryo that does divide was an individual before it divided.\n\n【11】To rehabilitate the nonindividuation objection, a proponent might contend that indivisibility is somehow intrinsic to the individuality of a person as it may not be to the individuality of a cell, so that a being that is divisible cannot be or correspond to a person. To buttress this claim, the proponent might offer the example that an adult individual cannot divide into surviving individuals. Or the proponent might contend that even if adult individual _x_ could be split into surviving individuals—say, by a brain split and transplant operation in which, as imagined by philosophers of mind, _x_ ’s brain is split and each half is transferred into a new body so that each successor retains memories and otherwise achieves psychological continuity with _x_ —it would not be the case that _x_ is the same individual as either of its successors. One reply to this, owed to the whimsy of Peter King, is that it is possible to survive with only half a brain, though in such case one is restricted to a career in politics. But we may leave aside what adults can do.\n\n【12】We may reply to the proponent of the nonindividuation objection with two thoughts. First, what is feasible for an adult ought not constrain our thinking, because we know of the remarkable ability of an early embryo to split into surviving individuals. Second, the individuality of a being does not depend on its being the same individual, if it happens to split, as any of its successors. When an embryo has split, we may simply say that it was one individual until it split, that the individual ceased to exist when it split, and that two individuals have succeeded it. Thus may we render not only the possibility but the actuality of twinning consistent with individuality of the original embryo and with individuality of its twin successors. Given that the case of an embryo that does split resolves in this way, no impediment arises to individuality of an embryo that has not split.\n\n【13】According to this analysis, the nonindividuation objection fails to establish that an embryo cannot be a person. When monozygotic twinning occurs, it may be said that two persons succeed one person that ceases. But even if we defeat the contention that an embryo cannot be a person, there remains the question whether, for purposes of the duty not to kill, we should treat every embryo as a person. That a being “is a person” is not an empirical observation or an _a priori_ truth. Calling a being a person is a shorthand reply to the moral question, “How should we treat it for this purpose?” The shorthand signifies our conclusion that we should classify the being among those to whom we think all of us should accord a particular treatment. Whereupon we may fairly be asked what argument supports that conclusion. Failure of the nonindividuation objection leaves the door open to introduce, or oppose, arguments that we are obliged to treat all embryos as persons for purposes of the duty not to kill.\n\n【14】### The Utilitarian Defense of Embryo Use\n\n【15】Utilitarianism commands us to maximize aggregate preference satisfaction for the universe of affected sentient beings. A familiar argument is that if, in regenerative medicine, we sacrifice a relatively small number of embryos in order to help millions, perhaps billions, of suffering people, we can achieve higher aggregate preference satisfaction than we would achieve were we to classify every embryo as a person for purposes of the duty not to kill.\n\n【16】John Stuart Mill, who with Bentham brought utilitarianism to prominence, learned calculus at the age of five, but Mill did not envision the mathematical defect of his moral theory. The infirmity came to light through the work of economists in the twentieth century. Consider that the number of affected sentient beings in respect of many policy issues, embryo use among them, is enormous. Collecting utility data from so many people would be a monumental task. A more fundamental failing is that there obtains no method of measuring utility. Utilitarianism presupposes a utility function for each member of the set of affected beings. A utility function is nowadays understood as a real-valued order homomorphism representing a transitive and connected binary relation defined by an individual on a set of alternatives. This understanding no doubt explains why many scientists have felt comfortable with utilitarianism and with a utilitarian defense of embryo research. Utilitarianism seems empirical, quantitative, precise. For physician scientists, utilitarianism evokes some of the thinking to which outcome studies, comparing benefits and costs, have accustomed them.\n\n【17】But if, for two or more individuals, a utilitarian seeks to sum the utilities of a given alternative, there obtains no common unit of measure. Indeed there does not exist a standard measure even for a single person. While it is easy to define, as a representation of an individual's positioning of alternatives, a real-valued order homomorphism, any of infinitely many other functions formed by affine transformations from that order homomorphism will also represent the positioning.\n\n【18】Though the problem of interpersonal incommensurability of utilities remains unsolved, on many occasions a utilitarian's audience either will be unaware of the problem, or willing to overlook it. For example, if a hospital were to propose construction of a new facility, and if that project would require demolition of the homes of 100 people, displacing those residents in exchange for reimbursement of their homes’ fair market value and their moving expenses, a utilitarian might argue that future gains in utility produced by the project for perhaps hundreds of thousands of patients in future decades will exceed the disutility of the 100 who must presently relocate. Listeners will follow an argument such as this without worrying much about whether the utility calculation has been performed. For it may seem in such a case that for any plausible conversion ratio of units of measure, the comparison of utility between alternatives will be lopsided.\n\n【19】On the other hand, if an advocated alternative is the killing of a life form that some people sincerely believe to be a person, not much tolerance will be found for an argument whose proponents cannot produce the calculation on which the argument purportedly rests. The root of the difficulty is the same as in the blinkered attempt to order, on the basis of supposed measures of quality, incommensurable college football teams.\n\n【20】### Appeal to “Fact-based Reasoning” Alone\n\n【21】The next argument, also not infrequently invoked by scientists, proceeds by asserting that public advocacy concerning embryo use should appeal to “fact-based reasoning” alone, and that it therefore follows that objections resting on any other ground must give way to the progress of biomedical science. This argument serves as a euphemism for saying that appeals to religion and various “insular” moral views do not have a place in public debate about science. In reply, we must observe that the view that scientific work grounded in fact-based reasoning should go forward without obstruction by moral views is itself a moral view. When an objection lies on grounds of wrongful killing, it is neither appropriate nor feasible to oust religion or moral views from the conversation. Of course we all agree that we should rest on facts as opposed to errors, but given facts, a normative discussion awaits.\n\n【22】A more sophisticated cousin of the foregoing argument, the call to “public reason” of John Rawls, would have us employ in public discourse only premises that others could not reasonably reject.\n\n<mark>【23】Political Liberalism. Columbia University Press , New York, NY 1993</mark>\n\n【24】That, in a moment, is what I shall try to do in stating my own view.\n\n【25】### Noncomplicity Defenses\n\n【26】It has been suggested that even if the consumption of embryos in research is wrong, a government could support derivative research by eschewing complicity in the destruction of embryos. As it has been put by proponents of this move, one could distinguish between embryonic stem cell derivation and embryonic stem cell use. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) at one time adopted this view.\n\n【27】65 Fed. Reg. 51976-51981 (2000).\n\n【28】It announced that it would fund projects classified as embryonic stem cell use. The notion seemed to be that this would avoid complicity in wrongful embryo-destructive derivation of stem cells.\n\n【29】In another scheme for purportedly conducting embryo research without complicity in embryo killing, fertility clinicians would perform the immunosurgery by which embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos. This scheme is probably impractical, because fertility clinicians do not do that kind of work. They do not customarily derive cell lines from embryos; they customarily nurture and transfer embryos so as to achieve pregnancies. Even if the scheme were practical, it shares with the derivation-use distinction the problem that when a chain of supply runs from someone who sacrifices an embryo to someone who experiments with the sacrificed embryo's derivatives, we seem compelled to say from a moral point of view that the source and the recipient ride in the same boat. It is untenable to say that the experimenter is not complicit in the work of the supplier.\n\n【30】Another noncomplicity strategy, recently played out in the United States, might be called “government surprise.” It would begin as a government announces that it will not fund research that effects or is consequent on destruction of embryos. Then, after this policy has become widely known, the government suddenly announces—in the United States, we saw this happen on August 9, 2001—that in the future it will disperse public funds for studies using derivatives of embryos already then sacrificed. The most cogent philosophical defense of this gambit that occurs to me might be to say that the government had not, prior to the second announcement, induced any destruction of embryos. One would say this on the hypothesis that theretofore, the government had given everyone to believe that it would not support such research. (The hypothesis may not be true with respect to the recent history of US government policy. Between the first and second announcements came the just mentioned NIH announcement that it would fund research on embryonic derivatives. What I am here calling the first announcement was a prohibition enacted by Congress as a rider to an appropriations bill.\n\n【31】Pub. L. No. 104-99, Title I, §128, 110 Stat. 26, 34 (1996).\n\n【32】) But apart from this historical contingency, the government surprise scheme succumbs to the same objection that lodges against the two other schemes that I have just mentioned. The government surprise scheme would place those who participate in funded embryonic stem cell studies in the same boat with those who participate in nonfunded embryodestructive stem cell derivation.\n\n【33】### Denying That Clones Are Embryos\n\n【34】The last in my roster of arguments that do not work consists in the claim that somatic cell nuclear transfer performed in research is not cloning, and does not produce clones or embryos, this because a suggested new semantic regimen would withhold the term “cloning” from any instance of somatic cell nuclear transfer in research, would instead call the process “nuclear transplantation,” and would withhold “clone” and “embryo” from the products of that process.\n\n【35】For this context, I have elsewhere tried to sort out the relevant entities and events in a manner informed by biological and moral considerations. My analysis leads me to reject the proposed semantic regimen as to both process and products. The proposed terminology risks the appearance of trying to smuggle in a morally significant event— initiation of embryogenesis—by not mentioning it. In trying to withhold “cloning” and “clone” from processes and products of research, a proponent of the proposed terminology would contradict the ordinary and morally significant understanding of cloning as a genetic event, an event completed shortly after oocyte activation, regardless whether transfer to a uterus ensues. The goal that has motivated the proposed terminology, the goal of offering the public a sharp distinction between research and producing children, does not require legerdemain to attain. Rather we may implement a simple distinction, a distinction between “procreative cloning” and “nonprocreative cloning.” The distinction turns on a single observable event, intrauterine transfer.\n\n【36】The set of embryo subjects.\n\n【37】As for “embryo,” any being that is of a kind capable of developing into a neonate upon transfer to a uterus is an object of moral concern. We implicitly acknowledge that concern when we classify every prefetal developing organism as an embryo. (In both scientific writing and popular speech, we have abandoned the textbook definition according to which “embryo” applies only to a conceptus older than two weeks.) Recognition of a being as an embryo does not end our moral investigation. We may conclude—for reasons that I shall shortly present, I believe that we should conclude—that we are not obliged to treat every embryo in the same way. But in respect of a product of somatic cell nuclear transfer, recognizing its inclusion within a discussant's universe of moral concern is the place from which to begin our discussion with one who does not agree with us.\n\n【38】ARGUMENTS THAT WORK\n-------------------\n\n【39】### Argument from Nonenablement\n\n【40】To advance the proposition that embryonic stem cell research is virtuous if not obligatory, I have elsewhere presented an argument that I call “the argument from nonenablement.”\n\n【41】Morals and primordials.\n\n【42】I refer to an embryo that will never enter a uterus as an “unenabled” embryo. In the first instance, I have in mind a situation, which often arises with fertility patients, in which the one person in the world who, together with her partner, is empowered to decide about intrauterine transfer of an embryo formed from her oocyte decides that neither does she wish to have that embryo transferred unto her nor does she wish to give the embryo to anyone else for intrauterine transfer.\n\n【43】There is no moral view of which I know that asserts a duty of intrauterine embryo transfer. That is to say that there is no moral view that asserts that a woman lies under a duty to undergo a transfer unto her of an embryo that lies outside her. About such a procedure, we respect her autonomy. Imagine, therefore, that a woman declines intrauterine transfer, and in fact, forbids it. She, with her partner, donates to medicine either an embryo created during her fertility treatment, or an embryo that will be created by a scientist from their donated cells. Let us assume that this decision is final and that the embryo has left parental control. Such a donation to medicine I call an “epidosembryo.” I take this name from the Greek _epidosis_ for a citizen's great beneficence to the common weal. What Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie Mayo left to Minnesota, and to the world, was an _epidosis_ . So too may we describe a couple's gift to medicine of a life form that, were they to decide otherwise, could become their child.\n\n【44】A distinction obtains between the developmental potential of an embryo that lies in a petri dish and will remain there, and an embryo that lies in a uterus, however it got there. In consequence of parental instructions that an epidosembryo shall be used in research or therapy and shall not be transferred to a uterus, there does not obtain any morally significant chance that from such an embryo, an infant will develop. To put the matter in language that I owe to Hare,\n\n【45】Essays on Bioethics. Clarendon Press , Oxford, England 1993\n\n【46】no possible person corresponds to an epidosembryo. We also know, and this is purely empirical knowledge, that an embryo is not sentient. And that, for lack of a cortex, an embryo cannot form preferences. Nor can an embryo adopt ends. Therefore nothing that we might do to an epidosembryo can cause it discomfort or frustrate it. Under these circumstances, and when we consider the duty of mutual aid asserted within each of the leading moral views of our time, I claim that it is permissible to use some embryos, namely epidosembryos, in medicine.\n\n【47】As the preceding discussion makes clear, I rest the permissibility and virtuousness of epidosembryo use on the autonomous decisions of couples from whose cells such embryos originate. The moral analysis flows entirely from what it is that they decide. If it is permissible for those donations to be made, then it is permissible for recipient scientists to use epidosembryos as instructed.\n\n【48】Suppose that someone interjects that precisely because epidosembryos cannot form preferences, it is our obligation to act according to their advantage. I reply that we cannot promote any advantage of epidosembryos. Were we to refrain from using epidosembryos in research, we could not gain anything for them. Entry into the only environment by which they could attain birth has been forbidden by the only persons in the world empowered to decide on entry into that environment.\n\n【49】I also point out that the argument from nonenablement differs from an appeal to imminent death as a means of justifying a killing. Nonenablement precludes a conceptus from attaining any of the attributes—autonomy, ability to feel pain, preferences, and, according to the traditional Thomist-Aristotelian teaching of Christianity, the attainment of a soul—whose infringement makes killing wrong. Nonenablement entails that there does not even correspond to an epidosembryo a possible person. It is not that death is imminent, but that development is bounded.\n\n【50】### Replies to Objections\n\n【51】Let me now reply to a couple objections. The first objection asserts that the sacrifice of an embryo violates the second form of Kant's categorical imperative, the precept that we should treat “humanity … always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.”\n\n【52】*   Kant\n\n【53】Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals.\n\n【54】in: Gregor MJ The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant, Practical Philosophy. 4\\. Cambridge University Press , Cambridge, England 1996 : 429\n\n【55】(This, not the Declaration of Helsinki, is the origin of the requirement of informed consent.) In this formulation, by “humanity” Kant understands rational nature. For this reason, the objection misapprehends Kant's view, which applies only to rational beings. The second form of the categorical imperative does not apply to mentally incompetent adults, infants, or embryos. That is not to say that Kant would take a cavalier view of the helpless. Kant would analyze our moral obligations toward these nonrational human beings as he would analyze moral questions in general. (“Human being,” by the way, is not a decisive moral classification; the phrase obviously applies to any being of the species _Homo sapiens_ , including any somatic cell.) Kant would ask whether we could without contradiction of the will adopt as a universal law whatever maxim we propose about how we shall treat such a being. We do not contradict our will by adopting as a universal law that we shall use epidosembryos, at no cost in potential lives, to provide to those who suffer the aid that we would wish were we in their shoes.\n\n【56】A second objection is the simple declaration that a zygote is a person. The most influential version of that objection appears in the official teaching issued within the latter part of the twentieth century by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith of the Roman Catholic Church. The reasoning begins from the premise that all artificial methods of reproduction, including in vitro fertilization, are illicit. In adopting that stance, the magisterium anticipated a situation now upon us—a set of surplus embryos whose creators have effectively consigned them, as the magisterium puts it, to an “absurd fate.” Such embryos will either perish as waste or be frozen indefinitely, never entering a womb. So when the magisterium condemns embryo destruction, it speaks consistently. It condemns destruction of embryos in research just as it condemns artificial reproductive practices that inexorably lead to destruction of embryos as waste. Others who approve of in vitro fertilization as presently practiced but oppose use of embryos in research fall into inconsistency. They implicitly approve the destruction of surplus embryos as waste while condemning the use of surplus embryos to help others.\n\n【57】Although the official Catholic view cannot be accused of inconsistency in the foregoing respect, on what ground does that view rest? Why condemn the destruction of an unenabled embryo in research? As one studies the magisterial instructions and looks for arguments, one finds a single argument. The argument is not scriptural. The ancients did not understand fertilization or embryogenesis, and were not thinking of embryos in petri dishes. The argument purports to be biological. The argument is that because fertilization creates a new genome, fertilization creates a person.\n\n【58】Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. _Donum Vitae._ Vatican City; 1987.\n\n【59】This is an argument whose premise one must admit— the biology is correct, fertilization does produce a new genome—but whose conclusion does not follow. The argument presupposes a radical version of genetic reductionism. To say that a person is a genome is a view that even a materialist would not venture. It is a view contradicting the belief, held within the religious tradition from within which the argument is offered, that a person is a _corpore et anima unus_ , a union of body and soul. I imagine that one reason that many people have not heard this argument is that it cannot be maintained consistently with the rest of Christian teaching. I suspect that eventually the argument will fade.\n\n【60】Another interpretation of Catholicism might lay stress on the notion, also advanced by the magisterium, that because we do not know whether an embryo is a person, we should exercise caution, and act as if it were a person. But suppose that we could have a conversation with God. We would say that as of 1998, we discovered how to culture embryonic stem cells. We would explain that we have plans to relieve human suffering by the use of embryos that will never enter a womb. Is it plausible that He would tell us that He regards embryos that will never enter a womb as persons in the sense that He includes them in the universe of beings that He wishes us not to consume? I do not know of a tenable argument according to which an all-merciful and omniscient God would assert that preference. For He would know that unenabled embryos will never develop into infants. He would know that our efforts to aid actual lives would exact no cost in potential lives. Under these circumstances, there inexorably come to bear Christian social teachings, including the duty to love thy neighbor as thyself, and “the law of charity.”\n\n【61】Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. _Declarato de Abortu Procurato_ Vatican City; 1974.\n\n【62】### Cloning as a Special Case\n\n【63】You may have heard some people say that the justification of embryonic stem cell research lies in the circumstance that the embryo donors initially intended procreation when they created the embryos now regarded as surplus. The argument from nonenablement does not rely on any assumption of initial procreative intent. Hence the argument from nonenablement justifies not only embryonic stem cell research, but nonprocreative cloning.\n\n【64】An objection peculiar to cloning might be this. An oocyte is created for a purpose, namely to issue in offspring, and it is wrong to divert an oocyte to any other purpose. This objection rests on an Aristotelian teleology that, since Darwin, does not exert much grip on our thought. We have learned from the history of medicine how mistaken we humans have often been in inferring purposes of various cells and structures of the human body. Our forbears would have said that bones are what hold us up; today we think of the marrow as a blood factory, and think it entirely appropriate to transfer marrow from one patient to another. We have learned the remarkable adaptability of tissues and cells. We now actively engage in directing tissues and cells to serve chosen purposes in aid of sick patients, calling this treatment “conventional” drug therapy. It is unpersuasive to say that an oocyte can or should serve only one purpose.\n\n【65】From a religious point of view—and the teleological objection that I have just described now finds its greatest support in religious traditions—the ultimate arbiter is divine will. Imagine again that we could have a conversation with God. Would He say that oocytes may serve only the purpose of procreation? This rule would seem harsh inasmuch as we should have to measure its implementation in suffering unrelieved. It would also seem puzzling insofar as every human female possesses from birth a quarter million or more immature oocytes.\n\n【66】That is all that I shall say here about the argument from nonenablement in general. I shall say a bit more about procreative cloning, the baggage of which those waiting to do nonprocreative cloning in research would like to rid themselves. About procreative cloning, we have developed a social consensus. We know from animal studies that the odds of producing healthy offspring in mammalian procreative cloning are so dismal that it would be irresponsible to attempt it in humans.\n\n【67】We have heard a considerable stir about legislating that consensus. I should only like to point out that the need for legislation is probably illusory. A couple years ago, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dispatched a two-page letter to fertility clinicians and to others known to have an appetite for procreative cloning. The letter declared that, first, if anyone wishes to attempt human procreative cloning, they must file an investigational drug application, and second, if anyone files such an application, the FDA will deny it. This letter evidently scared the daylights out of even mavericks. You will notice that those reported by the press to be attempting cloning are not attempting it within the United States. In consequence, there seems no need for legislation duplicating the FDA's interdiction.\n\n【68】I mention this because concern abounds that legislators, in their zeal to appear vigilant to their constituents, will sweep valuable research within the maw of a prohibition. That would be a shame when the likely incidence of procreative cloning seems nil. In a book that I am writing on the morality of new uses of embryos, I am studying a number of situations in which, so it has been suggested, people might resort to cloning as a means of having children. Among prospective parents usually imagined for the procedure are carriers of alleles for recessive diseases and those affected by them, infertile couples, homosexual couples, and others. I have concluded that cloning will seldom be a first choice. A more likely choice will be in vitro fertilization followed by prenatal genetic diagnosis as a screening technique. Germ line intervention would also draw interest when it is feasible. Perhaps someday we shall even see the use of artificial chromosomes. Cloning does not offer the flexibility, safety, and other advantages of such alternatives.\n\n【69】Still there will arise objections to procreative cloning when the day comes, if it does, that the procedure is as safe as natural conception. One objection will be that the motivation of people who want to clone is a kind of unworthy narcissism. To this I reply that if narcissism motivates some instances of asexual reproduction, it may motivate many more instances of natural reproduction. Perhaps we ought to shelve that objection.\n\n【70】There also abounds the prediction that a clone will undergo an identity crisis. As the scenario goes, a clone's knowledge that it shares the nuclear genome of a source will so burden the clone that the clone will not understand that he or she is a distinct person. I find this objection implausible. In a typical case, a clone will be about 25 years or more younger than the source, will grow up in a different environment, will meet different people, will have different experiences, and so forth.\n\n【71】We also hear speculation that asexual reproduction will threaten the nuclear family, and even that copying genomes by cloning will adversely affect the gene pool. Both eventualities seem improbable, the latter highly improbable unless the incidence of cloning becomes very high. In any case, we can respond to all these speculations by saying that if the day arrives that cloning is safe, we should revisit the question of its propriety. At that time, anyone proposing a governmental prohibition of cloning will need to explain why, if every other method of reproduction is private, this one should not be.\n\n【72】### Minimizing Risk of Abuses\n\n【73】I would like to close with some thoughts about minimizing the risk of abuses. I first mention how we learn about such risks. We did not learn about the risks of recombinant DNA research, germ line intervention, or embryonic stem cell research and cloning from moralists hovering about scientific laboratories. We learned about those risks from the scientists who made the enabling discoveries. They and their colleagues in each case envisioned what might come of their discoveries, and acted promptly to bring before the public the question whether it would be moral to proceed. We should give credit to these scientists for their welltuned moral barometers.\n\n【74】For the present task, we ought first to define the sorts of research in which donated embryos would be eligible subjects. We, most of us, I suspect, would be appalled if human embryos were used—as were animals in studies of which we learned not so long ago—in testing industrial chemicals or cosmetics. Hence we may stipulate—and the concept of epidosembryo embeds this condition—that only in humanitarian work may one consume a human embryo. Only epidosembryos, in other words, may be subjects.\n\n【75】We would also sensibly prohibit ectogenesis. That is, we would prohibit the development of an embryo in the laboratory beyond some specified number of days. British law prohibits development of an embryo beyond day 14.\n\n【76】Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 ch. 37, §3(3)(a).\n\n【77】Some have taken the laying down of the primitive streak as the first stage in the development of a nervous system. But the nonindividuation objection has become the most influential reason for adopting day 14 as a boundary. The demise of the nonindividuation objection would explode that rationale. Still we shall have to set some boundary if we wish to preclude ectogenesis. As Bernard Williams once remarked, it is not uniquely reasonable that we draw a line at fourteen days, but it is reasonable that we draw it.\n\n【78】Types of moral argument against embryo research.\n\n【79】in: Ciba Foundation Bock G O'Connor M Human Embryo Research: Yes or No? Tavistock , London, England 1986 : 190\n\n【80】There looms a risk of abuse in obtaining oocytes for use in cloning. Research might create an aggregate demand for substantial numbers of oocytes. This, it has been said, might lead to the exploitation of women. If asked, a circumspect scientist will say that science should use only the fruits of fully voluntary donations by women who want to help others. On the other hand, one could present a libertarian argument that a woman should be permitted to donate oocytes, and to receive compensation, as she wishes. If that practice were to become widespread, concern would understandably arise about ushering in the commodification of oocytes. I suggest that if we eventually elect to allow a market in this or other human body parts, we regulate the market. We may seek mechanisms to balance, on the one hand, protections against induced self-damaging acts, and, on the other, demand for subjects with which to conduct humanitarian research and therapy. One technological innovation that could greatly relieve any tension here consists in the production of oocytes by induced differentiation of embryonic stem cells.\n\n【81】We also have to decide whether to allow patents on embryos. A product of somatic cell nuclear transfer may well be new, useful, and nonobvious, and not be a product of nature, in which case it will meet the criteria for the award of a patent. But think what that would mean. A patent on a method of forming a clone would cause a human conception or birth to be assailable as a patent infringement. That would be a perverse result. The result already looms by dint of patents on DNA sequences, a subject unto itself.\n\n【82】Norms for patents concerning human and other life forms.\n\n【83】I observe here that in the case of both DNA and embryo patents, we can avoid untoward results by introducing a simple rule. Each country could amend its patent laws to say that “No claim of infringement shall lie against a parent or child as such.” This provision would leave commercial patent owners free to pursue each other on claims of infringement, but would render parents and children immune from claims of infringement in their capacities as such.\n\n【84】Any new technology poses some risk of abuse. It would be misleading to suggest that the risks of abuse in the case of embryo use are insubstantial. No one could claim to know that. But it would be uncaring of us to neglect the humanitarian work of which we are capable within the protective constraints that we have the power to impose. Given our prospects of relieving suffering in actual lives at no cost in potential lives, we have a duty to act. I leave you with the thought that the case for this conclusion, the argument from nonenablement, is a consensus argument. It commands assent across a wide range of moral views. It beckons us to recognize that sometimes we are called upon to derive good from bad.

The fertilized egg can't survive, and the growing tissue may cause life-threatening bleeding, if left untreated.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】You may not notice any symptoms at first. However, some women who have an ectopic pregnancy have the usual early signs or symptoms of pregnancy — a missed period, breast tenderness and nausea.\n\n【6】If you take a pregnancy test, the result will be positive. Still, an ectopic pregnancy can't continue as normal.\n\n【7】As the fertilized egg grows in the improper place, signs and symptoms become more noticeable.\n\n【8】### Early warning of ectopic pregnancy\n\n【9】Often, the first warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy are light vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain.\n\n【10】If blood leaks from the fallopian tube, you may feel shoulder pain or an urge to have a bowel movement. Your specific symptoms depend on where the blood collects and which nerves are irritated.\n\n【11】### Emergency symptoms\n\n【12】If the fertilized egg continues to grow in the fallopian tube, it can cause the tube to rupture. Heavy bleeding inside the abdomen is likely. Symptoms of this life-threatening event include extreme lightheadedness, fainting and shock.\n\n【13】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【14】Seek emergency medical help if you have any signs or symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, including:\n\n【15】*   Severe abdominal or pelvic pain accompanied by vaginal bleeding\n*   Extreme lightheadedness or fainting\n*   Shoulder pain\n\n【16】Causes\n------\n\n【17】A tubal pregnancy — the most common type of ectopic pregnancy — happens when a fertilized egg gets stuck on its way to the uterus, often because the fallopian tube is damaged by inflammation or is misshapen. Hormonal imbalances or abnormal development of the fertilized egg also might play a role.\n\n【18】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【19】Some things that make you more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy are:\n\n【20】*   **Previous ectopic pregnancy.** If you've had this type of pregnancy before, you're more likely to have another.\n*   **Inflammation or infection.** Sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea or chlamydia, can cause inflammation in the tubes and other nearby organs, and increase your risk of an ectopic pregnancy.\n*   **Fertility treatments.** Some research suggests that women who have in vitro fertilization (IVF) or similar treatments are more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy. Infertility itself may also raise your risk.\n*   **Tubal surgery.** Surgery to correct a closed or damaged fallopian tube can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy.\n*   **Choice of birth control.** The chance of getting pregnant while using an intrauterine device (IUD) is rare. However, if you do get pregnant with an intrauterine device (IUD) in place, it's more likely to be ectopic. Tubal ligation, a permanent method of birth control commonly known as \"having your tubes tied,\" also raises your risk, if you become pregnant after this procedure.\n*   **Smoking.** Cigarette smoking just before you get pregnant can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. The more you smoke, the greater the risk.\n\n【21】Complications\n-------------\n\n【22】An ectopic pregnancy can cause your fallopian tube to burst open. Without treatment, the ruptured tube can lead to life-threatening bleeding.\n\n【23】Prevention\n----------\n\n【24】There's no way to prevent an ectopic pregnancy, but here are some ways to decrease your risk:\n\n【25】*   Limiting the number of sexual partners and using a condom during sex helps to prevent sexually transmitted infections and may reduce the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.\n*   Don't smoke. If you do, quit before you try to get pregnant.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:11:41", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:11:54", "cost": 12.935}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:37", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:11:53", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:11:40"}

Then the medicine is stopped. For some people, this approach can help reduce the side effects of hormone therapy. If the prostate cancer comes back or gets worse, it might be necessary to start the medicines again.\n\n【15】Early research shows that starting and stopping hormone therapy medicines, sometimes called intermittent dosing, may lower the risk of side effects without affecting long-term survival. And this dosing approach might improve quality of life.\n\n【16】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【17】If you're thinking of having hormone therapy for prostate cancer, discuss your choices with your doctor. Types of hormone therapy for prostate cancer include:\n\n【18】*   **Medicines that stop the testicles from making testosterone.** Certain medicines stop cells from getting the signals that tell them to make testosterone. These medicines are called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and antagonists. Another name for these medicines is gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists.\n*   **Medicines that stop testosterone from acting on cancer cells.** These medicines, known as anti-androgens, are often used with LHRH agonists. That's because LHRH agonists can cause a brief rise in testosterone levels before testosterone levels go down.\n*   **Surgery to remove the testicles, called an orchiectomy.** Surgery to remove both testicles lowers testosterone levels in the body quickly. A version of this procedure removes only the tissue that makes testosterone, not the testicles. Surgery to remove the testicles can't be reversed.\n\n【19】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【20】### LHRH agonists and antagonists\n\n【21】LHRH agonist and antagonist medicines stop the testicles from making testosterone.\n\n【22】Most of these medicines are given as a shot under the skin or into a muscle. They're given monthly, every three months or every six months. Or they can be put under the skin as an implant. The implant slowly releases medicines over time.\n\n【23】LHRH agonists include:\n\n【24】*   Leuprolide (Eligard, Lupron Depot, others).\n*   Goserelin (Zoladex).\n*   Triptorelin (Trelstar).\n\n【25】LHRH antagonists include:\n\n【26】*   Degarelix (Firmagon).\n*   Relugolix (Orgovyx).\n\n【27】Testosterone levels might rise briefly, called a flare, for a few weeks after an LHRH agonist. LHRH antagonists don't cause a testosterone flare.\n\n【28】Cutting the risk of a flare is important for those who have pain or other cancer symptoms. An increase in testosterone can make symptoms worse. Taking an anti-androgen either before or with an LHRH agonist can cut the risk of flare.\n\n【29】### Anti-androgens\n\n【30】Anti-androgens keep testosterone from acting on cancer cells. These oral medicines often are taken with an LHRH agonist or before taking an LHRH agonist.\n\n【31】Anti-androgens include:\n\n【32】*   Bicalutamide (Casodex).\n*   Flutamide.\n*   Nilutamide (Nilandron).\n*   Apalutamide (Erleada).\n*   Darolutamide (Nubeqa).\n*   Enzalutamide (Xtandi).\n\n【33】### Other androgen-blocking medicines\n\n【34】When hormone therapy treatment stops the testicles from making testosterone, other cells in the body might make testosterone that can cause prostate cancer cells to grow. Other hormone therapy medicines can stop these other sources of testosterone. The medicines might be used when prostate cancer remains or comes back. These medicines are sometimes mixed with corticosteroids, such as prednisone. These medicines include:\n\n【35】*   Abiraterone (Yonsa, Zytiga).\n*   Ketoconazole.\n\n【36】These medicines treat advanced prostate cancer that no longer responds to other hormone therapy treatments.\n\n【37】### Orchiectomy\n\n【38】This treatment to remove the testicles is rarely used. After numbing the groin area, a surgeon cuts into the groin and takes the testicle through the opening. The surgeon repeats the process for the other testicle.\n\n【39】All surgery carries a risk of pain, bleeding and infection. Most people can go home after this operation. It usually doesn't require staying the hospital.\n\n【40】Results\n-------\n\n【41】If you take hormone therapy for prostate cancer, you'll have regular follow-up meetings with your doctor. Your doctor may ask about any side effects you're experiencing. Many side effects can be controlled.\n\n【42】Your doctor might order tests to check your health and watch for signs that the cancer is coming back or getting worse.

The science underlying pharmacogenomics has evolved rapidly over the 50 years since it was first suggested that genetics might influence drug response phenotypes. That process has occurred in parallel with advances in DNA sequencing and other molecular technologies, with striking increases in our understanding of the human genome. There are now many validated examples of the clinical utility of pharmacogenomics, and this type of clinical genomic information is increasingly being generated in clinical laboratories, incorporated into electronic health records, and used to “tailor” or individualize drug therapy. This review will survey the origins and development of pharmacogenomics; it will address some of the challenges associated with the clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics; and it will attempt to foresee future advances in this important genomic discipline, one that almost certainly will be among the earliest and most widely adopted aspects of clinical genomics.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CYP ( cytochrome P450 ), EHR ( electronic health record ), eMERGE ( Electronic Medical Records and Genomics ), GWAS ( genome-wide association study ), NGS ( next-generation sequencing ), NIH ( National Institutes of Health ), ns ( nonsynonymous ), PGRN ( Pharmacogenomics Research Network ), PK ( pharmacokinetic ), SNP ( single nucleotide polymorphism ), TPMT ( thiopurine S-methyltransferase ), UGT ( UDP-glucuronosyltransferase )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** In support of improving patient care, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), and the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) to provide continuing education for the healthcare team.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .

Pharmacogenomic information is increasingly being integrated into electronic health records (EHRs), and that information is rapidly becoming an important component of the “therapeutic encounter.” As a result, pharmacogenomics is the aspect of clinical genomics that will almost certainly see the earliest and broadest clinical implementation, with the potential to eventually touch the care of every patient everywhere. In subsequent sections, we will briefly review the origins and development of this important aspect of “rational therapeutics,” touch briefly on the science underlying pharmacogenomics, address challenges associated with the clinical implementation of this aspect of genomic science, and, finally, describe a vision for a future in which “pharmacogenomics” will have evolved into “pharmaco-omics” and will be an integral component of every medical drug-related therapeutic decision.\n\n【17】Pharmacogenomics: Origins and Development\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【18】The concept of “pharmacogenetics” was first put forward by the famed American geneticist Arno Motulsky more than a half century ago\n\n【19】Drug reactions enzymes and biochemical genetics.\n\n【20】at a time when it was already becoming clear that variation in drug response could be due, at least in part, to the effects of genetic inheritance. Subsequently, a steady stream of reports appeared that described the contribution of genetics to variation in drug effect. Those examples most often involved pharmacokinetic (PK) factors, that is, factors that influence the concentration of drug that will ultimately reach the therapeutic target. Of those PK factors, most important was genetic variation in the expression and function of drug-metabolizing enzymes, enzymes that can influence plasma drug concentrations. Included among early pioneers in pharmacogenomic research were Werner Kalow at the University of Toronto with his studies of butyrylcholinesterase genetic variation and prolonged apnea after treatment with the muscle relaxant succinylcholine\n\n【21】Familial incidence of low pseudocholinesterase level.\n\n【22】On distribution and inheritance of atypical forms of human serum cholinesterase, as indicated by dibucaine numbers.\n\n【23】and David Price Evans at Johns Hopkins University who pursued earlier reports\n\n【24】Über die Erbbedingtheit der intraindividuellen Konstanz der Isoniazidausscheidung beim Menschen.\n\n【25】of genetic variation in the N-acetylyation of the antituberculosis drug isoniazid.\n\n【26】Genetic control of isoniazid metabolism in man.\n\n【27】Further observations on the determination of isoniazid inactivator phenotype.\n\n【28】Subsequently, genetic variation in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme that was associated with potentially life-threatening myelosuppression after treatment with the antineoplastic and immunosuppressant agents mercaptopurine and azathioprine, substrates for metabolism by TPMT,\n\n【29】Mercaptopurine pharmacogenetics: monogenic inheritance of erythrocyte thiopurine methyltransferase activity.\n\n【30】Pharmacogenetics of acute azathioprine toxicity: relationship to thiopurine methyltransferase genetic polymorphism.\n\n【31】was reported, as was genetic variation in another drug-metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome (CYP) P450 _CYP2D6_ ,\n\n【32】Polymorphic hydroxylation of Debrisoquine in man.\n\n【33】A probable genetic defect of the metabolism of sparteine.\n\n【34】that was associated with variation in plasma concentrations and the therapeutic effects of various drugs.\n\n【35】Characterization of the common genetic defect in humans deficient in debrisoquine metabolism.\n\n【36】Debrisoquine/sparteine hydroxylation genotype and phenotype: analysis of common mutations and alleles of _CYP2D6_ in a European population.\n\n【37】These early examples were discovered at a time before genes were being cloned and sequenced, and they were most often shown to be genetic on the basis of family studies by using techniques similar in principal to those applied by Mendel in the previous century when he performed his famous breeding studies with peas. However primitive they may appear when viewed from the perspective of the present post–Human Genome Project world, these early examples have stood the test of time and are now well understood mechanistically. They also served as a powerful stimulus that set the stage for a series of systematic attempts to identify, study, and determine the clinical implications for drug response of genetic variation within whole families of genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and drug targets. Initially, most of those studies continued to focus on PK genes. One reason for that focus was the fact that the variation in PK genes was often associated with relatively easily measured phenotypes, blood drug and drug metabolite concentrations, phenotypes that were often associated with variation in clinical drug response. It should be emphasized that even these early examples served to illustrate that pharmacogenetic variation could result in serious adverse drug reactions and/or striking variation in drug efficacy. It should also be pointed out that drug metabolism may be required to “metabolically activate” a “prodrug,” a process that can also be significantly influenced by genetic variation in the biotransformation of the prodrug. We should also make it clear that metabolism is only one of many processes that can result in individual differences in drug response. For example, several severe adverse drug reactions can be predicted and prevented by knowledge of sequence variation involving human leukocyte antigen genes.\n\n【38】During the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, before the completion of the Human Genome Project, pharmacogenomic research often involved cloning and sequencing of genes encoding proteins that might contribute to variation in drug response phenotypes. Those studies found that much of the genetic variation in drug response that had been reported previously resulted from common sequence variation within or near genes that encoded the enzymes that had originally been studied as phenotypes, that is, “high” or “low” levels of enzyme activity. The fact that pharmacogenomic variation was often due to common genetic polymorphisms will come up again subsequently when we cite evidence that every member of our species carries many potentially clinically actionable pharmacogenomic variants. The studies performed during the decade of the 1990s often focused on isoforms of the CYPs as an extremely important family of drug-metabolizing enzymes,\n\n【39】Characterization of the common genetic defect in humans deficient in debrisoquine metabolism.\n\n【40】Debrisoquine/sparteine hydroxylation genotype and phenotype: analysis of common mutations and alleles of _CYP2D6_ in a European population.\n\n【41】but they also included other so-called phase II or conjugating drug-metabolizing enzymes such as sulfotransferases,\n\n【42】Sulfation pharmacogenetics in humans.\n\n【43】Sulfation and sulfotransferases 1: sulfotransferase molecular biology: cDNAs and genes.\n\n【44】methyltransferases such as TPMT,\n\n【45】Methylation pharmacogenetics: thiopurine methyltransferase as a model system.\n\n【46】Methylation pharmacogenetics: catechol O-methyltransferase, thiopurine methyltransferase, and histamine N-methyltransferase.\n\n【47】and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs).\n\n【48】Gene structure at the human _UGT1_ locus creates diversity in isozyme structure, substrate specificity, and regulation.\n\n【49】The genetic basis of the reduced expression of bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 in Gilbert’s syndrome.\n\n【50】Genetic predisposition to the metabolism of irinotecan (CPT-11): role of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1 in the glucuronidation of its active metabolite (SN-38) inhuman liver microsomes.\n\n【51】Although research of that era predominantly focused on gene cloning, gene sequencing, and functional characterization of allozymes encoded by variant gene sequences, it was also during that time that we began to understand molecular mechanisms responsible for the functional effects of common genetic variation in those genes. For example, TPMT, as mentioned previously, catalyzes S-methylation, a reaction that inactivates thiopurine drugs such as azathioprine. The most common _TPMT_ variant allele in European populations, _TPMT\\*3A_ , with a minor allele frequency of approximately 5% resulting in 1 of every 300 Europeans being homozygous for this variant, is due to 2 nonsynonymous (ns) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the _TPMT_ gene.\n\n【52】Thiopurine methyltransferase pharmacogenetics: human gene cloning and characterization of a common polymorphism.\n\n【53】Thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency: two nucleotide transitions define the most prevalent mutant allele associated with loss of catalytic activity in Caucasians.\n\n【54】Those 2 changes in the nucleotide sequence result in the alteration of 2 amino acids in the TPMT protein. The protein encoded by _TPMT\\*3A_ is translated, but it misfolds and is rapidly degraded,\n\n【55】Enhanced proteasomal degradation of mutant human thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) in mammalian cells: mechanism for TPMT protein deficiency inherited by _TPMT\\*2, TPMT\\*3A, TPMT\\*3B_ or TPMT\\*3C.\n\n【56】Thiopurine S-methyltransferase pharmacogenetics: chaperone protein association and allozyme degradation.\n\n【57】Human thiopurine S-methyltransferase pharmacogenetics: variant allozyme misfolding and aggresome formation.\n\n【58】with resultant lack of the enzyme and inability to metabolize thiopurines, leading to a 10-fold “overdose” of these cytotoxic agents when “standard” doses of thiopurines are administered to patients who are homozygous for _TPMT\\*3A_ . Another example illustrating a different type of mechanism involved genetic variation in the TATA box in the promoter for the _UGT1A1_ gene that encodes a protein that metabolizes bilirubin as well as drugs such as the antineoplastic agent irinotecan. Most people have 6 “TA” elements in this TATA box, but some subjects have 7 rather than 6, and they display decreased expression of both UGT1A1 messenger RNA and protein, resulting in Gilbert syndrome because of reduced bilirubin metabolism and, when they are exposed to irinotecan, an increased incidence of adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea and myelosuppression.\n\n【59】The genetic basis of the reduced expression of bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 in Gilbert’s syndrome.\n\n【60】Genetic predisposition to the metabolism of irinotecan (CPT-11): role of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1 in the glucuronidation of its active metabolite (SN-38) inhuman liver microsomes.\n\n【61】These examples and many others illustrate why, at the beginning of the 21st century, with the completion of the Human Genome Project, the stage had been set to move forward quickly with both pharmacogenomic discovery and pharmacogenomic clinical implementation. In a display of the potential power of public-private collaboration, those efforts were enabled by and greatly stimulated in the United States by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pharmacogenomics Research Network (PGRN) grants from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) grants from the National Human Genome Research Institute—public funding that not only served to drive discovery by providing access to new and expensive techniques such as genome-wide association study (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) but also acted as a strong stimulus for the clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics. This brief overview should make it clear that pharmacogenomics as a discipline progressed in parallel with the maturation of genomic science during the later decades of the 20th century and the opening decades of the 21st century.\n\n【62】The progress that has been made in identifying, characterizing, and determining the clinical utility of pharmacogenomic variants since Motulsky first suggested that genetics might influence drug response is illustrated in striking fashion by the information given in Table 1 , which represents a modified version of the US Food and Drug Administration Pharmacogenomics website\n\n【63】that lists drugs for which there are pharmacogenomic biomarkers with established clinical utility. It should be noted that Table 1 does not include drugs that are used primarily in oncology, but that information can also be found on the Food and Drug Administration website. The information given in Table 1 also serves to emphasize that virtually every medical discipline is touched by pharmacogenomics, which immediately raises the question of how we can make this information available to practitioners in an easily accessible and usable fashion, topics addressed in subsequent sections.\n\n【64】Table 1 Food and Drug Administration Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers for

listed in Table 1 , drugs used to treat patients in virtually every medical specialty, serves to highlight the challenges associated with pharmacogenomic implementation, one of which is that of making this information available to practitioners in a practical and easily understood fashion. To do that requires, among other important steps, objective, evidence-based guidelines and investment in the infrastructure required to make pharmacogenomic information accessible to physicians in a timely fashion. Physicians and other caregivers write prescriptions for drugs, not genes, so the approach that most institutions have taken is to focus on drug-gene pairs. Fortunately, the development of pharmacogenomics has occurred in parallel with the adoption of EHRs—a development required for the storage of ever-expanding genomic data as well as the tools required to instantly deliver that information to prescribers, preferably at the point of care, often while the prescription is being written. Of course, it always remains possible for a physician to order a specific pharmacogenomic test, either genotype-based, that is, a test which queries only specific nucleotides that we currently know are of functional significance; or sequence-based for a gene or genes known to be associated with variation in response to a specific drug or drugs. However, pharmacogenomic testing is moving increasingly to the use of panels of “pharmacogenes” that simultaneously test most of the genes that contribute to variation in response to commonly prescribed drugs for which there is evidence of pharmacogenomic clinical utility. To assist caregivers, many institutions have created automatic computer-based alerts that “fire” whenever a drug is prescribed for which a pharmacogenomic test might provide helpful information. For example, at Mayo Clinic, 17 drug-gene pair alerts currently fire when a prescription is first written for a drug that is included among those 17 drug-gene pairs . As at many medical centers, review and approval of the implementation of these alerts is the responsibility of a subcommittee of the Formulary Committee. Decision making with regard to the implementation of an alert depends on evidence-based guidelines that come from sources such as the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium,\n\n【69】a collaboration between the PGRN and the PharmGKB database, or a similar European consortium, such as the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group. It should be emphasized that even though this review has generally focused on North American pharmacogenomic discovery and implementation efforts, these efforts are truly international in scope, as illustrated, for example, by the European Ubiquitous Pharmacogenomics Consortium.\n\n【70】Ubiquitous Pharmacogenomics Consortium  \nImplementing pharmacogenomics in Europe: design and implementation strategy of the Ubiquitous Pharmacogenomics Consortium.\n\n【71】Current drug-gene pair alerts are primarily “reactive”; that is, they require that the physician—on the basis of his or her goals for the patient—order the genetic test in response to the alert. Although an important first step, reactive alerts represent only one step toward the eventual goal, which would involve having pharmacogenomic data for a specific patient “preemptively” available in the EHR so there will be no delay associated with waiting for a test result so the pharmacogenomic information can be incorporated into the clinical workflow seamlessly.\n\n【72】Table 2 Drug-Gene Pairs Included in Mayo Clinic’s Pharmacogenomic Electronic Alerts\n\n| Drug | Gene |\n| --- | --- |\n| Abacavir | _HLA-B\\*57:01_ |\n| Allopurinol | _HLA-B\\*58:01_ |\n| Carbamazepine | _HLA-B\\*15:02_ and _HLA-A\\*31:01_ |\n| Citalopram | _CYP2C19_ |\n| Clopidogrel | _CYP2C19_ |\n| Codeine | _CYP2D6_ |\n| Escitalopram | _CYP2C19_ |\n| Fluoxetine | _CYP2D6_ |\n| Fluvoxamine | _CYP2D6_ |\n| Paroxetine | _CYP2D6_ |\n| Simvastatin | _SLCO1B1_ |\n| Tacrolimus | _CYP3A5_ |\n| Tamoxifen | _CYP2D6_ |\n| Thiopurines | _TPMT_ |\n| Tramadol | _CYP2D6_ |\n| Venlafaxine | _CYP2D6_ |\n| Warfarin | _CYP2C9_ and _VKORC1_ |\n\n【74】Some academic medical centers are already experimenting with “preemptive” pharmacogenomic alerts. For example, the PGRN centers, as a group, supported a “deep sequencing” facility that developed an NGS reagent that initially included 84 pharmacogenes that were “captured” and sequenced across exons and splice junctions, thus making it possible to obtain information with regard to both known functionally significant variants and many variants of unknown significance. One of the challenges facing pharmacogenomics will be the development of high-throughput methods that will make it possible to functionally characterize the large number of variants of unknown significance identified when we apply NGS to DNA samples from a large number of patients. For example, if we just select 2 common and intensively studied CYP genes— _CYP2C9_ and _CYP2C19_ —genes that encode enzymes that metabolize the anticoagulant agents warfarin and clopidogrel, respectively, we can compare what we currently know about these 2 highly studied genes with what we need to know. To determine what “we know,” we went to the Human Cytochrome P450 ( _CYP_ ) Allele Nomenclature Database at the Karolinska in Stockholm.\n\n【75】This canonical database for CYP genes and enzymes listed 165 missense variants for _CYP2C9_ and 189 for _CYP2C19_ . Of those variants, only 29 _CYP2C9_ variants had been functionally validated (20 in a laboratory setting) and only 26 for _CYP2C19_ (7 in a laboratory setting). Meanwhile in 60,000 DNA samples for which exome sequence data had been reported by the Broad Institute,\n\n【76】Selective estrogen receptor modulators and pharmacogenomic variation in ZNF423 regulation of _BRCA1_ expression: individualized breast cancer prevention.\n\n【77】there were 235 missense variants in _CYP2C9_ and 258 in _CYP2C19_ . These numbers indicate that we need to develop methods to rapidly screen the function of these variant allozymes to determine what they might mean clinically. To place this task in context, a decade ago it would have been possible to justify a multiyear PhD thesis project for only a dozen variants of a single gene. This example represents a microcosm of the task that we face as more and more DNA sequence information becomes available. This coming tidal wave of DNA sequence information also raises the issue of the most efficient and cost-effective way to establish the clinical utility of novel pharmacogenomic information. It is clear that it will not be practical to perform a randomized clinical trial for all these genomic variants, but the most practical way in which to do that remains a subject of continuing debate.\n\n【78】The NIH PGRN and eMERGE networks have already begun to perform “pilot” studies designed to set the stage for more widespread clinical use of preemptive pharmacogenomic information. For example, each of the NIH eMERGE grant sites used the original PGRN-seq NGS reagent to sequence DNA samples from their biobanks. Mayo Clinic, as one example, used this reagent to sequence 1013 DNA samples from the Mayo Clinic Biobank for local patients who had consented for their DNA to be used for research purposes. Patients participating in that “RIGHT” study—RIGHT drug at the RIGHT dose at the RIGHT time—now have DNA sequence information in the EHR for the 17 drug-gene pairs for which “reactive alerts” are currently firing at Mayo Clinic, but in their case if an alert fires, it will not merely inform the prescriber that a genetic test is available.\n\n【79】Participant-perceived understanding and perspectives on pharmacogenomics: the Mayo Clinic RIGHT protocol (Right Drug, Right Dose, Right Time).\n\n【80】Electronic medical record-integrated pharmacogenomics and related clinical decision support concepts.\n\n【81】For these patients, the alert will instantly tell the caregiver the patient’s gene sequence with a clinical interpretation. For example, among those original 1013 subjects, if only 5 “common” pharmacogenes out of the 84 sequenced were included, 99.1% of the subjects had at least 1 actionable variant in at least 1 of those 5 genes, with many subjects having clinically actionable variant sequences in several of the 5 genes.\n\n【82】Preemptive pharmacogenomic testing for precision medicine: a comprehensive analysis of five actionable pharmacogenomic genes using next-generation DNA sequencing and a customized _CYP2D6_ genotyping cascade.\n\n【83】This observation explains why, at the beginning of this overview, we made the statement that “pharmacogenomics is the aspect of clinical genomics that will almost certainly see the earliest and broadest clinical implementation, with the potential to eventually touch the care of every patient everywhere.” To follow up on those initial RIGHT study results, Mayo Clinic’s Center for Individualized Medicine, in collaboration with the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center, is currently moving beyond the original 1013 biobank samples to consent and sequence 10,000 additional Mayo Clinic Biobank participants for a RIGHT 10K study designed to test the hypothesis that having preemptive pharmacogenomic information in the EHR might result in cost-effective health benefits for the patients involved, helping them to avoid adverse drug reactions and obtain maximum efficacy from drug therapy.\n\n【84】Finally, it goes without saying that the implementation of pharmacogenomics across a large academic medical center requires significant effort and significant resources. It is for that reason that we emphasized that the NIH support provided by the PGRN and eMERGE grants acted as a valuable “catalyst” to move this aspect of genomic science to the bedside, but that this process must be in a partnership with hospitals and medical centers, beginning with committed institutional leadership; engagement across multiple medical staffs that include physicians, nurses, allied health personnel, and pharmacists, with significant investments required for the education for all these groups, including patients; as well as infrastructural investment in information technology and the EHR. This may seem ambitious but, as outlined subsequently, we are only at the beginning of this process of discovery and implementation of genomics and other “omics” techniques to enhance drug therapy.\n\n【85】Pharmacogenomics: Future Prospects\n----------------------------------\n\n【86】In this overview, we have described briefly the origins and development of pharmacogenomics as well as ongoing efforts to bring pharmacogenomics into the clinic and to make it a standard component of routine patient care. It might be useful to point out that the _TPMT_ and _CYP2D6_ genetic polymorphisms that we are currently “implementing” clinically were discovered more than 35 years ago\n\n【87】Mercaptopurine pharmacogenetics: monogenic inheritance of erythrocyte thiopurine methyltransferase activity.\n\n【88】Pharmacogenetics of acute azathioprine toxicity: relationship to thiopurine methyltransferase genetic polymorphism.\n\n【89】Polymorphic hydroxylation of Debrisoquine in man.\n\n【90】A probable genetic defect of the metabolism of sparteine.\n\n【91】and that both have been known to have clinical utility for more than a quarter of a century. The association of statin-induced myopathy with an SNP in the _SLCO1B1_ gene was one of the early success stories of pharmacogenomic GWAS, but that occurred a decade ago.\n\n【92】SEARCH Collaborative Group  \n_SLCO1B1_ variants and statin-induced myopathy—a genomewide study.\n\n【93】Therefore, the information that we are currently implementing in the clinic has been known for decades, or at least for a decade. Included among the questions that we should be asking ourselves now are what are the scientific challenges that face pharmacogenomics as we increasingly apply NGS and increasingly move genome-wide in our perspective as we attempt to apply genomics to “inform” drug selection and use; what other types of “omics” information might help to better inform the “therapeutic encounter”; how we can merge other “omic” information with genomic data; and what other types of information might help make drug selection and use as “rational” and as highly “individualized” as possible. Finally, we should point out that the processes of biomedical “discovery,” “translation,” and “implementation” are not separate and distinct activities, but rather they are tightly intertwined and they inform each other, as illustrated graphically in Figure 1 .\n\n【94】Figure 1 Pharmacogenomic discovery, translation, and implementation.\n\n【95】In subsequent paragraphs, we will briefly outline challenges and possible future directions as genomic science is applied to drug response. That discussion will be followed by a description of recent efforts to move beyond genomics alone to include data from other “omics” disciplines, that is, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, in combination with genomics , to determine whether that might better inform our attempts to optimize and individualize drug therapy by moving beyond pharmacogenomics to what might be called pharmaco-omics.\n\n【96】Figure 2 Pharmacogenomics to pharmaco-omics.\n\n【97】Figure 3 Pharmaco-omics, the future.\n\n【98】As pointed out previously, many of the earliest clinically relevant examples of pharmacogenomics involved genes that encoded drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and drug targets, proteins that might logically be expected to influence drug response. Furthermore, there was an emphasis on ns SNPs, nucleotide sequence changes in the portion of the gene that encodes protein, resulting in an altered protein amino acid sequence. However, it is becoming increasingly clear now that a large number of GWAS for drug response have been performed, with both drug efficacy and adverse drug reactions as phenotypes, that—even though SNPs within the open reading frame of a gene can have a striking effect on function—many of the “top hit” SNPs identified during GWAS are outside the coding portion of the gene. Those SNPs often alter transcription, and as a result, they alter gene expression. That can occur, for example, if the SNP either creates or disrupts a transcription factor binding site, a DNA sequence that the transcription factor “recognizes” and binds to in the promoter of the gene or in so-called “enhancer” elements, DNA sequence motifs that can be located hundreds of thousands of base pairs away from the gene. There are now databases that can be used to predict whether an SNP might create or disrupt a transcription factor binding site, and there is also the GTEx database,\n\n【99】which, in a tissue-specific fashion, provides information about whether a specific SNP might be an “expression quantitative trait locus”; that is, whether that SNP is associated with variation in the level of messenger RNA expression. To complicate the situation even further, there is recent evidence that SNPs located hundreds of base pairs away from sites of transcription factor binding can have a profound effect on the binding of the transcription factor and on subsequent gene expression.\n\n【100】Selective estrogen receptor modulators and pharmacogenomic variation in ZNF423 regulation of _BRCA1_ expression: individualized breast cancer prevention.\n\n【101】Estrogen, SNP-dependent chemokine expression and selective estrogen receptor modulator regulation.\n\n【102】Because exome sequencing covers only about 1.5% of the genome, in the future we will need to move beyond the portion of the gene that encodes protein if we want to understand the functional implications of genetic polymorphisms. There can be no doubt that we are currently missing a great deal of information that might be important for our understanding of variation in drug response. Therefore, new high-throughput approaches will be needed to help us understand and use that information because we are being inundated by a tidal wave of data on genomic sequence variation.\n\n【103】Exome Aggregation Consortium  \nAnalysis of protein-coding genetic variation in 60,706 humans.\n\n【104】The issue of the extremely large number of ns SNP variants within the coding regions of genes and how we can quickly and accurately predict their functional implications that was mentioned previously is just one example of the fact that we are still only at the beginning of our understanding of the relationship of genomic sequence variation to clinically relevant variation in drug response phenotypes. There is no doubt that we will soon be dealing not with hundreds of potentially functionally significant variants for each gene, but rather with thousands. Even if we develop high-throughput methods to determine which gene sequence or structural variants have functional implications, there is no way that a human being could possibly remember all of them; so sophisticated computerized systems will be a necessity, as will systems to convey this information to the health care team caring for the patient in a form that can be easily and quickly understood and used. If that is true of genomics alone, how will we approach the integration of other “omics” information with genomics information with regard to the transcriptome, the epigenome, the proteome, the metabolome, and the microbiome?\n\n【105】The process of joining multiple “omics” datasets to help us make better informed therapeutic decisions presents a significant challenge. However, it is now commonplace to use both exome and RNA-seq data, that is, to join genomics and transcriptomics, for a tumor to gain greater insight into underlying—potentially “druggable”—therapeutic targets. That process is also “pharmacogenomics.” Psychiatry represents another clinical discipline in which multiple “omics” have been joined. It is probably fair to say that the application of genomics alone has been somewhat disappointing in psychiatry—perhaps, at least in part, because the phenotypes in psychiatry have not yet been closely related to the underlying biology in the same way that they have been in many other medical specialties. In an attempt to overcome that limitation, there have been recent attempts to “inform” genomic analyses by beginning with metabolomic data, determine which metabolite is most highly associated with the psychiatric phenotype (eg, Hamilton D scores for patients with major depressive disorder), perform a GWAS to identify genes associated with the concentration of the metabolite, and then functionally validate the genes/SNPs that were identified during the GWAS.\n\n【106】_TSPAN5, ERICH3_ and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in major depressive disorder: pharmacometabolomics-informed pharmacogenomics.\n\n【107】These examples have begun to show us that in the future, biomarkers for drug response might well be composed of genomic data, transcriptomic data, and metabolomic data; that is, that we will be using “pharmaco-omics” to help us individualize and optimize drug therapy .\n\n【108】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【109】Pharmacogenomics is the application of genomic and other “omic” information to help guide, inform, and individualize drug therapy. In the decades since Motulsky first put forward the concept of pharmacogenetics, striking progress has been made and there can no longer be any doubt that drug efficacy and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions can be influenced by genomics or that genomic information can be used to help maximize efficacy and minimize the occurrence of adverse drug reactions. That progress has occurred in parallel with the striking advances that have occurred in human genomics during the past half century. As outlined in previous sections, pharmacogenomics and pharmaco-omics are still young disciplines, but they are already moving into the clinic and are already being used to help physicians and other health care team members to make better and more highly individualized therapeutic decisions. Much remains to be done, and we are only at the beginning of the process of bringing this aspect of genomics to the bedside, but we will end this overview as we began: Pharmacogenomics is the aspect of clinical genomics that will almost certainly see the earliest and broadest clinical implementation, with the potential to eventually touch the care of every patient everywhere.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:33:53", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:34:43", "cost": 50.652}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:37", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:34:42", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:33:51"}

Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed with use of a diagnostic test for the assessment of HER2 overexpression, the HercepTest. The IHCstained slides were interpreted and scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 3+ according to Food and Drug Administration-approved guidelines. All specimens scored as 2+ were also routinely evaluated by FISH with use of a HER-2/neu DNA probe kit (PathVysion).

Zovirax\n\n【2】### Canadian Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Acyclovir\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Acyclovir belongs to the family of medicines called antivirals. Antivirals are used to treat infections caused by viruses. Usually they work for only one kind or group of virus infections.\n\n【6】Topical acyclovir is used to treat the symptoms of herpes simplex virus infections of the skin, mucous membranes, and genitals (sex organs). Although topical acyclovir will not cure herpes simplex, it may help relieve the pain and discomfort and may help the sores (if any) heal faster. Topical acyclovir may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.\n\n【7】Acyclovir is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Ointment\n*   Cream\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Studies on this medicine have been done only in adult patients, and there is no specific information comparing use of topical acyclovir in children with use in other age groups.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing the use of topical acyclovir in the elderly with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【23】*   Bupropion\n*   Dichlorphenamide\n*   Emtricitabine\n*   Fexinidazole\n*   Foscarnet\n*   Leflunomide\n*   Nitisinone\n*   Tenofovir Alafenamide\n*   Teriflunomide\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【25】*   Fosphenytoin\n*   Phenytoin\n*   Valproic Acid\n\n【26】### Other Interactions\n\n【27】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【28】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【29】Tell your doctor if your herpes simplex infection keeps coming back while you are using acyclovir.\n\n【30】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【31】Acyclovir may come with patient information about herpes simplex infections. Read this information carefully. If you have any questions, check with your health care professional.\n\n【32】Do not use this medicine in the eyes.\n\n【33】Acyclovir is best used as soon as possible after the signs and symptoms of herpes infection (for example, pain, burning, or blisters) begin to appear.\n\n【34】Use a finger cot or rubber glove when applying this medicine. This will help keep you from spreading the infection to other areas of your body and will prevent the transmission of the infection to other persons . Apply enough medicine to completely cover all the sores (blisters). A 1.25-centimeter (approximately ½-inch) strip of ointment applied to each area of the affected skin measuring 5 × 5 centimeters (approximately 2 × 2 inches) is usually enough, unless otherwise directed by your doctor.\n\n【35】To help clear up your herpes infection, continue using acyclovir for the full time of treatment, even if your symptoms begin to clear up after a few days. Do not miss any doses. However, do not use this medicine more often or for a longer time than your doctor ordered.\n\n【36】### Dosing\n\n【37】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【38】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【39】*   For topical dosage form (cream):\n    *   For herpes simplex infection:\n        *   Adults—Apply to the affected area(s), four to six times a day, for up to ten days.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n*   For topical dosage form (ointment):\n    *   For herpes simplex infection:\n\n【40】        #### In the U.S.\n\n【41】        *   Adults—Apply to the affected area(s), every three hours, for a total of six times a day, for seven days.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【42】        #### In Canada\n\n【43】        *   Adults—Apply to the affected area(s), four to six times a day, for up to ten days.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【44】### Missed Dose\n\n【45】If you miss a dose of this medicine, apply it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule.\n\n【46】### Storage\n\n【47】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【48】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【49】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【50】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【51】Women with genital herpes may be more likely to get cancer of the cervix (opening to the womb). Therefore, it is very important that Pap tests be taken at least once a year to check for cancer. Cervical cancer can be cured if found and treated early.\n\n【52】If your symptoms do not improve within 1 week, or if they become worse, check with your doctor.\n\n【53】Consider the possibility of viral resistance to acyclovir if little or no improvement in symptoms during therapy.\n\n【54】The areas affected by herpes should be kept as clean and dry as possible. Also, wear loose-fitting clothing to avoid irritating the sores (blisters).\n\n【55】Herpes infection of the genitals can be caught from or spread to your partner during any sexual activity. Although you may get herpes even though your sexual partner has no symptoms, the infection is more likely to be spread if sores are present. This is true until the sores are completely healed and the scabs have fallen off. The use of a condom (prophylactic) may help prevent the spread of herpes. However, spermicidal (sperm-killing) jelly or a diaphragm will not help prevent the spread of herpes. Therefore, it is best to avoid any sexual activity if either you or your partner has any symptoms of herpes. It is also important to remember that acyclovir will not keep you from spreading herpes to others.\n\n【56】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【57】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【58】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【59】#### More common\n\n【60】1.  Mild pain, burning, or stinging\n\n【61】#### Less common\n\n【62】1.  Itching\n\n【63】#### Rare\n\n【64】1.  Itching, stinging, or redness of the genital area\n2.  skin rash", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:03:50", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:04:23", "cost": 32.128}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:37", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:04:22", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:03:50"}

It affects adults, too, especially in hot, humid conditions.\n\n【2】Heat rash occurs when sweat is trapped in the skin. Symptoms can range from small blisters to deep, inflamed lumps. Some forms of heat rash are very itchy.\n\n【3】Heat rash usually goes away once the skin cools down. Severe forms of the condition might need treatment from a health care provider.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Adults usually develop heat rash in skin folds and where clothing rubs against the skin. In infants, the rash is mainly found on the neck, shoulders and chest. It can also show up in the armpits, elbow creases and groin.\n\n【6】### Types of heat rash\n\n【7】The types of heat rash are classified according to how deep the sweat is trapped in the skin. Signs and symptoms for each type vary.\n\n【8】*   The mildest form of heat rash is called miliaria crystallina. It occurs when the opening of the sweat duct on the surface of the skin (sweat pore) is blocked. This form is marked by tiny, clear, fluid-filled bumps that break easily.\n*   A type that occurs deeper in the skin is called miliaria rubra. It is sometimes called prickly heat. Signs and symptoms include small, inflamed blister-like bumps and itching or prickling in the affected area.\n*   Occasionally, the inflamed bumps of miliaria rubra fill with pus. This form is called miliaria pustulosa.\n*   A less common form of heat rash is called miliaria profunda. It affects the deepest layer of the skin (dermis). It causes firm, painful or itchy inflamed bumps that look like goose bumps and may break open.\n\n【9】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【10】Heat rash usually heals by cooling the skin and avoiding exposure to the heat that caused it. See your health care provider if you or your child has symptoms that last longer than a few days or the rash seems to be getting worse.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】Heat rash develops when a duct that leads from a sweat gland to the surface of the skin is blocked or inflamed. This then blocks the opening of the sweat duct on the surface of the skin (sweat pore). Instead of evaporating, sweat is trapped beneath the skin, causing irritation and bumps on the skin.\n\n【13】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【14】Factors that increase the risk of heat rash include:\n\n【15】*   Being a newborn, as newborns have immature sweat ducts\n*   Living in a hot, humid climate\n*   Being physically active\n*   Being on bedrest for a long time and having a fever\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】Heat rash usually heals without scarring. People with brown or Black skin are at risk of spots of skin that get lighter or darker in response to inflammatory skin conditions (postinflammatory hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation). These changes usually go away within weeks or months.\n\n【18】A common complication is infection with bacteria, causing inflamed and itchy pustules.\n\n【19】Prevention\n----------\n\n【20】To help protect yourself or your child from heat rash:\n\n【21】*   In hot weather, dress in loose, lightweight clothing that wicks moisture away from the skin. Don't wrap newborns in too many layers.\n*   In hot weather, limit physical activity. Stay in the shade or in an air-conditioned building. Or use a fan to circulate the air.\n*   Keep your sleeping area cool and well ventilated.\n*   Avoid creams and ointments that can block pores.\n*   Avoid drugs that cause sweating, such as clonidine, beta blockers and opioids.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:35:34", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:35:46", "cost": 12.091}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:37", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:35:44", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:35:32"}

Relative HGS was obtained by dividing the absolute value by body weight. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimated with Cox regression models. We used multiple imputation to account for missing data.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 17.1 (11.3-18.3) years, 177 HF events were recorded. Handgrip strength was continually associated with risk of HF, consistent with a curvilinear shape. On adjustment for several established risk factors and other potential confounders, the HR (95% CI) for HF was 0.73 (0.59-0.91) per 1 SD increase in relative HGS. Comparing the top vs bottom tertiles of relative HGS, the corresponding adjusted HR was 0.55 (0.38-0.81). The association remained similar across several clinical subgroups. Imputed results were broadly similar to the observed results.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Relative HGS is inversely and continually associated with the future risk of HF in the general population. Studies are warranted to evaluate whether HGS may be a useful prognostic tool for HF in the general population and to determine whether resistance exercise training may lower the risk of HF.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AMI ( acute myocardial infarction ), BMI ( body mass index ), CHD ( coronary heart disease ), CRF ( cardiorespiratory fitness ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), HF ( heart failure ), HGS ( handgrip strength ), HR ( hazard ratio ), KIHD ( Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease ), LTPA ( leisure time physical activity )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:19:03", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:19:14", "cost": 10.04}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:37", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:19:11", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:19:01"}

Cipro\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Ciprofloxacin is used to treat bacterial infections in many different parts of the body. Ciprofloxacin oral liquid and tablets are also used to treat anthrax infection after inhalational exposure. This medicine is also used to treat and prevent plague (including pneumonic and septicemic plague). Ciprofloxacin may mask or delay the symptoms of syphilis. It is not effective against syphilis infections.\n\n【4】Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets are only used to treat urinary tract infections, including acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis.\n\n【5】Proquin® XR tablets are only used to treat uncomplicated or simple urinary tract infections (acute cystitis).\n\n【6】Ciprofloxacin belongs to the class of drugs known as quinolone antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. However, this medicine will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Powder for Suspension\n*   Tablet\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ciprofloxacin in children. However, because of this medicine's toxicity, it should be used with caution, after other medicines have been considered and found ineffective. Ciprofloxacin oral liquid or tablet may be used in children to prevent anthrax infection after possible exposure, and to treat serious kidney infections.\n\n【16】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ciprofloxacin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney or heart problems, or develop severe tendon problems (including tendon rupture), which may require caution in patients receiving ciprofloxacin.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers.\n\n【76】Ciprofloxacin may cause diarrhea, and in some cases it can be severe. It may occur 2 months or more after you or your child stop taking this medicine. Do not take any medicine to treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor.

If these reactions are especially bothersome, check with your doctor.\n\n【83】If you are a diabetic patient taking diabetes medicine by mouth: Ciprofloxacin may cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in some patients.

To do so may cause unwanted side effects.\n\n【39】This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【40】Before starting CombiPatch® therapy, you may need to tell your doctor if you are currently using continuous estrogen or combination estrogen plus progestin therapy. This will allow your doctor to determine when to start your treatment.\n\n【41】You may have monthly bleeding or spotting at the completion of each cycle.\n\n【42】This transdermal patch system is to be applied on the skin of the lower abdomen (lower stomach area) two times a week, depending on your dosing regimen (either continuous combined regimen or continuous sequential regimen), as advised by your doctor.\n\n【43】To use the skin patch:\n\n【44】*   Wash your hands with soap and water before and after you use this medicine.\n*   Carefully tear open the pouch when you are ready to put the patch on your skin. Do not cut it.\n*   Peel off the backing from the patch and apply the patch to a clean, dry, and hair-free area of the lower stomach. This area must be free of powder, oil, or lotion for the patch to stick on to your skin.\n*   Press the patch firmly in place with your hand for about 10 seconds.\n*   Do not apply the patch on the breast or over any skin folds. Do not apply the patch on oily, broken, burned, or irritated skin, or areas with skin conditions (such as birth marks, tattoos).

Do not expose it to the sun for long periods of time.\n*   When replacing your patch, make sure to apply the new patch to a different area of your lower abdomen. Wait at least 1 week before applying a patch to the same area.\n*   When changing a patch, slowly peel it off from your skin. If you have any patch adhesive left on your skin, allow it to dry for 15 minutes and gently rub the sticky area with oil or lotion to remove it. It is best to change your patch on the same days of each week to help you remember.\n*   You may take a bath, shower, or swim while using this medicine. Doing so will not affect the patch.\n*   If a patch falls off, just put it back on a different area. If the patch does not stick completely, put on a new patch but continue to follow your original schedule for changing your patch.\n*   To throw away a used patch: Fold the patch in half with the sticky side together and place it in a sturdy child-proof container. Throw this container in the trash away from children and pets. Do not flush the patch down the toilet.\n\n【45】### Dosing\n\n【46】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients.

The pain, burning or irritation associated with vulvodynia can make you so uncomfortable that sitting for long periods or having sex becomes unthinkable. The condition can last for months to years.\n\n【2】If you have vulvodynia, don't let the absence of visible signs or embarrassment about discussing the symptoms keep you from seeking help. Treatment options are available to lessen your discomfort. And your doctor might be able to determine a cause for your vulvar pain, so it's important to have an examination.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】The main vulvodynia symptom is pain in your genital area, which can be characterized as:\n\n【5】*   Burning\n*   Soreness\n*   Stinging\n*   Rawness\n*   Painful intercourse (dyspareunia)\n*   Throbbing\n*   Itching\n\n【6】Your pain might be constant or occasional. It might occur only when the sensitive area is touched (provoked). You might feel the pain in your entire vulvar area (generalized), or the pain might be localized to a certain area, such as the opening of your vagina (vestibule).\n\n【7】Vulvar tissue might look slightly inflamed or swollen. More often, your vulva appears normal.\n\n【8】A similar condition, vestibulodynia, causes pain only when pressure is applied to the area surrounding the entrance to your vagina.\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】Although women often don't mention vulvodynia to their doctors, the condition is fairly common.\n\n【11】If you have pain in your genital area, discuss it with your doctor or ask for a referral to a gynecologist. It's important to have your doctor rule out more easily treatable causes of vulvar pain — for instance, yeast or bacterial infections, herpes, precancerous skin conditions, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and medical problems such as diabetes.\n\n【12】It's also important not to repeatedly use over-the-counter treatments for yeast infections without seeing your doctor. Once your doctor has evaluated your symptoms, he or she can recommend treatments or ways to help you manage your pain.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】Doctors don't know what causes vulvodynia, but possible contributing factors include:\n\n【15】*   Injury to or irritation of the nerves surrounding your vulvar region\n*   Past vaginal infections\n*   Allergies or sensitive skin\n*   Hormonal changes\n*   Muscle spasm or weakness in the pelvic floor, which supports the uterus, bladder and bowel\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】Because it can be painful and frustrating and can keep you from wanting sex, vulvodynia can cause emotional problems. For example, fear of having sex can cause spasms in the muscles around your vagina (vaginismus). Other complications might include:\n\n【18】*   Anxiety\n*   Depression\n*   Sleep disturbances\n*   Sexual dysfunction\n*   Altered body image\n*   Relationship problems\n*   Decreased quality of life", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:32:01", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:32:05", "cost": 4.076}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:32:03", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:31:55"}

It tends to happen in the arms and legs.\n\n【2】MFS starts as a growth of cells that can grow into healthy body tissue. MFS might cause a lump under the skin that grows slowly. It often isn't painful. MFS happens most often in adults over 50.\n\n【3】MFS is one of many types of cancer that start in the connective tissues that support and surround the organs, bones and muscles. Doctors sometimes call these cancers soft tissue sarcomas.\n\n【4】Doctors are still learning about what makes MFS different from other types of soft tissue sarcoma. Sometimes it looks like a growth that isn't cancer. This can make it hard to get a correct diagnosis and prompt treatment to control the cancer.\n\n【5】### Diagnosis\n\n【6】Tests and procedures used to diagnose MFS include:\n\n【7】*   **Physical exam.** Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and health. The provider will check your body for signs of cancer.\n*   **Imaging tests.** Imaging tests can help your provider see the cancer's size. One test used for this reason is MRI. You might have other imaging tests to look for signs that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. This might be with a CT scan.\n*   **Getting a sample of tissue for testing.** A biopsy procedure involves taking some of the suspicious tissue for testing in a lab. Lab tests can show if you have cancer and what type. To get the tissue sample, sometimes your provider uses a needle to collect the cells. Sometimes surgery is needed to get the tissue sample.\n\n【8】MFS diagnosis can be hard because it looks like other types of cancer and other conditions that aren't cancer. Careful imaging and advanced lab tests can help your health care team make the correct diagnosis.\n\n【9】### Treatment\n\n【10】MFS treatment often involves surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments include radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\n\n【11】MFS often comes back after treatment. When it comes back, it can be more aggressive. Your health care team creates a treatment plan with the goal of getting rid of all the cancer cells. This makes it more likely that the cancer won't come back.\n\n【12】Which treatment is best for you will depend on your cancer. Your care team considers the size and location of your cancer. A cancer that grows quickly has different treatment options than a cancer that grows slowly.\n\n【13】#### Surgery\n\n【14】The goal of surgery is to cut out as much of the cancer as possible. If all the MFS is removed, surgery might be the only treatment needed.\n\n【15】Sometimes it's hard to get all the MFS because this cancer tends to spread out as it grows. It can grow deep into the tissue. Sometimes surgeons can't see all the cancer to make sure it's removed.\n\n【16】In the past, surgeons often had to remove a limb to get rid of all the cancer. Today that's often not needed because of newer treatments. Sometimes radiation therapy and chemotherapy are used before surgery to shrink the cancer. This makes it easier to remove.\n\n【17】#### Radiation therapy\n\n【18】Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams to kill cancer cells. The energy beams can come from X-rays, protons and other sources.\n\n【19】Radiation might be done before surgery to help shrink the MFS. It can also be done after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might be left behind.\n\n【20】#### Chemotherapy\n\n【21】Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill cancer cells. It might help control a MFS that's growing quickly. It might be an option if MFS doesn't respond to other treatments.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:56:33", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:58:02", "cost": 88.773}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:58:01", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:56:32"}

Gengraf\n2.  Neoral\n3.  SandIMMUNE\n\n【2】### Canadian Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Apo-cycloSPORINE\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Cyclosporine is used together with other medicines to prevent the body from rejecting a transplanted organ (eg, kidney, liver, or heart). It belongs to a group of medicines known as immunosuppressive agents.\n\n【6】When a patient receives an organ transplant, the body's white blood cells will try to get rid of (reject) the transplanted organ. Cyclosporine works by suppressing the immune system to prevent the white blood cells from trying to get rid of the transplanted organ.\n\n【7】Cyclosporine is also used to treat severe rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have failed treatment with methotrexate. This medicine is also used to treat adults with severe plaque psoriasis after other treatments (eg, PUVA, retinoids, methotrexate) failed.\n\n【8】Cyclosporine is a very strong medicine. It can cause side effects that can be very serious, such as kidney problems. It may also decrease the body's ability to fight infections. You and your doctor should talk about the benefits of this medicine as well as the risks of using it.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Capsule, Liquid Filled\n*   Solution\n*   Capsule\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of cyclosporine have not been performed in children receiving organ transplants. However, no pediatric-specific problems have been documented to date.\n\n【18】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of cyclosporine in children with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【19】### Geriatric\n\n【20】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of cyclosporine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have high blood pressure or age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving cyclosporine.\n\n【21】### Breastfeeding\n\n【22】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【23】### Drug Interactions\n\n【24】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

Your doctor may adjust your dose as needed.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【55】### Missed Dose\n\n【56】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【57】### Storage\n\n【58】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【59】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【60】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【61】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【62】Do not keep the oral liquid in the refrigerator. Throw away any unused medicine 60 days after the bottle is opened for the first time.\n\n【63】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【64】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【65】You will also need to have your blood pressure measured before starting this medicine and while you are using it. If you notice any change to your recommended blood pressure, call your doctor right away. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.\n\n【66】Do not take Neoral® if you are receiving treatment for psoriasis, such as PUVA or UVB therapy, methotrexate (Rheumatrex®), coal tar, or radiation therapy.\n\n【67】Check with your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms: blood in the urine, change in the frequency of urination or amount of urine, difficulty breathing, drowsiness, increased thirst, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, or swelling of the feet or lower legs, or weakness. These may be symptoms of a serious kidney problem.\n\n【68】Do not use supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without first checking with your doctor.\n\n【69】Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.\n\n【70】Using this medicine may increase your risk of getting skin cancer or cancer of the lymph system (lymphoma). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.\n\n【71】This medicine may increase your risk of developing infections. Avoid being near people who are sick while you are using this medicine. Wash your hands often. Tell your doctor if you have any kind of infection before you start using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you have ever had an infection that would not go away or an infection that kept coming back.\n\n【72】This medicine may increase your risk of developing rare and serious virus infections, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN). The BK virus may affect how your kidneys work and cause a transplanted kidney to fail. Check with your doctor right away if you are having more than one of these symptoms: bloody urine, a decreased frequency or amount of urine, increased thirst, loss of appetite, lower back or side pain, nausea, swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs, trouble breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting, or weight gain.\n\n【73】While you are being treated with cyclosporine, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Cyclosporine may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.\n\n【74】In some patients (usually younger patients), tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of the gums may appear soon after treatment with cyclosporine is started. Brushing and flossing your teeth, carefully and regularly, and massaging your gums may help prevent this. See your dentist regularly to have your teeth cleaned. Check with your medical doctor or dentist if you have any questions about how to take care of your teeth and gums, or if you notice any tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of your gums.\n\n【75】This medicine may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight and can increase your risk of having skin cancer. If you are being treated for psoriasis, check with your doctor first before having an ultraviolet (UV) light treatment. Use a sunscreen when you are outdoors and avoid sunlamps and tanning beds.\n\n【76】This medicine may cause a serious nervous system problem. Tell your doctor right away if you have the following symptoms: confusion, loss of consciousness, mental changes, muscle weakness, seizures, or vision changes.\n\n【77】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal (eg, St. John's wort) or vitamin supplements.\n\n【78】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【79】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【80】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【81】#### More common\n\n【82】1.

Tricyclic antidepressants, dual reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine, calcium channel α <sub>2 </sub> \\-δ ligands (ie, gabapentin and pregabalin), and topical lidocaine were recommended as first-line treatment options on the basis of the results of randomized clinical trials. Opioid analgesics and tramadol were recommended as second-line treatments that can be considered for first-line use in certain clinical circumstances. Results of several recent clinical trials have become available since the development of these guidelines. These studies have examined botulinum toxin, high-concentration capsaicin patch, lacosamide, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and combination therapies in various neuropathic pain conditions. The increasing number of negative clinical trials of pharmacological treatments for neuropathic pain and ambiguities in the interpretation of these negative trials must also be considered in developing treatment guidelines. The objectives of the current article are to review the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group guidelines for the pharmacological management of neuropathic pain and to provide a brief overview of these recent studies.\n\n【1】DPN ( diabetic peripheral neuropathy ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), HRQoL ( health-related quality of life ), NeuPSIG ( Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group ), NP ( neuropathic pain ), PHN ( postherpetic neuralgia ), RCT ( randomized clinical trial ), SSNRI ( selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ), SSRI ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ), TCA ( tricyclic antidepressant )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:36:42", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:36:49", "cost": 6.508}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:36:48", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:36:41"}

One of the reversals we noted informs this point. The use of percutaneous coronary intervention for patients with stable angina was a widespread practice that was largely contracted in 2007 with the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial.\n\n【3】COURAGE Trial Research Group  \nOptimal medical therapy with or without PCI for stable coronary disease.\n\n【4】Although initial evidence suggested decreased use of stenting in the wake of the COURAGE study, more recent data suggest a resurgence of this practice to pre-COURAGE levels.\n\n【5】An empirical investigation suggests that citations to contradicted practices decrease only a decade after a reversal study.\n\n【6】Persistence of contradicted claims in the literature.\n\n【7】Thus, Warner et al are correct to note that contradicted practices are not immediately withdrawn, and future patients are subjected to reversed interventions. As Hall\n\n【8】Use of the pulmonary artery catheter in critically ill patients: was invention the mother of necessity \\[editorial\\]?\n\n【9】noted with respect to the pulmonary artery catheter over a decade ago, “the extrication from widespread use of a technology that has not been adequately assessed is difficult and painful, and should be made unnecessary by the prospective testing of all technology introduced into critical care in the future.”\n\n【10】The authors’ second point is whether new therapies that replace older ones—based on superiority in well-done trials—should be tested against therapies that have fallen out of favor several generations ago. In effect, the authors ask whether the _transitive property_ is true for trials. If nilotinib is better than imatinib and imatinib is better than interferon, can we safely conclude that nilotinib is better than interferon? There are 2 points here worth making. First, it is always difficult to draw lessons from the case of chronic myleogenous leukemia, in which an exquisitely targeted agent inhibits a key driver mutation and has revolutionized outcomes for an illness. Second, although second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (nilotinib, dasatinib) have improved response rates compared with imatinib, overall survival benefits from using these agents as first-line treatment has yet to be documented, and thus, there remains genuine uncertainty regarding the best first-line therapy,\n\n【11】How I treat newly diagnosed chronic phase CML.\n\n【12】as the authors note. That said, in general, we think it is important to study the history of medical practices, and we generally trust the transitive property in medicine.\n\n【13】Finally, we wish to clarify the terms we use. _Reversal_ refers to a medical practice that is actually no better or worse than a lesser standard; _replacement_ occurs when a new practice legitimately outperforms an older one. The case of chronic myelogenous leukemia is of serial _replacement_ , while stenting for angina constitutes a medical _reversal_ .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:32:17", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:32:27", "cost": 9.423}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:32:27", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:32:17"}

Stress incontinence happens when physical movement or activity — such as coughing, laughing, sneezing, running or heavy lifting — puts pressure (stress) on your bladder, causing you to leak urine. Stress incontinence is not related to psychological stress.\n\n【2】Stress incontinence is different from urgency incontinence and overactive bladder (OAB). If you have urgency incontinence or OAB, your bladder muscle contracts, causing a sudden urge to urinate before you can get to the bathroom. Stress incontinence is much more common in women than in men.\n\n【3】If you have stress incontinence, you may feel embarrassed, isolate yourself, or limit your work and social life. You may also avoid physical and leisure activities. With treatment, you'll likely be able to manage stress incontinence and improve your overall well-being.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】If you have stress incontinence, you may leak urine when you:\n\n【6】*   Cough or sneeze\n*   Laugh\n*   Bend over\n*   Lift something heavy\n*   Exercise\n*   Have sex\n\n【7】You may not leak urine every time you do one of these things. But, any activity that puts pressure on your bladder can make involuntary urine loss more likely, particularly when your bladder is full.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】Talk to your health care provider if your symptoms bother you or interfere with daily activities, such as your work, hobbies and social life.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Stress incontinence occurs when the muscles and other tissues that support the urethra (pelvic floor muscles) and the muscles that control the release of urine (urinary sphincter) weaken.\n\n【12】The bladder expands as it fills with urine. Typically, valve-like muscles in the urethra — the short tube that carries urine out of your body — stay closed as the bladder expands, preventing urine leakage until you reach a bathroom. But when those muscles weaken, anything that exerts force on the abdominal and pelvic muscles — sneezing, bending over, lifting or laughing hard, for instance — can put pressure on your bladder and cause urine leakage.\n\n【13】Your pelvic floor muscles and urinary sphincter may lose strength because of:\n\n【14】*   **Childbirth.** In women, tissue or nerve damage during delivery of a child can weaken the pelvic floor muscles or the sphincter. Stress incontinence from this damage may begin soon after delivery or occur years later.\n*   **Prostate surgery.** In men, the surgical removal of the prostate gland to treat prostate cancer (prostatectomy) is the most common factor leading to stress incontinence. This procedure can weaken the sphincter, which lies directly below the prostate gland and encircles the urethra.\n\n【15】### Contributing factors\n\n【16】Other factors that may worsen stress incontinence include:\n\n【17】*   Illnesses that cause chronic coughing\n*   Obesity\n*   Smoking, which can cause frequent coughing\n*   High-impact activities, such as running and jumping, over many years\n\n【18】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【19】Factors that increase the risk of developing stress incontinence include:\n\n【20】*   **Age.** Physical changes that occur as you age, such as the weakening of muscles, may make you more likely to develop stress incontinence. However, occasional stress incontinence can occur at any age.\n*   **Type of childbirth delivery.** Women who've had a vaginal delivery are more likely to develop urinary incontinence than women who've delivered via a cesarean section. Women who've had a forceps delivery to more rapidly deliver a healthy baby may also have a greater risk of stress incontinence. Women who've had a vacuum-assisted delivery don't appear to have a higher risk for stress incontinence.\n*   **Body weight.** People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of stress incontinence. Excess weight increases pressure on the abdominal and pelvic organs.\n*   **Previous pelvic surgery.** Hysterectomy in women and surgery for prostate cancer in men can weaken the muscles that support the bladder and urethra, increasing the risk of stress incontinence.\n\n【21】Complications\n-------------\n\n【22】Complications of stress incontinence may include:\n\n【23】*   **Emotional distress.** If you experience stress incontinence with your daily activities, you may feel embarrassed and distressed by the condition. It can disrupt your work, social activities, relationships and even your sex life.

Mayo Clinic has a long history and vibrant culture of using business consulting, analytics, engineering, and operations research to enhance patient care. More than 100 years ago, Henry Plummer, MD, one of the first physicians hired by Mayo Clinic, applied systems engineering principles to medical practice. He developed the unified patient medical record, conveyors, and pneumatic tubes to transport clinical documents within the campus, a color-coded light system to indicate the occupancy status of a patient examination room, a system of underground walkways connecting campus buildings, and many policies, templates, and forms.\n\n【7】The Doctors Mayo.\n\n【8】1st ed.

A key lesson from his work is that efficiency and best practices need to be designed and engineered systematically rather than left to individual initiative to achieve sustainable outcomes and excellent patient experience.\n\n【12】The Early Years\n---------------\n\n【13】Immediately after World War II, it became clear that “systemized” innovations would be vital for Mayo Clinic's success.\n\n【14】The Doctors Mayo.\n\n【15】1st ed. The University of Minnesota Press , Minneapolis, MN 1941\n\n【16】Mayo Roots: Profiling the Origins of Mayo Clinic.\n\n【17】Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research , Rochester, MN 1990\n\n【18】To explore this concept, Mayo Clinic leaders benchmarked with other institutions. According to Richard W. Cleeremans, former Section Head of Systems and Procedures, Mayo Clinic leaders visited the “Methods and Procedures” section of the Prudential Life Insurance Company and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in New York City (oral communication, Janine R. Kamath, MA, MBA, 2007). They were impressed with the “methods men,” whose backgrounds in industrial engineering and accounting provided the skills to develop procedures and design systems in a timely way.\n\n【19】Mayo Clinic leaders decided to replicate this practice and establish a team of industrial engineers at the clinic. This decision was aligned with Mayo Clinic's commitment to the patient, the physician-patient relationship, and Dr Plummer's conviction that the system and organization of the clinical practice was important and worthy of management attention. Postwar conditions had presented many new problems, and the procedures used at Mayo Clinic and its primary hospital, Saint Marys Hospital, were in need of restudy, especially those relating to the requesting, reporting, and recording of laboratory tests. Patient admission and registration procedures, x-ray film storage, and medical records also needed to be reviewed.\n\n【20】_Minutes of the Meeting of the Executive Committee_ . Rochester, Minnesota: Mayo Historical Suite, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research; July 14, 1947.\n\n【21】Mayo Clinic leaders presented a proposal for the creation of a new section within the Department of Administration. The minutes of the Board of Governors record the formation of the Section of Procedures and Records (now known as the Department of Management Engineering & Internal Consulting): As recorded in the written minutes of the Mayo Clinic Board of Governors on July 16, 1947: The Board approved the recommendation of the Executive and Coordinating Committees that a section be established in the Administrative Department to be concerned with procedures and records. It further concurs in the recommendation of the committees that Mr. E. H. Schlitgus be appointed head of this section… Mr. Schlitgus will devote full time to an analysis of all present methods of record-keeping and storage, ordering and reporting tests, and Clinic-Hospital functions, with the ultimate purpose of simplification of procedures and more efficient operation of the routines employed.\n\n【22】_Minutes of the Meeting of the Board of Governors_ .

Rochester, Minnesota: Mayo Historical Suite, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research; July 14, 1947.\n\n【25】In a classic blend of leadership and early adoption, Mayo Clinic became one of the first medical institutions to create a dedicated team of staff to specialize in “methods” and “systems.” These pioneers of engineering, integration, and innovation were open to learning from all spheres of work and life. They were risk takers with a passion for developing and implementing creative solutions focused on the needs of the patient. They reported the benefits of synthesizing the fields of medical science and engineering to serve patients and to provide colleagues with tools and methods to do their work most effectively. Based on an interview with Richard W. Cleeremans in 2007, early projects of the Section of Procedures and Records included developing a patient registration process for hospital patients, managing forms to support clinical workflows, developing procedure guides for physicians, and conducting space studies to accommodate storage needs for medical histories and x-ray films (oral communication, Janine R. Kamath, MA, MBA, 2007). The section was also integral to the planning, design, and occupancy of the 10-story Mayo Building, the largest construction project at Mayo Clinic in a generation. Completed in 1953, the building contained several unique facility design elements to support novel processes and systems, including a pneumatic tube system, medical history drop chutes, bucket lifts, and card conveyor belts.\n\n【26】The Doctors Mayo.\n\n【27】1st ed.

For example, S&P was asked to lead the development of the Mayo Clinic paper form specifications (size, paper weight, type of ink, etc) along with the _Mayo Clinic Forms Manual_ , resulting in a centralized method of forms control in 1964. In conjunction with the Coordinating Committee, S&P was responsible for the design, printing, and procedures for the 1100 forms that were part of the forms control program. The cost of printing these forms on an annual basis was estimated to be in excess of $250,000.\n\n【32】_Mayo Clinic Forms Manual_ . Rochester, Minnesota: Mayo Historical Suite, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research; July 8, 1964.\n\n【33】The Expansion Years\n-------------------\n\n【34】The mid-1980s through the early 2000s was a time of major capital investment, construction, and expansion for Mayo Clinic. While the Rochester campus was expanding, Mayo Clinic was also growing its physical presence with the opening of the Mayo Clinic campuses in Florida in 1986 and in Arizona in 1987 . On the basis of its contributions to the Rochester campus, S&P was established on-site in Florida and Arizona. Initial efforts focused on facilities development, supply distribution processes, staffing, nursing and surgery workflows, and information technology implementation. In the early 1990s, Mayo Clinic further expanded its operations with the establishment of the Mayo Clinic Health System in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa. An S&P unit was created to support the health system .\n\n【35】Figure 1 Composite view of Mayo Clinic campuses, including (clockwise) Rochester, Minnesota; Jacksonville, Florida; Scottsdale, Arizona; and Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\n【36】The turn of the 21st century witnessed the largest capital construction and infrastructure development initiative for patient care in the history of Mayo Clinic. Known as the Practice Integration Projects, this Rochester initiative connected new and existing buildings with a patient-centric focus. The Gonda Building, for example, was designed with the concept of providers coming to the patient rather than patients going to multiple provider locations. The S&P division was involved in the design, space and equipment planning, workflow, electronic systems assessment, and flow of patient medical information.\n\n【37】Kerry Olsen, MD, physician leader of the Practice Integration Projects, recalled in February 2017: In the 1990s and early 2000s, S&P played a major role in practice analysis concerning patient flow, physician time with patients, and other factors. Their studies and recommendations were used to assess needs for staff and space, and to develop practice efficiency options. We used this model in planning the Gonda Building. It was incredibly helpful (written communication, Janine R. Kamath, MA, MBA, 2017).\n\n【38】Complementing the physical expansion, Mayo Clinic embarked on a virtual outreach in 1994 with the establishment of the Ask Mayo Clinic nurse triage telephone line, which provided patients with 24-hour/7-day access to a nurse for clinical guidance.\n\n【39】Mayo Clinic  \nAsk Mayo Clinic brochure.\n\n【40】Five years later, a United Arab Emirates telemedicine pilot using store-and-forward technology was conducted. The pilot evaluated the transmission of patient clinical information from around the world to Mayo Clinic specialists for timely review. Systems and Procedures partnered with Mayo Clinic colleagues to develop processes that integrated the software and telecommunications technology with the clinical practice, ultimately allowing Mayo Clinic to serve patients in distant areas. Today, the engineering and consulting staff supports innovative initiatives in the areas of connected and digital health, which use technology to engage Mayo Clinic patients and their caregivers in new ways. For example, staff supports implementation of video telemedicine to reach patients outside the walls of Mayo Clinic, assuring care coordination and documentation. Another key engagement is remote monitoring of patients in their own homes to collect and analyze physiological and medical data.\n\n【41】Mayo Clinic's Center for Connected Care intranet site.\n\n【42】The age of the electronic medical record was on the horizon and promised to considerably disrupt health care. Mayo Clinic worked systematically to move from paper to computerized medical records starting in the early 1990s. Together with clinical informatics and information technology, S&P co-led the automation of critical care and hospital charting, outpatient documentation, patient orders and scheduling, patient-provided information, and laboratory results.\n\n【43】Moving toward an electronic medical record was tremendously beneficial for Mayo Clinic. However, the dual paper and electronic medical record created inefficiencies. In 2002, Mayo Clinic leaders decided to replace the paper medical record . A multidisciplinary, physician-led team was formed to enable this important endeavor. Systems and Procedures was responsible for the process and workload analysis, systems reengineering, standardization of procedures, training, implementation, and impact assessment. As more data became electronic, operational infrastructure and processes were developed to enable data-driven and evidence-based decisions. By 2005, Mayo Clinic had one of the largest integrated electronic medical record systems in the world, positively affecting the work of approximately 25,000 employees directly involved in patient care.\n\n【44】A new chapter in Mayo's long history—MICS takes the medical record electronic. Message from David Mohr, MD, Chair, MICS Subcommittee. _This Week at Mayo Clinic_ . 14(46).\n\n【45】Figure 2 Harwick Building, paper medical records storage.\n\n【46】The “systems” philosophy of S&P helped deliver best practices across multiple initiatives and ensure that insights gained from one project would be available to help other projects, including:\n\n【47】*   •\n\n【48】    Developing the first record retention policy\n\n【49】*   •\n\n【50】    Designing and implementing a system to computerize Mayo Clinic registration procedures and the central appointment desk system\n\n【51】*   •\n\n【52】    Conducting environmental and benchmarking studies and developing the first formal strategic planning process and framework for Mayo Clinic\n\n【53】It is important to note that S&P's focus on innovation and transformation was, and continues to be, reflective in the projects done with Mayo Clinic research and education. The comprehensive research management system was implemented to enhance the management of key research priorities. The goals of this integrated system included optimizing clinical trial management and implementing scalable shared support services for research. The expertise of S&P was used in the design, development, change management, and implementation of the comprehensive research management system. The redesign reduced the time from ideation through translation of clinical trials from 125 to 65 days (written communication, Dorothy A. Larsen, MA, 2014). In addition, S&P facilitated the reengineering of Mayo Clinic's Institutional Review Board process by applying Lean methodology to redesign the process, creating procedures and checklists, and coordinating the associated pilot studies, personnel training, and implementation of recommendations. The new Institutional Review Board model improved employee satisfaction, reduced approval cycle times and study expenses, and ensured more efficient adherence to federal and institutional regulations. In the education arena, Mayo Clinic approved a proposal to expand the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science to Arizona and Florida. A 4-year medical school was opened in Scottsdale, Arizona, in 2016. Systems and Procedures played an important role in making the Mayo Clinic School of Medicine—Arizona Campus—a reality. A heartening accomplishment was the recognition by medical school leaders that including systems engineering and the science of health care delivery in the curriculum for future physicians is critical to their understanding of the potential of these disciplines to transform health care.\n\n【54】As the needs of the health care industry continued to change rapidly, it was imperative that new models of collaboration be explored. Systems and Procedures partnered with Health Care Policy and Research, the Center for Innovation, Quality Management Services, and other Mayo Clinic departments to form a Systems Engineering/Operations Research Collaborative in 2005. Its mission was to study, share, and encourage the use of Systems Engineering/Operations Research tools in operations, clinical practice, administration, research, and education at Mayo Clinic.\n\n【55】Minutes of the Rochester Executive Board.\n\n【56】March 24, 2008\n\n【57】The collaborative sponsored educational opportunities for Mayo Clinic staff, including a monthly seminar with national experts, discussion forums, a conference on health care systems engineering and operations research, computer-based simulation workshops, and a master's level Mayo Graduate School course.\n\n【58】On another front, S&P partnered with the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Planning Services, Quality Management Services, and clinical practice leaders to create the Mayo Clinic Quality Academy. An immersive 10-day quality improvement course for multidisciplinary teams was designed to teach process improvement methodology. Systems and Procedures provided engineering and project management support for projects such as:\n\n【59】*   •\n\n【60】    _Clinical:_ acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia, surgical infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and the use of the anticoagulant drug warfarin\n\n【61】*   •\n\n【62】    _Administrative:_ wait time, abandoned calls, accounts receivable, patient access, business services, and referring-physician communications\n\n【63】Recent Evolution\n----------------\n\n【64】In 2016, S&P was renamed the Department of Management Engineering & Internal Consulting (ME&IC) to better reflect the breadth and depth of the work and engagement across the organization.\n\n【65】Department of Management Engineering & Internal Consulting. _Analyze This eNewsletter_ , January 12, 2016.\n\n【66】Today, ME&IC has more than 200 members, including administrative leadership, health system engineers, project managers, and support staff. The team serves all Mayo Clinic sites and regions. The Department of Management Engineering & Internal Consulting also supports the Mayo Clinic Care Network comprising more than 45 health care organizations in the United States and abroad as well as other business development entities of Mayo Clinic.\n\n【67】In a dynamic health care environment, ME&IC recognizes the importance of growing its value and transforming its operations to ensure performance excellence. The department has developed a number of best practice approaches, including a standardized business consulting model, a talent-management program, and a balanced scorecard. The Department of Management Engineering & Internal Consulting aligns the use of its professional frameworks and methods to serve the needs of its clients, including (1) queuing theory to optimize patient and staff surgical flows, (2) system dynamics models for resource allocation, (3) simulation modeling to design facilities and spaces, (4) decision-support methods to manage patient conditions, and (5) analytics and systems engineering for expense management. The staff of ME&IC strives to bring an objective, big picture perspective to all projects, including an understanding of patient and provider needs, organizational knowledge and relationships, and upstream and downstream implications. To position ME&IC for the next 5 years, the vision, value proposition, and service lines have been refined as outlined in Figure 3 .\n\n【68】Figure 3 An overview of the Department of Management Engineering & Internal Consulting (ME&IC).\n\n【69】Continuous professional development, scholarship, and learning are critical to providing the best service. The staff of ME&IC is involved in presenting at national and international conferences, publishing in peer-reviewed journals, serving as faculty in academic institutions, and seeking membership on professional boards and committees.\n\n【70】Although the quantitative value of ME&IC to Mayo Clinic has been reported over many years, the team's qualitative advantages are also important differentiators, including:\n\n【71】*   •\n\n【72】    Providing end-to-end services from project initiation through execution and sustainability\n\n【73】*   •\n\n【74】    Building professional relationships that lead to improved client understanding, buy-in, and ownership\n\n【75】*   •\n\n【76】    Expediting project deliverables and translating best practices in a contextual and result-oriented manner\n\n【77】*   •\n\n【78】    Serving as a talent pipeline for leadership and other positions, thereby extending the “spirit” of engineering and consulting throughout Mayo Clinic\n\n【79】To foster Mayo Clinic's primary value—“The needs of the patient come first”—ME&IC assesses its impact on patient experience, as highlighted by the patient experience diagram in Figure 4 .\n\n【80】Figure 4 Impact of engineering, applied analytics, and operations research on the Mayo Clinic patient experience.\n\n【81】The contributions of ME&IC have been recognized in several ways. The Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science added academic rank for the field of Health Care Systems Engineering in 2011. In 2014, Mayo Clinic was awarded the Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences Prize for application and integration of advanced analytics, systems engineering, and operations research.\n\n【82】INFORMS website.\n\n【83】ME&IC was judged the overall winner of the Association of Internal Management Consultants' 2015-2016 Internal Consulting Excellence Award for its delivery of high-quality consulting processes and sharing of best practice methodologies with the global consulting community.\n\n【84】Into the Future\n---------------\n\n【85】In 2016, ME&IC became a shared service formally integrating the ME&IC teams across all Mayo Clinic sites. This allows the department to provide greater value through consistent and best practice knowledge and skills, a converged and streamlined core internal infrastructure, and a strategic set of service lines. It also supports establishing a national reputation through additional professional relationships and contributions.\n\n【86】The complex and increasingly competitive health care environment will continue to challenge Mayo Clinic. The pressure to accelerate the delivery of quantifiable results as health care providers adapt to payment reform, new models of care, and an ambiguous future will be important to skillfully manage. ME&IC has a rich legacy to lean on as it navigates these challenges and strives to deliver sustainable value at Mayo Clinic. The primary focus of the department will be to enable the priorities of Mayo Clinic by using novel and best practice engineering and consulting approaches and methods. ME&IC’s greatest asset is its diverse workforce with varied educational backgrounds and global professional experience in different industries.\n\n【87】Closing Thoughts\n----------------\n\n【88】Mayo Clinic has been a pioneer in blending science with engineering to deliver high-value patient care and experience. The culture of collaboration and continuous improvement traces its roots to the early efforts of Dr Plummer. For 70 years, Mayo Clinic leadership has recognized consulting and engineering as important contributing disciplines for sustained excellence and market differentiation.\n\n【89】As the enduring mission and quest for answers continues, ME&IC is inspired by the spirit of systems thinking and the words of Dr William Worrall Mayo . The past has shown us that there are no final answers. We have to be open and curious as we strive to discover the next steps in our exciting journey.\n\n【90】Figure 5 Quote from a letter by Dr William Worrall Mayo.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【90】Figure 5 Quote from a letter by Dr William Worrall Mayo.", "content": "【0】Seventy Years of Management Engineering and Consulting: Integrating Health Care Delivery for an Enduring Mission\nOn July 21, 2017, the Department of Management Engineering & Internal Consulting (ME&IC) celebrated its 70th anniversary.

Rochester, Minnesota: Mayo Historical Suite, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research; July 8, 1964.\n\n【33】The Expansion Years\n-------------------\n\n【34】The mid-1980s through the early 2000s was a time of major capital investment, construction, and expansion for Mayo Clinic. While the Rochester campus was expanding, Mayo Clinic was also growing its physical presence with the opening of the Mayo Clinic campuses in Florida in 1986 and in Arizona in 1987 . On the basis of its contributions to the Rochester campus, S&P was established on-site in Florida and Arizona. Initial efforts focused on facilities development, supply distribution processes, staffing, nursing and surgery workflows, and information technology implementation. In the early 1990s, Mayo Clinic further expanded its operations with the establishment of the Mayo Clinic Health System in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa. An S&P unit was created to support the health system .\n\n【35】Figure 1 Composite view of Mayo Clinic campuses, including (clockwise) Rochester, Minnesota; Jacksonville, Florida; Scottsdale, Arizona; and Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\n【36】The turn of the 21st century witnessed the largest capital construction and infrastructure development initiative for patient care in the history of Mayo Clinic. Known as the Practice Integration Projects, this Rochester initiative connected new and existing buildings with a patient-centric focus. The Gonda Building, for example, was designed with the concept of providers coming to the patient rather than patients going to multiple provider locations. The S&P division was involved in the design, space and equipment planning, workflow, electronic systems assessment, and flow of patient medical information.\n\n【37】Kerry Olsen, MD, physician leader of the Practice Integration Projects, recalled in February 2017: In the 1990s and early 2000s, S&P played a major role in practice analysis concerning patient flow, physician time with patients, and other factors. Their studies and recommendations were used to assess needs for staff and space, and to develop practice efficiency options. We used this model in planning the Gonda Building. It was incredibly helpful (written communication, Janine R. Kamath, MA, MBA, 2017).\n\n【38】Complementing the physical expansion, Mayo Clinic embarked on a virtual outreach in 1994 with the establishment of the Ask Mayo Clinic nurse triage telephone line, which provided patients with 24-hour/7-day access to a nurse for clinical guidance.\n\n【39】Mayo Clinic  \nAsk Mayo Clinic brochure.\n\n【40】Five years later, a United Arab Emirates telemedicine pilot using store-and-forward technology was conducted. The pilot evaluated the transmission of patient clinical information from around the world to Mayo Clinic specialists for timely review. Systems and Procedures partnered with Mayo Clinic colleagues to develop processes that integrated the software and telecommunications technology with the clinical practice, ultimately allowing Mayo Clinic to serve patients in distant areas. Today, the engineering and consulting staff supports innovative initiatives in the areas of connected and digital health, which use technology to engage Mayo Clinic patients and their caregivers in new ways. For example, staff supports implementation of video telemedicine to reach patients outside the walls of Mayo Clinic, assuring care coordination and documentation. Another key engagement is remote monitoring of patients in their own homes to collect and analyze physiological and medical data.\n\n【41】Mayo Clinic's Center for Connected Care intranet site.\n\n【42】The age of the electronic medical record was on the horizon and promised to considerably disrupt health care. Mayo Clinic worked systematically to move from paper to computerized medical records starting in the early 1990s. Together with clinical informatics and information technology, S&P co-led the automation of critical care and hospital charting, outpatient documentation, patient orders and scheduling, patient-provided information, and laboratory results.\n\n【43】Moving toward an electronic medical record was tremendously beneficial for Mayo Clinic. However, the dual paper and electronic medical record created inefficiencies. In 2002, Mayo Clinic leaders decided to replace the paper medical record . A multidisciplinary, physician-led team was formed to enable this important endeavor. Systems and Procedures was responsible for the process and workload analysis, systems reengineering, standardization of procedures, training, implementation, and impact assessment. As more data became electronic, operational infrastructure and processes were developed to enable data-driven and evidence-based decisions. By 2005, Mayo Clinic had one of the largest integrated electronic medical record systems in the world, positively affecting the work of approximately 25,000 employees directly involved in patient care.\n\n【44】A new chapter in Mayo's long history—MICS takes the medical record electronic. Message from David Mohr, MD, Chair, MICS Subcommittee. _This Week at Mayo Clinic_ . 14(46).\n\n【45】Figure 2 Harwick Building, paper medical records storage.\n\n【46】The “systems” philosophy of S&P helped deliver best practices across multiple initiatives and ensure that insights gained from one project would be available to help other projects, including:\n\n【47】*   •\n\n【48】    Developing the first record retention policy\n\n【49】*   •\n\n【50】    Designing and implementing a system to computerize Mayo Clinic registration procedures and the central appointment desk system\n\n【51】*   •\n\n【52】    Conducting environmental and benchmarking studies and developing the first formal strategic planning process and framework for Mayo Clinic\n\n【53】It is important to note that S&P's focus on innovation and transformation was, and continues to be, reflective in the projects done with Mayo Clinic research and education. The comprehensive research management system was implemented to enhance the management of key research priorities. The goals of this integrated system included optimizing clinical trial management and implementing scalable shared support services for research. The expertise of S&P was used in the design, development, change management, and implementation of the comprehensive research management system. The redesign reduced the time from ideation through translation of clinical trials from 125 to 65 days (written communication, Dorothy A. Larsen, MA, 2014). In addition, S&P facilitated the reengineering of Mayo Clinic's Institutional Review Board process by applying Lean methodology to redesign the process, creating procedures and checklists, and coordinating the associated pilot studies, personnel training, and implementation of recommendations. The new Institutional Review Board model improved employee satisfaction, reduced approval cycle times and study expenses, and ensured more efficient adherence to federal and institutional regulations. In the education arena, Mayo Clinic approved a proposal to expand the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science to Arizona and Florida. A 4-year medical school was opened in Scottsdale, Arizona, in 2016. Systems and Procedures played an important role in making the Mayo Clinic School of Medicine—Arizona Campus—a reality. A heartening accomplishment was the recognition by medical school leaders that including systems engineering and the science of health care delivery in the curriculum for future physicians is critical to their understanding of the potential of these disciplines to transform health care.\n\n【54】As the needs of the health care industry continued to change rapidly, it was imperative that new models of collaboration be explored. Systems and Procedures partnered with Health Care Policy and Research, the Center for Innovation, Quality Management Services, and other Mayo Clinic departments to form a Systems Engineering/Operations Research Collaborative in 2005. Its mission was to study, share, and encourage the use of Systems Engineering/Operations Research tools in operations, clinical practice, administration, research, and education at Mayo Clinic.\n\n【55】Minutes of the Rochester Executive Board.\n\n【56】March 24, 2008\n\n【57】The collaborative sponsored educational opportunities for Mayo Clinic staff, including a monthly seminar with national experts, discussion forums, a conference on health care systems engineering and operations research, computer-based simulation workshops, and a master's level Mayo Graduate School course.\n\n【58】On another front, S&P partnered with the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Planning Services, Quality Management Services, and clinical practice leaders to create the Mayo Clinic Quality Academy. An immersive 10-day quality improvement course for multidisciplinary teams was designed to teach process improvement methodology. Systems and Procedures provided engineering and project management support for projects such as:\n\n【59】*   •\n\n【60】    _Clinical:_ acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia, surgical infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and the use of the anticoagulant drug warfarin\n\n【61】*   •\n\n【62】    _Administrative:_ wait time, abandoned calls, accounts receivable, patient access, business services, and referring-physician communications\n\n【63】Recent Evolution\n----------------\n\n【64】In 2016, S&P was renamed the Department of Management Engineering & Internal Consulting (ME&IC) to better reflect the breadth and depth of the work and engagement across the organization.\n\n【65】Department of Management Engineering & Internal Consulting. _Analyze This eNewsletter_ , January 12, 2016.\n\n【66】Today, ME&IC has more than 200 members, including administrative leadership, health system engineers, project managers, and support staff. The team serves all Mayo Clinic sites and regions. The Department of Management Engineering & Internal Consulting also supports the Mayo Clinic Care Network comprising more than 45 health care organizations in the United States and abroad as well as other business development entities of Mayo Clinic.\n\n【67】In a dynamic health care environment, ME&IC recognizes the importance of growing its value and transforming its operations to ensure performance excellence. The department has developed a number of best practice approaches, including a standardized business consulting model, a talent-management program, and a balanced scorecard. The Department of Management Engineering & Internal Consulting aligns the use of its professional frameworks and methods to serve the needs of its clients, including (1) queuing theory to optimize patient and staff surgical flows, (2) system dynamics models for resource allocation, (3) simulation modeling to design facilities and spaces, (4) decision-support methods to manage patient conditions, and (5) analytics and systems engineering for expense management. The staff of ME&IC strives to bring an objective, big picture perspective to all projects, including an understanding of patient and provider needs, organizational knowledge and relationships, and upstream and downstream implications. To position ME&IC for the next 5 years, the vision, value proposition, and service lines have been refined as outlined in Figure 3 .\n\n【68】Figure 3 An overview of the Department of Management Engineering & Internal Consulting (ME&IC).\n\n【69】Continuous professional development, scholarship, and learning are critical to providing the best service. The staff of ME&IC is involved in presenting at national and international conferences, publishing in peer-reviewed journals, serving as faculty in academic institutions, and seeking membership on professional boards and committees.\n\n【70】Although the quantitative value of ME&IC to Mayo Clinic has been reported over many years, the team's qualitative advantages are also important differentiators, including:\n\n【71】*   •\n\n【72】    Providing end-to-end services from project initiation through execution and sustainability\n\n【73】*   •\n\n【74】    Building professional relationships that lead to improved client understanding, buy-in, and ownership\n\n【75】*   •\n\n【76】    Expediting project deliverables and translating best practices in a contextual and result-oriented manner\n\n【77】*   •\n\n【78】    Serving as a talent pipeline for leadership and other positions, thereby extending the “spirit” of engineering and consulting throughout Mayo Clinic\n\n【79】To foster Mayo Clinic's primary value—“The needs of the patient come first”—ME&IC assesses its impact on patient experience, as highlighted by the patient experience diagram in Figure 4 .\n\n【80】Figure 4 Impact of engineering, applied analytics, and operations research on the Mayo Clinic patient experience.\n\n【81】The contributions of ME&IC have been recognized in several ways. The Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science added academic rank for the field of Health Care Systems Engineering in 2011. In 2014, Mayo Clinic was awarded the Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences Prize for application and integration of advanced analytics, systems engineering, and operations research.\n\n【82】INFORMS website.\n\n【83】ME&IC was judged the overall winner of the Association of Internal Management Consultants' 2015-2016 Internal Consulting Excellence Award for its delivery of high-quality consulting processes and sharing of best practice methodologies with the global consulting community.\n\n【84】Into the Future\n---------------\n\n【85】In 2016, ME&IC became a shared service formally integrating the ME&IC teams across all Mayo Clinic sites. This allows the department to provide greater value through consistent and best practice knowledge and skills, a converged and streamlined core internal infrastructure, and a strategic set of service lines. It also supports establishing a national reputation through additional professional relationships and contributions.\n\n【86】The complex and increasingly competitive health care environment will continue to challenge Mayo Clinic. The pressure to accelerate the delivery of quantifiable results as health care providers adapt to payment reform, new models of care, and an ambiguous future will be important to skillfully manage. ME&IC has a rich legacy to lean on as it navigates these challenges and strives to deliver sustainable value at Mayo Clinic. The primary focus of the department will be to enable the priorities of Mayo Clinic by using novel and best practice engineering and consulting approaches and methods. ME&IC’s greatest asset is its diverse workforce with varied educational backgrounds and global professional experience in different industries.\n\n【87】Closing Thoughts\n----------------\n\n【88】Mayo Clinic has been a pioneer in blending science with engineering to deliver high-value patient care and experience. The culture of collaboration and continuous improvement traces its roots to the early efforts of Dr Plummer. For 70 years, Mayo Clinic leadership has recognized consulting and engineering as important contributing disciplines for sustained excellence and market differentiation.\n\n【89】As the enduring mission and quest for answers continues, ME&IC is inspired by the spirit of systems thinking and the words of Dr William Worrall Mayo . The past has shown us that there are no final answers. We have to be open and curious as we strive to discover the next steps in our exciting journey.\n\n【90】Figure 5 Quote from a letter by Dr William Worrall Mayo.", "index": 24436, "show": true, "start": 24436, "end": 24496, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:24:04", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:25:00", "cost": 56.469}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:25:00", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:24:03"}

There is some basis for this concept when applied to humans, because the human form can be modified as the result of activities and environmental exposure, both influenced by inner temperament. Taken a step further, the more a person interacts with the environment, the more likely outward appearances may change. The same concepts can hold for biomedical publications. Textbooks never (single editions) or seldom (multiple editions) change in response to their environments. Perhaps this is why it is difficult to judge a book by its cover. In contrast, contemporary biomedical journals must continually respond to their evolving environments in attempts to provide higher-quality information and services to readers and deliver them more rapidly and in increasingly more palatable forms. As such, the many features of a contemporary biomedical journal can speak volumes about the intent and motivation of the journal to better serve its audience.\n\n【1】In this regard, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is a fine example. Less than a decade ago, faculty and trainees at Mayo Clinic overwhelmingly authored the _Proceedings_ content, and the journal's Web site offered little content beyond a listing of the monthly tables of contents. Today, the _Proceedings_ , as its byline proclaims, is “authored by physicians worldwide,” and the facade and content of the print journal and Web site reveal the journal's highly engaged (and evolving) relationship with a dynamic, diverse medical world.\n\n【2】Continuous quality improvement is not unique to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ . It is practiced at all leading biomedical journals, although the approach may vary depending on a given journal's mission. While all journals would like to boast of ongoing, unimpeded improvements, the contemporary publishing business, whether in biomedical or other forms of publishing, has experienced historic challenges since 2008. Specifically, the downturn in the global economy, superimposed on a preexisting recession in the publishing industry, created a challenge for many biomedical journals unlike anything they had experienced in more than 4 decades. The magnitude of the insult depends somewhat on the profile of the individual journal or groups of journals, with general/internal medicine journals (the genre of the _Proceedings_ ) and multispecialty journals (an advertising market from which the _Proceedings_ also samples) experiencing severe challenges. As a result, journals' missions and programs have required alteration. For example, within the past few weeks, the _Canadian Medical Association Journal_ ( _CMAJ_ ), one of the pioneers in open access to journal content, has announced that it must restrict open access because of financial concerns.\n\n【3】Letter from the editor: no longer free for all \\[editorial\\].\n\n【4】Letter from the publisher: no longer free for all \\[editorial\\].\n\n【5】Other journals are expected to follow.\n\n【6】These aforementioned challenges have caused the leadership of the _Proceedings_ , and our sponsoring organization Mayo Clinic, to closely examine our mission, practices, and future. The months-long review process was unlike anything the journal had heretofore experienced and, as a result, it caused all to gain a better appreciation of the operations and value of the journal. I am thankful to all who participated in this process, and I am extremely thankful that the process caused us to rededicate ourselves to you, our readers, in an attempt to more effectively deliver a unique, relevant, and timely product each month. This process will cause some alterations in the _Proceedings_ you read in print and online. These changes will make the journal more focused and more extensively engage readers, but they also may lead to more restricted access to the print journal unless readers' voluntary support of the journal expands.\n\n【7】During 2009, we asked _Proceedings_ ' readers to contribute to a voluntary paid subscription (VPS) program. The numerous individual contributions proved the viability of this concept as a revenue stream, and readers' acts of kindness (both through the VPS program and through direct communications with us) profoundly affected the journal's Editorial Board and staff. Unfortunately, the revenue generated by this program was insufficient to offset 2009 losses of advertising and other revenue streams critical to the journal's well-being. Thus, the Editorial Board and I are asking that each of you reexamine your relationship with the _Proceedings_ and again consider VPS participation in 2010 and beyond, either through the journal's Web site or through requests mailed to you. We will await the response to this effort before taking the next steps to ensure sustained journal vitality. Those next steps will most likely involve restricting many complimentary subscriptions to the print journal.\n\n【8】In the few months that we await your response to this petition, the journal will continue its planning to be a more effective and efficient source of information for readers. Let me share with you some of the changes you will witness in 2010 and the rationale for implementation.\n\n【9】Migration From Print-Predominant to Electronic-Predominant Dissemination of Information\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】One of the most common discussion topics at _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is the association between journal finances and methods of publication. Many have asked, “Why don't you simply cease print publication and begin an electronic journal?” There are many answers to this, not the least of which is that we already run a complete print and complete electronic journal, each wholly capable of disseminating existing journal content. However, this is where the simple answers end. Our decisions on journal form relate to both readers' preferences and the business models that dictate print vs electronic publication. It is difficult to predict whether an individual reader will prefer to use print exclusively, electronic exclusively, or both. Readers' ages, specialty interests, and familiarity with computers play a role, but, even after knowing these factors, predicting preferences is an inexact science. Furthermore, traditional journal financial modeling dictates that print subscription sales, print advertising sales, and the marketing and licensing of subsets of journal content are important revenue streams. The cost of printing and mailing the print journal accounts for approximately one-fourth to one-half of journal expenses at most medical journals, depending on the size and quality of the printed journal and the frequency of its publication. Abolishing the print journal may eliminate substantial expense, but the costs of peer review, editing, and related factors still remain in an environment in which revenue from print advertisement has now been removed.\n\n【11】Medical journal editing: who shall pay \\[editorial\\]?\n\n【12】Web sites can have immense readership, but advertisers do not pay parity for audiences reached electronically compared with those reached in print. Thus, in the current era, print journals tend to subsidize their Web versions, not vice versa. Additionally, according to industry experts our journal has consulted, there is no historic precedent for a long-standing print-predominant journal of the scope and magnitude of the _Proceedings_ converting to electronic-only and surviving. Hence, it is imperative that we act with caution.\n\n【13】For all the aforementioned reasons, the _Proceedings_ will continue to maintain both its print and electronic forms, although we will continue to migrate activities in the direction of the Web site, predominantly by growing Web activities coupled with highly targeted diminution of print activities. The ambient financial markets and the extent of readers' participation in the VPS program will dictate the end effect on the print journal.\n\n【14】New Web Site Activities for Previously Printed Materials\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The _Proceedings_ plans to entice readers to use its Web site more often by improving the quality and novelty of its Web content. Specifically, the Web site will contain added features that are not found in the print-only journal.\n\n【16】Beginning in October 2009, the _Proceedings_ began publishing 2 Residents Clinics articles per month, with 1 of these published as electronic only and the other as both electronic and print. We will continue this pattern for the foreseeable future. In 2010, we also will begin migrating Medical Images to the Web site, and we will publish more of the images. Book reviews and the few historical articles we publish will also move to the Web site.\n\n【17】We will begin a new approach to publishing select full-length original articles, reviews, and other content through a program entitled “Online First.” These articles will be published on the Web site before print publication, some in mid-month. Our attempt is to share time-sensitive articles with readers more rapidly and to have weekly or biweekly updates to Web-based content so that readers will experience new content more frequently when they visit our Web site. We will periodically create Web-based—only appendices for print articles so that the print journal content will be more focused, yet readers will not be deprived of valuable background information for an individual article. Furthermore, we will attempt to include more color images on the electronic version of articles, regardless of whether the print version contains black-and-white or color images. Authors' fees for color figures will be initiated to help cover the costs in the print, but not in the electronic journal.\n\n【18】Materials released to our Web site, whether as Online First articles or in some other format, will receive the same high-quality editing and layout that you have come to expect from the _Proceedings._ Articles published online only will be indexed in MEDLINE and will be acknowledged in the monthly print table of contents and will receive a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) number to facilitate indexing.\n\n【19】The _Proceedings'_ archives of articles available online will also expand in 2010 and cover the interval from 1995 to the present. Given that _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ has a respectable impact factor (currently 4.81) plus a 7.9-year citation half-life (Thompson ISI, New York, NY) for published articles, this combination places the journal among the upper tier of those having long-term value to readers. As such, by expanding the beginning of our archive collection of articles from the previous 2002 to 1995, readers should find additional, valuable materials that have withstood the test of time.\n\n【20】Additional New Web Site Activities\n----------------------------------\n\n【21】Beginning in August 2009, the _Proceedings_ began publishing on its Web site audiovisual podcasts of interviews with authors, as well as a monthly audio podcast from the Editor-in-Chief reviewing highlights of each monthly issue. From the former, _Proceedings_ ' readers have been able to attach a face to the names of authors and learn from those authors the interpretation of their articles, the motivation behind their research, and other valuable features. For example, in September, Dr Gordon Dewald\n\n【22】Fluorescence in situ hybridization to visualize genetic abnormalities in interphase cells of acinar cell carcinoma, ductal adenocarcinoma, and islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas.\n\n【23】discussed his original research article on new biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. Also that month, Dr Barbara Yawn\n\n【24】Health care utilization and cost burden of herpes zoster in a community population.\n\n【25】reviewed her research that quantified the effects of herpes zoster infection on health care utilization and cost of care in a community population of patients. In October, Dr Bernard Gersh discussed cell therapy for cardiac injury, a topic covered in his review article.\n\n【26】Cardiac cell repair therapy: a clinical perspective.\n\n【27】Through these interviews, we hope that the written words and images will come alive for readers, enhancing their journal experience.\n\n【28】Currently, the above-mentioned podcasts are disseminated additionally on SciVee  and YouTube .\n\n【29】e-TOCs (Electronic Tables-of-Contents)\n--------------------------------------\n\n【30】Invitations to Participate in the VPS Program\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【31】In 2010, just as in 2009, we will send readers requests for VPS support in the February and August issues. On receipt, we would appreciate if you would indicate whether you prefer to contribute toward a print subscription or an electronic-only subscription or whether your current circumstances do not allow you to participate. Any of these responses will provide us valuable information that will be used for planning purposes.\n\n【32】You can participate in the VPS program by returning the print request form or by purchasing a subscription on our Web site and choosing the box indicating you would like to voluntarily pay for a subscription.\n\n【33】We will use targeted mailings in an attempt to send VPS invitations only to those who have not contributed within the previous 6 months. We estimate that participation in the VPS program by 25% of readers who currently receive complimentary subscriptions will allow us to continue the existing mission of the journal, including the changes mentioned earlier. As I have shared with you previously,\n\n【34】The business of providing high-quality content to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings'_ readers: 2009 and beyond \\[editorial\\].\n\n【35】in accordance with the journal's core principles, should we experience any revenue excesses from the VPS program, all funds will remain with the journal and will be used to improve the quality and scope of the journal's mission. Specifically, funds will not be diverted to the general funds of our sponsor or publisher.\n\n【36】In Closing\n----------\n\n【37】Through circumstances not of our choosing, the contemporary _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , along with its brother and sister general/internal medicine journals, has experienced a financial environment that threatens both the form and the substance of the monthly journal. We choose not to let this challenge consume us but instead will use it as an opportunity to make our journal even better and more relevant to readers' needs. From one perspective, these changes are just another step in a continuum of improvements the journal has made in recent years; however, this time there is a greater sense of urgency. Throughout these changes, the Editorial Board and staff have gained comfort from the veneration of the journal expressed in readers' notes, telephone calls, and other contacts. However, we must ask you, the readers, to consider taking one more step in your support of the journal. Participation in the VPS program will help ensure valuable journal activities in this time of transition and beyond, regardless of whether the financial challenges seen in 2008 and 2009 decrease or persist. Either way, through your support, we intend to survive and continually improve the journal so that, for years to come, it will be a favorite source of information for you and your fellow students of medicine.\n\n【38】Thank you for your ongoing interest in and support of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【38】Thank you for your ongoing interest in and support of Mayo Clinic Proceedings .", "content": "【0】The Physiognomy of \nThe concept of physiognomy holds that the inner character and qualities of a being are reflected in its external features.

Those next steps will most likely involve restricting many complimentary subscriptions to the print journal.\n\n【8】In the few months that we await your response to this petition, the journal will continue its planning to be a more effective and efficient source of information for readers. Let me share with you some of the changes you will witness in 2010 and the rationale for implementation.\n\n【9】Migration From Print-Predominant to Electronic-Predominant Dissemination of Information\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】One of the most common discussion topics at _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is the association between journal finances and methods of publication. Many have asked, “Why don't you simply cease print publication and begin an electronic journal?” There are many answers to this, not the least of which is that we already run a complete print and complete electronic journal, each wholly capable of disseminating existing journal content. However, this is where the simple answers end. Our decisions on journal form relate to both readers' preferences and the business models that dictate print vs electronic publication. It is difficult to predict whether an individual reader will prefer to use print exclusively, electronic exclusively, or both. Readers' ages, specialty interests, and familiarity with computers play a role, but, even after knowing these factors, predicting preferences is an inexact science. Furthermore, traditional journal financial modeling dictates that print subscription sales, print advertising sales, and the marketing and licensing of subsets of journal content are important revenue streams. The cost of printing and mailing the print journal accounts for approximately one-fourth to one-half of journal expenses at most medical journals, depending on the size and quality of the printed journal and the frequency of its publication. Abolishing the print journal may eliminate substantial expense, but the costs of peer review, editing, and related factors still remain in an environment in which revenue from print advertisement has now been removed.\n\n【11】Medical journal editing: who shall pay \\[editorial\\]?\n\n【12】Web sites can have immense readership, but advertisers do not pay parity for audiences reached electronically compared with those reached in print. Thus, in the current era, print journals tend to subsidize their Web versions, not vice versa. Additionally, according to industry experts our journal has consulted, there is no historic precedent for a long-standing print-predominant journal of the scope and magnitude of the _Proceedings_ converting to electronic-only and surviving. Hence, it is imperative that we act with caution.\n\n【13】For all the aforementioned reasons, the _Proceedings_ will continue to maintain both its print and electronic forms, although we will continue to migrate activities in the direction of the Web site, predominantly by growing Web activities coupled with highly targeted diminution of print activities. The ambient financial markets and the extent of readers' participation in the VPS program will dictate the end effect on the print journal.\n\n【14】New Web Site Activities for Previously Printed Materials\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The _Proceedings_ plans to entice readers to use its Web site more often by improving the quality and novelty of its Web content. Specifically, the Web site will contain added features that are not found in the print-only journal.\n\n【16】Beginning in October 2009, the _Proceedings_ began publishing 2 Residents Clinics articles per month, with 1 of these published as electronic only and the other as both electronic and print. We will continue this pattern for the foreseeable future. In 2010, we also will begin migrating Medical Images to the Web site, and we will publish more of the images. Book reviews and the few historical articles we publish will also move to the Web site.\n\n【17】We will begin a new approach to publishing select full-length original articles, reviews, and other content through a program entitled “Online First.” These articles will be published on the Web site before print publication, some in mid-month. Our attempt is to share time-sensitive articles with readers more rapidly and to have weekly or biweekly updates to Web-based content so that readers will experience new content more frequently when they visit our Web site. We will periodically create Web-based—only appendices for print articles so that the print journal content will be more focused, yet readers will not be deprived of valuable background information for an individual article. Furthermore, we will attempt to include more color images on the electronic version of articles, regardless of whether the print version contains black-and-white or color images. Authors' fees for color figures will be initiated to help cover the costs in the print, but not in the electronic journal.\n\n【18】Materials released to our Web site, whether as Online First articles or in some other format, will receive the same high-quality editing and layout that you have come to expect from the _Proceedings._ Articles published online only will be indexed in MEDLINE and will be acknowledged in the monthly print table of contents and will receive a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) number to facilitate indexing.\n\n【19】The _Proceedings'_ archives of articles available online will also expand in 2010 and cover the interval from 1995 to the present. Given that _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ has a respectable impact factor (currently 4.81) plus a 7.9-year citation half-life (Thompson ISI, New York, NY) for published articles, this combination places the journal among the upper tier of those having long-term value to readers. As such, by expanding the beginning of our archive collection of articles from the previous 2002 to 1995, readers should find additional, valuable materials that have withstood the test of time.\n\n【20】Additional New Web Site Activities\n----------------------------------\n\n【21】Beginning in August 2009, the _Proceedings_ began publishing on its Web site audiovisual podcasts of interviews with authors, as well as a monthly audio podcast from the Editor-in-Chief reviewing highlights of each monthly issue. From the former, _Proceedings_ ' readers have been able to attach a face to the names of authors and learn from those authors the interpretation of their articles, the motivation behind their research, and other valuable features. For example, in September, Dr Gordon Dewald\n\n【22】Fluorescence in situ hybridization to visualize genetic abnormalities in interphase cells of acinar cell carcinoma, ductal adenocarcinoma, and islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas.\n\n【23】discussed his original research article on new biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. Also that month, Dr Barbara Yawn\n\n【24】Health care utilization and cost burden of herpes zoster in a community population.\n\n【25】reviewed her research that quantified the effects of herpes zoster infection on health care utilization and cost of care in a community population of patients. In October, Dr Bernard Gersh discussed cell therapy for cardiac injury, a topic covered in his review article.\n\n【26】Cardiac cell repair therapy: a clinical perspective.\n\n【27】Through these interviews, we hope that the written words and images will come alive for readers, enhancing their journal experience.\n\n【28】Currently, the above-mentioned podcasts are disseminated additionally on SciVee  and YouTube .\n\n【29】e-TOCs (Electronic Tables-of-Contents)\n--------------------------------------\n\n【30】Invitations to Participate in the VPS Program\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【31】In 2010, just as in 2009, we will send readers requests for VPS support in the February and August issues. On receipt, we would appreciate if you would indicate whether you prefer to contribute toward a print subscription or an electronic-only subscription or whether your current circumstances do not allow you to participate. Any of these responses will provide us valuable information that will be used for planning purposes.\n\n【32】You can participate in the VPS program by returning the print request form or by purchasing a subscription on our Web site and choosing the box indicating you would like to voluntarily pay for a subscription.\n\n【33】We will use targeted mailings in an attempt to send VPS invitations only to those who have not contributed within the previous 6 months. We estimate that participation in the VPS program by 25% of readers who currently receive complimentary subscriptions will allow us to continue the existing mission of the journal, including the changes mentioned earlier. As I have shared with you previously,\n\n【34】The business of providing high-quality content to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings'_ readers: 2009 and beyond \\[editorial\\].\n\n【35】in accordance with the journal's core principles, should we experience any revenue excesses from the VPS program, all funds will remain with the journal and will be used to improve the quality and scope of the journal's mission. Specifically, funds will not be diverted to the general funds of our sponsor or publisher.\n\n【36】In Closing\n----------\n\n【37】Through circumstances not of our choosing, the contemporary _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , along with its brother and sister general/internal medicine journals, has experienced a financial environment that threatens both the form and the substance of the monthly journal. We choose not to let this challenge consume us but instead will use it as an opportunity to make our journal even better and more relevant to readers' needs. From one perspective, these changes are just another step in a continuum of improvements the journal has made in recent years; however, this time there is a greater sense of urgency. Throughout these changes, the Editorial Board and staff have gained comfort from the veneration of the journal expressed in readers' notes, telephone calls, and other contacts. However, we must ask you, the readers, to consider taking one more step in your support of the journal. Participation in the VPS program will help ensure valuable journal activities in this time of transition and beyond, regardless of whether the financial challenges seen in 2008 and 2009 decrease or persist. Either way, through your support, we intend to survive and continually improve the journal so that, for years to come, it will be a favorite source of information for you and your fellow students of medicine.\n\n【38】Thank you for your ongoing interest in and support of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ .", "index": 15475, "show": true, "start": 15475, "end": 15558, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:14:15", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:14:46", "cost": 30.731}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:14:45", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:14:14"}

In practice there is._ Yogi Berra\n\n【1】This quotation from baseball icon and American cult philosopher Yogi Berra addresses a problem we face regularly in clinical medicine: interventions that should work in theory and appear to work in controlled research settings do not work nearly as well, or not at all, during “real-world” applications. Although we think of translational research as translating basic research into clinical application, the most difficult translation may be in taking treatments that are efficacious in clinical trials, applying them in the real world of clinical practice, and getting the same results. This dichotomy describes the difference between efficacy and effectiveness. In order for an efficacious treatment to be effective, the treatment must be readily available, practitioners must apply the treatment to the recommended target population, and patients must be willing to accept and adhere to treatment recommendations.\n\n【2】A primer on effectiveness and efficacy trials.\n\n【3】Treatment for tobacco dependence using behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy has been proven efficacious in numerous clinical trials and less rigorous uncontrolled studies.\n\n【4】Combined pharmacotherapy and behavioural interventions for smoking cessation.\n\n【5】In this issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , Kotz et al\n\n【6】Prospective cohort study of the effectiveness of smoking cessation treatments used in the “real world.”.\n\n【7】report on the nationwide effectiveness of combined behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy for tobacco dependence treatment in England. In a previous effectiveness study by the same authors, a cross-sectional survey was used to confirm that evidence-based treatment can be translated to the real world, and they were able to validate a measure that accounted for one of the most important confounding factors for any study of tobacco dependence treatment: the degree of tobacco dependence assessed by strength of urges to smoke.\n\n【8】‘Real-world’ effectiveness of smoking cessation treatments: a population study.\n\n【9】In the current research, the investigative team applied this new measure to a prospective cohort of smokers with follow-up for up to 6 months.\n\n【10】In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service has invested heavily in providing tobacco dependence treatment as a key component of the tobacco control efforts. Specialized clinics for the treatment of tobacco dependence have been established widely, and most general practitioners have been trained to provide brief intervention services for tobacco cessation. Additionally, all of the first-line medications (ie, medications proven efficacious and having a labeled indication for smoking cessation) for tobacco dependence are available for use. The current study used a survey method to obtain information regarding tobacco quit attempts among smokers, and categorized smokers as those who (1) had been seen in a specialized clinic for tobacco cessation treatment, (2) received brief intervention from their general practitioner, (3) used over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy without behavioral intervention, or (4) simply tried to quit unassisted. Prescription pharmacotherapy was provided to patients seen in specialized clinics or by their general practitioners.\n\n【11】One of the important methodological features of the study by Kotz et al is the adjustment of results for important confounders, including adjustment for the degree of nicotine dependence before the quit attempt. Their results were striking. Smokers who attempted to quit smoking using specialist clinics plus prescription medication had an odds ratio (OR) for successful abstinence of 2.58 \\[95% CI, 1.48-4.52\\] compared with unassisted quit attempts. Similarly, prescription medication plus brief advice by a general practitioner resulted in an increased odds of successful abstinence compared with unassisted quitting (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.11-2.16). Finally, an unexpected result was the finding that the use of over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy without any behavioral support resulted in a lower chance of successful abstinence compared with unassisted quitting (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94).\n\n【12】One key question to ask is whether these investigators truly approximated the real world in which most practitioners and smokers live. Positive elements of the research design are that the authors studied a heterogeneous population that was unselected, and practitioners delivered the intervention in routine clinical settings. Kotz et al were able to make adjustments for potential confounders, although unaccounted for confounders cannot be ruled out. Factors that may be different in the clinical setting found in England compared with most other countries include the availability of specialized clinics that provide a standardized approach to tobacco dependence treatment and a corps of general practitioners who are largely trained and given incentives for providing intervention for smokers. For example, in the United States there are tobacco treatment specialists sprinkled across the country among medical practices, clinics, and hospitals, but there are very few specialized clinics to which smokers can be referred for evidence-based behavioral treatment and pharmacotherapy for tobacco dependence. In low- and middle-income countries, there is virtually no capacity for tobacco dependence treatment, and the availability of effective pharmacotherapy is quite limited. The reality for most health care professionals outside the United Kingdom is that the most effective treatment as described by Kotz et al is either unavailable altogether or inaccessible to most patients.\n\n【13】In addition to the main results in the report by Kotz et al, some of the secondary results are noteworthy. First, only 4.8% of patients received the most effective therapy (specialist support plus prescription medication) during their last quit attempt, and only 20.8% received brief advice and medication. Thus, almost 75% of smokers either used no medication or support or chose nicotine replacement therapy purchased on their own—ie, the most ineffective treatments . This finding is consistent with the results of polls of smokers who believe that unassisted quitting is most effective, an approach supported by some experts as well.\n\n【14】Quitting smoking unassisted: the 50-year research neglect of a major public health phenomenon.\n\n【15】Perhaps surprising to many, the results of the study by Kotz et al suggest that nicotine replacement therapy purchased over the counter results in a worse outcome compared with simply quitting unassisted. Tobacco dependence treatment experts have long believed that any attempt to quit, using any means available, should be encouraged. However, the results of the current study raise the possibility that using nicotine replacement therapy without additional support may undermine abstinence and discourage future attempts to quit. Why should an efficacious treatment provide such a negative result? The authors speculate that poor adherence to treatment (incorrect dose, inappropriately brief treatment duration) may be the cause, a speculation supported by population-based survey studies.\n\n【16】Effectiveness of stop-smoking medications: findings from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey.\n\n【17】How should we apply the results of this study to the real world in which each of us lives? First, behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy work synergistically to improve abstinence outcomes. Every patient who uses tobacco should be offered at least brief behavioral intervention and first-line pharmacotherapy to aid in quitting. Years of productive life are added for every smoker who successfully quits. Health care professionals should discourage patients from simply buying nicotine replacement therapy off the shelf and trying it on their own. This strategy may be even less effective than unaided quitting. Not only is it ineffective, but it may also undermine future quit attempts by making smokers feel that pharmacotherapy will not work for them. Practitioners should learn simple techniques to provide brief behavioral support, advise patients that medications will help them in their attempt to quit, and provide medications to those who are motivated to quit. When access to a tobacco treatment specialist is available, practitioners should simply ask patients about their smoking status, advise them to quit, and refer them for specialist treatment.\n\n【18】Tobacco use continues to be prevalent and deadly in the United States and worldwide. Further, smoking cessation is one of the most important health behavior changes that we can encourage in our patients. Hundreds of clinical trials that included thousands of patients have documented the efficacy of combined behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy for tobacco dependence treatment. The research by Kotz et al confirms that this approach can be translated to the real world and provide real benefit. This is a case in which there is happily no difference between “theory and practice.” Health systems, hospitals, clinics, and physicians now need to practice the well-established standard of care to save real lives in their real world.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:54:11", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:55:08", "cost": 56.579}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:55:07", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:54:10"}

Flow cytometric immunophenotyping histogram analysis was more informative than tabulated percentage antigen positivity; surface immunoglobulin and CD20 staining intensity, CD5 and CD23 positivity, CD10 positivity, and the coexpression of CD11c/CD22 and CD103 were the most pertinent markers. Using these FCIP parameters and strict immunophenotypic definitions for CLL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and hairy cell leukemia, we obtained greater than 95% specificity for each diagnosis. However, we encountered the following exceptions to standard paradigms of B-cell lymphoma-associated FCIP: (1) CD5 expression by disorders distinct from CLL and MCL, (2) lack of uniform CD5 positivity in some CLL and MCL cases, (3) absence of CD10 in approximately 50% of follicular lymphomas, and (4) expression of CD103 by occasional marginal zone lymphomas.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Stringent interpretation of PB and bone marrow FCIP results enables identification of certain B-cell lymphoma types. However, the observed exceptions to accepted immunophenotypic paradigms highlight the occasional phenotypic overlap among diseases and emphasize that a systematic approach to FCIP interpretations is key to providing clinically useful diagnostic information.\n\n【8】APC ( allophycocyanin ), BCLPD ( B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorder ), BL ( Burkitt lymphoma ), CLL ( chronic lymphocytic leukemia ), DLBCL ( diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ), ENMZL ( extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma ), FCIP ( flow cytometric immunophenotyping ), FISH ( fluorescent in situ hybridization ), FITC ( fluorescein isothiocyanate ), FL ( follicular lymphoma ), HCL ( hairy cell leukemia ), LPL ( lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma ), MCL ( mantle cell lymphoma ), PB ( peripheral blood ), PE ( phycoerythrin ), sIg ( surface immunoglobulin ), SLL ( small lymphocytic lymphoma ), SMZL ( splenic marginal zone lymphoma ), TRAP ( tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ), WHO ( World Health Organization )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:06:34", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:06:46", "cost": 11.901}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:06:45", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:06:33"}

Most people have four wisdom teeth at the back of the mouth — two on the top, two on the bottom.\n\n【3】Impacted wisdom teeth can result in pain, damage to other teeth and other dental problems. In some cases, impacted wisdom teeth may cause no apparent or immediate problems. But because they're hard to clean, they may be more vulnerable to tooth decay and gum disease than other teeth are.\n\n【4】Impacted wisdom teeth that cause pain or other dental complications are usually removed. Some dentists and oral surgeons also recommend removing impacted wisdom teeth that don't cause symptoms to prevent future problems.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Impacted wisdom teeth don't always cause symptoms. However, when an impacted wisdom tooth becomes infected, damages other teeth or causes other dental problems, you may experience some of these signs or symptoms:\n\n【7】*   Red or swollen gums\n*   Tender or bleeding gums\n*   Jaw pain\n*   Swelling around the jaw\n*   Bad breath\n*   An unpleasant taste in your mouth\n*   Difficulty opening your mouth\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】See your dentist if you experience symptoms in the area behind your last molar that may be associated with an impacted wisdom tooth.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Wisdom teeth (third molars) become impacted because they don't have enough room to come in (erupt) or develop normally.\n\n【12】Wisdom teeth usually emerge sometime between the ages of 17 and 25. Some people have wisdom teeth that emerge without any problems and line up with the other teeth behind the second molars. In many cases, however, the mouth is too crowded for third molars to develop normally. These crowded third molars become trapped (impacted).\n\n【13】An impacted wisdom tooth may partially emerge so that some of the crown is visible (partially impacted), or it may never break through the gums (fully impacted). Whether partially or fully impacted, the tooth may:\n\n【14】*   Grow at an angle toward the next tooth (second molar)\n*   Grow at an angle toward the back of the mouth\n*   Grow at a right angle to the other teeth, as if the wisdom tooth is \"lying down\" within the jawbone\n*   Grow straight up or down like other teeth but stay trapped within the jawbone\n\n【15】Complications\n-------------\n\n【16】Impacted wisdom teeth can cause several problems in the mouth:\n\n【17】*   **Damage to other teeth.** If the wisdom tooth pushes against the second molar, it may damage the second molar or increase the risk of infection in that area. This pressure can also cause problems with crowding of the other teeth or require orthodontic treatment to straighten other teeth.\n*   **Cysts.** The wisdom tooth develops in a sac within the jawbone. The sac can fill with fluid, forming a cyst that can damage the jawbone, teeth and nerves. Rarely, a tumor — usually noncancerous (benign) — develops. This complication may require removal of tissue and bone.\n*   **Decay.** Partially impacted wisdom teeth appear to be at higher risk of tooth decay (caries) than other teeth. This probably occurs because wisdom teeth are harder to clean and because food and bacteria get easily trapped between the gum and a partially erupted tooth.\n*   **Gum disease.** The difficulty cleaning impacted, partially erupted wisdom teeth increases the risk of developing a painful, inflammatory gum condition called pericoronitis (per-ih-kor-o-NI-tis) in that area.\n\n【18】Prevention\n----------\n\n【19】You can't keep an impaction from occurring, but keeping regular six-month dental appointments for cleaning and checkups enables your dentist to monitor the growth and emergence of your wisdom teeth.

The fluid keeps your lungs from filling with enough air, which means less oxygen reaches your bloodstream. This deprives your organs of the oxygen they need to function.\n\n【2】ARDS typically occurs in people who are already critically ill or who have significant injuries. Severe shortness of breath — the main symptom of ARDS — usually develops within a few hours to a few days after the precipitating injury or infection.\n\n【3】Many people who develop ARDS don't survive. The risk of death increases with age and severity of illness. Of the people who do survive ARDS, some recover completely while others experience lasting damage to their lungs.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The signs and symptoms of ARDS can vary in intensity, depending on its cause and severity, as well as the presence of underlying heart or lung disease. They include:\n\n【6】*   Severe shortness of breath\n*   Labored and unusually rapid breathing\n*   Low blood pressure\n*   Confusion and extreme tiredness\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】ARDS usually follows a major illness or injury, and most people who are affected are already hospitalized.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】The mechanical cause of ARDS is fluid leaked from the smallest blood vessels in the lungs into the tiny air sacs where blood is oxygenated. Normally, a protective membrane keeps this fluid in the vessels. Severe illness or injury, however, can cause damage to the membrane, leading to the fluid leakage of ARDS.\n\n【11】Underlying causes of ARDS include:\n\n【12】*   **Sepsis.** The most common cause of ARDS is sepsis, a serious and widespread infection of the bloodstream.\n*   **Inhalation of harmful substances.** Breathing high concentrations of smoke or chemical fumes can result in ARDS, as can inhaling (aspirating) vomit or near-drowning episodes.\n*   **Severe pneumonia.** Severe cases of pneumonia usually affect all five lobes of the lungs.\n*   **Head, chest or other major injury.** Accidents, such as falls or car crashes, can directly damage the lungs or the portion of the brain that controls breathing.\n*   **Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).** People who have severe COVID-19 may develop ARDS.\n*   **Others.** Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), massive blood transfusions and burns.\n\n【13】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【14】Most people who develop ARDS are already hospitalized for another condition, and many are critically ill. You're especially at risk if you have a widespread infection in your bloodstream (sepsis).\n\n【15】People who have a history of chronic alcoholism are at higher risk of developing ARDS. They're also more likely to die of ARDS.\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】If you have ARDS, you can develop other medical problems while in the hospital. The most common problems are:\n\n【18】*   **Blood clots.** Lying still in the hospital while you're on a ventilator can increase your risk of developing blood clots, particularly in the deep veins in your legs. If a clot forms in your leg, a portion of it can break off and travel to one or both of your lungs (pulmonary embolism) — where it blocks blood flow.\n*   **Collapsed lung (pneumothorax).** In most ARDS cases, a breathing machine called a ventilator is used to increase oxygen in the body and force fluid out of the lungs. However, the pressure and air volume of the ventilator can force gas to go through a small hole in the very outside of a lung and cause that lung to collapse.\n*   **Infections.** Because the ventilator is attached directly to a tube inserted in your windpipe, this makes it much easier for germs to infect and further injure your lungs.\n*   **Scarring (pulmonary fibrosis).** Scarring and thickening of the tissue between the air sacs can occur within a few weeks of the onset of ARDS. This stiffens your lungs, making it even more difficult for oxygen to flow from the air sacs into your bloodstream.\n\n【19】Thanks to improved treatments, more people are surviving ARDS. However, many survivors end up with potentially serious and sometimes lasting effects:\n\n【20】*   **Breathing problems.** Many people with ARDS recover most of their lung function within several months to two years, but others may have breathing problems for the rest of their lives. Even people who do well usually have shortness of breath and fatigue and may need supplemental oxygen at home for a few months.\n*   **Depression.** Most ARDS survivors also report going through a period of depression, which is treatable.\n*   **Problems with memory and thinking clearly.** Sedatives and low levels of oxygen in the blood can lead to memory loss and cognitive problems after ARDS. In some cases, the effects may lessen over time, but in others, the damage may be permanent.\n*   **Tiredness and muscle weakness.** Being in the hospital and on a ventilator can cause your muscles to weaken. You also may feel very tired following treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:33:42", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:34:16", "cost": 34.647}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:34:14", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:33:39"}

Genetic testing can reveal changes (mutations) in your genes that may cause illness or disease.\n\n【2】Although genetic testing can provide important information for diagnosing, treating and preventing illness, there are limitations. For example, if you're a healthy person, a positive result from genetic testing doesn't always mean you will develop a disease. On the other hand, in some situations, a negative result doesn't guarantee that you won't have a certain disorder.\n\n【3】Talking to your doctor, a medical geneticist or a genetic counselor about what you will do with the results is an important step in the process of genetic testing.\n\n【4】### Genome sequencing\n\n【5】When genetic testing doesn't lead to a diagnosis but a genetic cause is still suspected, some facilities offer genome sequencing — a process for analyzing a sample of DNA taken from your blood.\n\n【6】Everyone has a unique genome, made up of the DNA in all of a person's genes. This complex testing can help identify genetic variants that may relate to your health. This testing is usually limited to just looking at the protein-encoding parts of DNA called the exome.\n\n【7】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【8】Genetic testing plays a vital role in determining the risk of developing certain diseases as well as screening and sometimes medical treatment. Different types of genetic testing are done for different reasons:\n\n【9】*   **Diagnostic testing.** If you have symptoms of a disease that may be caused by genetic changes, sometimes called mutated genes, genetic testing can reveal if you have the suspected disorder. For example, genetic testing may be used to confirm a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease.\n*   **Presymptomatic and predictive testing.** If you have a family history of a genetic condition, getting genetic testing before you have symptoms may show if you're at risk of developing that condition. For example, this type of test may be useful for identifying your risk of certain types of colorectal cancer.\n*   **Carrier testing.** If you have a family history of a genetic disorder — such as sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis — or you're in an ethnic group that has a high risk of a specific genetic disorder, you may choose to have genetic testing before having children. An expanded carrier screening test can detect genes associated with a wide variety of genetic diseases and mutations and can identify if you and your partner are carriers for the same conditions.\n*   **Pharmacogenetics.** If you have a particular health condition or disease, this type of genetic testing may help determine what medication and dosage will be most effective and beneficial for you.\n*   **Prenatal testing.** If you're pregnant, tests can detect some types of abnormalities in your baby's genes. Down syndrome and trisomy 18 syndrome are two genetic disorders that are often screened for as part of prenatal genetic testing. Traditionally this is done looking at markers in blood or by invasive testing such as amniocentesis. Newer testing called cell-free DNA testing looks at a baby's DNA via a blood test done on the mother.\n*   **Newborn screening.** This is the most common type of genetic testing. In the United States, all states require that newborns be tested for certain genetic and metabolic abnormalities that cause specific conditions. This type of genetic testing is important because if results show there's a disorder such as congenital hypothyroidism, sickle cell disease or phenylketonuria (PKU), care and treatment can begin right away.\n*   **Preimplantation testing.** Also called preimplantation genetic diagnosis, this test may be used when you attempt to conceive a child through in vitro fertilization. The embryos are screened for genetic abnormalities. Embryos without abnormalities are implanted in the uterus in hopes of achieving pregnancy\n\n【10】Risks\n-----\n\n【11】Generally genetic tests have little physical risk. Blood and cheek swab tests have almost no risk. However, prenatal testing such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling has a small risk of pregnancy loss (miscarriage).\n\n【12】Genetic testing can have emotional, social and financial risks as well. Discuss all risks and benefits of genetic testing with your doctor, a medical geneticist or a genetic counselor before you have a genetic test.\n\n【13】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【14】Before you have genetic testing, gather as much information as you can about your family's medical history. Then, talk with your doctor or a genetic counselor about your personal and family medical history to better understand your risk. Ask questions and discuss any concerns about genetic testing at that meeting. Also, talk about your options, depending on the test results.\n\n【15】If you're being tested for a genetic disorder that runs in families, you may want to consider discussing your decision to have genetic testing with your family. Having these conversations before testing can give you a sense of how your family might respond to your test results and how it may affect them.\n\n【16】Not all health insurance policies pay for genetic testing. So, before you have a genetic test, check with your insurance provider to see what will be covered.\n\n【17】In the United States, the federal Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) helps prevent health insurers or employers from discriminating against you based on test results. Under GINA, employment discrimination based on genetic risk also is illegal. However, this act does not cover life, long-term care or disability insurance. Most states offer additional protection.\n\n【18】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【19】Depending on the type of test, a sample of your blood, skin, amniotic fluid or other tissue will be collected and sent to a lab for analysis.\n\n【20】*   **Blood sample.** A member of your health care team takes the sample by inserting a needle into a vein in your arm. For newborn screening tests, a blood sample is taken by pricking your baby's heel.\n*   **Cheek swab.** For some tests, a swab sample from the inside of your cheek is collected for genetic testing.\n*   **Amniocentesis.** In this prenatal genetic test, your doctor inserts a thin, hollow needle through your abdominal wall and into your uterus to collect a small amount of amniotic fluid for testing.\n*   **Chorionic villus sampling.** For this prenatal genetic test, your doctor takes a tissue sample from the placenta. Depending on your situation, the sample may be taken with a tube (catheter) through your cervix or through your abdominal wall and uterus using a thin needle.\n\n【21】Results\n-------\n\n【22】The amount of time it takes for you to receive your genetic test results depends on the type of test and your health care facility. Talk to your doctor, medical geneticist or genetic counselor before the test about when you can expect the results and have a discussion about them.\n\n【23】### Positive results\n\n【24】If the genetic test result is positive, that means the genetic change that was being tested for was detected. The steps you take after you receive a positive result will depend on the reason you had genetic testing.\n\n【25】If the purpose is to:\n\n【26】*   **Diagnose a specific disease or condition,** a positive result will help you and your doctor determine the right treatment and management plan.\n*   **Find out if you are carrying a gene that could cause disease in your child,** and the test is positive, your doctor, medical geneticist or a genetic counselor can help you determine your child's risk of actually developing the disease. The test results can also provide information to consider as you and your partner make family planning decisions.\n*   **Determine if you might develop a certain disease,** a positive test doesn't necessarily mean you'll get that disorder. For example, having a breast cancer gene (_BRCA1_ or _BRCA2_) means you're at high risk of developing breast cancer at some point in your life, but it doesn't indicate with certainty that you'll get breast cancer. However, with some conditions, such as Huntington's disease, having the altered gene does indicate that the disease will eventually develop.\n\n【27】Talk to your doctor about what a positive result means for you. In some cases, you can make lifestyle changes that may reduce your risk of developing a disease, even if you have a gene that makes you more susceptible to a disorder. Results may also help you make choices related to treatment, family planning, careers and insurance coverage.\n\n【28】In addition, you may choose to participate in research or registries related to your genetic disorder or condition. These options may help you stay updated with new developments in prevention or treatment.\n\n【29】### Negative results\n\n【30】A negative result means a mutated gene was not detected by the test, which can be reassuring, but it's not a 100 percent guarantee that you don't have the disorder. The accuracy of genetic tests to detect mutated genes varies, depending on the condition being tested for and whether or not the gene mutation was previously identified in a family member.\n\n【31】Even if you don't have the mutated gene, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll never get the disease. For example, the majority of people who develop breast cancer don't have a breast cancer gene (_BRCA1_ or _BRCA2_). Also, genetic testing may not be able to detect all genetic defects.\n\n【32】### Inconclusive results\n\n【33】In some cases, a genetic test may not provide helpful information about the gene in question. Everyone has variations in the way genes appear, and often these variations don't affect your health. But sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between a disease-causing gene and a harmless gene variation. These changes are called variants of uncertain significance. In these situations, follow-up testing or periodic reviews of the gene over time may be necessary.\n\n【34】### Genetic counseling\n\n【35】No matter what the results of your genetic testing, talk with your doctor, medical geneticist or genetic counselor about questions or concerns you may have. This will help you understand what the results mean for you and your family.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:58:33", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:58:40", "cost": 7.721}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:58:40", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:58:32"}

Most injuries were mild, and the most common type was contusion, which occurred in 33 players (60%). Four injuries (7%) were severe enough to prevent players from participating for the rest of the season. All 4 severe injuries were fractures involving the ankle physis. The risk of injury increased as players matured in age and grade level. Injury risk for an eighthgrade player was 4 times greater than the risk of injury to a fourth-grade player. A trend was identified for heavier players to be at increased risk, but no significant correlation was evident between body weight and injury.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】Our prospective observational analysis showed that most youth football injuries are mild.

M-M-R II\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccine (live) is an active immunizing agent that is given to protect against infections caused by measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles). It works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the virus.\n\n【4】Measles (also known as coughing measles, hard measles, morbilli, red measles, rubeola, and 10-day measles) is an infection that is easily spread from one person to another. Infection with measles can cause serious problems, including stomach problems, pneumonia, ear infections, sinus problems, convulsions (seizures), brain damage, and possibly death. The risk of serious complications and death is greater for adults and infants than for children and teenagers.\n\n【5】Mumps is an infection that can cause serious problems, such as encephalitis and meningitis, which affect the brain. In addition, adolescent boys and men are very susceptible to a condition called orchitis, which causes pain and swelling in the testicles and scrotum and, in rare cases, sterility. Also, mumps infection can cause spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) in women during the first 3 months of pregnancy.\n\n【6】Rubella (also known as German measles) is a serious infection that causes miscarriages, stillbirths, or birth defects in unborn babies when pregnant women get the disease.\n\n【7】This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Powder for Solution\n*   Powder for Suspension\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this vaccine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Priorix® injection in infants younger than 12 months of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】Use of M-M-R® II is not recommended in children younger than 12 months of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established for measles vaccine in children younger than 6 months of age and for mumps and rubella vaccine in children younger than 12 months of age.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of Priorix® and M-M-R® II injection have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of Priorix® injection in the elderly.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this vaccine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Receiving this vaccine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【31】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【32】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this vaccine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【33】*   Allergy to eggs, history of—May increase risk for a serious allergic reaction to occur again.\n\n【34】*   Immune system problems—Use with caution. This condition may decrease the useful effects of the vaccine.\n\n【35】*   Immune system problems, severe or\n*   Tuberculosis, active and untreated—Should not be used in patients with this condition.\n\n【36】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【37】A nurse or other trained health professional will give your child this vaccine. It is given as a shot under your skin (usually in the thighs) or into one of your muscles.\n\n【38】This vaccine is given in 2 doses. First dose is given at 12 to 15 months of age, while the second dose is given at 4 to 6 years of age. If this vaccine is not given on time, 2 doses will be given at least 4 weeks apart.\n\n【39】If you have received 1 dose of another authorized or approved measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, you may receive a second dose of Priorix® to complete your vaccination series.\n\n【40】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【41】Be sure to notify your doctor of any side effects that occur after you receive this vaccine.\n\n【42】Do not become pregnant for 1 month after receiving this vaccine without first checking with your doctor. There is a chance that this vaccine may cause problems during pregnancy. If you think you have become pregnant, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【43】This vaccine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, a fast heartbeat, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after receiving the vaccine.\n\n【44】This vaccine will lower the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed or get infections more easily. To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers.\n\n【45】Fainting may occur after you receive this vaccine. You may also have vision changes, numbness or tingling in your arms, hands, or feet, or jerky movements of the arms and legs. Your doctor may want you to be observed after you get the injection to prevent and manage fainting.\n\n【46】The tip caps of the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before receiving this medicine.\n\n【47】This vaccine may not protect everyone who receives it. This vaccine will not treat symptoms of measles, mumps, and rubella infection if you already have the disease.\n\n【48】Tell your doctor that you have received this vaccine:\n\n【49】*   If you are to receive a tuberculin skin test within 4 to 6 weeks after receiving this vaccine. The results of the test may be affected by this vaccine.\n*   If you are to receive any other live virus vaccines within 1 month after receiving this vaccine.\n*   If you are to receive blood transfusions or other blood products within 2 weeks after receiving this vaccine.\n*   If you are to receive gamma globulin or other globulins within 2 weeks after receiving this vaccine.\n\n【50】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【51】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【52】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【53】#### More common\n\n【54】1.  Difficulty in breathing or swallowing\n2.  fever over 39 °C (102 °F)\n3.  itching, especially of the feet or hands\n4.  reddening of the skin, especially around the ears\n5.  swelling of the eyes, face, or inside of the nose\n6.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n\n【55】#### Less common\n\n【56】1.

It may also be called neurocardiogenic syncope.\n\n【2】The vasovagal syncope trigger causes your heart rate and blood pressure to drop suddenly. That leads to reduced blood flow to your brain, causing you to briefly lose consciousness.\n\n【3】Vasovagal syncope is usually harmless and requires no treatment. But it's possible that you may injure yourself during a vasovagal syncope episode. Your doctor may recommend tests to rule out more-serious causes of fainting, such as heart disorders.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Before you faint due to vasovagal syncope, you may experience some of the following:\n\n【6】*   Pale skin\n*   Lightheadedness\n*   Tunnel vision — your field of vision narrows so that you see only what's in front of you\n*   Nausea\n*   Feeling warm\n*   A cold, clammy sweat\n*   Blurred vision\n\n【7】During a vasovagal syncope episode, bystanders may notice:\n\n【8】*   Jerky, abnormal movements\n*   A slow, weak pulse\n*   Dilated pupils\n\n【9】Recovery after a vasovagal episode generally begins in less than a minute. However, if you stand up too soon after fainting — within about 15 to 30 minutes — you're at risk of fainting again.\n\n【10】### When to see a doctor\n\n【11】Fainting can be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a heart or brain disorder. You may want to consult your doctor after a fainting spell, especially if you've never had one before.\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】Vasovagal syncope occurs when the part of your nervous system that regulates heart rate and blood pressure malfunctions in response to a trigger, such as the sight of blood.\n\n【14】Your heart rate slows, and the blood vessels in your legs widen (dilate). This allows blood to pool in your legs, which lowers your blood pressure. Combined, the drop in blood pressure and slowed heart rate quickly reduce blood flow to your brain, and you faint.\n\n【15】Sometimes there is no classical vasovagal syncope trigger, but common triggers include:\n\n【16】*   Standing for long periods of time\n*   Heat exposure\n*   Seeing blood\n*   Having blood drawn\n*   Fear of bodily injury\n*   Straining, such as to have a bowel movement\n\n【17】Prevention\n----------\n\n【18】You may not always be able to avoid a vasovagal syncope episode. If you feel like you might faint, lie down and lift your legs. This allows gravity to keep blood flowing to your brain. If you can't lie down, sit down and put your head between your knees until you feel better.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:20:17", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:20:37", "cost": 19.998}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:20:36", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:20:15"}

A statistically significant temporal rate change was not observed among hospitalizations for pregnancy-related disorders. Multivariable regression revealed several patient and hospital characteristics as predictors of DAMA, including lack of health insurance (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 3.78; 95% CI, 3.62-3.94), male sex (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 2.36-2.45), and northeast region (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.72-2.11). Other predictors included age, race/ethnicity, income, primary diagnosis, severity of illness, and hospital location/type and size.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Rates for DAMA have increased in the United States, and key differences exist across patient and hospital characteristics. Early identification of vulnerable patients and preventive measures such as improved patient-provider communication may reduce DAMA.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AMA ( against medical advice ), DAMA ( discharge against medical advice ), HCUP ( Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project ), JPR ( Joinpoint Regression ), MH/SA ( mental health/substance abuse ), NEOMAT ( Neonatal-Maternal ), NH ( non-Hispanic ), NIS ( Nationwide Inpatient Sample ), OR ( odds ratio )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 09:59:40", "endTime": "2024/08/20 09:59:44", "cost": 4.01}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 17:59:44", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 17:59:35"}

Phenergan\n2.  Promacot\n\n【2】### Descriptions\n\n【3】Promethazine is used to relieve or prevent the symptoms of hay fever, allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eye), and other types of allergy or allergic reactions. It works by preventing the effects of a substance called histamine, which is produced by the body. Histamine can cause itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes. It can sometimes close up the bronchial tubes (air passages of the lungs) and make breathing difficult .\n\n【4】Promethazine is also used to prevent and control motion sickness, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. In addition, it may be used to help people go to sleep and control their pain or anxiety before or after surgery or other procedures .\n\n【5】Promethazine may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor .\n\n【6】This medicine is only available with your doctor's prescription .\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Syrup\n*   Tablet\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【11】### Allergies\n\n【12】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【13】### Pediatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of promethazine in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children below 2 years of age. Caution should be used when this medicine is given to children 2 years of age and older .\n\n【15】### Geriatric\n\n【16】Insufficient information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of promethazine in geriatric patients. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the side effects of this medicine (such as confusion and severe drowsiness) than in younger adults, and are more likely to have age-related heart or blood vessel disease, liver problems, and kidney disease, which may require adjustment of dosage in patients receiving promethazine .\n\n【17】### Breastfeeding\n\n【18】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

Highs and lows commonly coincide with the beginning or end of a relationship or with major life changes, such as pregnancy, menopause or illness. Some medications used for mood disorders also can cause low sex drive in women.\n\n【2】If your lack of interest in sex continues or returns and causes personal distress, you may have a condition called sexual interest/arousal disorder.\n\n【3】But you don't have to meet this medical definition to seek help. If you're bothered by a low sex drive or decreased sex drive, there are lifestyle changes and sexual techniques that may put you in the mood more often. Some medications may offer promise as well.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】If you want to have sex less often than your partner does, neither one of you is necessarily outside the norm for people at your stage in life — although your differences may cause distress.\n\n【6】Similarly, even if your sex drive is weaker than it once was, your relationship may be stronger than ever. Bottom line: There is no magic number to define low sex drive. It varies among women.\n\n【7】Symptoms of low sex drive in women include:\n\n【8】*   Having no interest in any type of sexual activity, including masturbation\n*   Never or only seldom having sexual fantasies or thoughts\n*   Being concerned by your lack of sexual activity or fantasies\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】If you're concerned by your low desire for sex, talk to your doctor_._ The solution could be as simple as changing a medication you are taking, and improving any chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】Desire for sex is based on a complex interaction of many things affecting intimacy, including physical and emotional well-being, experiences, beliefs, lifestyle, and your current relationship. If you're experiencing a problem in any of these areas, it can affect your desire for sex.\n\n【13】### Physical causes\n\n【14】A wide range of illnesses, physical changes and medications can cause a low sex drive, including:\n\n【15】*   **Sexual problems.** If you have pain during sex or can't orgasm, it can reduce your desire for sex.\n*   **Medical diseases.** Many nonsexual diseases can affect sex drive, including arthritis, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease and neurological diseases.\n*   **Medications.** Certain prescription drugs, especially antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are known to lower the sex drive.\n*   **Lifestyle habits.** A glass of wine may put you in the mood, but too much alcohol can affect your sex drive. The same is true of street drugs. Also, smoking decreases blood flow, which may dull arousal.\n*   **Surgery.** Any surgery related to your breasts or genital tract can affect your body image, sexual function and desire for sex.\n*   **Fatigue.** Exhaustion from caring for young children or aging parents can contribute to low sex drive. Fatigue from illness or surgery also can play a role in a low sex drive.\n\n【16】### Hormone changes\n\n【17】Changes in your hormone levels may alter your desire for sex. This can occur during:\n\n【18】*   **Menopause.** Estrogen levels drop during the transition to menopause. This can make you less interested in sex and cause dry vaginal tissues, resulting in painful or uncomfortable sex. Although many women still have satisfying sex during menopause and beyond, some experience a lagging libido during this hormonal change.\n*   **Pregnancy and breast-feeding.** Hormone changes during pregnancy, just after having a baby and during breast-feeding can put a damper on sex drive. Fatigue, changes in body image, and the pressures of pregnancy or caring for a new baby also can contribute to changes in your sexual desire.\n\n【19】### Psychological causes\n\n【20】Your state of mind can affect your sexual desire. There are many psychological causes of low sex drive, including:\n\n【21】*   Mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression\n*   Stress, such as financial stress or work stress\n*   Poor body image\n*   Low self-esteem\n*   History of physical or sexual abuse\n*   Previous negative sexual experiences\n\n【22】### Relationship issues\n\n【23】For many women, emotional closeness is an essential prelude to sexual intimacy. So problems in your relationship can be a major factor in low sex drive. Decreased interest in sex is often a result of ongoing issues, such as:\n\n【24】*   Lack of connection with your partner\n*   Unresolved conflicts or fights\n*   Poor communication of sexual needs and preferences\n*   Trust issues", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:07:26", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:07:36", "cost": 9.972}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:07:36", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:07:25"}

He was an accomplished horse rider who had fallen several times during his teenage years. Three years earlier, he sustained an injury to the left flank while playing college football, with subsequent flank pain, ecchymoses, and a systolic blood pressure level between 150 and 170 mm Hg. He sought evaluation for blood pressure management. The patient denied having headaches, hematuria, weight change, dyspnea, chest pains, flushing, or decreased libido. This young man used no tobacco, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, illicit drugs, or alcohol. His family history was unremarkable for hypertension.\n\n【1】Physical examination revealed a healthy-looking man in no distress. His blood pressure level was 170/110 mm Hg in each arm, his heart rate was 68 beats/min, and he was afebrile. Cardiovascular examination findings were normal. The lungs sounded clear bilaterally, the abdomen was without bruits or masses, lower extremity pulses were symmetrical with no pulse lag, and the funduscopic examination findings were normal. The initial laboratory test results are shown in Table 1 . Chest radiographic findings were normal without rib notching, and an electrocardiogram suggested no left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n【2】Table 1 Laboratory Values\n\n| Test | Values on admission |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hemoglobin (g/dL) | 13.4 |\n| Leukocytes (× 10 9 /L) | 6.1 |\n| Platelet count (× 10 9 /L) | 273 |\n| Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/1 h) | 15 |\n| Sodium (mEq/L) | 140 |\n| Potassium (mEq/L) | 4.1 |\n| Calcium (mg/dL) | 9.4 |\n| Phosphorus (mg/dL) | 3.3 |\n| Chloride (mEq/L) | 102 |\n| Bicarbonate (mEq/L) | 24 |\n| Glucose (mg/dL) | 88 |\n| Creatinine (mg/dL) | 1.5\\*Indicates abnormal value.

This form of hypertension tends to present in middle-aged individuals who areusually asymptomatic with normal physical examination and laboratory tests but with concurrent cardiovascular risk factors such as family history, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and obesity. Approximately 5% to 7% of patients do not fit this profile; such patients should be examined for secondary causes of hypertension after causes such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and illicit drug use are excluded. The most sensitive strategy for identifying patients in this group is to screen all patients who present with hypertension before age 25 years and after age 50 years. Other clues to secondary hypertension include abnormal renal function, evidence of early endorgan damage, unprovoked electrolyte abnormalities, abdominal bruits or asymmetrical pulses on physical examination, and poor response to therapy. Our patient used no drugs and presented with 4 features that suggested an underlying secondary cause: a young age, an abnormal creatinine level, severe hypertension, and the absence of family history for hypertension; therefore, a diagnosis of essential hypertension is unlikely.\n\n【22】Primary aldosteronism is found in 0.3% to 1.5% of patients with hypertension.\n\n【23】Secondary hypertension in a blood pressure clinic.\n\n【24】The effect of age on prevalence of secondary forms of hypertension in 4429 consecutively referred patients.\n\n【25】Primary aldosteronism is recognized more frequently by measuring serum aldosterone levels and plasma renin activity.\n\n【26】Potentially high prevalence of primary aldosteronism in a primarycare population \\[letter\\].\n\n【27】Although up to 20% of patients with primary aldosteronism may present with concentrations of serum potassium in the low end of normal, the combination of normal potassium and elevated plasma renin activity effectively rules out the diagnosis because almost all patients with primary aldosteronism have suppressed plasma renin activity.\n\n【28】Primary aldosteronism.\n\n【29】Pheochromocytoma and coarctation of the aorta represent less than 0.2% of all causes of hypertension and less than 10% of secondary causes. The absence of history that suggests pheochromocytoma and the lack of physical examination data that support coarctation of the aorta make both of these rare entities extremely unlikely.\n\n【30】Renal parenchymal disease and renovascular disease cause 5% to 10% of all hypertension, depending on the population studied. Renal parenchymal disease alone is responsible for 40% to 60% of hypertension among children and adolescents. Renovascular disease accounts for up to 25% of secondary forms of hypertension, although two thirds of cases are caused by atherosclerotic disease and affect a much older population. Therefore, both epidemiologically and clinically, the most likely cause of hypertension in this patient is renal disease, and evaluation of the kidneys is the next obvious investigational step.\n\n【31】*   2.\n\n【32】    _Which one of the following diagnostic tests would be the least helpful in this case?_\n\n【33】    *   a.\n\n【34】        _Kidney biopsy_\n\n【35】    *   b.\n\n【36】        _Magnetic resonance arteriography_\n\n【37】    *   c.\n\n【38】        _Conventional arteriography_\n\n【39】    *   d.\n\n【40】        _Duplex ultrasonography_\n\n【41】    *   e.\n\n【42】        _Captopril renal scan_\n\n【43】A renal etiology for this patient's hypertension would direct diagnostic investigation, and several clues from the history, physical examination, and preliminary laboratory studies need to be analyzed. The patient's good health, absence of analgesic or illicit drug use, normal physical examination findings, negative antinuclear antibodies, and, most importantly, normal urinalysis results suggest a diagnosis other than a parenchymal process such as glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or analgesic nephropathy. Thus, kidney biopsy would be the least helpful test. Renovascular hypertension is a likely diagnosis because plasma renin activity and creatinine were elevated; therefore, a method to evaluate for renal artery stenosis (RAS) would provide valuable information. Also, in this age group, fibromuscular dysplasia is relatively common among those with renovascular hypertension, although it is more prevalent in women. Therefore, the diagnostic investigation should focus primarily on detecting possible RAS. Magnetic resonance or conventional arteriography, duplex ultrasonography, and captopril renal scan are all used in assessing for RAS, and the choice among them depends on the individual patient scenario.\n\n【44】*   3.\n\n【45】    _Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in the investigation and management of this patient's condition?_\n\n【46】    *   a.\n\n【47】        _Intravenous pyelography_\n\n【48】    *   b.\n\n【49】        _Captopril renal scan_\n\n【50】    *   c.\n\n【51】        _Duplex ultrasonography_\n\n【52】    *   d.\n\n【53】        _Magnetic resonance arteriography_\n\n【54】    *   e.\n\n【55】        _Conventional arteriography_\n\n【56】Intravenous pyelography has no role in the diagnosis of RAS since it lacks sensitivity (70%) and specificity (85%). Captopril renal scan serves primarily as a screening tool and has excellent sensitivity and specificity (90%-95%); however, it provides a functional rather than anatomical diagnosis and is recommended when an intermediate clinical suspicion exists. Duplex ultrasonography is noninvasive, widely available, inexpensive, has 80% to 90% sensitivity and specificity, and has become the screening test of choice for RAS. However, it depends heavily on operator experience and is less useful for diagnosing fibromuscular dysplasia, the principal diagnostic consideration in this patient because of his age and renin-dependent hypertension. In this case, however, with the high pretest probability of RAS, a definitive test that provides anatomical diagnosis would be appropriate. The only 2 options that would definitively show RAS are magnetic resonance arteriography or conventional arteriography. Magnetic resonance arteriography of the renal arteries has a reported sensitivity of 94% to 97% and a specificity of 85% to 93%, the higher values being with gadolinium enhancement. The gold standard for diagnosing RAS is arteriography with intravenous contrast media, although this procedure is invasive and is associated with the greatest morbidity. Nevertheless, it is the only modality that offers the possibility of concomitant treatment with percutaneous angioplasty and stenting of the area of stenosis. This was the next step chosen in evaluating this patient.\n\n【57】An alternative diagnostic approach, given the history of trauma in this patient, would be to use ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) to image the kidneys initially, before proceeding with arteriography. This approach, however, was not chosen because of the reasons mentioned earlier.\n\n【58】Conventional arteriography revealed normal renal arteries, but there was intrarenal vascular distortion caused apparently by a mass within the left kidney. Renin sampling of the renal veins was performed and results were abnormal: 10.1 ng • mL  • h  on the left and 3.8 ng • mL  • h  on the right, with a renal vein renin ratio (RVRR) of 2.7.\n\n【59】*   4.\n\n【60】    _Which one of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's renal mass, based on his presentation?_\n\n【61】    *   a.\n\n【62】        _Wilms tumor_\n\n【63】    *   b.\n\n【64】        _Renal cell carcinoma_\n\n【65】    *   c.\n\n【66】        _Chronic renal abscess_\n\n【67】    *   d.\n\n【68】        _Metastatic melanoma_\n\n【69】    *   e.\n\n【70】        _Chronic intraparenchymal hematoma_\n\n【71】Since the mass had not been visualized but only inferred from the vascular distortion it caused in the renal parenchyma, the obvious next step is to obtain imaging. The differential diagnosis of a renal mass depends heavily on its radiological appearance. Wilms tumor and renal cell carcinoma are both unlikely, given the patient's age, but both would be distinguished easily on CT. Additionally, because of the patient's overall excellent health, a renal abscess or metastatic melanoma would be highly unlikely. However, considering the patient's history of prior left flank trauma, a chronic intraparenchymal hematoma is the most likely diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging is the best technique for evaluating renal masses since it provides the most accurate information and in this case was the imaging procedure of choice.\n\n【72】Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a subcapsular, calcified hematoma (7.5 × 5.3 cm). Optimal management of the patient's hypertension is the next step.\n\n【73】*   5.\n\n【74】    _Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's hypertension?_\n\n【75】    *   a.\n\n【76】        _Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy_\n\n【77】    *   b.\n\n【78】        _Observation with yearly follow-up_\n\n【79】    *   c.\n\n【80】        _CT-guided aspiration of the hematoma_\n\n【81】    *   d.\n\n【82】        _Surgical decapsulation and resection of the hematoma_\n\n【83】    *   e.\n\n【84】        _Left nephrectomy_\n\n【85】In patients with RAS, an RVRR of 1.5 or more is predictive of a beneficial blood pressure response to either revascularization or nephrectomy.\n\n【86】Renal-artery stenosis.\n\n【87】In this patient, the RVRR of 2.7 suggests that the hyperreninemic state and hypertension may be improved, and perhaps cured, by correcting the underlying cause. Given the patient's young age, it would be wise to pursue surgical intervention in an attempt to cure hypertension as an alternative to lifelong ACE therapy. Simple observation would be inadequate in the setting of established hypertension likely secondary to kidney trauma and organized hematoma. It is unlikely, given the age and extensive calcification of the hematoma, that needle aspiration could be used successfully to remove the hematoma. It was unclear whether renal decapsulation with resection of the hematoma or total nephrectomy should be conducted. However, because the condition was benign, a surgical strategy designed to spare the left kidney seemed preferable, and our patient underwent decapsulation with resection of the hematoma. Within a week after surgery, his blood pressure level returned to normal, and at 1-year follow-up he remained normotensive without the use of antihypertensive medication.\n\n【88】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【89】Our case is a classic example of direct renal compression by a subcapsular calcified hematoma resulting in systemic hypertension. Intrarenal subcapsular hematoma as a cause of curable hypertension was first described in 1939 by Page\n\n【90】The production of persistent arterial hypertension by cellophane perinephritis.\n\n【91】and has since been known as Page kidney. Page described a new paradigm for systemic hypertension. After he wrapped cellophane around the kidneys of dogs, cats, and rabbits, hypertension developed within 3 to 5 weeks when a fibrous capsule developed around the wrapped kidneys.\n\n【92】Sixteen years later, Engel and Page\n\n【93】Hypertension due to renal compression resulting from subcapsular hematoma.\n\n【94】reported the first clinical correlate to Page's pathophysiological model: hypertension developed in a football player after flank trauma occurred and a renal subcapsular hematoma developed. The pathophysiology of hypertension in this model is believed to involve renal ischemia with concurrent hyperreninemia.\n\n【95】Unilateral “Page kidney” hypertension in man: studies of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system before and after nephrectomy.\n\n【96】Hypertension and unilateral renal ischemia (Page kidney) due to compression of a retroperitoneal paraganglioma.\n\n【97】Approximately 80 cases of Page kidney have been described, and preliminary review of the Mayo Clinic experience has yielded 27 cases over the past 35 years.\n\n【98】The main causes of Page kidney are trauma from football and other contact sports, trauma unrelated to sports, motor vehicle accidents, and miscellaneous causes such as tumor, biopsy, renal transplantation, and renal artery dissection.\n\n【99】Page kidney: case report and review of the literature.\n\n【100】Accepted criteria for diagnosing Page kidney include the presence of hypertension, documentation of renal subcapsular hematoma, and improvement of hypertension with surgical intervention. Although ultrasonography and CT are used more often as diagnostic methods, magnetic resonance imaging was identified recently as a useful tool with excellent resolution. Hypertension should be medically managed, preferably with ACE inhibition, although no clinical trial supports this assumption.\n\n【101】Definitive management of Page kidney is with surgery.\n\n【102】Capsulectomy: a cure for the Page kidney.\n\n【103】Surgical options include percutaneous or surgical drainage of the hematoma, decapsulation, or subtotal or total nephrectomy. Renal vein renin sampling may help predict the success of surgical intervention if the affected side shows hyperreninemia,\n\n【104】Renal-artery stenosis.\n\n【105】as in our case.\n\n【106】This case illustrates several points about a rare and curable cause of hypertension: (1) the need to identify patients who need work-up for secondary causes of hypertension, (2) diagnostic strategies of secondary hypertension, and (3) investigation of the differential diagnosis of renal masses.\n\n【107】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【108】Although rare, Page kidney is one of the few curable causes of hypertension, and diagnosis requires a high degree of awareness of young, active patients presenting with hypertension and a history of trauma. Curing hypertension can be achieved by using a conservative surgical approach that spares the affected kidney. Recognizing and treating Page kidney may avert considerable morbidity and mortality associated with long-standing hypertension.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:27:33", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:27:49", "cost": 15.616}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:27:49", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:27:33"}

Two months earlier he was hospitalized for weakness and was noted to have pronounced hypokalemia (potassium, 1.2 mEq/L). The patient's medical problems included coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, long-standing essential hypertension, and polymyalgia rheumatica. His medication was switched from hydrochlorothiazide to a potassium-sparing diuretic, and he was dismissed. Shortly thereafter, the patient felt so weak that he was unable to climb a flight of stairs without support and noticed great difficulty in rising from a squatting position. Over the past few months, his diabetes and blood pressure control had worsened considerably. His medications included glipizide, metformin, spironolactone, amiloride, atenolol, digoxin, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, and aspirin. The patient had been taking low-dose prednisone (5 mg/d) for polymyalgia rheumatica, but use of this drug had been discontinued 6 months previously.\n\n【1】*   1.\n\n【2】    **_Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?_**\n\n【3】    *   a.\n\n【4】        _Cushing syndrome_\n\n【5】    *   b.\n\n【6】        _Primary aldosteronism_\n\n【7】    *   c.\n\n【8】        _Familial periodic paralysis_\n\n【9】    *   d.\n\n【10】        _Thyrotoxicosis_\n\n【11】    *   e.\n\n【12】        _Bartter syndrome_\n\n【13】Cushing syndrome is the likely diagnosis in this patient. Weight gain, muscle weakness, hypokalemia, and worsening hypertension and diabetes suggest this disorder.\n\n【14】Cushing's syndrome .\n\n【15】Primary aldosteronism can cause hypertension with associated hypokalemia (muscle weakness may be present if hypokalemia is profound) but does not exacerbate diabetes and cause weight gain. Familial periodic paralysis is a rare disease that causes episodic muscle weakness associated with hypokalemia, and attacks are often precipitated by ingestion of a carbohydrate-rich meal. This patient's weakness was not episodic, and the initial manifestation of this disease at his age is unlikely. Also, hypertension and diabetes are not associated with this disorder. Thyrotoxicosis usually leads to weight loss (weight gain can occur rarely in some patients with markedly stimulated appetites). It can lead to worsening diabetes and is rarely associated with hypokalemia in the syndrome of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, in which weakness is episodic. Bartter syndrome can be a cause of unexplained hypokalemia, but patients are usually normotensive and do not have symptoms of weight gain and worsening diabetes.\n\n【16】On examination, our patient had many of the classic signs of Cushing syndrome, including central obesity, plethoric facies, prominent dorsocervical fat pad, marked proximal muscle weakness, and multiple wide purple abdominal striae. Admission laboratory tests revealed the following: hemoglobin, 13 g/dL; white blood cell count, 8.2 × 10  /L; platelet count, 193 × 10  /L; serum sodium, 143 mEq/L; serum potassium, 4.0 mEq/L; and serum creatinine, 1.5 mg/dL.\n\n【17】*   2.\n\n【18】    **_Which one of the following is the best test to screen for the suspected diagnosis in this patient?_**\n\n【19】    *   a.\n\n【20】        _Morning serum cortisol level_\n\n【21】    *   b.\n\n【22】        _Serum corticotropin level_\n\n【23】    *   c.\n\n【24】        _24-Hour urinary free cortisol level_\n\n【25】    *   d.\n\n【26】        _Overnight dexamethasone suppression test_\n\n【27】    *   e.\n\n【28】        _Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen_\n\n【29】The next essential step is to screen for Cushing syndrome with biochemical tests. Measurement of morning cortisol levels is not a useful screening test because in both healthy subjects and patients with Cushing syndrome, the secretion of cortisol increases and decreases episodically, leading to a considerable overlap of values between these groups. Thus, patients with Cushing syndrome (particularly mild disease) frequently have morning cortisol levels within the reference range. Measurement of corticotropin is also not a useful screening test because patients with pituitary-dependent Cushing disease have corticotropin levels that overlap with those in healthy subjects.\n\n【30】The most reliable screening test for Cushing syndrome is a 24-hour urinary free cortisol because it integrates serum free cortisol levels during the entire day. The upper limit of normal for our radioimmunoassay is 108 µg/ 24 h. A urinary free cortisol level greater than a 3- to 4fold elevation is considered highly suggestive of Cushing syndrome.\n\n【31】The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: atypical presentations and laboratory shortcomings.\n\n【32】The overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test may be used as a screening test if collection of 24-hour urinary free cortisol is not possible and suspicion of Cushing syndrome is low. However, the test has limitations because some patients with a corticotropin-secreting pituitary adenoma may suppress cortisol production and some pseudo-Cushing states may be resistant to suppression. Thus, the test is inappropriate when clinical suspicion of Cushing syndrome is high (as in our patient). The 1-mg overnight dexamethasone test is best used to rule out subclinical hypercortisolism in patients with adrenal incidentalomas.\n\n【33】Imaging studies cannot provide information about function and should not be used as a screening test for Cushing syndrome. Furthermore, the finding of an incidentaloma may lead to diagnostic confusion. As is true with many endocrine disorders, the general rule is to confirm the diagnosis biochemically before proceeding with localization studies.\n\n【34】Our patient's clinical presentation was highly suggestive of Cushing syndrome. His urinary free cortisol level was 874 µg/24 h. Thus, the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome was confirmed.\n\n【35】*   3.\n\n【36】    **_At this point in the patient's evaluation, which one of the following tests is most appropriate?_**\n\n【37】    *   a.\n\n【38】        _Serum corticotropin level_\n\n【39】    *   b.\n\n【40】        _Metyrapone test_\n\n【41】    *   c.\n\n【42】        _Inferior petrosal sinus sampling_\n\n【43】    *   d.\n\n【44】        _CT of the abdomen_\n\n【45】    *   e.\n\n【46】        _Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary gland_\n\n【47】The next step in evaluating this patient is to determine whether secretion of excess cortisol is corticotropin dependent (corticotropin-secreting pituitary adenoma or ectopic corticotropin-producing tumor) or corticotropin independent (primary adrenal disease). This so-called subtype classification is essential to guide further investigations and is best achieved by measurement of serum corticotropin. Patients with a primary adrenal cause of Cushing syndrome (15%) will have an undetectable corticotropin concentration (<5 pg/mL \\[immunoradiometric assay\\]) due to feedback of hypercortisolism at the pituitary gland. Patients with pituitary or ectopic disease will have a corticotropin level that is within the normal or high range.\n\n【48】Metyrapone blocks the conversion of 11-ß-deoxycortisol to cortisol. Therefore, the metyrapone test can assess the ability of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to respond to low cortisol levels. The test is not helpful in differentiating between corticotropin-dependent and corticotropin-independent disease.\n\n【49】Because we do not yet know whether this patient has corticotropin-dependent or corticotropin-independent disease, localizing studies such as inferior petrosal sampling, CT of the abdomen, and MRI of the pituitary gland are inappropriate at this time.\n\n【50】This patient's corticotropin level was 71 pg/mL (reference range, 10-60 pg/mL) and thus consistent with corticotropin-dependent disease.\n\n【51】*   4.\n\n【52】    **_Which one of the following will most accurately determine the source of corticotropin hypersecretion in this patient?_**\n\n【53】    *   a.\n\n【54】        _Degree of corticotropin elevation_\n\n【55】    *   b.\n\n【56】        _MRI of the pituitary gland_\n\n【57】    *   c.\n\n【58】        _MRI of the chest_\n\n【59】    *   d.\n\n【60】        _Inferior petrosal sinus sampling_\n\n【61】    *   e.\n\n【62】        _High-dose dexamethasone suppression test_\n\n【63】Once our patient was diagnosed with corticotropin-dependent disease, the next essential step was to determine the source of excess corticotropin secretion (pituitary vs ectopic disease).\n\n【64】Measurement of corticotropin, although useful in distinguishing adrenal from nonadrenal causes, does not reliably distinguish between pituitary microadenomas and ectopic corticotropin secretion. With use of the immunoradiometric assay, corticotropin levels in patients with pituitary- dependent disease tend to range from 10 to 200 pg/mL, whereas those with ectopic disease tend to have corticotropin values that range from 50 pg/mL to greater than 200 pg/ mL. Thus, overlap in corticotropin values between these 2 groups is considerable.\n\n【65】Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland should be performed in all patients with corticotropin- dependent disease in whom the source of corticotropin hypersecretion is unknown. However, the results of MRI can be misleading because most corticotropin-producing pituitary adenomas are smaller than 1 cm, and only 50% are visible on MRI. Furthermore, the presence of a pituitary incidentaloma may confuse the picture. If a pituitary adenoma (<5 mm) is seen on MRI and the clinical presentation is consistent with pituitary disease, a reasonable next step is transsphenoidal exploration.\n\n【66】Chest MRI is not useful in localizing the source of corticotropin production. Corticotropin-secreting bronchial carcinoid tumors are usually small, and less than 30% are detectable by this radiologic method.\n\n【67】The search for occult ectopic ACTH-producing tumors.\n\n【68】If the tumor is found, the treatment of choice is complete removal when possible.\n\n【69】The most accurate test to differentiate between pituitary and ectopic causes of Cushing syndrome is inferior petrosal sinus sampling.\n\n【70】Cavernous sinus sampling is highly accurate in distinguishing Cushing's disease from the ectopic adrenocorticotropin syndrome and in predicting intrapituitary tumor location.\n\n【71】This test involves bilateral catheterization of the inferior petrosal sinuses and simultaneous measurement of corticotropin levels at central and peripheral sites. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling is indicated in patients with normal findings on MRI of the pituitary gland or those with a clinical presentation suggestive of ectopic disease. The test is based on the fact that pituitary venous blood drains into the inferior petrosal sinuses, and thus patients with a pituitary source of corticotropin will have a centralto-peripheral gradient in corticotropin concentration. A central-to-peripheral corticotropin gradient greater than 3fold after corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) administration is diagnostic of pituitary-dependent disease.\n\n【72】The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, once widely used to differentiate between pituitary-dependent disease and the ectopic corticotropin syndrome, is now considered of little use for the differentiation of corticotropin-dependent disease.\n\n【73】Effectiveness versus efficacy: the limited value in clinical practice of high dose dexamethasone suppression testing in the differential diagnosis of adrenocorticotropin-dependent Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【74】This is because up to 30% of corticotropin-secreting bronchial carcinoid tumors show suppression of cortisol production with use of traditional diagnostic criteria.\n\n【75】Our patient underwent MRI of the pituitary and chest, both of which showed normal findings. Abdominal CT also showed normal findings. The patient then underwent inferior petrosal sinus sampling (with CRH stimulation). This showed no substantial difference in corticotropin levels between petrosal sinus blood and the peripheral blood. The inferior petrosal sinus-peripheral ratio for corticotropin was 1.30, 1.32, 1.29, and 1.14 at baseline, 2, 5, and 10 minutes after CRH administration, respectively. A ratio less than 3 in our patient was consistent with ectopic disease.\n\n【76】*   5.\n\n【77】    **_At this time, which one of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient?_**\n\n【78】    *   a.\n\n【79】        _Bilateral adrenalectomy_\n\n【80】    *   b.\n\n【81】        _Repeated CT of the chest in 6 months_\n\n【82】    *   c.\n\n【83】        _Initiation of ketoconazole therapy_\n\n【84】    *   d.\n\n【85】        _Initiation of mitotane therapy_\n\n【86】    *   e.\n\n【87】        _Unilateral adrenalectomy_\n\n【88】This patient has severe Cushing syndrome, a debilitating and life-threatening disease. The ectopic source of corticotropin had not been detected. Therefore, immediate treatment is needed to resolve his hypercortisolism. The most appropriate management is bilateral adrenalectomy. Although the source of excess corticotropin production remains unknown, removal of the adrenal glands will prevent production of cortisol and hence further effects of hypercortisolism. Patients who undergo bilateral adrenalectomy are maintained on replacement glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. In patients with ectopic corticotropin secretion, the tumor may be undetectable at the time of investigation in approximately 35% but may be evident a few months or years later on a repeated imaging study. Therefore, it is important that patients with unlocalized ectopic disease undergo CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen at regular intervals.\n\n【89】Ketoconazole suppresses cortisol production by directly affecting adrenal gland steroidogenesis and is sometimes used as an interim agent to control hypercortisolism, particularly in patients with mild disease. Ketoconazole therapy in our patient would be unlikely to control his severe degree of hypercortisolism. Mitotane is an antineo- plastic agent that is often used in patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma. It can also be used in conjunction with ketoconazole in patients with severe Cushing syndrome who are not surgical candidates. Mitotane has severe adverse effects and was not considered appropriate management for this patient. Unilateral adrenalectomy would serve no purpose because the ectopic corticotropin production would still stimulate the remaining adrenal gland to produce excess cortisol.\n\n【90】The patient underwent bilateral adrenalectomy and was discharged home while taking corticosteroid therapy.\n\n【91】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【92】Evaluating Cushing syndrome can be a challenging task for a physician. Although the confirmation of Cushing syndrome in a patient with florid symptoms and signs may be relatively straightforward, the differentiation of mild Cushing syndrome from endogenous cortisol hypersecretion due to a pseudo-Cushing state may be difficult. Once the disorder is clinically suspected, accurate diagnosis relies on performing a logical sequence of the following diagnostic steps.\n\n【93】### Biochemical Screening and Confirmation of Cushing Syndrome and Exclusion of Pseudo-Cushing States\n\n【94】Conditions such as depression, infection, stress, and alcohol abuse (so-called pseudo-Cushing states) can be associated with elevated urinary free cortisol levels and lead to diagnostic confusion. Furthermore, approximately 10% to 15% of patients with Cushing syndrome in 1 study\n\n【95】The sensitivity of the urine free cortisol measurement as a screening test for Cushing's syndrome \\[abstract\\].\n\n【96】had at least 1 normal urinary free cortisol result from 4 collections. Therefore, clinical suspicion of Cushing syndrome with a negative urinary test mandates repeated urinary free cortisol measurement. Situations in which cortisol-binding globulin levels are elevated (eg, with estrogen- containing medications) can be associated with misleadingly elevated plasma cortisol values.\n\n【97】The low-dose dexamethasone test (0.5 mg 4 times daily for 2 days) has been used traditionally to confirm the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. The test can be used to assess for autonomous Cortisol hypersecretion when the urinary free Cortisol level is elevated less than 3-fold. Unfortunately, this test has limitations; some patients with a corticotropin-secreting pituitary adenoma may suppress cortisol production, and some pseudo-Cushing states may be resistant to suppression. Therefore, the results of the test should be interpreted in light of the index of clinical suspicion of Cushing syndrome. If the diagnosis remains unclear, it is appropriate to reevaluate the patient in a few months.\n\n【98】### Subtype Classification Into Corticotropin-Dependent and Corticotropin-Independent Disease\n\n【99】Once the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is confirmed, the next step is to determine whether the hypercortisolemia is corticotropin dependent or corticotropin independent. As discussed previously, a normal to elevated serum corticotropin level in a patient with Cushing syndrome suggests corticotropin-driven hypercortisolemia, and suppressed corticotropin levels indicate primary adrenal disease. This distinction is critical because it determines subsequent investigation and management.\n\n【100】### Differentiation Between Pituitary and Ectopic Sources of Corticotropin in Corticotropin-Dependent Disease\n\n【101】Often, the most challenging part of the evaluation of Cushing syndrome is differentiation between pituitary-dependent disease and ectopic corticotropin disorders. Pituitary adenomas account for most corticotropin-dependent causes of Cushing syndrome (85%); the rest are due to ectopic sources of corticotropin secretion (including bronchial carcinoid tumors, small cell carcinoma of the lung, islet cell carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma). The clinical history may give a clue to the source of corticotropin production. Pituitary-dependent disease is 5 times more common in women and usually occurs between the third and fifth decades of life. These patients often present with slow development of symptoms and signs during the course of a few years. The rapid onset of symptoms and signs of Cushing syndrome associated with hypokalemia is more consistent with an ectopic source of corticotropin. However, patients with ectopic tumors (particularly bronchial carcinoid tumors) can present with insidious onset of disease and a clinical picture indistinguishable from pituitary-dependent disease. In some patients an ectopic tumor may be recognized before onset of Cushing syndrome.\n\n【102】The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is not useful for distinguishing between pituitary and ectopic sources of corticotropin secretion. At least 30% of patients with corticotropin-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors will suppress plasma and urinary steroids to less than 50% of baseline values during high-dose dexamethasone suppression, and as many as 20% to 30% of patients with pituitary-dependent disease (particularly pituitary macro- adenomas) fail to suppress urinary free cortisol to less than 50%. Thus, the diagnostic accuracy of the high-dose dexa- methasone test is only 70% to 80%.\n\n【103】Inferior petrosal sinus sampling is currently the most accurate test to differentiate between pituitary and ectopic corticotropin-driven Cushing syndrome but is not readily available at all medical centers. Misleading results may be obtained when catheter placement is incorrect or when hypercortisolism is not present at the time of the procedure because of cyclic secretion of corticotropin. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling should be considered in the patient with documented hypercortisolism and normal findings on MRI of the pituitary gland. Of note, the test is invasive and may be associated with pronounced risks, including deep venous thrombosis and neurologic complications. Therefore, the procedure should not be considered routine and should be performed only by an experienced operator after careful review of the patient's clinical presentation and biochemical profile.\n\n【104】For appropriate evaluation, patients suspected of having Cushing syndrome need to undergo various tests, none of which is 100% accurate in confirming the presence or cause of the disorder. Each individual test has limitations. This knowledge will help clinicians avoid potential pitfalls in test interpretation that otherwise could lead to unnecessary further testing, inaccurate diagnosis, and inappropriate therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:43:34", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:43:50", "cost": 16.435}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:43:50", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:43:34"}

This segment of the large intestine is called the colon. This reduced blood flow may be caused by narrowing of the blood vessels supplying the colon. It also may be due to reduced blood flow caused by low blood pressure. The diminished blood flow doesn't provide enough oxygen for the cells in the digestive system. This can result in tissue damage to the affected area of the intestine.\n\n【2】Any part of the colon can be affected, but ischemic colitis most commonly causes pain on the left side of the belly area.\n\n【3】Ischemic colitis can be misdiagnosed because it can easily be confused with other digestive problems. You may need medicine to treat ischemic colitis or prevent infection. Or you may need surgery if your colon has been damaged. Most often, however, ischemic colitis heals on its own.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Symptoms of ischemic colitis can include:\n\n【6】*   Pain, tenderness or cramping in your belly, which can occur suddenly or happen over time\n*   Bright red or maroon blood in your stool or, at times, passage of blood alone without stool\n*   A feeling of urgency to move your bowels\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Nausea\n\n【7】The risk of severe complications is higher when you have symptoms on the right side of your belly. This is less commonly seen compared with left-sided colitis. People with right-sided colitis tend to have more underlying medical problems, such as high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation and kidney disease. They more frequently have to undergo surgery and also have a higher risk of death.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】Seek immediate medical care if you have sudden, severe pain in your belly area. Pain that makes you so uncomfortable that you can't sit still or find a comfortable position is a medical emergency.\n\n【10】Contact your health care provider if you develop worrisome symptoms, such as bloody diarrhea. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent serious complications.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】The precise cause of diminished blood flow to the colon isn't always clear. But several factors can increase your risk of ischemic colitis:\n\n【13】*   Buildup of fatty deposits on the walls of an artery, also called atherosclerosis\n*   Low blood pressure, also called hypotension, associated with dehydration, heart failure, surgery, trauma or shock\n*   Bowel obstruction caused by a hernia, scar tissue or a tumor\n*   Surgery involving the heart or blood vessels, or the digestive or gynecological systems\n*   Other medical disorders that affect your blood, such as inflammation of the blood vessels, called vasculitis, lupus or sickle cell anemia\n*   Cocaine or methamphetamine use\n*   Colon cancer, which is rare\n\n【14】### The role of medications\n\n【15】The use of certain medicines also can lead to ischemic colitis, though this is rare. These include:\n\n【16】*   Some heart and migraine medicines\n*   Hormone medicines, such as estrogen\n*   Antibiotics\n*   Pseudoephedrine\n*   Opioids\n*   Certain medicines for irritable bowel syndrome\n*   Chemotherapy medicines\n\n【17】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【18】Risk factors for ischemic colitis include:\n\n【19】*   **Age.** The condition occurs mostly frequently in adults older than age 60. Ischemic colitis that occurs in a young adult may be a sign of a blood-clotting irregularity. Or it also may be due to inflammation of the blood vessels, also known as vasculitis.\n*   **Sex.** Ischemic colitis is more common in women.\n*   **Clotting problems.** Conditions that affect the way the blood clots, such as factor V Leiden, may increase the risk of ischemic colitis.\n*   **High cholesterol,** which can lead to atherosclerosis.\n*   **Reduced blood flow,** due to heart failure, low blood pressure or shock. It may also be caused by certain conditions, such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.\n*   **Previous abdominal surgery.** Scar tissue that forms after surgery may cause reduced blood flow.\n*   **Heavy exercise,** such as marathon running, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the colon.\n*   **Surgery** involving the large artery that pumps blood from your heart to the rest of your body. This artery is called the aorta.\n\n【20】Complications\n-------------\n\n【21】Ischemic colitis usually gets better on its own within 2 to 3 days. In more-severe cases, complications can include:\n\n【22】*   **Tissue death,** also called gangrene, resulting from diminished blood flow\n*   **Hole formation,** also known as perforation, in the intestine or persistent bleeding\n*   **Bowel obstruction,** also called ischemic stricture\n\n【23】Prevention\n----------\n\n【24】Since the cause of ischemic colitis isn't always clear, there's no certain way to prevent the disorder. Most people who have ischemic colitis recover quickly and may never have another episode.\n\n【25】To prevent recurrent episodes of ischemic colitis, some doctors recommend stopping any medicine that might cause the condition. Making sure to stay adequately hydrated, especially when doing vigorous outdoor activities, is also important — especially for those living in warm climates. A test for clotting problems may be recommended as well, especially if no other cause for ischemic colitis is apparent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/20 10:29:27", "endTime": "2024/08/20 10:29:37", "cost": 9.916}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-18 23:19:36", "update_time": "2024-08-19 18:29:37", "grab_time": "2024-08-19 18:29:27"}
