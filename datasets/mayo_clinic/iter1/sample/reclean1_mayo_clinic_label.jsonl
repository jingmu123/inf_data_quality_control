Eight dosage strengths of single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin were flexibly titrated. The primary efficacy assessment of the main trial was the percentage of patients who attained the LDL-C treatment goals of both the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure and the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of the 1170 African American patients screened, 501 were enrolled in the study and 499 received drug therapy. At end point, 236 (48.3%) of 489 patients reached both their BP and LDL-C goals (vs 4 \\[0.8%\\] of 484 at baseline); 280 (56.8%) of 493 reached BP goals (vs 7 \\[1.4%\\] of 494 at baseline); and 361 (73.7%) of 490 reached LDL-C goals (vs 138 \\[28.5%\\] of 484 at baseline). Among the 499 patients receiving drug therapy, common treatment-related adverse events were peripheral edema (17 patients \\[3.4%\\]), headache (11 \\[2.2%\\]), myalgia (11 \\[2.2%\\]), and constipation (10 \\[2.0%\\]).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin therapy was well tolerated and effectively targeted HTN and dyslipidemia in this population of African Americans who were at risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】AE ( adverse event ), ALT ( alanine aminotransferase ), AST ( aspartate aminotransferase ), BP ( blood pressure ), CAPABLE ( Clinical Utility of Caduet in Simultaneously Achieving Blood Pressure and Lipid End Points ), CK ( creatine kinase ), CV ( cardiovascular ), GGT ( γ-glutamyl transpeptidase ), HTN ( hypertension ), ITT ( intention-to-treat ), JNC 7 ( Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure ), LDL-C ( low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), SAE ( serious AE ), SBP ( systolic BP ), ULN ( upper limit of normal )\n\n【10】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【14】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【16】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【17】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

We agree that personnel fluctuations need to be minimized. The issue is how to accomplish such a complex and never-ending objective. A comprehensive approach across all medical specialties may be too cumbersome to establish and fund de novo. As Coursin and Vender point out, changes in the health care sector occur rapidly. In addition, personnel supply considerations differ across specialties. For example, surgical specialties control training positions more tightly than does anesthesiology. A specialty-initiated approach may therefore yield more timely, actionable information coming from within its organization.\n\n【1】The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) has already moved to convene a task force on graduate medical education to address some possible manpower solutions. Likewise, the leadership of the Society of Academic Anesthesia Chairs is conducting a follow-up analysis to their 2000 assessment of academic personnel supply and demand. A truly optimal approach, however, would involve standing committees in each medical subspecialty society with representation from private and academic practice, assisted by appropriate consultants, charged with providing specialty-specific up-to- date workforce balance analyses.\n\n【2】This information should be published widely and updated annually, to be used in 2 ways. First, it should be routinely given to medical students. Second, the Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME), perhaps assisted by the Council of Medical Specialty Societies, the American Medical Association (AMA), and the Health Resources and Services Administration, should interpret the data at least annually and recommend appropriate administrative or congressional action. COGME even now is charged by Congress to assess physician (including specialist) workforce trends, identify needs, and recommend to the secretary of health and human services and Congress appropriate federal and private-sector efforts to address those needs. A new multidisciplinary permanent oversight committee may not be needed, just more timely attention and action by COGME in response to authoritative, specialty-originated information about important personnel supply and demand trends.\n\n【3】Providing authoritative, continually updated personnel supply and demand data to medical students and holding COGME to its congressionally established mission may go a long way to smooth imbalances in the labor market for physicians crucial to the American public's specialty as well as general health care needs.\n\n【4】Article info\n------------\n\n【5】### Identification\n\n【6】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/77.2.204\n\n【7】### Copyright\n\n【8】© 2002 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

You may feel pressure around the eyes, cheeks and forehead. Perhaps your head throbs.\n\n【2】But, this pain might actually be caused by a migraine.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Signs and symptoms of sinus headaches may include:\n\n【5】*   Pain, pressure and fullness in the cheeks, brow or forehead\n*   Worsening pain if you bend forward or lie down\n*   Stuffy nose\n*   Fatigue\n*   Achy feeling in the upper teeth\n\n【6】### Sinusitis or migraine?\n\n【7】Migraines and headaches from sinusitis are easy to confuse because the signs and symptoms of the two types of headaches may overlap.\n\n【8】Both migraine and sinusitis headache pain often get worse when you bend forward. Migraine can also be accompanied by various nasal signs and symptoms — including congestion, facial pressure and a clear, watery nasal discharge. These are due to involvement of the autonomic nervous system in a migraine attack. In fact, studies have shown that most people who see a health care provider for sinus headaches are found to have migraines instead.\n\n【9】Sinusitis, however, usually isn't associated with nausea or vomiting or aggravated by noise or bright light — all common features of migraines.\n\n【10】Sinusitis usually:\n\n【11】*   Occurs after a viral upper respiratory infection or cold\n*   Includes thick, discolored nasal mucus\n*   Is associated with a decreased sense of smell\n*   Causes pain in one cheek or upper teeth\n\n【12】Headaches due to sinus disease often last days or longer, and migraines most commonly last hours to a day or two.\n\n【13】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【14】Consult your provider if:\n\n【15】*   Your headache symptoms occur more than 15 days a month or require frequent pain medicine available without a prescription\n*   You have a severe headache, and pain medicine available without a prescription doesn't help\n*   You miss school or work because of frequent headaches or the headaches interfere with your daily life\n\n【16】Causes\n------\n\n【17】Sinus headaches are usually associated with migraines or other forms of headaches.\n\n【18】Sinus headaches are associated with pain and pressure in the face and sinuses and can cause nasal symptoms. Most of these headaches are not caused by sinus infections and generally should not be treated with antibiotics.\n\n【19】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【20】Sinus headaches can affect anyone but may be more likely if you have:\n\n【21】*   A previous history of migraines or headaches\n*   A family history of migraines or headaches\n*   Hormonal changes associated with headaches\n\n【22】Prevention\n----------\n\n【23】Whether or not you take preventive medications, you may benefit from lifestyle changes that can help reduce the number and severity of headaches. One or more of these suggestions may be helpful for you:\n\n【24】*   **Avoid triggers.** If certain foods or odors seem to have triggered your headaches in the past, avoid them. Your provider may recommend you reduce your caffeine and alcohol intake and avoid tobacco.\n\n【25】    In general, establish a daily routine with regular sleep patterns and regular meals. In addition, try to control stress.\n\n【26】*   **Exercise regularly.** Regular aerobic exercise reduces tension and can help prevent headaches. If your provider agrees, choose any aerobic exercise you enjoy, including walking, swimming and cycling.\n\n【27】    Warm up slowly, however, because sudden, intense exercise can cause headaches.\n\n【28】    Obesity is also thought to be a factor in headaches, and regular exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight or lose weight.\n\n【29】*   **Reduce the effects of estrogen.** If estrogen seems to trigger or make your headaches worse, you may want to avoid or reduce the medications you take that contain estrogen.\n\n【30】    These medications include birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy. Talk with your provider about the appropriate alternatives or dosages for you.\n\n【31】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.\n\n【10】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【11】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【12】*   Powder\n\n【13】Before Using\n------------\n\n【14】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【15】### Allergies\n\n【16】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【17】### Pediatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of salmeterol in children 4 years of age and older. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 4 years of age.\n\n【19】### Geriatric\n\n【20】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of salmeterol in the elderly. However, elderly patients with heart or blood vessel problems may require special caution when receiving salmeterol.\n\n【21】### Breastfeeding\n\n【22】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【23】### Drug Interactions\n\n【24】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【26】*   Abametapir\n*   Acebutolol\n*   Arotinolol\n*   Atenolol\n*   Befunolol\n*   Betaxolol\n*   Bevantolol\n*   Bisoprolol\n*   Boceprevir\n*   Bopindolol\n*   Bucindolol\n*   Bupranolol\n*   Carteolol\n*   Carvedilol\n*   Celiprolol\n*   Ceritinib\n*   Clarithromycin\n*   Cobicistat\n*   Conivaptan\n*   Darunavir\n*   Dasabuvir\n*   Dilevalol\n*   Esmolol\n*   Fedratinib\n*   Fexinidazole\n*   Fosnetupitant\n*   Idelalisib\n*   Indinavir\n*   Itraconazole\n*   Ketoconazole\n*   Labetalol\n*   Landiolol\n*   Levobunolol\n*   Lopinavir\n*   Mepindolol\n*   Methacholine\n*   Metipranolol\n*   Metoprolol\n*   Nadolol\n*   Nebivolol\n*   Nefazodone\n*   Nelfinavir\n*   Netupitant\n*   Nilotinib\n*   Nirmatrelvir\n*   Omaveloxolone\n*   Ombitasvir\n*   Oxprenolol\n*   Paritaprevir\n*   Penbutolol\n*   Phenobarbital\n*   Pindolol\n*   Posaconazole\n*   Practolol\n*   Primidone\n*   Propranolol\n*   Ritonavir\n*   Saquinavir\n*   Sotalol\n*   Talinolol\n*   Telaprevir\n*   Telithromycin\n*   Tertatolol\n*   Timolol\n*   Voriconazole\n\n【27】### Other Interactions\n\n【28】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【30】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【31】*   Asthma attack, acute or\n*   Bronchospasm (difficulty with breathing), acute or\n*   COPD flare-up or\n*   Milk protein allergy, severe—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【32】*   Diabetes or\n*   Heart or blood vessel disease or\n*   Heart rhythm problems (eg arrhythmia, QT prolongation) or\n*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) or\n*   Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) or\n*   Hypokalemia (low potassium in the blood) or\n*   Ketoacidosis (high ketones in the blood) or\n*   Seizures, history of—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【33】*   Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【34】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【35】Inhaled salmeterol is used to prevent asthma attacks and to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not used to relieve an asthma attack that has already started. For relief of an asthma attack that has already started, you should use another medicine. If you do not have another medicine to use for an attack or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.\n\n【36】Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using this medicine without first telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of having breathing problems.\n\n【37】This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using this medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the Diskus®, ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the Diskus® to make sure you are using it properly.\n\n【38】In order for this medicine to help prevent asthma or COPD attacks, it must be used every day in regularly spaced doses, as ordered by your doctor.\n\n【39】To use the Diskus®:\n\n【40】*   Open the foil pouch containing the Diskus®.\n*   To open the Diskus®, push the thumb grip away from you as far as it will go. You will hear a click and feel a snap. When open, the mouthpiece will appear.\n*   Slide the mouthpiece lever away from you as far as it will go until it clicks. The Diskus® is now ready to use. If you close the Diskus® or push the lever again, you will lose the medicine.\n*   Turn your head away from the Diskus®, and breathe out to the end of a normal breath. Do not breathe into the Diskus®.\n*   Holding the Diskus® level, put the mouthpiece between your lips and teeth, and close your lips around the mouthpiece. Do not bite down on the mouthpiece. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue.\n*   Breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath. Do not breathe through your nose.\n*   Hold your breath and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Continue holding your breath as long as you can up to 10 seconds before breathing out slowly. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.\n*   Turn your head away from the Diskus®, and breathe out slowly to the end of a normal breath. Do not breathe into the Diskus®.\n*   If your doctor has told you to inhale more than one puff of medicine at each dose, take the second puff using exactly the same steps you used for the first puff.\n*   When you are finished, close the Diskus®. Place your thumb on the thumb grip, and slide it back toward you as far as it will go. You will hear it click shut.\n*   Keep the Diskus® dry. Do not wash the mouthpiece, or any other part of the Diskus®. You may use a dry cloth to wipe it clean.\n*   The Diskus® has a window that shows the number of doses that are left. This tells you when you are getting low on medicine. When the Diskus® has 5 doses left, the numbers from 5 to 0 will show up in red to remind you to refill your prescription.\n\n【41】### Dosing\n\n【42】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【43】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【44】*   For inhalation dosage form (powder):\n    *   For maintenance treatment of COPD:\n        *   Adults—One inhalation (50 micrograms \\[mcg\\]) 2 times a day (morning and evening). The doses should be at least 12 hours apart.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For preventing an asthma attack:\n        *   Adults and children 4 years of age and older—One inhalation (50 micrograms \\[mcg\\]) 2 times a day (morning and evening), at least 12 hours apart.\n        *   Children younger than 4 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For preventing exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB):\n        *   Adults and children 4 years of age and older—One inhalation (50 micrograms \\[mcg\\]) taken at least 30 minutes before exercise for patients without persistent asthma. For patients with persistent asthma, one inhalation (50 mcg) 2 times a day (morning and evening), at least 12 hours apart. Do not use another dose for 12 hours after you have taken 2 doses of this medicine for the day.\n        *   Children younger than 4 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【45】### Missed Dose\n\n【46】If you miss a dose of this medicine, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【47】### Storage\n\n【48】Keep the medicine in the foil pouch until you are ready to use it. Store at room temperature, away from heat and direct light. Do not freeze.\n\n【49】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【50】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【51】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【52】Throw the medicine away 6 weeks after it is removed from the foil pouch or after all the blisters have been used (dose indicator reaches \"0\").\n\n【53】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【54】It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to check for any unwanted effects.\n\n【55】Tell your doctor if you are also using other medicines for your COPD. Your doctor may want you to stop using the medicine and use it only during a severe COPD attack. Follow your doctor's instructions on how you should take your medicine.\n\n【56】This medicine should not be used if you are having a severe COPD attack, or if symptoms of COPD attack has already started. Your doctor may prescribe another medicine for you to use in case of an acute COPD attack. If the other medicine does not work as well, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【57】This medicine should only be used as an additional treatment for patients who cannot be treated with other asthma medicines (such as inhaled corticosteroids) or for asthma patients that require two medicines, including salmeterol. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【58】Although this medicine decreases the number of asthma episodes, it may increase the chance for a severe asthma attack when they do occur. Be sure to read about these risks in the Medication Guide and talk to your doctor or pharmacist about any questions or concerns you may have.\n\n【59】You should not use this medicine if your asthma attack has already started. Your doctor will prescribe another medicine (eg, a short-acting inhaler) for you to use in case of an acute asthma attack. Make sure you understand how to use the short-acting inhaler. Talk to your doctor if you need instructions.\n\n【60】Do not use any other asthma medicine or medicine for breathing problems without checking first with your doctor. This medicine should not be used with other inhalers that contain arformoterol (Brovana™), budesonide and formoterol combination (Symbicort®), fluticasone and salmeterol combination (Advair® Diskus®, Advair® HFA), formoterol (Foradil® Aerolizer®, Perforomist™), or indacaterol (Arcapta® Neohaler®).\n\n【61】Tell your doctor if you are using or have used medicine for depression (eg, MAO inhibitor, TCA) within the past 2 weeks.\n\n【62】Talk to your doctor or get medical care right away if:\n\n【63】*   Your or your child's symptoms do not improve after using this medicine for 1 week or if they become worse.\n*   Your short-acting inhaler does not seem to be working as well as usual and you or your child need to use it more often (eg, you use 1 whole canister of the short-acting inhaler in 8 weeks time, or you need to use 4 or more inhalations of the short-acting inhaler in 24 hours or for 2 or more days in a row).\n*   You or your child have a big decrease in your peak flow when measured as directed by your doctor.\n\n【64】Do not change your dose or stop using your medicine without first asking your doctor.\n\n【65】Your doctor may want you to carry a medical identification (ID) card stating that you or your child are using this medicine. The card will say that you may need additional medicine during an emergency, a severe asthma attack or other illness, or unusual stress.\n\n【66】This medicine may cause paradoxical bronchospasm, which means your breathing or wheezing will get worse. Paradoxical bronchospasm may be life-threatening. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child are having a cough, difficulty with breathing, shortness of breath, or wheezing after using this medicine.\n\n【67】If you or your child develop a skin rash, hives, or any allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis) to this medicine, check with your doctor right away.\n\n【68】Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have chest pain, a fast heartbeat, nervousness, shaking of the hands or feet, noisy breathing, a feeling of choking, or tightness or irritation of the throat while using this medicine.\n\n【69】Hypokalemia (low potassium in the blood) may occur while you are using this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have more than one of the following symptoms: convulsions (seizures), decreased urine, dry mouth, increased thirst, irregular heartbeat, loss of appetite, mood changes, muscle pain or cramps, nausea or vomiting, numbness or tingling in the hands, feet, or lips, shortness of breath, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【70】This medicine may affect blood sugar levels. If you or your child are diabetic and notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests, check with your doctor.\n\n【71】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【72】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【73】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.

The electronic medical record was reviewed to assess for subsequent clinical management and survival.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Potentially pathologic IFs (PPIFs) were present in 285 patients (67.2%). The mean ± SD number of PPIFs per patient was 1.1±1.0 (range, 0-4). Factors associated with higher numbers of PPIFs were reduced ejection fraction ( _P_ \\=.02) and history of smoking ( _P_ \\=.06). Potentially pathologic incidental findings prompted clinical work-up in 39 patients (9.2%) and delayed or canceled treatment plans for aortic stenosis in 7 patients (1.7%). The number needed to image to diagnose a new malignancy or medical condition was 19. The number of PPIFs was predictive of poor overall survival before (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.31-1.88) and after (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.19-1.76) adjustment for baseline clinical variables ( _P_ <.001 for both).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】This investigation found that PPIFs are common in elderly patients undergoing TAVR-CTA scans and, once discovered, commonly generate further clinical evaluation. Higher numbers of PPIFs may be predictive of poorer survival, but further study is required to guide the appropriateness of pursuing diagnostic evaluations for asymptomatic PPIFs in this elderly population.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AS ( aortic stenosis ), ECG ( electrocardiogram ), HR ( hazard ratio ), IF ( incidental findings ), PPIF ( potentially pathologic incidental finding ), SAVR ( surgical aortic valve replacement ), TAVR ( transcatheter aortic valve replacement ), TAVR-CTA ( electrocardiographically gated aortoiliac computed tomographic angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "73066d74-c946-474a-8d0e-4ed94364f8de", "title": "Viral hemorrhagic fevers", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Viral hemorrhagic (hem-uh-RAJ-ik) fevers are infectious diseases that can cause severe, life-threatening illness. They can damage the walls of tiny blood vessels, making them leak, and can hamper the blood's ability to clot. The resulting internal bleeding is usually not life-threatening, but the diseases can be.\n\n【2】Some viral hemorrhagic fevers include:\n\n【3】*   Dengue\n*   Ebola\n*   Lassa\n*   Marburg\n*   Yellow fever\n\n【4】These diseases most commonly occur in tropical areas. In the United States, people who get them usually have recently traveled to one of those areas.\n\n【5】There's no cure for viral hemorrhagic fevers. There are vaccines for only a few types. Until additional vaccines are developed, the best approach is prevention.\n\n【6】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【7】Signs and symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fevers vary by disease. In general, early signs and symptoms can include:\n\n【8】*   Fever\n*   Fatigue, weakness or general feeling of being unwell\n*   Dizziness\n*   Muscle, bone or joint aches\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n\n【9】### Symptoms that can become life-threatening\n\n【10】More-severe symptoms include:\n\n【11】*   Bleeding under the skin, in internal organs, or from the mouth, eyes or ears\n*   Nervous system malfunctions\n*   Coma\n*   Delirium\n*   Kidney failure\n*   Respiratory failure\n*   Liver failure\n\n【12】### When to see a doctor\n\n【13】The best time to see a doctor is before you travel to a developing country to ensure that you've received any available vaccinations and pre-travel advice for staying healthy.\n\n【14】If you develop signs and symptoms once you return home, talk to a doctor, preferably one trained in international medicine or infectious diseases. Tell your doctor where you've traveled.\n\n【15】Causes\n------\n\n【16】Viral hemorrhagic fevers are spread by contact with infected animals or insects. The viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fevers live in a variety of animal and insect hosts. Most commonly the hosts include mosquitoes, ticks, rodents or bats.\n\n【17】Some viral hemorrhagic fevers can also be spread from person to person.\n\n【18】### How is it transmitted?\n\n【19】Some viral hemorrhagic fevers are spread by mosquito or tick bites. Others are spread by contact with infected body fluids, such as blood, saliva or semen. A few varieties can be inhaled from infected rat feces or urine.\n\n【20】If you travel to an area where a particular hemorrhagic fever is common, you can be infected there but not develop symptoms until after you return home. Depending on the type of virus, it can take from two to 21 days for symptoms to develop.\n\n【21】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【22】Living in or traveling to an area where a particular viral hemorrhagic fever is common will increase your risk of becoming infected with that particular virus. Other factors that can increase your risk include:\n\n【23】*   Working with infected people\n*   Slaughtering or eating infected animals\n*   Sharing needles to use intravenous drugs\n*   Having unprotected sex\n*   Working outdoors or in rat-infested buildings\n*   Being exposed to infected blood or other body fluids\n\n【24】Complications\n-------------\n\n【25】Viral hemorrhagic fevers can cause:\n\n【26】*   Septic shock\n*   Multiorgan failure\n*   Death\n\n【27】Prevention\n----------\n\n【28】Preventing viral hemorrhagic fevers is challenging. If you live in, work in or travel to areas where these diseases are common, protect yourself from infection by using appropriate protective barriers when working with blood or body fluids. For example, wear gloves and eye and face shields. Precautions also include careful handling, disinfection and disposal of lab specimens and waste.\n\n【29】### Get vaccinated\n\n【30】The yellow fever vaccine is generally considered safe and effective. However, in rare cases, serious side effects can occur. The yellow fever vaccine isn't recommended for children younger than 9 months of age; pregnant women, especially during the first trimester; or people with compromised immune systems.\n\n【31】There's also an Ebola vaccination that protects against one type of Ebola. Check with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the status of the countries you're visiting — some require certificates of vaccination for entry.\n\n【32】### Avoid mosquitoes and ticks\n\n【33】Do your best to avoid these insects, especially when traveling in areas where there are outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers. Wear light-colored long pants and long-sleeved shirts or, better yet, permethrin-coated clothing.

{"seq_id": "cc9fbe1b-64a9-4e9b-9429-10607f7252bf", "title": "Rickets", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Rickets is the softening and weakening of bones in children, usually because of an extreme and prolonged vitamin D deficiency. Rare inherited problems also can cause rickets.\n\n【2】Vitamin D helps your child's body absorb calcium and phosphorus from food. Not enough vitamin D makes it difficult to maintain proper calcium and phosphorus levels in bones, which can cause rickets.\n\n【3】Adding vitamin D or calcium to the diet generally corrects the bone problems associated with rickets. When rickets is due to another underlying medical problem, your child may need additional medications or other treatment. Some skeletal deformities caused by rickets may require corrective surgery.\n\n【4】Rare inherited disorders related to low levels of phosphorus, the other mineral component in bone, may require other medications.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms of rickets can include:\n\n【7】*   Delayed growth\n*   Delayed motor skills\n*   Pain in the spine, pelvis and legs\n*   Muscle weakness\n\n【8】Because rickets softens the areas of growing tissue at the ends of a child's bones (growth plates), it can cause skeletal deformities such as:\n\n【9】*   Bowed legs or knock knees\n*   Thickened wrists and ankles\n*   Breastbone projection\n\n【10】### When to see a doctor\n\n【11】Talk to your doctor if your child develops bone pain, muscle weakness or obvious skeletal deformities.\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】Your child's body needs vitamin D to absorb calcium and phosphorus from food. Rickets can occur if your child's body doesn't get enough vitamin D or if his or her body has problems using vitamin D properly. Occasionally, not getting enough calcium or lack of calcium and vitamin D can cause rickets.\n\n【14】### Lack of vitamin D\n\n【15】Children who don't get enough vitamin D from these two sources can develop a deficiency:\n\n【16】无关删除-2*   **Sunlight.** Your child's skin produces vitamin D when it's exposed to sunlight. But children in developed countries tend to spend less time outdoors. They're also more likely to use sunscreen, which blocks the sun's rays that trigger the skin's production of vitamin D.\n*   **Food.** Fish oil, egg yolks and fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel contain vitamin D. Vitamin D has also been added to some foods and beverages, such as milk, cereal and some fruit juices.\n\n【17】### Problems with absorption\n\n【18】Some children are born with or develop medical conditions that affect the way their bodies absorb vitamin D. Some examples include:\n\n【19】*   Celiac disease\n*   Inflammatory bowel disease\n*   Cystic fibrosis\n*   Kidney problems\n\n【20】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【21】Factors that can increase a child's risk of rickets include:\n\n【22】无关删除-2*   **Dark skin.** Dark skin has more of the pigment melanin, which lowers the skin's ability to produce vitamin D from sunlight.\n*   **Mother's vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy.** A baby born to a mother with severe vitamin D deficiency can be born with signs of rickets or develop them within a few months after birth.\n*   **Northern latitudes.** Children who live in geographical locations where there is less sunshine are at higher risk of rickets.\n*   **Premature birth.** Babies born before their due dates tend have lower levels of vitamin D because they had less time to receive the vitamin from their mothers in the womb.\n*   **Medications.** Certain types of anti-seizure medications and antiretroviral medications, used to treat HIV infections, appear to interfere with the body's ability to use vitamin D.\n*   **Exclusive breast-feeding.** Breast milk doesn't contain enough vitamin D to prevent rickets. Babies who are exclusively breast-fed should receive vitamin D drops.\n\n【23】Complications\n-------------\n\n【24】Left untreated, rickets can lead to:\n\n【25】*   Failure to grow\n*   An abnormally curved spine\n*   Bone deformities\n*   Dental defects\n*   Seizures\n\n【26】Prevention\n----------\n\n【27】Exposure to sunlight provides the best source of vitamin D. During most seasons, 10 to 15 minutes of exposure to the sun near midday is enough. However, if you're dark-skinned, if it's winter or if you live in northern latitudes, you might not be able to get enough vitamin D from sun exposure.\n\n【28】In addition, because of skin cancer concerns, infants and young children, especially, are warned to avoid direct sun or to always wear sunscreen and protective clothing.\n\n【29】To prevent rickets, make sure your child eats foods that contain vitamin D naturally — fatty fish such as salmon and tuna, fish oil and egg yolks — or that have been fortified with vitamin D, such as:\n\n【30】*   Infant formula\n*   Cereal\n*   Bread\n*   Milk, but not foods made from milk, such as some yogurts and cheese\n*   Orange juice\n\n【31】Check labels to determine the vitamin D content of fortified foods.\n\n【32】If you're pregnant, ask your doctor about taking vitamin D supplements.\n\n【33】Guidelines recommend that all infants should receive 400 IU a day of vitamin D. Because human milk contains only a small amount of vitamin D, infants who are exclusively breast-fed should receive supplemental vitamin D daily. Some bottle-fed infants may also need vitamin D supplements if they aren't receiving enough from their formula.\n\n【34】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【55】You or your child will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.\n\n【56】Adalimumab-aacf injection will lower the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed or get infections more easily. To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers.\n\n【57】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. Using abatacept (Orencia®), anakinra (Kineret®), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®), etanercept (Enbrel®), golimumab (Simponi®), or infliximab (Remicade®) together with this medicine may increase your risk of having serious side effects.\n\n【58】This medicine may cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after this medicine is used. A small number of people (including children and teenagers) who have used this type of medicine have developed certain types of cancer (eg, leukemia). Some patients also developed a rare type of cancer called lymphoma. Talk with your doctor if you or your child have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, or unexplained weight loss. Also, check with your doctor right away if your skin has red, scaly patches, or raised bumps that are filled with pus.\n\n【59】Adalimumab-aacf injection may cause serious allergic reactions, (eg, anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema), which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have a cough, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, fast heartbeat, large, hive-like swelling on the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, throat, hands, legs, feet, sex organs, rash, itching, trouble breathing, or unusual tiredness or weakness after using this medicine.\n\n【60】Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, or sudden weight gain. These may be signs of a heart condition called congestive heart failure (CHF).\n\n【61】Some people who have used this medicine developed lupus-like symptoms during treatment and got better after the medicine was stopped. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child start having chest pains, joint pain, or a rash on your cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun.\n\n【62】Do not have any live vaccines (immunizations) while you or your child are being treated with adalimumab-aacf. Your child's vaccines need to be current before he or she begins using this medicine. Be sure to ask your child's doctor if you have any questions about this.\n\n【63】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【64】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【65】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.

Eligible outpatients who had been fasting for at least 8 hours underwent venous phlebotomy at baseline, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes to measure plasma potassium levels in whole blood using a point-of-care device (i-STAT, Abbott Laboratories). We analyzed the results to assess their variability and frequency of pseudohyperkalemia and pseudonormokalemia.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 1170 patients were included in this study. Absolute differences between pairs of measurements from different time points ranged from 0 to 2.5 mmol/L, with a mean difference of 0.26 mmol/L. The mean percentage differences were approximately 5% with an SD of 5%. Approximately 12% of differences between repeated fasting potassium blood test results were above 0.5 mmol/L (33% of the normal range), and 20% of patients (234) had at least one difference greater than 0.5 mmol/L. In 44.0% of the patients with a hyperkalemic average value (true hyperkalemia) (302 of 686), at least one blood test result was in the normal range (pseudonormokalemia), and in 30.2% of the patients with a normal average value (146 of 484), at least one blood test result was elevated (pseudohyperkalemia).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Expected variability and errors exist with potassium blood tests, even when conditions are optimized. Pseudohyperkalemia and pseudonormokalemia are common, indicating a need for thoughtful clinical interpretation of unexpected test results.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CCC ( concordance correlation coefficient ), ECG ( electrocardiography )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Your larynx enables you to speak, breathe, and eat. Your trachea connects your larynx to your lungs.\n\n【2】This procedure is complex, but it may restore your ability to breathe and allow you to live a more active life.\n\n【3】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【4】When you have a damaged larynx or trachea, and other ways of treating it have not worked, you may need a trachea transplant.\n\n【5】Some of the reasons to have a trachea transplant include:\n\n【6】*   Scarring of the larynx or trachea\n*   Severe injury and damage to your larynx or trachea\n*   Narrowing of your trachea since birth\n*   Growths in your larynx or trachea\n\n【7】Trachea transplant may be an option if these treatments have not helped you:\n\n【8】*   An opening in your neck (tracheostomy)\n*   Previous surgery on your larynx or trachea\n*   A tube (stent) placed to open your trachea more\n\n【9】Risks\n-----\n\n【10】Risks can occur during or after your transplant. Some problems could happen right after your surgery, and some could happen later.\n\n【11】Risks are:\n\n【12】*   **Bleeding.** Your care team will watch you carefully for blood loss.\n*   **Rejection of the new trachea.** After a transplant, your immune system sees that something foreign is inside you and attacks it.\n\n【13】    You will get medication to reduce the chance that your body rejects your new trachea. You may have side effects such as high blood sugar, kidney problems, swelling, infections, nausea and other conditions. If this happens, you will be treated right away.\n\n【14】*   **Infection.** Infection can happen after any surgery and when you take anti-rejection medication. If you develop signs of an infection, such as chills, a high fever, fatigue that is new or body aches, call your care provider right away.\n\n【15】    It is also important to reduce your chances of getting an infection. Stay away from crowds and sick people, wash your hands frequently, and stay up to date on your vaccinations. Also, take safe care of your teeth, and do not share utensils with others.\n\n【16】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【17】If you are preparing for a larynx or trachea transplant, you have been on a long journey.\n\n【18】### Taking the first steps\n\n【19】When you and your doctor have decided on a transplant, you will have to choose a transplant center. Doctors at this center will perform an exam to see if you are eligible for a transplant. Your care team will look at your health history and all your prior tests. The team will go over the benefits and risks of the transplant with you.\n\n【20】When you choose a center, look at how much experience the center has. Each center should have statistics that you can check and compare to other centers.\n\n【21】Ask if the transplant center provides other services you will need such as support groups, travel assistance and long-term follow-up.\n\n【22】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【23】### During your transplant\n\n【24】You will be asleep during the transplant and will be given medication, so you do not feel pain. The surgeon will remove your damaged trachea and sew the new one in its place.\n\n【25】This procedure takes several hours, but you will not be aware of the time passing.\n\n【26】### After your transplant\n\n【27】When you wake up, you will have tubes in place in your body to help your recovery. You will have oxygen, intravenous (IV) fluid, a breathing tube and a tube to drain your urine. You will receive medicine for pain.\n\n【28】You will move from the operating room to the intensive care unit (ICU) so you can be closely watched.\n\n【29】As time goes by, your team will remove the tubes and move you to a regular hospital bed.\n\n【30】The amount of time you spend in the hospital varies from person to person but is usually a few weeks.\n\n【31】When you leave the hospital, you will need close follow-up care by the transplant team. Since you will be on anti-rejection medication, you should follow directions carefully. You should also follow diet and exercise guidance from your care team.\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】A larynx or tracheal transplant can improve your quality of life.\n\n【34】This procedure can restore functions that improve your health and comfort.\n\n【35】You will receive a follow-up appointment and the transplant team will help you with other resources such as support groups, exercise programs and speech therapy if needed. You may also receive help with meal planning and instruction about your medications.\n\n【36】### What if your new transplant fails?\n\n【37】Not all transplants work. This surgery is challenging, but new techniques and results offer promise. If you have problems with your transplant, your health care provider will tell you what options you have.\n\n【38】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "cd25f252-6443-47ca-bff5-da7a62c7ea8a", "title": "Achilles tendinitis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Achilles tendinitis is an overuse injury of the Achilles (uh-KILL-eez) tendon, the band of tissue that connects calf muscles at the back of the lower leg to your heel bone.\n\n【2】Achilles tendinitis most commonly occurs in runners who have suddenly increased the intensity or duration of their runs. It's also common in middle-aged people who play sports, such as tennis or basketball, only on the weekends.\n\n【3】Most cases of Achilles tendinitis can be treated with relatively simple, at-home care under your doctor's supervision. Self-care strategies are usually necessary to prevent recurring episodes. More-serious cases of Achilles tendinitis can lead to tendon tears (ruptures) that may require surgical repair.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The pain associated with Achilles tendinitis typically begins as a mild ache in the back of the leg or above the heel after running or other sports activity. Episodes of more-severe pain may occur after prolonged running, stair climbing or sprinting.\n\n【6】You might also experience tenderness or stiffness, especially in the morning, which usually improves with mild activity.\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】If you experience persistent pain around the Achilles tendon, call your doctor. Seek immediate medical attention if the pain or disability is severe. You may have a torn (ruptured) Achilles tendon.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Achilles tendinitis is caused by repetitive or intense strain on the Achilles tendon, the band of tissue that connects your calf muscles to your heel bone. This tendon is used when you walk, run, jump or push up on your toes.\n\n【11】The structure of the Achilles tendon weakens with age, which can make it more susceptible to injury — particularly in people who may participate in sports only on the weekends or who have suddenly increased the intensity of their running programs.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】A number of factors may increase your risk of Achilles tendinitis, including:\n\n【14】*   **Your sex.** Achilles tendinitis occurs most commonly in men.\n*   **Age.** Achilles tendinitis is more common as you age.\n*   **Physical problems.** A naturally flat arch in your foot can put more strain on the Achilles tendon. Obesity and tight calf muscles also can increase tendon strain.\n*   **Training choices.** Running in worn-out shoes can increase your risk of Achilles tendinitis. Tendon pain occurs more frequently in cold weather than in warm weather, and running on hilly terrain also can predispose you to Achilles injury.\n*   **Medical conditions.** People who have psoriasis or high blood pressure are at higher risk of developing Achilles tendinitis.\n*   **Medications.** Certain types of antibiotics, called fluoroquinolones, have been associated with higher rates of Achilles tendinitis.\n\n【15】Complications\n-------------\n\n【16】Achilles tendinitis can weaken the tendon, making it more vulnerable to a tear (rupture) — a painful injury that usually requires surgical repair.\n\n【17】Prevention\n----------\n\n【18】While it may not be possible to prevent Achilles tendinitis, you can take measures to reduce your risk:\n\n【19】*   **Increase your activity level gradually.** If you're just beginning an exercise regimen, start slowly and gradually increase the duration and intensity of the training.\n*   **Take it easy.** Avoid activities that place excessive stress on your tendons, such as hill running. If you participate in a strenuous activity, warm up first by exercising at a slower pace. If you notice pain during a particular exercise, stop and rest.\n*   **Choose your shoes carefully.** The shoes you wear while exercising should provide adequate cushioning for your heel and should have a firm arch support to help reduce the tension in the Achilles tendon. Replace your worn-out shoes. If your shoes are in good condition but don't support your feet, try arch supports in both shoes.\n*   **Stretch daily.** Take the time to stretch your calf muscles and Achilles tendon in the morning, before exercise and after exercise to maintain flexibility. This is especially important to avoid a recurrence of Achilles tendinitis.\n*   **Strengthen your calf muscles.** Strong calf muscles enable the calf and Achilles tendon to better handle the stresses they encounter with activity and exercise.\n*   **Cross-train.** Alternate high-impact activities, such as running and jumping, with low-impact activities, such as cycling and swimming.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "7531ed78-4272-4eb4-b28b-97483e22eacb", "title": "Uterine fibroids", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths of the uterus that often appear during childbearing years. Also called leiomyomas (lie-o-my-O-muhs) or myomas, uterine fibroids aren't associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and almost never develop into cancer.\n\n【2】Fibroids range in size from seedlings, undetectable by the human eye, to bulky masses that can distort and enlarge the uterus. You can have a single fibroid or multiple ones. In extreme cases, multiple fibroids can expand the uterus so much that it reaches the rib cage and can add weight.\n\n【3】Many women have uterine fibroids sometime during their lives. But you might not know you have uterine fibroids because they often cause no symptoms. Your doctor may discover fibroids incidentally during a pelvic exam or prenatal ultrasound.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Many women who have fibroids don't have any symptoms. In those that do, symptoms can be influenced by the location, size and number of fibroids.\n\n【6】In women who have symptoms, the most common signs and symptoms of uterine fibroids include:\n\n【7】*   Heavy menstrual bleeding\n*   Menstrual periods lasting more than a week\n*   Pelvic pressure or pain\n*   Frequent urination\n*   Difficulty emptying the bladder\n*   Constipation\n*   Backache or leg pains\n\n【8】Rarely, a fibroid can cause acute pain when it outgrows its blood supply, and begins to die.\n\n【9】Fibroids are generally classified by their location. Intramural fibroids grow within the muscular uterine wall. Submucosal fibroids bulge into the uterine cavity. Subserosal fibroids project to the outside of the uterus.\n\n【10】### When to see a doctor\n\n【11】See your doctor if you have:\n\n【12】*   Pelvic pain that doesn't go away\n*   Overly heavy, prolonged or painful periods\n*   Spotting or bleeding between periods\n*   Difficulty emptying your bladder\n*   Unexplained low red blood cell count (anemia)\n\n【13】Seek prompt medical care if you have severe vaginal bleeding or sharp pelvic pain that comes on suddenly.\n\n【14】Causes\n------\n\n【15】Doctors don't know the cause of uterine fibroids, but research and clinical experience point to these factors:\n\n【16】*   **Genetic changes.** Many fibroids contain changes in genes that differ from those in typical uterine muscle cells.\n*   **Hormones.** Estrogen and progesterone, two hormones that stimulate development of the uterine lining during each menstrual cycle in preparation for pregnancy, appear to promote the growth of fibroids.\n\n【17】    Fibroids contain more estrogen and progesterone receptors than typical uterine muscle cells do. Fibroids tend to shrink after menopause due to a decrease in hormone production.\n\n【18】*   **Other growth factors.** Substances that help the body maintain tissues, such as insulin-like growth factor, may affect fibroid growth.\n*   **Extracellular matrix (ECM).** ECM is the material that makes cells stick together, like mortar between bricks. ECM is increased in fibroids and makes them fibrous. ECM also stores growth factors and causes biologic changes in the cells themselves.\n\n【19】Doctors believe that uterine fibroids develop from a stem cell in the smooth muscular tissue of the uterus (myometrium). A single cell divides repeatedly, eventually creating a firm, rubbery mass distinct from nearby tissue.\n\n【20】The growth patterns of uterine fibroids vary — they may grow slowly or rapidly, or they may remain the same size. Some fibroids go through growth spurts, and some may shrink on their own.\n\n【21】Many fibroids that have been present during pregnancy shrink or disappear after pregnancy, as the uterus goes back to its usual size.\n\n【22】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【23】There are few known risk factors for uterine fibroids, other than being a woman of reproductive age. Factors that can have an impact on fibroid development include:\n\n【24】*   **Race.** Although all women of reproductive age could develop fibroids, black women are more likely to have fibroids than are women of other racial groups. In addition, black women have fibroids at younger ages, and they're also likely to have more or larger fibroids, along with more-severe symptoms.\n*   **Heredity.** If your mother or sister had fibroids, you're at increased risk of developing them.\n*   **Other factors.** Starting your period at an early age; obesity; a vitamin D deficiency; having a diet higher in red meat and lower in green vegetables, fruit and dairy; and drinking alcohol, including beer, appear to increase your risk of developing fibroids.\n\n【25】Complications\n-------------\n\n【26】Although uterine fibroids usually aren't dangerous, they can cause discomfort and may lead to complications such as a drop in red blood cells (anemia), which causes fatigue, from heavy blood loss. Rarely, a transfusion is needed due to blood loss.\n\n【27】### Pregnancy and fibroids\n\n【28】Fibroids usually don't interfere with getting pregnant. However, it's possible that fibroids — especially submucosal fibroids — could cause infertility or pregnancy loss.\n\n【29】Fibroids may also raise the risk of certain pregnancy complications, such as placental abruption, fetal growth restriction and preterm delivery.\n\n【30】Prevention\n----------\n\n【31】Although researchers continue to study the causes of fibroid tumors, little scientific evidence is available on how to prevent them. Preventing uterine fibroids may not be possible, but only a small percentage of these tumors require treatment.\n\n【32】But, by making healthy lifestyle choices, such as maintaining a healthy weight and eating fruits and vegetables, you may be able to decrease your fibroid risk.\n\n【33】Also, some research suggests that using hormonal contraceptives may be associated with a lower risk of fibroids.\n\n【34】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Lazanda\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Fentanyl nasal spray is used to treat breakthrough cancer pain. Breakthrough episodes of cancer pain are the flares of pain which “breaks through” the medication used to control the persistent pain. Fentanyl belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics, which are medicines used to relieve pain. Nasal fentanyl is only used in patients who are already taking narcotic analgesics and who are tolerant to opioid medicines for cancer pain.\n\n【6】Fentanyl acts in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. Some of its side effects are also caused by actions in the CNS. When a narcotic is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence). However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by reducing the dose gradually over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely. Your doctor will take this into consideration when deciding on the amount of nasal fentanyl you should receive.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called TIRF REMS Program.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Spray\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of nasal fentanyl in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of nasal fentanyl in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of narcotic analgesics than younger adults and are more likely to have age-related kidney disease, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving nasal fentanyl.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【23】*   Mifepristone\n*   Nalmefene\n*   Naltrexone\n*   Safinamide\n*   Samidorphan\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【28】Using this medicine with any of the following is usually not recommended, but may be unavoidable in some cases. If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use this medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】*   Ethanol\n*   Grapefruit Juice\n\n【30】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【31】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【32】*   Adrenal problems or\n*   Alcohol abuse, or history of or\n*   Brain tumor, history of or\n*   Breathing problems (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \\[COPD\\], cor pulmonale, hypoxia) or\n*   Drug dependence, especially with narcotics, history of or\n*   Head injuries, history of or\n*   Increased pressure in the head or\n*   Seizures, history of—Use with caution. May increase risk for more serious side effects.\n\n【33】*   Bradyarrhythmia (slow heart rhythm) or\n*   Gallbladder disease or\n*   Hypotension (low blood pressure) or\n*   Pancreatitis (inflammation or swelling of the pancreas), acute—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【34】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【35】*   Lung or breathing problems, severe (eg, bronchial asthma, respiratory depression) or\n*   Stomach or bowel blockage (including paralytic ileus), known or suspected—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【36】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【37】Fentanyl nasal sprays are for use in opioid-tolerant patients only. If you are not sure whether or not you are opioid-tolerant, check with your doctor before using this medicine.\n\n【38】This medicine should come with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【39】This medicine is for use only in the nose. Do not get any of it in your eyes or on your skin. If it does get on these areas, rinse it off with water right away.\n\n【40】Fentanyl nasal spray works differently than other fentanyl products, even at the same dose (number of milligrams). Do not substitute or convert it to other products containing fentanyl.\n\n【41】To use the nasal spray:\n\n【42】*   Keep the spray in the child-resistant container until ready to use.\n*   If you are using the nasal spray for the first time, you will need to prime the spray. To do this, you should release four sprays into the pouch. Now it is ready to use.\n*   If you have not used the medicine for more than 5 days, re-prime by spraying once into the pouch.\n*   Before using this medicine, gently blow your nose to clear the nostrils.\n*   Insert the tip of the Lazanda® bottle into the nose. Point towards the bridge of the nose and tilt the bottle slightly.\n*   Press down firmly on the finger grips until you hear a \"click\" sound and the number in the dose counter window adds up. This confirms a spray has been taken.\n*   Return the spray bottle to the child-resistant container after each use.\n\n【43】### Dosing\n\n【44】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【45】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【46】*   For nasal dosage form (spray):\n    *   For cancer pain:\n        *   Adults—At first, 100 micrograms (mcg) or 1 spray in one nostril during an episode of breakthrough cancer pain. Your doctor may increase your dose as needed and tolerated, up to a maximum of 800 mcg or 1 spray containing 400 mcg of fentanyl in each nostril. However, patients should not use more than 4 doses per 24 hours. Wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain. If pain relief is not achieved within 30 minutes, a rescue medicine may be used as directed by your doctor. Patients should record their use over several episodes of breakthrough cancer pain and review their experience with their doctor to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【47】### Storage\n\n【48】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【49】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【50】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【51】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【52】Ask your pharmacist about the best way to dispose of medicine that you do not use. Throw away any spray bottle and start using a new one if you have used 8 sprays or if it has been 60 days or more since it has been used. Dispose any used, partially used, or unneeded spray bottles by emptying and spraying the remaining solution into the pouch. The sealed pouch and the empty bottle should be placed in a child-resistant container before discarding it in the trash can. Wash your hands with soap and water right away after handling the pouch.\n\n【53】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【54】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits. This will allow your doctor to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check you for any problems or unwanted effects that may be caused by this medicine.\n\n【55】Do not use Lazanda® if you need pain medicine for just a short time, such as during a headache or migraine attack, tooth pain, or when recovering from surgery or an injury.\n\n【56】After you have been using this medicine for awhile, \"breakthrough\" pain may occur more often than usual, and it may not be relieved by your regular dose of medicine. If this occurs, do not increase the amount of nasal fentanyl or other narcotic that you are using without first checking with your doctor.\n\n【57】Using too much nasal fentanyl, or taking too much of another narcotic while using nasal fentanyl, may cause an overdose. If this occurs, get emergency help right away. An overdose can cause severe breathing problems (breathing may even stop), unconsciousness, and death. Serious signs of an overdose include very slow breathing (fewer than 8 breaths a minute) and drowsiness that is so severe that you are not able to answer when spoken to or, if asleep, cannot be awakened. Other signs of an overdose may include cold, clammy skin, low blood pressure, pinpoint pupils of the eyes, and slow heartbeat. It may be best to have a family member or a friend check on you several times a day when you start using a narcotic regularly, and whenever your dose is increased, so that he or she can get help for you if you cannot do so yourself.\n\n【58】Lazanda® contains an amount of fentanyl which can be fatal to a child. Patients and their caregivers should keep this medicine out of the reach of children, and discard used and unused bottle sprays in its child-resistant container properly.\n\n【59】This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. This effect may last for a few days after you stop using this medicine. CNS depressants are medicines that slow down the nervous system, which may cause drowsiness or make you less alert. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, benzodiazepines, sleeping medicines, other prescription pain medicine or narcotics, barbiturates or seizure medicine, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of the other medicines listed above while you are using this medicine.\n\n【60】Fentanyl may cause some people to become drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded, or to feel a false sense of well-being. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or not alert and clearheaded. These effects usually go away after a few days of treatment, when your body gets used to the medicine. However, check with your doctor if drowsiness that is severe enough to interfere with your activities continues for more than a few days.\n\n【61】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.\n\n【62】This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.\n\n【63】Using narcotics for a long time may cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may tell you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.\n\n【64】Do not use this medicine if you have taken a monoamine oxidase (MAOI) inhibitor in the previous 2 weeks. Some examples of MAO inhibitors are isocarboxazid (Marplan®), phenelzine (Nardil®), selegiline (Eldepryl®), or tranylcypromine (Parnate®). If you use the 2 medicines close together it may cause serious side effects like confusion, agitation, restlessness, stomach or intestinal symptoms, a sudden high temperature, an extremely high blood pressure, or severe convulsions.\n\n【65】Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using this medicine.\n\n【66】Using too much of this medicine may cause reduced infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children.\n\n【67】Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using this medicine. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may change the amount of this medicine that is absorbed in the body.\n\n【68】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【69】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【70】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【71】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【72】#### More common\n\n【73】1.

Specifically, Bijlsma and associates evaluated our risk score in a cohort of 218 patients who had bacterial meningitis and a negative Gram stain. They discovered that our model had a high sensitivity (98.5%) but a very low specificity (9.2%) for identifying patients with meningitis and a negative Gram stain at risk for an adverse clinical outcome.\n\n【1】We derived and validated our prognostic model in a very large and heterogeneous patient population from the Houston, Texas, area that included meningitis caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria and in which only 22 of 567 patients (3.7%) had culture-proven bacterial meningitis. In contrast, the analysis by Bijlsma and colleagues included only bacterial meningitis cases, which are associated with higher adverse clinical outcomes. In the United States, the use of conjugate vaccines has reduced the incidence of bacterial meningitis from 5.5 cases per 100,000 persons in 1986 to 1.38 per 100,000 persons in 2007.\n\n【2】无关删除-2*   McIntyre P.B.\n*   O’Brien K.L.\n*   Greenwood B.\n*   van de Beek D.\n\n【3】Effect of vaccines on bacterial meningitis worldwide.\n\n【4】无关删除-2_Lancet._ 2012; 380 : 1703-1711\n\n【5】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (231)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【6】Thus, although the fraction of bacterial meningitis cases we reported differs considerably from that of Bijlsma and associates, our data accurately reflect the current epidemiology of community-acquired meningitis with a negative Gram stain in US hospitals.\n\n【7】无关删除-2*   Khoury N.T.\n*   Hossain M.M.\n*   Wootton S.H.\n*   Salazar L.\n*   Hasbun R.\n\n【8】Meningitis with a negative cerebrospinal fluid gram stain in adults: risk classification for an adverse clinical outcome.\n\n【9】无关删除-2_Mayo Clinic Proc._ 2012; 87 : 1181-1188\n\n【10】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (27)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【11】It is reassuring to see that 203 of 218 patients (93%) with bacterial meningitis and a negative Gram stain in the Dutch Meningitis Cohort Study were identified by our high-risk score and that their adverse clinical outcome rate was 30%. The low-risk score in that study was seen in only 15 of the 218 patients (7%), and only 1 of the 15 (7% of the patients with a low-risk score; 0.5% of the 218 patients with bacterial meningitis with a negative Gram stain) had an adverse clinical outcome. The single low-risk patient who had an adverse outcome had nosocomial meningitis and would have been excluded from our community-acquired meningitis study; hence, applying our calculations to this adverse clinical outcome in the analysis by Bijlsma and colleagues yielded a 0% adverse outcome rate.

{"seq_id": "d7ee6680-92c9-4147-90eb-6a986bee3e3c", "title": "Brain tumor", "text": "【0】Brain tumor\nMedulloblastoma\n---------------\n\n【1】Medulloblastoma (muh-dul-o-blas-TOE-muh) is a cancerous brain tumor that starts in the lower back part of the brain. This part of the brain is called the cerebellum. It is involved in muscle coordination, balance and movement.\n\n【2】Medulloblastoma begins as a growth of cells, which is called a tumor. The cells grow quickly and can spread to other parts of the brain. Medulloblastoma cells tend to spread through the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain and spinal cord. This is called cerebrospinal fluid. Medulloblastomas don't usually spread to other parts of the body.\n\n【3】Medulloblastoma can happen at any age, but most often occurs in young children. Though medulloblastoma is rare, it's the most common cancerous brain tumor in children. Medulloblastoma happens more often in families that have a history of conditions that increase the risk of cancer. These syndromes include Gorlin syndrome or Turcot syndrome.\n\n【4】Medulloblastoma symptoms happen when the tumor grows or causes pressure to build up in the brain. They can begin before the cancer is diagnosed and may continue for months or years even after treatment. Signs and symptoms of medulloblastoma may include:\n\n【5】*   Dizziness.\n*   Double vision.\n*   Headaches.\n*   Nausea.\n*   Poor coordination.\n*   Tiredness.\n*   Unsteady walk.\n*   Vomiting.\n\n【6】### Diagnosis\n\n【7】The process of diagnosis usually starts with a medical history review and a discussion of signs and symptoms. Tests and procedures used to diagnose medulloblastoma include:\n\n【8】*   **Neurological exam.** During this exam, vision, hearing, balance, coordination and reflexes are tested. This can help show which part of the brain might be affected by the tumor.\n*   **Imaging tests.** Imaging tests capture pictures of the brain. The pictures can show the size and location of the tumor. These tests may show pressure or blockages of the cerebrospinal fluid. CTs and MRIs are used for the imaging, but other tests might be needed in certain situations.\n*   **Tissue sample testing.** A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of the tumor for testing. Biopsies for medulloblastoma are uncommon but might be used in certain situations. In a biopsy, part of the skull is removed. A needle is used to take a sample of the tumor. The sample is tested in a lab to see if it's a medulloblastoma.\n*   **Removal of cerebrospinal fluid for testing.** A spinal tap, also called a lumbar puncture, involves inserting a needle between two bones in the lower spine. The needle draws out cerebrospinal fluid from around the spinal cord. The fluid is tested in a lab to look for tumor cells. This test is only done after managing the pressure in the brain or removing the tumor.\n\n【9】### Treatment\n\n【10】Treatment for medulloblastoma usually includes surgery followed by radiation or chemotherapy, or both. Your health care team considers many factors when creating a treatment plan. These might include the tumor's location, how fast it's growing, whether it has spread to other parts of the brain and the results of tests on the tumor cells. Your care team also considers your age and your overall health.\n\n【11】Treatment options include:\n\n【12】*   **Surgery to relieve fluid buildup in the brain.** A medulloblastoma may grow to block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. This can cause a buildup of fluid that puts pressure on the brain. To reduce the pressure, a surgeon can create a pathway for the fluid to flow out of the brain. Sometimes this procedure can be combined with surgery to remove the tumor.\n*   **Surgery to remove the medulloblastoma.** The goal of surgery is to remove all of the medulloblastoma. But sometimes it's not possible to fully remove the tumor because it forms near important structures deep within the brain. Most people with medulloblastoma need more treatments after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.\n*   **Radiation therapy.** Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams to kill cancer cells. The energy can come from X-rays, protons and other sources. During radiation therapy, a machine directs beams of energy to specific points on the body. Radiation therapy is often used after surgery.\n*   **Chemotherapy.** Chemotherapy uses medicines to kill cancer cells. Typically, children and adults with medulloblastoma receive these medicines as an injection into veins. Chemotherapy may be used after surgery or radiation therapy. Sometimes it's done at the same time as radiation therapy.\n*   **Clinical trials.** Clinical trials enroll eligible participants to study new treatments or to study new ways of using existing treatments, such as different combinations or timing of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. These studies provide a chance to try the latest treatment options, though the risk of side effects may not be known. Talk with your health care provider for advice.\n\n【13】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

His father was a leather merchant who moved to The Hague when young Hendrik was a small boy. As an adolescent, Hendrik was apprenticed to a goldsmith but at age 17 left his home and family to join a communal religious sect, the Labadists. Initially, the sect was located near Hamburg, but later moved on to the small village of Wieuwerd, in the rural province of Friesland. The Labadists were followers of the teachings of Jean de Labadie (1610-1674), a controversial Dutch Reformed minister and former Catholic priest who insisted on a pure, self-sufficient church.\n\n【2】Under the guidance of a Labadist healer about whom little is known, “Walter from Copenhagen,” Hendrik became interested in medicine and surgery, effectively becoming a medical apprentice. From the 1670s he was the primary doctor to the Labadist community, delivering babies and caring for community members with a wide variety of ailments. Although van Deventer did not know any Latin—a prerequisite for University training at the time—he was eventually allowed to enroll in the University of Groningen, which (unusually) permitted his doctoral examination to be conducted in Dutch, and he received a degree in 1694 with special commendation.\n\n【3】van Deventer had an early interest in orthopedics and became known for his skill in treating children with rickets, a common problem in the cloudy vitamin D–poor regions along the North Sea, especially among the ascetic Labadists who ate a very meager diet. During a visit to Copenhagen in 1688 to examine some orthopedic instruments, he was sought out by Danish King Christian V to attend to the king's children, two of whom had limb deformities. Reportedly, the king was pleased with the results.\n\n【4】In the late 1690s, van Deventer broke away from the Labadists (perhaps in part because his family resented his increasingly high consulting fees going into a communal pool) and developed an interest in obstetrics. He moved from rural Friesland to The Hague, intending to set up an urban obstetrical practice. However, the physicians in The Hague, who were organized into a _Collegium Medicum_ , resisted the newcomer's presence, and would not allow him a permit to practice in the city. Although the cited reason for denying him a practice opportunity was van Deventer's poor Latin skills, The Hague physicians' real concern was likely competition for patients. One of the physicians from the _Collegium Medicum_ in The Hague criticized van Deventer's training, claiming that the University of Groningen would “give a degree to a donkey.”\n\n【5】Instead, van Deventer moved to the nearby town of Voorburg just outside The Hague, where he developed a busy and respected practice. In 1701, he published an influential obstetrical manual, _The New Light for Obstetricians and Midwives_ , in which he described various helpful maneuvers for delivery and insisted on good hygiene during labor, anticipating the work of Ignaz Semmelweis on handwashing and puerperal sepsis 150 years later. This text also discussed extensively variations in the anatomy of the bony pelvis, which may have been a focus of interest because of van Deventer's previous orthopedic work; van Deventer was among the first to discuss the mechanical obstetrical challenges of a narrow pelvis and a pelvis damaged by rickets. He also advocated improved training for midwives.\n\n【6】van Deventer had plenty of personal experience with obstetrics: his wife had 10 children. She died in 1719, and van Deventer died in Voorburg in 1724. The front piece of his obstetrical text included the inscription, “Manet Post Funera Verum” (I will die, but the truth will remain.). He was honored philatelically by the Netherlands in 1947 (Scott #B175), a semi-postal issue that supported various social causes.\n\n【7】Article info\n------------\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2016.10.017\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2016 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research\n\n【12】### ScienceDirect\n\n【13】Access this article on ScienceDirect\n\n【14】Hendrik van Deventer: Dutch Obstetrician and Orthopedist\n\n【15】*   \n\n【16】Hide Caption Download See figure in article\n\n【17】Toggle Thumbstrip\n\n【18】*   Figure\n\n【19】无关删除-2*   View Large Image\n*   Download .PPT\n\n【20】Figures\n-------\n\n【21】*   \n\n【22】Related Articles\n----------------\n\n【23】Hide Caption Download See figure in Article\n\n【24】Toggle Thumbstrip\n\n【25】无关删除-2*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download .PPT", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

All patients underwent transplants between March 19, 1998, and May 7, 2004. Information was collected on patient characteristics, comorbid conditions, laboratory results, donor and operative variables, medical and surgical complications, and mortality and graft loss.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Preoperative characteristics were similar across age groups, except for creatinine ( _P_ \\=.01) and serum albumin ( _P_ \\=.03) values, which were higher in older patients, and an earlier year of transplant in younger patients ( _P_ <.001). Intraoperatively, older patients required more erythrocyte transfusions ( _P_ \\=.04) and more intraoperative fluids ( _P_ \\=.001) than did younger patients. Postoperatively, bilirubin level ( _P_ \\=.007) and international normalized ratios ( _P_ \\=.01) were lower in older patients, whereas albumin level was higher ( _P_ <.001). The median follow-up was 5.1 years (range, 0.1-8.5 years). Compared with younger patients, older patients were not at an increased risk of death (relative risk, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-2.31; _P_ \\>.99) or graft loss (relative risk, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-2.52; _P_ \\=.70). The frequency of other complications did not differ significantly between age groups, although older patients had more cardiovascular complications.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Five-year mortality and graft loss in older recipients were comparable with those in younger recipients, suggesting that age alone should not exclude older patients from liver transplant.\n\n【8】CI ( confidence interval ), LT ( liver transplant ), MELD ( model for end-stage liver disease ), RR ( relative risk )\n\n【9】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【13】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【15】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Of paramount concern are questions about the effect of the disease on a woman's ability to conceive and carry the pregnancy safely to term, as well as the effect of the disease and its therapies on the health of the fetus. For health care providers, there is also the issue of medication dose adjustments and management of flares during pregnancy. Growing experience with IBD in pregnancy suggests that most women will have good outcomes; however, concerns and uncertainty remain for both the patient and the physician. This article outlines our approach to the treatment of these patients with respect to preconception counseling and management during pregnancy and the postpartum period.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AZA/6-MP ( azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine ), IBD ( inflammatory bowel disease ), PIANO ( Pregnancy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Neonatal Outcomes ), UC ( ulcerative colitis )\n\n【4】Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can affect women during their childbearing years. This presents several unique treatment considerations in women with IBD who are contemplating pregnancy, attempting to conceive, or are pregnant. Most women will have a successful pregnancy, but close management of IBD during this time is crucial to a good outcome. This article will review the many issues that providers face in each stage of managing the pregnant patient with IBD.\n\n【5】Preparing for Pregnancy\n-----------------------\n\n【6】Providers should ensure that a patient's vaccinations (hepatitis A and B, pneumonia, influenza, and tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis), colon cancer surveillance, and cervical dysplasia screening are up to date.\n\n【7】无关删除-2*   Moscandrew M.\n*   Mahadevan U.\n*   Kane S.\n\n【8】General health maintenance in IBD.\n\n【9】无关删除-2_Inflamm Bowel Dis._ 2009; 15 : 1399-1409\n\n【10】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (69)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【11】Routine laboratory tests should include a complete blood cell count and vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> , folic acid, and iron levels.

Also, their disease activity should be stable with maintenance therapy before conception. Medications that are absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy (eg, methotrexate and thalidomide) should be discontinued a minimum of 3 months, ideally 6 months, before conception, and alternative medical regimens should be started.

In general, the act of stopping medications and precipitating a possible disease flare poses a greater risk to the fetus than any potential adverse effects of most medications themselves. Therefore, we advise patients to have a thoughtful discussion with their gastroenterologist before making any changes to their treatment regimen. It has been our experience that patients who have a medication plan before conception are much more adherent to recommended therapies than patients who attempt to create a treatment plan after conception. We generally address the issue of conception during routine office visits so that the patient knows to contact us before conception and is comfortable with their therapy. We also emphasize that they should check with their gastroenterologist before discontinuing any IBD medications, even if this was a recommendation made by their obstetrician or pediatrician.\n\n【146】### Methotrexate and Thalidomide\n\n【147】The 2 exceptions to IBD medications being safely continued in pregnancy are methotrexate and thalidomide, which are both Food and Drug Administration category X agents and are absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy. We do not routinely manage patients taking thalidomide, but for the many patients taking methotrexate as monotherapy or as combination therapy with biological agents, we advise discontinuing the drug at least 6 months before attempting conception.

Osalazine, Asacol, and Asacol HD (Actavis) are category C agents.

Mesalamine suppositories and enemas are well tolerated and can be used during pregnancy. There is no evidence to suggest that the use of medicinal enemas during pregnancy is associated with an increased rate of miscarriage or preterm labor.\n\n【158】### Corticosteroids\n\n【159】Prednisone and budesonide are category C agents but can be used in the setting of disease flares.

In our practice, if AZA/6-MP is monotherapy, we will continue it throughout pregnancy. If the patient is taking a thiopurine as part of combination therapy with an anti–tumor necrosis factor agent, we will consider stopping it in the patient with long-standing remission. It should be recognized that stopping AZA/6-MP during pregnancy may not change outcomes given that fetal exposure during organogenesis has already occurred by the time the patient realizes she is pregnant, so the risk of flaring should be weighed against the unclear benefit of stopping thiopurines. We do not administer AZA/6-MP for the first time during pregnancy given the (very small) risk of pancreatitis or bone marrow suppression. Azathioprine/6-MP is excreted at low levels in breast milk, with maximal excretion during the first 4 hours of drug ingestion.\n\n【186】无关删除-2*   Christensen L.A.\n*   Dahlerup J.F.\n*   Nielsen M.J.\n*   Fallingborg J.F.\n*   Schmiegelow K.\n\n【187】Azathioprine treatment during lactation.\n\n【188】无关删除-2_Aliment Pharmacol Ther._ 2008; 28 : 1209-1213\n\n【189】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (146)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【190】Azathioprine/6-MP is believed to be compatible with lactation, but mothers are advised to wait 4 hours after taking the medication before breastfeeding. This is not always possible with a newborn, in which case we still give patients the option of breastfeeding because transfer is minimal.\n\n【191】### Biological Agents\n\n【192】In general, these agents are compatible with pregnancy and breastfeeding. Infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab are all Food and Drug Administration pregnancy category B. Natalizumab is pregnancy category C. Experience with this group of drugs is increasing. To date, there has not been a consistent pattern of adverse pregnancy outcomes or birth defects observed in exposed individuals. Infliximab and adalimumab are IgG1 antibodies that are actively transported across the placenta by the FcRn receptor on the placenta and are detectable in newborns for up to 6 months after birth. Certolizumab is a pegylated Fab' fragment that is not actively transported across the placenta during pregnancy, resulting in minimal drug levels detected in infant and cord blood. Natalizumab is an integrin receptor antagonist and IgG4 antibody that would be expected to actively cross the placenta as well. Available data, mostly in patients with multiple sclerosis, do not suggest an increase in birth defects.\n\n【193】无关删除-2*   Cristiano L.\n*   Friend S.\n*   Bozic C.\n*   Bloomren G.\n\n【194】Evaluation of pregnancy outcomes from the Tysabri (natalizumab) Pregnancy Exposure Registry.\n\n【195】_Neurology._ 2013; 80 (meeting abstracts 1):P02.127\n\n【196】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【197】The PIANO registry has now enrolled more than 1200 pregnant patients with IBD, of whom more than 500 have been exposed to a biological agent.\n\n【198】无关删除-2*   Mahadevan U.\n*   Martin C.\n*   Sandler R.S.\n*   et al.\n\n【199】PIANO: a 1000 patient prospective registry of pregnancy outcomes in women with IBD exposed to immunomodulators and biologic therapy \\[abstract\\].\n\n【200】_Gastroenterology._ 2012; 142 ( S-149 )\n\n【201】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【202】The risk of birth defects does not seem to be increased based on exposure to medication (biological agents, AZA/6-MP, or combination therapy) compared with those not exposed to these medications.\n\n【203】There is significant debate over when to stop anti–tumor necrosis factor agents during pregnancy. The theoretical risks of drug transfer to the infant must be weighed against the risk to the mother and infant if a flare occurs during pregnancy. Because certolizumab has minimal placental transfer, it can be continued throughout pregnancy with no adjustment made to medication timing or infant immunization schedules. There is evidence of placental transfer of infliximab as early as 26 weeks' gestation, with detectable drug levels in cord blood at term birth.\n\n【204】无关删除-2*   Zelinkova Z.\n*   de Haar C.\n*   de Ridder L.\n*   et al.\n\n【205】High intra-uterine exposure to infliximab following maternal anti-TNF treatment during pregnancy.\n\n【206】无关删除-2_Aliment Pharmacol Ther._ 2011; 33 : 1053-1058\n\n【207】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (157)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【208】We also know that the FcRn is functioning as early as week 13 of gestation, so transfer may occur even earlier. In our practice, we try to manipulate the timing of infliximab doses so that the patient receives her last predelivery infusion during week 30 to 32 of gestation, followed by an infusion immediately after delivery. This method generally works well because there is little interruption to therapy. Adalimumab, on the other hand, has a 2-week dosing schedule, so a patient is at greater risk for disease flare when a scheduled injection is delayed. Therefore, we will continue treatment through week 36 to 38 of gestation. For natalizumab, these patients often have limited therapeutic options, and antibody development would be devastating; therefore, we generally continue therapy until week 37 to 38 of gestation and avoid infusion delays. For infliximab, adalimumab, and natalizumab, we send letters to the pediatrician and advise the mother that there should be no live vaccines for the first 6 months of life (all other attenuated vaccines should be given on schedule) and that the infant should be monitored for infection. At 1 year, in a preliminary analysis of the PIANO registry, we have not observed an increase in the rate of infections in those exposed to biological agents, and there seems to be no impairment in achieving developmental milestones.\n\n【209】无关删除-2*   Mahadevan U.\n*   Martin C.\n*   Sandler R.S.\n*   et al.\n\n【210】PIANO: a 1000 patient prospective registry of pregnancy outcomes in women with IBD exposed to immunomodulators and biologic therapy \\[abstract\\].\n\n【211】_Gastroenterology._ 2012; 142 ( S-149 )\n\n【212】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【213】Infliximab and adalimumab have been detected in breast milk in miniscule amounts.\n\n【214】无关删除-2*   Ben-Horin S.\n*   Yavzori M.\n*   Kopylov U.\n*   et al.\n\n【215】Detection of infliximab in breast milk of nursing mothers with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【216】无关删除-2_J Crohns Colitis._ 2011; 5 : 555-558\n\n【217】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (103)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【218】无关删除-2*   Ben-Horin S.\n*   Yavzori M.\n*   Katz L.\n*   et al.\n\n【219】Adalimumab level in breast milk of a nursing mother.\n\n【220】无关删除-2_Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol._ 2010; 8 : 475-476\n\n【221】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (96)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【222】Breastfeeding is considered compatible with the use of biological agents.\n\n【223】Recommendations\n---------------\n\n【224】There are several key points that providers should keep in mind when treating IBD in women who are interested in conceiving or are pregnant ( Table ). Women with IBD who have not had pelvic surgery have similar chances of conceiving as women without IBD. Once pregnant, women with IBD are at increased risk for adverse outcomes and should be observed as high-risk obstetric patients, even in remission. Ideally, women should strive to achieve quiescent or stable disease before conception and to maintain it during pregnancy to reduce the risk of miscarriage and preterm birth. Preconception counseling, a medical therapy plan that the patient is comfortable following, and good communication with the treatment team should be established before pregnancy. Most IBD medications may be safely continued during pregnancy and lactation. Biological agent therapy may need to be adjusted in the third trimester but is generally well tolerated without significant adverse fetal outcomes. An interdisciplinary approach among the gastroenterologist, obstetrician, and, eventually, pediatrician is needed to ensure a healthy baby and a healthy mother.\n\n【225】Table Key Points of IBD Management of the Pregnant Patient\n\n| Period | Key points |\n| --- | --- |\n| Preconception counseling | Care should be established with a primary care provider, an obstetrician, and a gastroenterologistMedication that may be harmful to the fetus (eg, methotrexate) should be discontinued in favor of an alternative agentThe patient should have a medication plan that she is comfortable with before conception and should understand the risks of NOT treating and the risks of the medicationDisease activity should be stabilized and the patient should be receiving established maintenance therapy if appropriateVaccinations and other health care maintenance should be up to dateLaboratory values, such as complete blood cell count, B 12 , folic acid, iron, and vitamin D, should be checked and addressed if abnormal |\n| Conception | Rates of conception are similar in women with and without IBD (except in the setting of previous pelvic surgery)Increased disease activity may affect fertility and miscarriage rates; stable disease should be maintainedPatients should be referred to a reproductive endocrinologist if concerted attempts to conceive are unsuccessful after 6 mo |\n| Pregnancy | Increased disease activity may affect pregnancy outcome; stable disease should be maintainedAppropriate maintenance therapy should be continued throughout pregnancyThe schedule of biological agent dosing may be adjusted to minimize placental transfer to the fetus during the third trimesterWomen with IBD should be followed as high-risk obstetric patients given the increased risk of complications during labor and delivery |\n| Delivery | Generally, vaginal delivery is appropriate in women with IBD except those with active perianal diseaseMode of delivery should remain an individualized decision between the patient and her obstetrician |\n| Postpartum | Most medications can be safely continued while breastfeedingLive vaccines should not be given in the first 6 mo to infants exposed to anti–tumor necrosis factor agents during pregnancy (except certolizumab)All other vaccines can be given on scheduleThe pediatrician should be aware of anti–tumor necrosis factor or other biological agent exposure during pregnancy so that fevers and infections in the newborn can be appropriately managed |\n\n【227】IBD = inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【228】*   Open table in a new tab", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

This seemingly illogical claim acknowledges that a person is not just a biological organism, but also has a mind, spiritual life, and community.

For relationship-building, the PEARLS (partnership, empathy, apology, respect, legitimization, and support) are useful: partnership articulates the nature of the patient-clinician relationship; empathy notes insight regarding the patient’s situation; apology acknowledges missteps that occur during the illness journey (eg, clinicians late for appointments, apparent insentivity, etc); respect appreciates the patient’s experiences and efforts; legitimization recognizes that many patients experience frustration and numerous other challenges; and support specifies that the clinician will not abandon the patient.\n\n【23】无关删除-2*   Barrier P.A.\n*   Li J.T.C.\n*   Jensen N.M.\n\n【24】Two words to improve physician-patient communication: what else?.\n\n【25】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2003; 78 : 211-214\n\n【26】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (118)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【27】Most clinicians know colleagues who are expert at guiding patients and loved ones through the dying process. William Osler is an historical exemplar. During the 1918 influenza epidemic, Osler made house calls to many patients including Janet. Janet’s mother described Osler’s last visit:\n\n【28】The most exquisite moment came one cold, raw, November morning when the end was near, and he mysteriously brought out from his inside pocket a beautiful red rose…and told how he had watched this last rose of summer growing in his garden and how the rose had called out to him as he passed by, that she wished to go along with him to see his little lassie. That evening we all had a fairy tea-party, at a tiny table by the bed, Sir William talking to the rose, his “little lassie”, and her mother in a most exquisite way; and presently he slipped out of the room just as mysteriously as he entered it…and the little girl understood that neither fairies nor people could always have the colour of a red rose in their cheeks, or stay as long as they wanted in one place, but that they nevertheless would be very happy in another home and must not let the people they left behind, particularly their parents, feel badly about it; and the little girl understood and was not unhappy.\n\n【29】*   Cushing H.\n\n【30】The Life of Sir William Osler: 2 Volumes.\n\n【31】Clarendon Press , Oxford, UK 1925\n\n【32】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【33】For Janet and her mother, Osler exquisitely facilitated the evolution from focused to intrinsic hope. Healing occurred even though Janet’s mother knew her daughter was dying.\n\n【34】Another example includes Osler’s care of a boy who nearly died of whooping cough. He visited the boy often, clearly communicated the prognosis to the boy’s father, and yet cheerfully provided pieces of sugar sprinkled fruit, which the boy enjoyed.

As trust builds, the door to intrinsic hope and healing may open. They describe Laura and her child’s physician who facilitated opening this door: he answered questions honestly, listened more than talked, didn’t rush, sought and respected opinions, wasn’t defensive, wanted the best, was available each step of the way, etc. In contrast, clinicians should avoid behaviors that obliterate hope (eg, saying, “nothing more can be done”).\n\n【40】Osler was aware a clinician’s behaviors and mindset can affect patients.

Addressing despair—not avoiding it—is part of healing. Clinicians should harness resources to mitigate contributing factors including exhaustion, neglected family duties, and financial stress (eg, social work, spiritual care, bereavement counseling, support groups, palliative care, etc) and work with patients and loved ones to establish goals of care including plans for the last days.\n\n【62】Stuart et al conclude that the outcome of healing when cure is not possible is freedom—perhaps found in making a conscious choice of letting go, being unencumbered by medical illness, meaning making, and so on. Osler’s own death illustrates this freedom. During late 1919, he developed bronchopneumonia and did not doubt the outcome (eg, “…I’m sorry I shall not see the post-mortem.”\n\n【63】*   Cushing H.\n\n【64】The Life of Sir William Osler: 2 Volumes.\n\n【65】Clarendon Press , Oxford, UK 1925\n\n【66】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【67】 ).

Persons in close contact with a patient with active pulmonary TB and those from endemic regions of the world are at highest risk of primary infection, whereas patients with compromised immune systems are at highest risk of reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI). Tuberculosis can affect any organ system. Clinical manifestations vary accordingly but often include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Positive results on either a tuberculin skin test or an interferon-γ release assay in the absence of active TB establish a diagnosis of LTBI. A combination of epidemiological, clinical, radiographic, microbiological, and histopathologic features is used to establish the diagnosis of active TB. Patients with suspected active pulmonary TB should submit 3 sputum specimens for acid-fast bacilli smears and culture, with nucleic acid amplification testing performed on at least 1 specimen. For patients with LTBI, treatment with isoniazid for 9 months is preferred. Patients with active TB should be treated with multiple agents to achieve bacterial clearance, to reduce the risk of transmission, and to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Directly observed therapy is recommended for the treatment of active TB. Health care professionals should collaborate, when possible, with local and state public health departments to care for patients with TB. Patients with drug-resistant TB or coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus should be treated in collaboration with TB specialists. Public health measures to prevent the spread of TB include appropriate respiratory isolation of patients with active pulmonary TB, contact investigation, and reduction of the LTBI burden.\n\n【1】AFB ( acid-fast bacilli ), BCG ( bacille Calmette-Guérin ), CFP-10 ( culture filtrate protein 10 ), DOT ( directly observed therapy ), EMB ( ethambutol ), ESAT-6 ( early-secreted antigenic target 6 ), HIV ( human immuno deficiency virus ), IFN-γ ( interferon-γ ), IGRA ( IFN-γ release assay ), INH ( isoniazid ), LTBI ( latent TBI ), MDR-TB ( multidrug-resistant TB ), NAA ( nucleic acid amplification ), PZA ( pyrazinamide ), RIF ( rifampin ), TB ( tuberculosis ), TBI ( TB infection ), TST ( tuberculin skin test ), XDR-TB ( extensively drug-resistant TB )\n\n【2】Effective medical therapy for tuberculosis (TB) has existed for more than half a century, yet TB remains among the most pressing public health issues of our day.

This review highlights key principles in the management of TB. For purposes of definition, TB infection (TBI) occurs when a susceptible person inhales droplets containing _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ nuclei that travel through the respiratory tract to the alveoli. In most patients, an immune response limits propagation of TBI, resulting in an asymptomatic, noninfectious, localized infection that may remain in the body for many years. These patients have positive immunologic test results for _M tuberculosis_ and carry a diagnosis of latent TBI (LTBI). A constellation of clinical, radiographic, microbiological, and histopathologic hallmarks are used to diagnose active TB disease.\n\n【13】*   Jensen PA\n*   Lambert LA\n*   Iademarco MF\n*   Ridzon R\n\n【14】Guidelines for preventing the transmission of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in health-care settings, 2005.\n\n【15】无关删除-2_MMWR Recomm Rep._ 2005; 54 : 1-141\n\n【16】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【17】EPIDEMIOLOGY\n------------\n\n【18】An estimated one-third of the world's population is infected with TB.\n\n【19】*   Lonnroth K\n*   Raviglione M\n\n【20】Global epidemiology of tuberculosis: prospects for control.\n\n【21】无关删除-2_Semin Respir Crit Care Med._ 2008; 29 : 481-491\n\n【22】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (223)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【23】Tuberculosis accounted for 1.3 million deaths in 2007, and the prevalence of active disease is estimated at 13.7 million (206 per 100,000 persons).\n\n【24】*   World Health Organization\n\n【25】Global Tuberculosis Control: Epidemiology, Strategy, Financing: WHO Report 2009.

The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Victoria, Australia) is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay–based whole blood assay that measures and quantifies IFN-γ (IU/mL) released from blood collected in special tubes that are coated with _M tuberculosis_ –specificantigens, including ESAT-6, CFP-10, and TB7.7(p4). The T-SPOT. _TB_ test (Oxford Immunotec Limited, Abingdon, United Kingdom) is an enzyme-linked immunospot assay that uses peripheral blood mononuclear cells incubated with mixtures of peptides containing ESAT-6 and CFP-10 to measure the number of cells secreting IFN-γ (IFN-γ-spot–forming cells). Results of IGRA are reported both qualitatively (positive, negative, indeterminate, or border-line) and quantitatively (IU/mL or IFN-γ-spot–forming cells). Reversion of IGRA test results from positive to negative has been observed, particularly in those with negative results on the initial TST.\n\n【452】*   Menzies D\n*   Pai M\n*   Comstock G\n\n【453】Meta-analysis: new tests for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: areas of uncertainty and recommendations for research.\n\n【454】无关删除-2_Ann Intern Med._ 2007; 146 : 340-354\n\n【455】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (896)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【456】Conversion of IGRA (ie, a change in test results from negative to positive within 2 years) has not been associated with an increased risk of subsequent progression to TB disease.\n\n【457】*   Mazurek GH\n*   Jereb J\n*   Vernon A\n*   LoBue P\n*   Goldberg S\n*   Castro K\n\n【458】Updated guidelines for using Interferon Gamma Release Assays to detect _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ infection—United States, 2010.\n\n【459】无关删除-2_MMWR Recomm Rep._ 2010; 59 : 1-25\n\n【460】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【461】The IGRA can be used in the same setting as TST\n\n【462】*   Mazurek GH\n*   Jereb J\n*   Vernon A\n*   LoBue P\n*   Goldberg S\n*   Castro K\n\n【463】Updated guidelines for using Interferon Gamma Release Assays to detect _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ infection—United States, 2010.\n\n【464】无关删除-2_MMWR Recomm Rep._ 2010; 59 : 1-25\n\n【465】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【466】but has the advantage of being able to differentiate _M tuberculosis_ infection from previous BCG vaccination and most nontuberculous mycobacterial infections; it may also be able to discriminate true-negative responses from anergy.

An IGRA is the preferred method of testing for groups of people who have low rates of returning to have their TST test results read and for those who have received BCG vaccine.

Pulmonary TB as a result of endogenous reactivation of latent infection classically presents with infiltrates in the apical and posterior segments of the right upper lobe, the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe, and the superior segment of the lower lobe. Cavitation, fibrosis, and/or enlargement of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes may be present. In some cases, pulmonary TB may present as lobar or segmental infiltrates, lung mass, scattered fibronodular lesions (“miliary”), or pleural effusions.\n\n【487】### Smear Microscopy\n\n【488】Smear microscopy for the detection of AFB is the most rapid and inexpensive method for TB diagnosis. Two commonly used methods for AFB staining are the carbolfuchsin methods (eg, Ziehl-Neelsen and Kinyoun methods) and the fluorochrome procedure using auramine O or auramine-rhodamine dyes. The fluorochrome method with fluorescence microscopy is preferred because it is far more sensitive than the carbolfuchsin methods. The finding of AFB on respiratory specimens associated with the appropriate epidemiological, clinical, and radiographic findings is highly suggestive of TB.\n\n【489】### Nucleic Acid Amplification Test\n\n【490】The NAA test is useful for the rapid detection of _M tuberculosis_ in respiratory specimens. The Enhanced Amplified MTD (Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct) test (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA) detects _M tuberculosis_ ribosomal RNA directly from AFB smear–positive and AFB smear–negative respiratory specimens from patients with suspected TB. The Amplicor MTB (Mycobacterium Tuberculosis) test (Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, NJ) detects _M tuberculosis_ DNA in AFB smear–positive respiratory specimens.\n\n【491】Interpretation of NAA test results should be correlated with AFB smear results.\n\n【492】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n【493】Updated guidelines for the use of nucleic acid amplification tests in the diagnosis of tuberculosis.\n\n【494】无关删除-2_MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep._ 2009; 58 : 7-10\n\n【495】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【496】Positive findings on the NAA test and a positive sputum AFB smear are strongly indicative of TB.\n\n【497】*   Laraque F\n*   Griggs A\n*   Slopen M\n*   Munsiff SS\n\n【498】Performance of nucleic acid amplification tests for diagnosis of tuberculosis in a large urban setting.\n\n【499】无关删除-2_Clin Infect Dis._ 2009; 49 : 46-54\n\n【500】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (60)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【501】*   Campos M\n*   Quartin A\n*   Mendes E\n*   et al.\n\n【502】Feasibility of shortening respiratory isolation with a single sputum nucleic acid amplification test.\n\n【503】无关删除-2_Am J Respir Crit Care Med._ 2008; 178 : 300-305\n\n【504】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (36)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【505】*   Catanzaro A\n*   Perry S\n*   Clarridge JE\n*   et al.\n\n【506】The role of clinical suspicion in evaluating a new diagnostic test for active tuberculosis: results of a multicenter prospective trial.\n\n【507】无关删除-2_JAMA._ 2000; 283 : 639-645\n\n【508】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (131)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【509】When NAA and sputum microscopy test results are discordant, physicians should exercise their clinical judgment in deciding whether to start anti-TB treatment while culture results are awaited.\n\n【510】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n【511】Updated guidelines for the use of nucleic acid amplification tests in the diagnosis of tuberculosis.\n\n【512】无关删除-2_MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep._ 2009; 58 : 7-10\n\n【513】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【514】When the clinical suspicion for TB is high, a positive NAA test result in smear-negative cases can be valuable for the early detection of TB in approximately 50% to 80% of cases.\n\n【515】*   Moore DF\n*   Guzman JA\n*   Mikhail LT\n\n【516】Reduction in turnaround time for laboratory diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis by routine use of a nucleic acid amplification test.\n\n【517】无关删除-2_Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis._ 2005; 52 : 247-254\n\n【518】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (72)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【519】*   Guerra RL\n*   Hooper NM\n*   Baker JF\n*   et al.\n\n【520】Use of the amplified _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ direct test in a public health laboratory: test performance and impact on clinical care.\n\n【521】无关删除-2_Chest._ 2007; 132 : 946-951\n\n【522】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (49)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【523】Findings on the NAA test often remain positive after cultures become negative during therapy and can remain positive even after completion of therapy\n\n【524】*   Schluger NW\n*   Rom WN\n\n【525】Current approaches to the diagnosis of active pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\n【526】无关删除-2_Am J Respir Crit Care Med._ 1994; 149 : 264-267\n\n【527】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (67)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【528】; therefore, it should not be used for assessing infectivity or response to treatment.\n\n【529】### Culture\n\n【530】Culture remains the criterion standard for laboratory confirmation of TB. Three types of culture media are available for the microbiological detection of _M tuberculosis_ : egg-based (Löwenstein-Jensen), agar-based (Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11), and liquid (Middlebrook 7H12 and other commercial broth systems). Mycobacterial growth tends to be slightly better on the egg-based medium but more rapid on the agar medium. Growth in liquid media is faster than growth on solid media and allows detection in 1 to 3 weeks.\n\n【531】*   Cruciani M\n*   Scarparo C\n*   Malena M\n*   Bosco O\n*   Serpelloni G\n*   Mengoli C\n\n【532】Meta-analysis of BACTEC MGIT 960 and BACTEC 460 TB, with or without solid media, for detection of mycobacteria.\n\n【533】无关删除-2_J Clin Microbiol._ 2004; 42 : 2321-2325\n\n【534】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (207)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【535】The development of automated liquid culture systems for mycobacterial growth detection, such as BACTEC 460TB and BACTEC MGIT960 (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparks, MD), VersaTREK Myco (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Westlake, OH), and BacT/Alert 3D (bioMérieux, Durham, NC), which are faster and more sensitive than solid media, has clearly facilitated TB diagnosis in the past decade.\n\n【536】### New Technology\n\n【537】Several recently developed tests for TB, including molecular drug resistance, have the potential for providing rapid diagnosis and targeted treatment.\n\n【538】*   Pai M\n*   Minion J\n*   Sohn H\n*   Zwerling A\n*   Perkins M\n\n【539】Novel and improved technologies for tuberculosis diagnosis: progress and challenges.\n\n【540】无关删除-2_Clin Chest Med._ 2009; 30 ( 2009 ) : 701-716\n\n【541】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (119)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【542】*   Boehme CC\n*   Nabeta P\n*   Hillemann D\n*   et al.\n\n【543】Rapid molecular detection of tuberculosis and rifampin resistance.\n\n【544】无关删除-2_N Engl J Med._ 2010; 363 : 1005-1015\n\n【545】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1769)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【546】These fully automated tests provide rapid drug-resistance testing for RIF and INH; however, they require sophisticated technology and are currently available only at reference laboratories.\n\n【547】*   Small PM\n*   Pai M\n\n【548】Tuberculosis diagnosis–time for a game change \\[editorial\\].\n\n【549】无关删除-2_N Engl J Med._ 2010; 363 : 1070-1071\n\n【550】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (144)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【551】### Other Considerations\n\n【552】At the start of LTBI therapy, baseline measurements of serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin are recommended for patients who have a history of liver disease (eg, hepatitis B or C, alcoholic hepatitis, or cirrhosis), use alcohol regularly, have risk factors for chronic liver disease, are infected with HIV, are pregnant, or have given birth within the past 3 months.\n\n【553】*   American Thoracic Society\n\n【554】Targeted tuberculin testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection.\n\n【555】无关删除-2_MMWR Recomm Rep._ 2000; 49 : 1-51\n\n【556】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【557】All patients diagnosed as having LTBI should be offered voluntary HIV counseling and testing.\n\n【558】All patients with active TB should receive counseling and be tested for HIV infection.

Susceptibility testing to the second-line drugs should be performed on specimens from patients who have had previous therapy, are known to have resistance to first-line drugs, are contacts of patients with drug-resistant TB, or have persistently positive cultures 3 months or more after starting treatment.

For treatment to be successful, patient-centered case management and close collaboration between health care professionals and local public health programs are imperative.\n\n【589】Medications for treating TB are classified as first- and second-line drugs ( Table 5 ). First-line drugs are INH, RIF, EMB, and PZA. The rifamycin derivatives rifapentine and rifabutin are also considered among the first-line drugs. Second-line drugs include the aminoglycosides streptomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin; the polypeptide capreomycin; p-aminosalicylic acid; cycloserine; the thioamides ethionamide and prothionamide; and several fluoroquinolones (eg, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin).

Although these regimens are broadly applicable, treatment must be individualized on the basis of each patient's clinical situation. Each of the 4 TB treatment regimens has an initial phase of 2 months followed by a continuation phase of 4 or 7 months ( Table 6 ). Treatment in the initial phase is usually empirical because susceptibility data may not be available. To guard against drug resistance and to ensure maximal effectiveness, the initial phase of treatment should include 4 drugs (INH, RIF, PZA, and EMB). If the isolate is susceptible to INH and RIF, EMB can be discontinued. Depending on the regimen chosen, medication in the initial phase may be given daily throughout treatment, daily for 2 weeks then twice weekly thereafter, or 3 times weekly throughout. Susceptibility data should direct treatment in the continuation phase, which lasts for 4 months in most patients. The continuation phase of treatment should be extended to 7 months for the following 3 groups of patients: those with cavitary pulmonary TB whose sputum culture remains positive after 2 months of treatment; those in whom the initial phase of treatment did not include PZA (eg, thosewho have severe liver disease or are pregnant); and those being treated with once-weekly INH and rifapentine whose sputum culture remains positive after 2 months of treatment.

Treatment for TB can be complicated by the interaction between rifamycins, antiretroviral agents, and other anti-infective drugs prescribed for opportunistic infections. In persons receiving antiretroviral therapy, RIF should be avoided or used with caution. Rifabutin, which has fewer problematic drug interactions, may be substituted for RIF. During the continuation phase of treatment, the INH-rifapentine regimen should never be used because of the high relapse rate.\n\n【663】Concurrent initiation of anti-TB and antiretroviral therapy may cause increased adverse effects and paradoxical reactions in patients not already receiving treatment. The term _immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome_ is used to describe this paradoxical reaction, which presents as worsening clinical (eg, high fever, weight loss, increased lymphadenopathy) and radiographic (eg, increased pulmonary infiltrates) manifestations of TB resulting from the immune reconstitution achieved by antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【664】*   Murdoch DM\n*   Venter WD\n*   Feldman C\n*   Van Rie A\n\n【665】Incidence and risk factors for the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in HIV patients in South Africa: a prospective study.\n\n【666】无关删除-2_AIDS._ 2008; 22 : 601-610\n\n【667】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (248)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【668】*   French MA\n*   Lenzo N\n*   John M\n*   et al.\n\n【669】Immune restoration disease after the treatment of immunodeficient HIV-infected patients with highly active antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【670】无关删除-2_HIV Med._ 2000; 1 : 107-115\n\n【671】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (371)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【672】*   Narita M\n*   Ashkin D\n*   Hollender ES\n*   Pitchenik AE\n\n【673】Paradoxical worsening of tuberculosis following antiretroviral therapy in patients with AIDS.\n\n【674】无关删除-2_Am J Respir Crit Care Med._ 1998; 158 : 157-161\n\n【675】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (554)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【676】*   Wendel KA\n*   Alwood KS\n*   Gachuhi R\n*   Chaisson RE\n*   Bishai WR\n*   Sterling TR\n\n【677】Paradoxical worsening of tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons.\n\n【678】无关删除-2_Chest._ 2001; 120 : 193-197\n\n【679】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (147)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【680】The mechanism for these paradoxical reactions is unclear but appears to be immune mediated: lower CD4 counts in patients with HIV infection seem to be associated with a higher risk of developing immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.\n\n【681】*   Murdoch DM\n*   Venter WD\n*   Feldman C\n*   Van Rie A\n\n【682】Incidence and risk factors for the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in HIV patients in South Africa: a prospective study.\n\n【683】无关删除-2_AIDS._ 2008; 22 : 601-610\n\n【684】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (248)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【685】*   Manabe YC\n*   Campbell JD\n*   Sydnor E\n*   Moore RD\n\n【686】Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome: risk factors and treatment implications.\n\n【687】无关删除-2_J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr._ 2007; 46 : 456-462\n\n【688】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (155)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【689】For these reasons, antiretroviral therapy should be delayed for 2 to 8 weeks after starting anti-TB therapy.\n\n【690】*   Kaplan JE\n*   Benson C\n*   Holmes KH\n*   Brooks JT\n*   Pau A\n*   Masur H\n\n【691】Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\n【692】无关删除-2_MMWR Recomm Rep._ 2009; 58 : 1-207\n\n【693】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【694】Treatment of HIV-related TB is complex and is best managed by those with expertise in both HIV infection and TB.\n\n【695】### Extrapulmonary TB\n\n【696】The same basic principles for the treatment of pulmonary TB apply to extrapulmonary TB. For TB at any site, a treatment course of 6 to 9 months with regimens that include INH and RIF is recommended; the single exception is meningitis, for which 9 to 12 months of treatment is recommended. The addition of corticosteroids to anti-TB treatment is recommended for patients with TB of the pericardium and central nervous system, including the meninges.\n\n【697】### Pregnancy and Breast-feeding\n\n【698】For the treatment of TB in pregnant women, the initial regimen should be INH, RIF, and EMB for at least 9 months. Although teratogenicity data for PZA are limited, it is probably safe to use in pregnancy. Breast-feeding should not be discouraged for women receiving anti-TB treatment. Pyridoxine supplementation (25 mg/d) is recommended for all pregnant and breast-feeding women taking INH.\n\n【699】### Drug-Resistant TB\n\n【700】Treatment of drug-resistant TB (resistance of the organism to 1 first-line drug) has become even more complex, difficult, and expensive with the emergence of MDR-TB and XDR-TB.

Careful supervision under DOT is mandatory to ensure adherence to therapy. Treatment is extended to 24 months after culture conversion, with posttreatment follow-up for 24 months.

Testing for LTBI is indicated to detect patients at risk of new infection or at risk of reactivation of LTBI due to underlying medical conditions. Persons at risk of new infection include contacts of patients with active pulmonary TB, employees at facilities with a high risk of exposure (eg, prisons, health care facilities, homeless shelters), and those who have recently immigrated (ie, within the past 5 years) from regions of the world where TB is endemic. Persons at highest risk of reactivation include those taking immunosuppressive medications (ie, chemotherapy, tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors) and those with HIV infection, hematologic malignancy, silicosis, dialysis-dependent renal failure, or changes on chest radiography consistent with previous TB.\n\n【752】*   American Thoracic Society\n\n【753】Targeted tuberculin testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection.\n\n【754】无关删除-2_MMWR Recomm Rep._ 2000; 49 : 1-51\n\n【755】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【756】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【757】Tuberculosis remains a devastating disease throughout the world.

Effective management requires prompt recognition using a combination of clinical, radiographic, microbiological, and histopathologic hallmarks and initiation of appropriate multidrug therapy. In addition to effective treatment of patients with active TB, public health management strategies include contact investigation and testing of persons who came into close contact with patients with active TB before initiation of therapy and reduction of the population-based burden of LTBI through targeted testing and treatment.\n\n【758】CME Materials\n-------------\n\n【759】无关删除-2*   Download .pdf (.01 MB)\n\n【760】    Help with pdf files", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis, a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology, is typically based on clinical signs and symptoms supported by radiographic findings and the presence of noncaseating epithelioid granulomas in more than one organ. Elevated serum levels of ACE, hypercalciuria, and hypercalcemia provide supportive, but not diagnostic, evidence of sarcoidosis.\n\n【16】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n\n【17】Related Articles\n----------------\n\n【18】Hide Caption Download See figure in Article\n\n【19】Toggle Thumbstrip\n\n【20】无关删除-2*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download .PPT", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "32815b4c-9d38-4fbf-be93-218bfb53fe69", "title": "Stomach cancer", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Stomach cancer, which is also called gastric cancer, is a growth of cells that starts in the stomach. The stomach is in the upper middle part of the belly, just below the ribs. The stomach helps to break down and digest food.\n\n【2】Stomach cancer can happen in any part of the stomach. In most of the world, stomach cancers happen in the main part of the stomach. This part is called the stomach body.\n\n【3】In the United States, stomach cancer is more likely to start by the gastroesophageal junction. This is the part where the long tube that carries food you swallow meets the stomach. The tube that carries food to the stomach is called the esophagus.\n\n【4】Where the cancer starts in the stomach is one factor health care providers think about when making a treatment plan. Other factors might include the cancer's stage and the type of cells involved. Treatment often includes surgery to remove the stomach cancer. Other treatments may be used before and after surgery.\n\n【5】Stomach cancer treatment is most likely to be successful if the cancer is only in the stomach. The prognosis for people with small stomach cancers is quite good. Many can expect to be cured. Most stomach cancers are found when the disease is advanced and a cure is less likely. Stomach cancer that grows through the stomach wall or spreads to other parts of the body is harder to cure.\n\n【6】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【7】Signs and symptoms of stomach cancer may include:\n\n【8】*   Trouble swallowing\n*   Belly pain\n*   Feeling bloated after eating\n*   Feeling full after eating small amounts of food\n*   Not feeling hungry when you would expect to be hungry\n*   Heartburn\n*   Indigestion\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n*   Losing weight without trying\n*   Feeling very tired\n*   Stools that look black\n\n【9】Stomach cancer doesn't always cause symptoms in its early stages. When they happen, symptoms might include indigestion and pain in the upper part of the belly. Symptoms might not happen until the cancer is advanced. Later stages of stomach cancer might cause symptoms such as feeling very tired, losing weight without trying, vomiting blood and having black stools.\n\n【10】Stomach cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is called metastatic stomach cancer. It causes symptoms specific to where it spreads. For example, when cancer spreads to the lymph nodes it might cause lumps you can feel through the skin. Cancer that spreads to the liver might cause yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. If cancer spreads within the belly, it might cause fluid to fill the belly. The belly might look swollen.\n\n【11】### When to see a doctor\n\n【12】If you have signs and symptoms that worry you, make an appointment with your health care provider. Many conditions can cause symptoms that are like the ones caused by stomach cancer. Your provider might test for those other causes first before testing for stomach cancer.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】It's not clear what causes stomach cancer. Experts believe most stomach cancers start when something hurts the inside lining of the stomach. Examples include having an infection in the stomach, having long-standing acid reflux and eating a lot of salty foods. Not everyone with these risk factors gets stomach cancer, though. So more research is needed to find out exactly what causes it.\n\n【15】Stomach cancer begins when something hurts cells in the inner lining of the stomach. It causes the cells to develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to multiply quickly. The cells can go on living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural lifecycle. This causes a lot of extra cells in the stomach. The cells can form a mass called a tumor.\n\n【16】Cancer cells in the stomach can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. They might start to grow deeper into the wall of the stomach. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer cells spread to another part of the body it's called metastasis.\n\n【17】### Types of stomach cancer\n\n【18】The type of stomach cancer you have is based on the type of cell where your cancer began. Examples of stomach cancer types include:\n\n【19】*   **Adenocarcinoma.** Adenocarcinoma stomach cancer starts in cells that produce mucus. This is the most common type of stomach cancer. Nearly all cancers that start in the stomach are adenocarcinoma stomach cancers.\n*   **Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).** GIST starts in special nerve cells that are found in the wall of the stomach and other digestive organs. GIST is a type of soft tissue sarcoma.\n*   **Carcinoid tumors.** Carcinoid tumors are cancers that start in the neuroendocrine cells. Neuroendocrine cells are found in many places in the body. They do some nerve cell functions and some of the work of cells that make hormones. Carcinoid tumors are a type of neuroendocrine tumor.\n*   **Lymphoma.** Lymphoma is a cancer that starts in immune system cells. The body's immune system fights germs. Lymphoma can sometimes start in the stomach if the body sends immune system cells to the stomach. This might happen if the body is trying to fight off an infection. Most lymphomas that start in the stomach are a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n【20】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【21】Factors that increase the risk of stomach cancer include:\n\n【22】*   Ongoing problems with stomach acid backing up into the esophagus, which is called gastroesophageal reflux disease\n*   A diet high in salty and smoked foods\n*   A diet low in fruits and vegetables\n*   Infection in the stomach caused by a germ called Helicobacter pylori\n*   Swelling and irritation of the inside of the stomach, which is called gastritis\n*   Smoking\n*   Growths of noncancerous cells in the stomach, called polyps\n*   Family history of stomach cancer\n*   Family history of genetic syndromes that increase the risk of stomach cancer and other cancers, such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, Lynch syndrome, juvenile polyposis syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis\n\n【23】Prevention\n----------\n\n【24】To lower the risk of stomach cancer, you can:\n\n【25】*   **Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.** Try to include fruits and vegetables in your diet each day. Choose a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables.\n*   **Reduce the amount of salty and smoked foods you eat.** Protect your stomach by limiting these foods.\n*   **Stop smoking.** If you smoke, quit. If you don't smoke, don't start. Smoking increases your risk of stomach cancer and many other types of cancer. Quitting smoking can be very hard, so ask your health care provider for help.\n*   **Tell your health care provider if stomach cancer runs in your family.** People with a strong family history of stomach cancer might have stomach cancer screening. Screening tests can detect stomach cancer before it causes symptoms.\n\n【26】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Panto-250\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Vitamins are compounds that you must have for growth and health. They are needed in only small amounts and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Pantothenic acid (vitamin B 5) is needed for the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.\n\n【6】No problems have been found that are due to a lack of pantothenic acid alone. However, a lack of one B vitamin usually goes along with a lack of others, so pantothenic acid is often included in B complex products.\n\n【7】Claims that pantothenic acid is effective for treatment of nerve damage, breathing problems, itching and other skin problems, and poisoning with some other drugs; for getting rid of or preventing gray hair; for preventing arthritis, allergies, and birth defects; or for improving mental ability have not been proven.\n\n【8】This vitamin is available without a prescription.\n\n【9】### Importance of Diet\n\n【10】For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.\n\n【11】Pantothenic acid is found in various foods including peas and beans (except green beans), lean meat, poultry, fish, and whole-grain cereals. Little pantothenic acid is lost from foods with ordinary cooking.\n\n【12】Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food—protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat.\n\n【13】The daily amount of pantothenic acid needed is defined in several different ways.\n\n【14】#### For U.S.—\n\n【15】*   Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).\n*   Daily Values (DVs) for nutrients are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DVs replace the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).\n\n【16】#### For Canada—\n\n【17】*   Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.\n\n【18】Because lack of pantothenic acid is so rare, there is no RDA or RNI for this vitamin. The following daily intakes are thought to be plenty for most individuals:\n\n【19】*   Infants and children—\n    *   Birth to 3 years of age: 2 to 3 milligrams (mg).\n    *   4 to 6 years of age: 3 to 4 mg.\n    *   7 to 10 years of age: 4 to 5 mg.\n*   Adolescents and adults—4 to 7 mg.\n\n【20】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【21】*   Tablet\n*   Capsule\n\n【22】Before Using\n------------\n\n【23】If you are taking this dietary supplement without a prescription, carefully read and follow any precautions on the label. For this supplement, the following should be considered:\n\n【24】### Allergies\n\n【25】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【26】### Pediatric\n\n【27】Problems in children have not been reported with intake of normal daily recommended amounts.\n\n【28】### Geriatric\n\n【29】Problems in older adults have not been reported with intake of normal daily recommended amounts.\n\n【30】### Drug Interactions\n\n【31】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【32】### Other Interactions\n\n【33】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【34】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【35】### Dosing\n\n【36】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【37】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【38】*   For oral dosage forms (capsules, tablets, oral solution):\n    *   To prevent deficiency, the amount taken by mouth is based on normal daily recommended intakes:\n        *   Adults and teenagers—4 to 7 milligrams (mg) per day.\n        *   Children 7 to 10 years of age—4 to 5 mg per day.\n        *   Children 4 to 6 years of age—3 to 4 mg per day.\n        *   Children birth to 3 years of age—2 to 3 mg per day.\n    *   To treat deficiency:\n        *   Adults, teenagers, and children—Treatment dose is determined by prescriber for each individual based on severity of deficiency.\n\n【39】### Missed Dose\n\n【40】If you miss a dose of this medicine, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【41】### Storage\n\n【42】Store the dietary supplement in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【43】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【44】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【45】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【46】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【47】Portions of this document last updated: Feb. 01, 2023\n\n【48】Original article: https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/pantothenic-acid-oral-route/description/drg-20065349", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Approximately 2% of patients with MM are null excretors of protein, and MM will be diagnosed only with bone marrow biopsy.

Chest CT showed no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.\n\n【93】*   4.\n\n【94】    _Which one of the following procedures is the best choice to elucidate the cause of this patient's lymphadenopathy?_\n\n【95】    *   a.\n\n【96】        _Exploratory laparotomy_\n\n【97】    *   b.\n\n【98】        _CT-guided biopsy_\n\n【99】    *   c.\n\n【100】        _Bone marrow aspiration_\n\n【101】    *   d.\n\n【102】        _Gallium citrate Ga 67 lung scan_\n\n【103】    *   e.\n\n【104】        _Indium In scan_\n\n【105】To establish the etiology of lymphadenopathies in general, obtaining a tissue specimen for pathologic diagnosis is the “gold standard.” In this patient who has several intra- peritoneal lymph nodes that are causing no morbid or severe symptoms such as obstruction or pain refractory to medical management, exploratory laparotomy is unwarranted. The risks would outweigh any potential benefit. Biopsy with CT guidance is minimally invasive and is relatively safe and effective. Nevertheless, normal or nonspecific results may be obtained due to sampling error, and further diagnostic or therapeutic measures rely on clinical judgment and overall course of the disease.\n\n【106】Bone marrow aspiration is not used for the diagnosis but rather for disease staging of lymphoma because involvement of the marrow is usually focal. Hence, this test is inappropriate in our patient.\n\n【107】Gallium lung scanning is not recommended for evaluating causes of lymphadenopathy. The test result is not only difficult to interpret but also nonspecific and has low sensitivity. However, it is superior to CT in distinguishing mediastinal fibrosis from active tumor tissue after treatment of lymphomas. Indium scanning images the entire body and is generally used for patients in whom the initial evaluation shows no underlying infection or inflammation. Use of these nuclear imaging scans remains investigational to date.\n\n【108】The patient subsequently underwent fine-needle aspiration of a retroperitoneal lymph node. Noncaseating granulomatous inflammation was seen. Special stains for microorganisms and acid-fast bacilli were negative. The serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was elevated at 81 U/L (7-46 U/L). The purified protein derivative test result was negative.\n\n【109】*   5.\n\n【110】    _At this point, which one of the following diagnoses is most likely in this patient?_\n\n【111】    *   a.\n\n【112】        _Tuberculosis_\n\n【113】    *   b.\n\n【114】        _Sarcoidosis_\n\n【115】    *   c.\n\n【116】        _Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)_\n\n【117】    *   d.\n\n【118】        _Lymphoma_\n\n【119】    *   e.\n\n【120】        _Berylliosis_\n\n【121】Tuberculosis is a mycobacterial infection that has been associated with hypercalcemia and an increased ACE level.\n\n【122】*   Thomas AV\n*   Ansari A\n*   Khurana M\n*   Niden AH\n\n【123】Elevated serum angiotensin converting enzyme in miliary tuberculosis \\[abstract\\].\n\n【124】_Am Rev Respir Dis._ 1979; 119 : 83\n\n【125】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【126】However, caseation is the typical histopathologic finding in this entity, which differs from that seen in our patient.\n\n【127】Although the presence of noncaseating granulomas is not diagnostic by itself, the composite of clinical findings such as high levels of calcitriol, hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, negative purified protein derivative test results, and increased ACE levels together with the cytologic evidence makes sarcoidosis the most likely diagnosis.\n\n【128】A differential diagnosis to consider in a patient who presents with fatigue and has anemia and abdominal lymphadenopathy is CLL. Most symptomatic patients have enlarged lymph nodes and splenomegaly. Enlargement of the cervical and supraclavicular nodes occurs more commonly than lymphadenopathy elsewhere. Mesenteric or retroperitoneal involvement is infrequent. Moreover, patients with CLL have demonstrable lymphocytosis in routine complete blood cell counts. Lymph node architecture is diffusely effaced by small lymphocytes. These points argue against the diagnosis of CLL in our patient.\n\n【129】Although elevated serum levels of calcitriol are found in many patients with hypercalcemia who have either high- grade widespread B-cell lymphomas or Hodgkin disease, individual characteristic histopathologic findings distinguish such patients from those with sarcoidosis. Moreover, the ACE level is usually low in patients with malignant lymphomas.\n\n【130】*   Romer FK\n*   Emmertsen K\n\n【131】Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme in malignant lymphomas, leukaemia and multiple myeloma.\n\n【132】无关删除-2_Br J Cancer._ 1980; 42 : 314-318\n\n【133】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (27)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【134】*   Carr PL\n*   Singer DE\n*   Goldenheim P\n*   Bernardo J\n*   Mulley AG\n\n【135】Noninvasive testing of asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy.\n\n【136】无关删除-2_J Gen Intern Med._ 1990; 5 : 138-146\n\n【137】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (17)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【138】Berylliosis is an antigen-driven pulmonary disease characterized histologically by noncaseating granulomas and mononuclear cell infiltrates and is diagnosed in the presence of beryllium exposure and evidence of beryllium sensitization. However, our patient had findings confined to the peritoneal cavity, incongruous with berylliosis.\n\n【139】After we withheld hydrochlorothiazide and administered aggressive saline diuresis, the patient's hypercalcemia improved, and his serum calcium levels plateaued at 11 to 11.2 mg/dL. Prednisone, 40 mg/d, was then initiated. His serum calcium level normalized within 5 days of institution of prednisone. Corticosteroid use was tapered over 6 months. Repeated CT of the abdomen after treatment showed remarkable regression in the size of the intra- abdominal lymph nodes. Although withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids is a risk factor for exacerbation of psoriasis, this did not occur in our patient.\n\n【140】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【141】First described by Hutchinson in 1877, sarcoidosis has remained an enigma despite progress in accumulating pathologic and clinical data. Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disorder whose etiology remains unknown.\n\n【142】The diagnosis is made by histological evidence of non- caseating epithelioid cell granulomas in support of clinico- radiologic findings and by exclusion of other diseases capable of producing a similar histological or clinical picture. The value of monitoring ACE levels for disease activity remains unclear. However, the ACE level should never be used as the sole indication for initiating treatment.\n\n【143】Hypercalcemia is usually transient in patients with subacute sarcoidosis and may fluctuate in those with chronic sarcoidosis, depending on disease activity. Although hypercalcemia has long been recognized as a complication of sarcoidosis, the importance of hypercalciuria has been less appreciated. In patients with sarcoidosis, hypercalciuria is 3 times more common than hypercalcemia.\n\n【144】*   Carr PL\n*   Singer DE\n*   Goldenheim P\n*   Bernardo J\n*   Mulley AG\n\n【145】Noninvasive testing of asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy.\n\n【146】无关删除-2_J Gen Intern Med._ 1990; 5 : 138-146\n\n【147】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (17)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【148】In some studies, the frequency of hypercalciuria is 60%.\n\n【149】*   Lebacq E\n*   Desmet V\n*   Verhaegen H\n\n【150】Renal involvement in sarcoidosis.\n\n【151】无关删除-2_Postgrad Med J._ 1970; 46 : 526-529\n\n【152】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (82)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【153】Renal calculi have been found in about 10% of patients with chronic sarcoidosis. Hypercalciuria is slightly more common in men than in women and in white people than in West Indian patients. The mechanism of hypercalciuria appears to be 2-fold: (1) absorptive, associated with elevated serum 1,25- hydroxyvitamin D levels and an abnormally high urinary calcium-creatinine ratio; and (2) resorptive, as evidenced by the association of osteopenia, persistence of hyper- calciuria despite a calcium-poor diet, and association with an osteoclast-activating factor. An osteoclast-activating factor is a bone-reabsorbing substance produced by activated lymphocytes, mononuclear cells, and sarcoid granulomas. These sarcoid granulomas may be responsible for bone resorption.\n\n【154】Corticosteroids have conventionally been the initial treatment of choice, but there is no clear evidence that they modify the course of sarcoidosis despite numerous investigations. However, systemic therapy is clearly indicated in patients with severe organ impairment, such as progressive pulmonary disease. Extrapulmonary involvement of the neurologic, cardiac, and ophthalmologic systems unresponsive to topical agents or in patients with hypercalcemia warrants treatment even when symptoms are minimal because of the deleterious consequences that may ensue. Prednisone, 20 to 40 mg/d, is the drug of choice to reduce the endogenous production of 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D. Institution of corticosteroid therapy causes a decrease in circulating 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum calcium levels within 3 to 5 days. A decrease in the urinary calcium excretion rate occurs within 7 to 10 days.\n\n【155】*   Sharma OP\n\n【156】Vitamin D, calcium and sarcoidosis.\n\n【157】无关删除-2_Chest._ 1996; 109 : 535-539\n\n【158】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (224)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【159】If the serum calcium level fails to normalize after 2 weeks of corticosteroid therapy, the clinician should exclude the possibility of a coexisting disorder, including hyperparathyroidism, carcinoma, lymphoma, and myeloma. Once the calcium abnormality is controlled, the prednisone dose can be reduced over a period of 4 to 6 weeks. If the patient develops unbearable adverse effects from corticosteroid therapy or treatment fails, chloroquine or hydrochloroquine should be given. The latter 2 drugs are known to reduce serum 1,25- hydroxyvitamin D and calcium concentrations by inhibiting 1a-hydroxylase.\n\n【160】*   Adams JS\n*   Diz MM\n*   Sharma OP\n\n【161】Effective reduction in the serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and calcium concentration in sarcoidosis-associated hypercalcemia with short-course chloroquine therapy.\n\n【162】无关删除-2_Ann Intern Med._ 1989; 111 : 437-438\n\n【163】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (137)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【164】*   O'Leary TJ\n*   Jones G\n*   Yip A\n*   Lohnes D\n*   Cohanim M\n*   Yendt ER\n\n【165】The effects of chloroquine on serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis.\n\n【166】无关删除-2_N Engl J Med._ 1986; 315 : 727-730\n\n【167】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (134)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【168】Correct answers: 1. _d_ , 2. _c_ , 3. _a_ , 4. _b,_ 5\\. _b_", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "25cf9afd-9def-4676-b8a3-c5479c93eca1", "title": "Timolol (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Timolol (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Blocadren\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Timolol is used alone or together with other medicines (such as hydrochlorothiazide) to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled .\n\n【6】Timolol is also used after an acute heart attack to decrease its severity and prevent another heart attack. It may also be used to help prevent migraine headaches .\n\n【7】This medicine is a beta-blocker. It works by affecting the response to nerve impulses in certain parts of the body, like the heart. As a result, the heart beats slower and decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen is increased to the heart .\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription .\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of timolol in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established .\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatrics-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of timolol in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require an adjustment of dosage in patients receiving timolol .\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【24】*   Albuterol\n*   Bupropion\n*   Ceritinib\n*   Cobicistat\n*   Crizotinib\n*   Darunavir\n*   Dronedarone\n*   Escitalopram\n*   Fedratinib\n*   Fenoldopam\n*   Fingolimod\n*   Formoterol\n*   Indacaterol\n*   Iobenguane I 131\n*   Iohexol\n*   Lacosamide\n*   Levalbuterol\n*   Olodaterol\n*   Oxymetazoline\n*   Paroxetine\n*   Ponesimod\n*   Rivastigmine\n*   Salmeterol\n*   Terbutaline\n*   Venlafaxine\n*   Vilanterol\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【26】*   Aceclofenac\n*   Acemetacin\n*   Acetyldigoxin\n*   Amtolmetin Guacil\n*   Aspirin\n*   Bromfenac\n*   Bufexamac\n*   Celecoxib\n*   Choline Salicylate\n*   Clonixin\n*   Deslanoside\n*   Dexibuprofen\n*   Dexketoprofen\n*   Diclofenac\n*   Diflunisal\n*   Digitoxin\n*   Digoxin\n*   Dipyrone\n*   Droxicam\n*   Etodolac\n*   Etofenamate\n*   Etoricoxib\n*   Felbinac\n*   Fenoprofen\n*   Fepradinol\n*   Feprazone\n*   Floctafenine\n*   Flufenamic Acid\n*   Flurbiprofen\n*   Ibuprofen\n*   Indomethacin\n*   Ketoprofen\n*   Ketorolac\n*   Lornoxicam\n*   Loxoprofen\n*   Lumiracoxib\n*   Meclofenamate\n*   Mefenamic Acid\n*   Meloxicam\n*   Metildigoxin\n*   Morniflumate\n*   Nabumetone\n*   Naproxen\n*   Nepafenac\n*   Niflumic Acid\n*   Nimesulide\n*   Nimesulide Beta Cyclodextrin\n*   Oxaprozin\n*   Oxyphenbutazone\n*   Parecoxib\n*   Phenylbutazone\n*   Piketoprofen\n*   Piroxicam\n*   Pranoprofen\n*   Proglumetacin\n*   Propyphenazone\n*   Proquazone\n*   Rofecoxib\n*   Salicylic Acid\n*   Salsalate\n*   Sodium Salicylate\n*   St John's Wort\n*   Sulindac\n*   Tenoxicam\n*   Tiaprofenic Acid\n*   Tolfenamic Acid\n*   Tolmetin\n*   Valdecoxib\n\n【27】### Other Interactions\n\n【28】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.

Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【30】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【31】*   Angina (severe chest pain)—May provoke chest pain if stopped too quickly .\n\n【32】*   Asthma or\n*   Bradycardia (slow heartbeat) or\n*   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe or\n*   Heart block or\n*   Heart failure—Should not use in patients with these conditions .\n\n【33】*   Blood vessel disease (especially blood vessels in the brain) or\n*   Stroke, history of—Use with caution. This medicine may worsen these conditions .\n\n【34】*   Diabetes or\n*   Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) or\n*   Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)—May cover up some of the signs and symptoms of these diseases, such as a fast heartbeat .\n\n【35】*   Kidney disease, severe or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal from the body .\n\n【36】*   Lung disease (e.g. bronchitis, emphysema)—May cause difficulty with breathing in patients with this condition .\n\n【37】*   Myasthenia gravis—May worsen symptoms of this condition, such as muscle weakness .\n\n【38】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【39】In addition to the use of this medicine, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and changes in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium. Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet .\n\n【40】Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal. It is very important that you take your medicine exactly as directed and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well .\n\n【41】Remember that this medicine will not cure your high blood pressure, but it does help control it. You must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life.

One month previously, approximately 2 months after her third delivery, she developed bilateral pedal edema, which progressed rapidly to anasarca. Hypertension, noted since the third trimester with average blood pressure of 180/105 mm Hg, persisted. Her 24-hour urinary protein level at that time was 9 g/24 h, and creatinine level was elevated at 1.7 mg/dL (reference range shown parenthetically) (0.6-0.9 mg/dL). Records from a hospital elsewhere revealed that she had undergone renal biopsy during that time, which showed active grade 4 diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (World Health Organization class IV glomerulonephritis). Diuretics, prednisone, 60 mg/d, and 1 dose of cyclophosphamide were started approximately 3 weeks before admission, and the patient's edema improved gradually. She did well until 1 week before admission, when she developed an incongruous affect, with inappropriate giggling alternating with episodes of hostility, catatonia, and combativeness. She had no hallucinations, delusions, fever, or headache. Her medications included labetalol, 200 mg/d; furosemide, 200 mg/d; amiloride, 5 mg twice daily; metolazone, 5 mg/d; and prednisone, 40 mg/d. The patient was initially admitted to her local hospital where a complete blood cell count and serum sodium, potassium, and calcium levels were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a protein level of 80 mg/dL (14-45 mg/dL), glucose of 66 mg/dL, and no pleocytosis. Cryptococcal antigen, rapid plasma reagin test, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative. The patient was then transferred to our institution for evaluation of her change in behavior.\n\n【1】On physical examination, the patient was alert but hostile and paranoid. Her blood pressure was 156/103 mm Hg, heart rate was 108 beats/min, respirations were 18/min, and temperature was 37.6°C. Pertinent findings included bilateral lower extremity edema and normal findings on cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations. She had no focal neurologic deficit or nuchal rigidity. Muscle strength and reflexes were symmetrical, and plantar response was flexor bilaterally. Her mental status examination was notable for global cognitive dysfunction, with a Kokmen mental status score of 10 of 38.\n\n【2】Initial laboratory tests after admission showed a hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL (12.0-15.5 g/dL), hematocrit level of 31.6% (34.9%-44.5%), white blood count (WBC) of 3.8×10  /L (3.5-10.5×10  /L), and platelet count of 65×10  /L (150-450×10  /L). Her blood urea nitrogen level was 80 mg/dL (6-21 mg/dL), creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL, sodium was 142 mEq/L (135-145 mEq/L), potassium was 3.7 mEq/L (3.6-4.8 mEq/L), calcium was 8.6 mg/dL (8.9-10.1 mg/dL), and albumin was 2.0 g/dL (3.5-5.0 g/dL). Urinalysis revealed 11 to 20 red blood cells per high-power field (<1 per high-power field) and occasional fat bodies but no WBCs, hemoglobin, or hemosiderin. The urinary protein level was 7869 mg/24 h (27-93 mg/24 h).\n\n【3】*   1.\n\n【4】    **_Which one of the following diagnoses is most likely in this patient?_**\n\n【5】    *   a.\n\n【6】        _Herpes encephalitis_\n\n【7】    *   b.\n\n【8】        _Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)_\n\n【9】    *   c.\n\n【10】        _Corticosteroid-induced psychosis_\n\n【11】    *   d.\n\n【12】        _Neuropsychiatric lupus_\n\n【13】    *   e.\n\n【14】        _Postpartum psychosis_\n\n【15】Altered behavior and confusion can be found in each of these diagnoses.

More sensitive techniques for detecting DIC measure the presence of the products of fibrinolysis (eg, D-dimer products) and coagulation activation (eg, soluble fibrin monomer). The D- dimer assay is nonspecific, and deep venous thrombosis might be responsible for the elevation in this patient. Moreover, the absence of the soluble fibrin monomer argues against DIC.\n\n【115】Correction of the APTT on addition of normal plasma suggests deficiency of coagulation factors involved in the intrinsic or common pathway. The normal PT in this patient supports the former. In contrast, a prolonged APTT that does not correct when the patient's plasma is mixed with normal plasma indicates the presence of an inhibitor. In some patients, partial correction may be achieved.

The common precipitants of PRES are diverse and include acute hypertension, renal failure, eclampsia, and immuno- suppressant drug treatment such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Reported blood pressure measurements range from 130/80 to 210/110 mm Hg, with a median of 170/100 mm Hg. The symptoms of this syndrome typically resolve completely after blood pressure is satisfactorily controlled or immunosuppressive therapy is modified or withdrawn.\n\n【150】The most common abnormality on neuroimaging is evidence of white matter edema involving the posterior cerebral hemispheres, especially the parieto-occipital areas. Characteristic radiographic findings are areas of low attenuation on CT and increased T2 signal on MRI, usually localized to brain regions supplied by the posterior circulation but potentially involving any region. The frontal lobes, basal ganglia, and posterior fossa structures may be affected. The occipital lobes are almost always involved, with sparing of the calcarine and paramedian occipital lobe. This helps to distinguish PRES from bilateral infarctions of the posterior cerebral artery. Predominant involvement of white matter may also assist in this distinction. Patients with PRES undergoing follow-up imaging generally have improvement or complete resolution of imaging abnormalities, suggesting that this syndrome is characterized by transient edema rather than infarction. Clinical improvement may precede resolution of radiologic abnormalities, the latter of which may occur as early as a week.\n\n【151】*   Hinchey J\n*   Chaves C\n*   Appignani B\n*   et al.\n\n【152】A reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome.\n\n【153】无关删除-2_N Engl J Med._ 1996; 334 : 494-500\n\n【154】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2768)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【155】Although prompt treatment usually leads to resolution of symptoms, neurologic dysfunction persists in some patients. Permanent injury may result from intracerebral hemorrhage, especially in patients with thrombocytopenia or poorly controlled hypertension.\n\n【156】The pathogenesis of PRES is poorly understood. It is presumed that sudden systemic blood pressure elevations exceed the autoregulatory capabilities of the brain vasculature. This failure of autoregulation leads to regions of vasodilation and vasoconstriction with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and focal transudation of fluid, hence the capillary leak.\n\n【157】Frequently, PRES is associated with precipitating factors that do not elevate the blood pressure. In addition, PRES occasionally occurs in patients with only moderately elevated blood pressure. These findings suggest that other additional factors, either local or systemic, may predispose the cerebral vasculature to the effects of elevations in blood pressure. Attention has been focused on the selective vulnerability of watershed areas in the posterior circulation. These areas exhibit increased sensitivity to normally circulating pressor agents and to deficiencies of locally produced vasodilating prostaglandins. However, the mechanisms leading to endothelial cell dysfunction in this syndrome are, at the present time, unclear.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Providing updates in diagnosis, treatment, and medical research, educating house staff and faculty, and promoting collegiality were the most important objectives of MGR. Regarding objectives, responses to the current survey differed significantly from the responses to the 1988 survey for providing updates in medical research ( _P_ \\=.047), providing continuing medical education credit ( _P_ <.001), educating house staff ( _P_ \\=.048), and educating faculty ( _P_ <.001); the differences were primarily due to higher proportions of current survey respondents rating these objectives as “quite” or “very” important. The most common format was the didactic lecture. Case presentations were uncommonly used, and patients were rarely present. Only 44% of departments used educational needs assessments, and only 13% assessed knowledge gained by attendees. Feedback was irregularly provided to presenters. Most departments (64%) relied on industry to pay for MGR. Lack of presenter-attendee interaction and conflicting meetings were cited as important challenges. Nevertheless, most (62%) of the current survey respondents thought the quality of MGR had increased.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】Departments of medicine regard MGR as an important educational and social endeavor. However, most departments use suboptimal teaching, planning, and evaluation methods, and many rely on industry to pay for MGR.

He had experienced a squeezing heaviness in the central portion of his chest with associated tingling of his left arm at various times during the past 10 years. The symptoms occasionally developed during his morning walk; however, episodes also occurred with no physical activity, and rest-related and exercise-related episodes occurred with equal frequency. At presentation, he reported onset of chest discomfort within 15 to 20 minutes after beginning his daily 3-mile walk. Discomfort was relieved after 90 seconds of rest. The episodes of chest discomfort had increased in frequency from only once weekly to every other day to daily within the previous 6 months. He had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and a family history of coronary artery disease. During the past 10 years, 3 cardiovascular evaluations, including exercise thallium scintigraphy and coronary angiography, yielded unremarkable results. The symptoms persisted despite the use of atenolol (25 mg/d).\n\n【1】*   1.\n\n【2】    **_On the basis of the patient's history, which one of the following is least likely to account for his symptoms?_**\n\n【3】    *   a.\n\n【4】        _Progressive angina_\n\n【5】    *   b.\n\n【6】        _Variant angina_\n\n【7】    *   c.\n\n【8】        _Esophageal spasm_\n\n【9】    *   d.\n\n【10】        _Gastroesophageal reflux disease_\n\n【11】    *   e.\n\n【12】        _Acute pericarditis_\n\n【13】Angina is caused by transient myocardial ischemia, usually associated with fixed narrowing of coronary arteries and precipitated by an exercise-related imbalance of coronary blood supply and demand. Most affected patients are age 50 years or older and describe exertional heaviness or a squeezing sensation localized to the substernal region that lasts 1 to 5 minutes. Our patient had symptoms of angina with evidence of recent progression.\n\n【14】Variant angina, also referred to as Prinzmetal angina or atypical angina, is thought to result from spasm of normal or narrowed coronary arteries without a typical relationship to physical exercise. It usually involves pain at rest triggered by factors such as cold, emotional stress, or hyperventilation, but some exertion-related symptoms may also occur. It should be considered in any patient with a lengthy history of chest pain in whom no definitive diagnosis has been made, including our patient.\n\n【15】Diffuse esophageal spasm can cause symptoms similar to those associated with myocardial ischemia. The chest discomfort has been described as a mild to heavy crushing sensation that radiates to the back and jaw. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is believed to be an initiating factor for diffuse esophageal spasm and should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of this patient.\n\n【16】Chest pain due to acute pericarditis tends to be sharp and pleuritic. It is aggravated by supine positioning and relieved by sitting, radiates to the back and trapezius ridge, and must be present for less than 6 weeks. Our patient's pain was not pleuritic or positional and had been present for more than 10 years. Thus, acute pericarditis is the least likely explanation for his symptoms.\n\n【17】The patient underwent electrocardiography (ECG), which revealed normal findings. Results of laboratory tests were unremarkable.\n\n【18】*   2.\n\n【19】    **_Which one of the following studies would be least helpful in the diagnostic assessment at this time?_**\n\n【20】    *   a.\n\n【21】        _24-Hour ECG monitoring_\n\n【22】    *   b.\n\n【23】        _Exercise testing with imaging_\n\n【24】    *   c.\n\n【25】        _Invasive electrophysiologic testing_\n\n【26】    *   d.\n\n【27】        _Hyperventilation followed by accelerated exercise with ECG monitoring_\n\n【28】    *   e.\n\n【29】        _Coronary angiography with chemical provocation_\n\n【30】ST-segment elevation, the first ECG manifestation of coronary occlusion in acute transmural or Q-wave myocardial infarction, has also been noted in patients with chest pain and coronary vasospasm. During an episode of coronary vasospasm, transient total coronary occlusion produces transmural ischemia. Thus, 24-hour ECG monitoring may detect episodes of ST elevation, especially in patients such as ours who have some symptoms that can be provoked or predicted. Exercise testing would be more likely to produce ST-segment depression, indicative of subendocardial ischemia or injury in patients with hemodynamically important coronary disease. Because our patient's history did not suggest cardiac arrhythmia, an invasive electrophysiologic study would not be helpful. A formalized period of hyperventilation preceding standard treadmill exercise testing may increase the probability of detection of coronary spasm and therefore would be a reasonable option in our patient.\n\n【31】*   Sueda S\n*   Suzuki J\n*   Watanabe K\n*   et al.\n\n【32】New non-invasive protocol for detection of coronary spastic angina with significant organic stenosis.\n\n【33】无关删除-2_Coron Artery Dis._ 2001; 12 : 295-303\n\n【34】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (14)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【35】Coronary angiography with chemical provocation would be a useful test in diagnosing possible coronary artery spasm in this patient.\n\n【36】*   Mayer S\n*   Hillis LD\n\n【37】Prinzmetal's variant angina.\n\n【38】无关删除-2_Clin Cardiol._ 1998; 21 : 243-246\n\n【39】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (43)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【40】Ambulatory ECG monitoring was performed to assess potential changes during periods of pain.

Cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography is the appropriate next step in such a scenario. This should include a chemical provocative test for spasm (ergonovine, methylergonovine maleate) if no major obstruction is detected. Prescribing nitroglycerin as needed is reasonable adjunctive therapy but does not address the diagnosis of a condition with a potentially adverse prognosis. Therefore, this choice alone is inappropriate. Providing no treatment to a patient with progressive symptoms is also inappropriate.

A segment of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery appeared normal during diastole ( Figure 2, left ) but was partially obstructed during systole. After nitroglycerin administration ( Figure 2, right ), a phasic systolic abnormality became more apparent, and 85% obstruction was observed. Ergonovine stimulation was not performed because of the presence of the fixed lesions.\n\n【62】Figure 2 Coronary angiograms in a 66-year-old man with atypical angina after nitroglycerin administration taken during diastole (left) and during systole (right).\n\n【63】无关删除-2*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【64】*   4.\n\n【65】    **_Based on the results of this patient's coronary angiogram, which one of the following statements is true?_**\n\n【66】    *   a.\n\n【67】        _The coronary arteries were normal_\n\n【68】    *   b.\n\n【69】        _The patient had severe 3-vessel coronary artery disease_\n\n【70】    *   c.\n\n【71】        _Coronary artery spasm was present_\n\n【72】    *   d.\n\n【73】        _The patient had evidence of coronary dissection_\n\n【74】    *   e.\n\n【75】        _A myocardial bridge was present_\n\n【76】Angiography demonstrated 2-vessel coronary artery disease.

The pain had been present for 10 years, and the patient had had normal results on 3 previous cardiac catheterizations, suggesting that the cause of his chest pain preceded the development of the 2-vessel coronary artery disease. Although we could not definitively determine which coronary location exhibited spasm, it seemed most likely that coronary spasm was contributing to the pathogenesis of chest pain in this patient. A treatment plan was devised.\n\n【82】*   5.\n\n【83】    **_Which one of the following is not an appropriate treatment option for this patient?_**\n\n【84】    *   a.\n\n【85】        _Intracoronary angioplasty and stenting at the site of the myocardial bridge_\n\n【86】    *   b.\n\n【87】        _β-Blocker therapy_\n\n【88】    *   c.\n\n【89】        _Calcium channel blocker therapy_\n\n【90】    *   d.\n\n【91】        _Long-acting nitrate therapy_\n\n【92】    *   e.\n\n【93】        _Surgical supra-arterial myotomy_\n\n【94】Although earlier reports suggested that a myocardial bridge segment was incompatible with concomitant atherosclerotic coronary disease, recent investigations have shown that they may occur simultaneously. Coronary angioplasty has been used successfully to achieve revascularization in coronary arteries affected by both myocardial bridging and atherosclerotic disease, especially when a stent is used to prevent systolic compression of the bridged segment. β-Adrenergic blocking agents have been the medical treatment of choice for affected patients. These drugs decrease heart rate, which increases the time for diastolic filling and ensures vessel patency. They also decrease the systolic phase, which would be expected to decrease the duration of symptoms because the bridge causes obstruction only during systole. Although β-blocking drugs may aggravate coronary spasm, they would still be an appropriate choice for this patient. Calcium channel blockers have also been effective in relieving anginal symptoms. These agents have the added benefit of treating vasospasm, which has been implicated as a cause of symptoms associated with myocardial bridging.\n\n【95】Long-acting nitrates, an effective treatment for coronary spasm, may cause vasodilation in nonbridged segments of coronary arteries while having no effect on the intramyocardial bridged segment. This may actually increase the degree of obstruction related to the bridge and cause angina with exertion; thus, these agents are not appropriate for our patient. Short-acting nitrates used as needed for episodes of pain are a more reasonable alternative to long-acting nitrate therapy, especially when episodic spasm is the mechanism implicated as the cause of pain. Treatment with supraarterial decompression myotomy has been successful in medically refractory cases.\n\n【96】*   Cohen HM\n*   Juska J\n*   Kleiman JH\n\n【97】PTCA of complex atherosclerotic lesion at site of LAD myocardial bridging.\n\n【98】无关删除-2_Cathet Cardiovasc Diagn._ 1996; 37 : 272-276\n\n【99】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (6)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【100】*   Tauth J\n*   Sullebarger T\n\n【101】Myocardial infarction associated with myocardial bridging: case history and review of the literature.\n\n【102】无关删除-2_Cathet Cardiovasc Diagn._ 1997; 40 : 364-367\n\n【103】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (105)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【104】Because of the dynamic nature of the angina and the documented ST-segment elevation suggesting spasm, the calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate was added to the patient's other medications.

It's not high enough to be considered type 2 diabetes yet. But without lifestyle changes, adults and children with prediabetes are at high risk to develop type 2 diabetes.\n\n【2】If you have prediabetes, the long-term damage of diabetes — especially to your heart, blood vessels and kidneys — may already be starting. There's good news, however. Progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes isn't inevitable.\n\n【3】Eating healthy foods, making physical activity part of your daily routine and staying at a healthy weight can help bring your blood sugar level back to normal. The same lifestyle changes that can help prevent type 2 diabetes in adults might also help bring children's blood sugar levels back to normal.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Prediabetes doesn't usually have any signs or symptoms.\n\n【6】One possible sign of prediabetes is darkened skin on certain parts of the body. Affected areas can include the neck, armpits and groin.\n\n【7】Classic signs and symptoms that suggest you've moved from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes include:\n\n【8】*   Increased thirst\n*   Frequent urination\n*   Increased hunger\n*   Fatigue\n*   Blurred vision\n*   Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands\n*   Frequent infections\n*   Slow-healing sores\n*   Unintended weight loss\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】See your health care provider if you're concerned about diabetes or if you notice any type 2 diabetes signs or symptoms. Ask your health care provider about blood sugar screening if you have any risk factors for diabetes.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】The exact cause of prediabetes is unknown. But family history and genetics appear to play an important role. What is clear is that people with prediabetes don't process sugar (glucose) properly anymore.\n\n【13】Most of the glucose in your body comes from the food you eat. When food is digested, sugar enters your bloodstream. Insulin allows sugar to enter your cells — and lowers the amount of sugar in your blood.\n\n【14】Insulin is produced by a gland located behind the stomach called the pancreas. Your pancreas sends insulin to your blood when you eat. When your blood sugar level starts to drop, the pancreas slows down the secretion of insulin into the blood.\n\n【15】When you have prediabetes, this process doesn't work as well. As a result, instead of fueling your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. This can happen because:\n\n【16】*   Your pancreas may not make enough insulin\n*   Your cells become resistant to insulin and don't allow as much sugar in\n\n【17】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【18】The same factors that increase the odds of getting type 2 diabetes also increase the risk of prediabetes. These factors include:\n\n【19】*   **Weight.** Being overweight is a primary risk factor for prediabetes. The more fatty tissue you have — especially inside and between the muscle and skin around your abdomen — the more resistant your cells become to insulin.\n*   **Waist size.** A large waist size can indicate insulin resistance. The risk of insulin resistance goes up for men with waists larger than 40 inches and for women with waists larger than 35 inches.\n*   **Diet.** Eating red meat and processed meat, and drinking sugar-sweetened beverages, is associated with a higher risk of prediabetes.\n*   **Inactivity.** The less active you are, the greater your risk of prediabetes.\n*   **Age.** Although diabetes can develop at any age, the risk of prediabetes increases after age 35.\n*   **Family history.** Your risk of prediabetes increases if you have a parent or sibling with type 2 diabetes.\n*   **Race or ethnicity.** Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are more likely to develop prediabetes.\n*   **Gestational diabetes.** If you had diabetes while pregnant (gestational diabetes), you and your child are at higher risk of developing prediabetes.\n*   **Polycystic ovary syndrome.** Women with this common condition — characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — have a higher risk of prediabetes.\n*   **Sleep.** People with obstructive sleep apnea — a condition that disrupts sleep repeatedly — have an increased risk of insulin resistance. People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea.\n*   **Tobacco smoke.** Smoking may increase insulin resistance and can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes. Smoking also increases your risk of complications from diabetes.\n\n【20】Other conditions associated with an increased risk of prediabetes include:\n\n【21】*   High blood pressure\n*   Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the \"good\" cholesterol\n*   High levels of triglycerides — a type of fat in your blood\n\n【22】### Metabolic syndrome\n\n【23】When certain conditions occur with obesity, they are associated with insulin resistance, and can increase your risk for diabetes — and heart disease and stroke. A combination of three or more of these conditions is often called metabolic syndrome:\n\n【24】*   High blood pressure\n*   Low levels of HDL\n*   High triglycerides\n*   High blood sugar levels\n*   Large waist size\n\n【25】Complications\n-------------\n\n【26】Prediabetes has been linked with long-term damage, including to your heart, blood vessels and kidneys, even if you haven't progressed to type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes is also linked to unrecognized (silent) heart attacks.\n\n【27】Prediabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes, which can lead to:\n\n【28】*   High blood pressure\n*   High cholesterol\n*   Heart disease\n*   Stroke\n*   Kidney disease\n*   Nerve damage\n*   Fatty liver disease\n*   Eye damage, including loss of vision\n*   Amputations\n\n【29】Prevention\n----------\n\n【30】Healthy lifestyle choices can help you prevent prediabetes and its progression to type 2 diabetes — even if diabetes runs in your family. These include:\n\n【31】*   Eating healthy foods\n*   Getting active\n*   Losing excess weight\n*   Controlling your blood pressure and cholesterol\n*   Not smoking\n\n【32】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "dd03818a-a489-4f7f-85ca-0ab1f4be6614", "title": "Genetic testing", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Genetic testing involves examining your DNA, the chemical database that carries instructions for your body's functions. Genetic testing can reveal changes (mutations) in your genes that may cause illness or disease.\n\n【2】Although genetic testing can provide important information for diagnosing, treating and preventing illness, there are limitations. For example, if you're a healthy person, a positive result from genetic testing doesn't always mean you will develop a disease. On the other hand, in some situations, a negative result doesn't guarantee that you won't have a certain disorder.\n\n【3】Talking to your doctor, a medical geneticist or a genetic counselor about what you will do with the results is an important step in the process of genetic testing.\n\n【4】### Genome sequencing\n\n【5】When genetic testing doesn't lead to a diagnosis but a genetic cause is still suspected, some facilities offer genome sequencing — a process for analyzing a sample of DNA taken from your blood.\n\n【6】Everyone has a unique genome, made up of the DNA in all of a person's genes. This complex testing can help identify genetic variants that may relate to your health. This testing is usually limited to just looking at the protein-encoding parts of DNA called the exome.\n\n【7】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【8】Genetic testing plays a vital role in determining the risk of developing certain diseases as well as screening and sometimes medical treatment. Different types of genetic testing are done for different reasons:\n\n【9】*   **Diagnostic testing.** If you have symptoms of a disease that may be caused by genetic changes, sometimes called mutated genes, genetic testing can reveal if you have the suspected disorder. For example, genetic testing may be used to confirm a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease.\n*   **Presymptomatic and predictive testing.** If you have a family history of a genetic condition, getting genetic testing before you have symptoms may show if you're at risk of developing that condition. For example, this type of test may be useful for identifying your risk of certain types of colorectal cancer.\n*   **Carrier testing.** If you have a family history of a genetic disorder — such as sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis — or you're in an ethnic group that has a high risk of a specific genetic disorder, you may choose to have genetic testing before having children. An expanded carrier screening test can detect genes associated with a wide variety of genetic diseases and mutations and can identify if you and your partner are carriers for the same conditions.\n*   **Pharmacogenetics.** If you have a particular health condition or disease, this type of genetic testing may help determine what medication and dosage will be most effective and beneficial for you.\n*   **Prenatal testing.** If you're pregnant, tests can detect some types of abnormalities in your baby's genes. Down syndrome and trisomy 18 syndrome are two genetic disorders that are often screened for as part of prenatal genetic testing. Traditionally this is done looking at markers in blood or by invasive testing such as amniocentesis. Newer testing called cell-free DNA testing looks at a baby's DNA via a blood test done on the mother.\n*   **Newborn screening.** This is the most common type of genetic testing. In the United States, all states require that newborns be tested for certain genetic and metabolic abnormalities that cause specific conditions. This type of genetic testing is important because if results show there's a disorder such as congenital hypothyroidism, sickle cell disease or phenylketonuria (PKU), care and treatment can begin right away.\n*   **Preimplantation testing.** Also called preimplantation genetic diagnosis, this test may be used when you attempt to conceive a child through in vitro fertilization. The embryos are screened for genetic abnormalities. Embryos without abnormalities are implanted in the uterus in hopes of achieving pregnancy\n\n【10】Risks\n-----\n\n【11】Generally genetic tests have little physical risk. Blood and cheek swab tests have almost no risk. However, prenatal testing such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling has a small risk of pregnancy loss (miscarriage).\n\n【12】Genetic testing can have emotional, social and financial risks as well. Discuss all risks and benefits of genetic testing with your doctor, a medical geneticist or a genetic counselor before you have a genetic test.\n\n【13】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【14】Before you have genetic testing, gather as much information as you can about your family's medical history. Then, talk with your doctor or a genetic counselor about your personal and family medical history to better understand your risk. Ask questions and discuss any concerns about genetic testing at that meeting. Also, talk about your options, depending on the test results.\n\n【15】If you're being tested for a genetic disorder that runs in families, you may want to consider discussing your decision to have genetic testing with your family. Having these conversations before testing can give you a sense of how your family might respond to your test results and how it may affect them.\n\n【16】Not all health insurance policies pay for genetic testing. So, before you have a genetic test, check with your insurance provider to see what will be covered.\n\n【17】In the United States, the federal Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) helps prevent health insurers or employers from discriminating against you based on test results. Under GINA, employment discrimination based on genetic risk also is illegal. However, this act does not cover life, long-term care or disability insurance. Most states offer additional protection.\n\n【18】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【19】Depending on the type of test, a sample of your blood, skin, amniotic fluid or other tissue will be collected and sent to a lab for analysis.\n\n【20】*   **Blood sample.** A member of your health care team takes the sample by inserting a needle into a vein in your arm. For newborn screening tests, a blood sample is taken by pricking your baby's heel.\n*   **Cheek swab.** For some tests, a swab sample from the inside of your cheek is collected for genetic testing.\n*   **Amniocentesis.** In this prenatal genetic test, your doctor inserts a thin, hollow needle through your abdominal wall and into your uterus to collect a small amount of amniotic fluid for testing.\n*   **Chorionic villus sampling.** For this prenatal genetic test, your doctor takes a tissue sample from the placenta. Depending on your situation, the sample may be taken with a tube (catheter) through your cervix or through your abdominal wall and uterus using a thin needle.\n\n【21】Results\n-------\n\n【22】The amount of time it takes for you to receive your genetic test results depends on the type of test and your health care facility. Talk to your doctor, medical geneticist or genetic counselor before the test about when you can expect the results and have a discussion about them.\n\n【23】### Positive results\n\n【24】If the genetic test result is positive, that means the genetic change that was being tested for was detected. The steps you take after you receive a positive result will depend on the reason you had genetic testing.\n\n【25】If the purpose is to:\n\n【26】*   **Diagnose a specific disease or condition,** a positive result will help you and your doctor determine the right treatment and management plan.\n*   **Find out if you are carrying a gene that could cause disease in your child,** and the test is positive, your doctor, medical geneticist or a genetic counselor can help you determine your child's risk of actually developing the disease. The test results can also provide information to consider as you and your partner make family planning decisions.\n*   **Determine if you might develop a certain disease,** a positive test doesn't necessarily mean you'll get that disorder. For example, having a breast cancer gene (_BRCA1_ or _BRCA2_) means you're at high risk of developing breast cancer at some point in your life, but it doesn't indicate with certainty that you'll get breast cancer. However, with some conditions, such as Huntington's disease, having the altered gene does indicate that the disease will eventually develop.\n\n【27】Talk to your doctor about what a positive result means for you. In some cases, you can make lifestyle changes that may reduce your risk of developing a disease, even if you have a gene that makes you more susceptible to a disorder. Results may also help you make choices related to treatment, family planning, careers and insurance coverage.\n\n【28】In addition, you may choose to participate in research or registries related to your genetic disorder or condition. These options may help you stay updated with new developments in prevention or treatment.\n\n【29】### Negative results\n\n【30】A negative result means a mutated gene was not detected by the test, which can be reassuring, but it's not a 100 percent guarantee that you don't have the disorder. The accuracy of genetic tests to detect mutated genes varies, depending on the condition being tested for and whether or not the gene mutation was previously identified in a family member.\n\n【31】Even if you don't have the mutated gene, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll never get the disease. For example, the majority of people who develop breast cancer don't have a breast cancer gene (_BRCA1_ or _BRCA2_). Also, genetic testing may not be able to detect all genetic defects.\n\n【32】### Inconclusive results\n\n【33】In some cases, a genetic test may not provide helpful information about the gene in question. Everyone has variations in the way genes appear, and often these variations don't affect your health. But sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between a disease-causing gene and a harmless gene variation. These changes are called variants of uncertain significance. In these situations, follow-up testing or periodic reviews of the gene over time may be necessary.\n\n【34】### Genetic counseling\n\n【35】No matter what the results of your genetic testing, talk with your doctor, medical geneticist or genetic counselor about questions or concerns you may have. This will help you understand what the results mean for you and your family.\n\n【36】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

They show that 2 proteins that are highly expressed by renal cell carcinoma, the water-channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1) and the lipid droplet–associated protein adipophilin (ADFP), are significantly more abundant in urine samples from patients with renal cell carcinomas than in control participants.\n\n【6】Very few tumor markers are both organ and malignancy specific. For example, the carcinoembryonic antigen level can be elevated in patients with carcinomas from a variety of organs, including colon, pancreas, stomach, lung, and breast, in addition to inflammatory conditions that affect those organs, and may be increased in some healthy individuals. Markers that appear to be organ specific, such as prostate-specific antigen and thyroglobulin, can be elevated in both benign and malignant conditions. Thus, tumor markers have not gained widespread acceptance in screening. They appear to have the most utility as diagnostic adjuncts, as prognostic indicators, and in following up patients.\n\n【7】By these accounts, AQP1 and ADFP seem unlikely tumor marker candidates. Although both proteins are expressed at relatively high levels in the kidney, they are also expressed almost ubiquitously throughout the rest of the human body, albeit at lower levels, a finding that does not bode well for a high degree of organ specificity. Moreover, by the nature of their relatively high expression in proximal renal tubular epithelium, they seem ill-suited to distinguish normal tubular epithelium from its transformed cancerous counterpart.\n\n【8】However, the nature of the analyte, urine, and the biology of renal epithelium tilt the balance in favor of these markers. Urine contains very low concentrations of circulating proteins in the absence of renal disease. In addition, neither AQP1 nor ADFP is a secreted protein. Aquaporin-1 is a membrane protein, and ADFP is an intracellular protein associated with lipid droplets. Therefore, AQP1 or ADFP found in urine can be expected to originate from epithelium facing the filtrate side, rather than the blood side, of the nephron. Within the nephron, concentrations are highest in the proximal tubules. Thus, with urine testing, AQP1 and ADFP not only are organ specific for the kidney but also are localized to the structures that give rise to most renal cell carcinomas.\n\n【9】*   Marples D\n*   Frøkiaer J\n*   Nielsen S\n\n【10】Long-term regulation of aquaporins in the kidney.\n\n【11】_Am J Physiol._ 1999; 276 : F331-F339\n\n【12】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【13】*   Heid HW\n*   Moll R\n*   Schwetlick I\n*   Rackwitz HR\n*   Keenan TW\n\n【14】Adipophilin is a specific marker of lipid accumulation in diverse cell types and diseases.\n\n【15】无关删除-2_Cell Tissue Res._ 1998; 294 : 309-321\n\n【16】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (365)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【17】*   Verkman AS\n\n【18】Aquaporins: translating bench research to human disease.\n\n【19】无关删除-2_J Exp Biol._ 2009; 212 : 1707-1715\n\n【20】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (124)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【21】In addition, AQP1 and ADFP are greatly overexpressed in renal cell carcinomas compared with normal tubules, albeit more so in clear cell carcinomas than in the papillary morphotype.\n\n【22】*   Mazal PR\n*   Stichenwirth M\n*   Koller A\n*   Blach S\n*   Haitel A\n*   Susani M\n\n【23】Expression of aquaporins and PAX-2 compared to CD10 and cytokeratin 7 in renal neoplasms: a tissue microarray study.\n\n【24】无关删除-2_Mod Pathol._ 2005; 18 : 535-540\n\n【25】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (124)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【26】*   Yao M\n*   Huang Y\n*   Shioi K\n*   et al.\n\n【27】Expression of adipose differentiation-related protein: a predictor of cancer-specific survival in clear cell renal carcinoma.\n\n【28】无关删除-2_Clin Cancer Res._ 2007; 13 : 152-160\n\n【29】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (63)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【30】*   Verkman AS\n*   Hara-Chikuma M\n*   Papadopoulos MC\n\n【31】Aquaporins—new players in cancer biology.\n\n【32】无关删除-2_J Mol Med._ 2008; 86 : 523-529\n\n【33】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (287)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【34】The diagnostic feature that has given rise to the term _clear cell carcinoma_ is in fact caused by lipid droplet accumulation within the tumor cells, all of which contain copious amounts of ADFP. Cancer cell shedding alone might consequently be expected to elevate urinary AQP1 and ADFP concentrations, but many cells cast off significant numbers of exosomes during their life cycle. These 50- to 90-nm diameter vesicles allow cells to selectively shed certain membrane portions, which can serve a role in cell-to-cell nutrient transport, signaling, and even exchange of nucleic acids and pathogens, as well as allowing selective export of lipids, proteins, peptides, cytokines, and various cellular structures and components.\n\n【35】*   Théry C\n*   Zitvogel L\n*   Amigorena S\n\n【36】Exosomes: composition, biogenesis and function.\n\n【37】无关删除-2_Nat Rev Immunol._ 2002; 2 : 569-579\n\n【38】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (3890)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【39】Renal cell carcinomas have been found to shed particularly high numbers of exosomes.\n\n【40】*   Sonoda H\n*   Yokota-Ikeda N\n*   Oshikawa S\n*   et al.\n\n【41】Decreased abundance of urinary exosomal aquaporin-1 in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.\n\n【42】_Am J Physiol Renal Physiol._ 2009; 297 : F1006-F1016\n\n【43】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (115)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【44】It seems plausible—and proven in the case of AQP1—that these exosomes contain AQP1 and ADFP.\n\n【45】Thus, AQP1 and ADFP in urine might make surprisingly good candidate tumor markers for the main renal cell carcinoma subtypes, and the study by Morrissey et al seems to support this notion. Their article is, of course, inconclusive. Like most proof-of-principle studies, there are omissions, primarily inadequate control groups and lack of independent verification of the findings in a second patient cohort. The comparison groups consisted of healthy volunteers and patients undergoing surgery for a variety of reasons unrelated to any renal pathology, whereas the patient group was highly preselected and thereby enriched for patients with a high likelihood of having a renal cell carcinoma. Indeed, 33 of the 42 patients had a renal cell carcinoma. Such extreme contrasts between patients and controls often favor overoptimistic estimates of the diagnostic utility of a test. It is easy to imagine that a variety of nonmalignant tubular disorders might lead to excessive shedding of normal tubular epithelium, which could elevate urinary AQP1 and ADFP levels. Similarly, renal expression levels of these proteins might differ from their average healthy state in a variety of different physiologic and pathophysiologic states. For example, tubular expression and levels of urinary excretion of AQP2 vary 5- to 6-fold depending on the hydration state of a person.\n\n【46】*   Esteva-Font C\n*   Baccaro ME\n*   Fernandez-Llama P\n*   et al.\n\n【47】Aquaporin-1 and Aquaporin-2 urinary excretion in cirrhosis: relationship with ascites and hepatorenal syndrome.\n\n【48】无关删除-2_Hepatology._ 2006; 44 : 1555-1563\n\n【49】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (42)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【50】Granted, unlike AQP1, AQP2 is regulated by antidiuretic hormone, but this still illustrates the point that a good deal more work needs to be done, both in healthy volunteers under different conditions and in patients with a variety of illnesses of the kidneys, heart, and liver.\n\n【51】In contrast, it seems irrefutable that the patients with tumors had much higher urine concentrations of AQP1 and ADFP, and that these were most likely caused by the tumors, as levels declined profoundly after treatment. Thus, the proof of principle is there, and performing further studies seems worthwhile, and, ultimately, if such studies are promising, a prospective, blinded validation study should be performed. However, with that strategy, converting the assay to a different format will be necessary. Western blot analysis is too slow, costly, and technically demanding for large-scale studies or routine clinical diagnosis. Moreover, at best it is a semiquantitative method and cannot easily be standardized across different laboratories. Therefore, converting the assay to a solution-based, quantitative immunoassay seems prudent. Unfortunately, this task could be more difficult than one might imagine. Membrane proteins and lipid-associated proteins are often difficult to solubilize, which could impede antibody development, creation of control and calibration materials, and antigen retrieval from urine.\n\n【52】Morrissey et al raise the possibility of population screening for renal cell carcinoma—a bit of a stretch with a pilot study but an interesting idea. Would the potential reward, a test for screening and early detection, diagnosis, and follow-up of renal cell carcinoma, be worth the efforts and costs? Surgical intervention appears to be still needed because these markers, even in this small number of cases evaluated, identified only 2 types of renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, some benign renal tumors may need surgical intervention for reasons unrelated to malignancy. In contrast, if the test were to be applied as a tool for population screening, similar to prostate-specific antigen screening or fecal occult blood testing, there is a high likelihood this would result in earlier diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. Incidence rates of renal cell carcinoma have risen during the past 40 years, paralleling the use of imaging modalities and incidental discoveries of kidney cancers. The size of tumors has decreased, and mortality from renal cell carcinoma increases at only one-third the rate that the number of new cases is growing.\n\n【53】*   Pantuck AJ\n*   Zisman A\n*   Belldegrun AS\n\n【54】The changing natural history of renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【55】无关删除-2_J Urol._ 2001; 166 : 1611-1623\n\n【56】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【57】It remains unclear whether the increasing discrepancy between incidence rates and mortality rates in screened populations reflects an actual survival benefit for patients or an increasing proportion of biologically indolent cases that might never have caused clinical disease. Precedent for this has been suggested in thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, and, to a lesser degree, breast cancer, all of which have seen increasing case numbers with no equal increase in relative mortality during the past few decades, as screening has been applied to their detection.\n\n【58】*   Davies L\n*   Welch HG\n\n【59】Increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States, 1973-2002.\n\n【60】无关删除-2_JAMA._ 2006; 295 : 2164-2167\n\n【61】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2724)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【62】*   Esserman L\n*   Shieh Y\n*   Thompson I\n\n【63】Rethinking screening for breast cancer and prostate cancer.\n\n【64】无关删除-2_JAMA._ 2009; 302 : 1685-1692\n\n【65】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (443)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【66】The evidence in these tumors indicates that some of the tumors found by screening may be indolent, and some patients might not have benefited from early detection. The other major questions would be at which age screening should start and how frequently screening should be done to identify renal cell carcinomas at an early enough stage. What would the negative and positive predictive values of this test be when applied to population screening, given the low incidence rates of renal cell carcinoma, and how much would it cost? This type of testing may prove too expensive for population-based testing, but it may have utility in screening high-risk populations, such as those with familial kidney cancer predisposition, or as an adjunct in evaluation of an incidentally discovered renal mass.\n\n【67】Therefore, we hope that Morrissey et al or other investigators will extend their studies in the manner suggested in this editorial, to define whether this test can fulfill the early promise that it shows.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Interaction terms were fitted in survival models to estimate the risk of both outcomes across levels of an overall microvascular disease score (range 0 to 100) and its individual components: diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】During a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, 1685 primary outcomes and 1806 deaths occurred in 9405 participants. The outcome-specific microvascular score was ≤30 in 97.9% of subjects for the primary outcome and in 98.5% for death. For participants with scores of 0 and 30, respectively, the 10-year absolute risk difference between intensive glucose control and standard treatment ranged from −0.8% (95% CI, −2.6, 1.1) to −3.0% −7.1, 1.1) for the primary outcome and from −0.5% (−2.1, 1.1) to 0.7% (−4.2, 5.6) for mortality. Retinopathy was associated with the largest effects, with a 10-year absolute risk difference of −6.5% (−11.1 to −2.0) for the primary outcome and −3.9% (−7.8 to 0.1) for mortality.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】This hypothesis-generating study identifies diabetic retinopathy as predictor of the beneficial effect of intensive glucose control on the risk of cardiovascular disease and possibly death.

{"seq_id": "9c5e8e46-7a24-4aa3-b101-268f653725a2", "title": "In the Limelight: April 2022", "text": "【0】In the Limelight: April 2022\nThis month’s feature highlights three articles that appear in the current issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ . These articles are also featured on the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings’_ YouTube Channel ( https://youtu.be/sib6Lj37z6M ).\n\n【1】The Costliness of Discontinuous Care\n------------------------------------\n\n【2】Continuity of care is beneficial in a multitude of ways that include improved patient well-being and outcomes, lower rates of emergency room visits and hospitalization, greater patient compliance with prescribed therapies and management, greater patient contentment with and approval of their care, lower mortality, and reduced medical care costs. Continuity of care has an impact even in hospitalized patients in whom outcomes may be better when patient care is provided by hospitalists with a more continuous work schedule (Goodwin JS, Continuity of care matters in all health care settings. JAMA Network Open 4(3):e213842,2021). Continuity of care may be disrupted by several factors including physician turnover, and in the present issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , Sinsky et al assessed the health care cost imposed by physician turnover. Drawing upon data from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile, published information regarding Medicare patients, and estimates for non-Medicare patients, these authors determined that health care costs ascribed to primary care physician turnover approximated $90,000 in the first year a primary care physician left practice, with total annual excess health care costs from such turnover approximating $1 billion in the first year; health care costs from physician turnover specifically caused by burnout exceeded 25% of the total annual excess health care costs. The disruption of continuous care thus not only deprives patients of the benefits that accrue from continuous care, but also imposes a substantial financial burden on the health care system. Why health care costs are less with continuous care is an important question, and one discussed by Sinsky et al; a plausible proffered explanation resides in that sense of trust engendered by, and which subsequently informs, a long-term engagement between patients and their physicians. Trust-based partnerships are cornerstones in health care services for a number of altruistic, mission-based, and compelling reasons, as brilliantly discussed by Berry et al last year (Berry LL, Awdish RLA, Letchuman S, Steffensen KD. Trust-based partnerships are essential — and achievable — in health care service. _Mayo Clin Proc. 2021;_ 96(7):1896–1906 _)_ . Trust between patients and their physicians, as engendered by continuous care, likely influences diagnostic evaluation, referrals, management, hospital admission, and other aspects of patient care such that health care costs are inherently less. With physician turnover, and a trust-based relationship still to be developed with a new physician, health care costs attendantly increase. Physician turnover, especially due to burnout, are addressable issues in current attempts to curtail the continuous increase in US health care costs.\n\n【3】Sinsky CA, Shanafelt TD, Dyrbye LN, Sabety AH, Carlasare LE, West CO. Health care expenditures attributable to primary care physician overall and burnout-related turnover: a cross-sectional analysis. _Mayo Clin Proc._ 2022;97(4):693-702.\n\n【4】Predicting the Progression to Type 2 Diabetes and the Need for Intervention\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Prediabetes occurs in approximately one third of the US population, and either lifestyle modification or pharmacotherapy may interrupt its progression to type 2 diabetes. Kent et al describe an electronic health record (EHR)-compatible model that assesses the individual risk for diabetes and how such an assessment may aid in deciding where preventive interventions may be especially warranted. As discussed by Kent et al, their study was predicated on the following considerations. First, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Study clearly established the efficacy of either lifestyle modification or metformin in reducing the risk of occurrence of type 2 diabetes (Knowler WC et al, Reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle interventions or metformin. _NEJM._ 2002;346(6):393-403). However, the risk of occurrence of type 2 diabetes varies markedly in prediabetic subjects. Uncertainty thus surrounds which patients would benefit from preventive interventions, the latter less likely to be valuable in low-risk patients. Second, there are relevant issues as regards preventive interventions: intensive lifestyle modifications require health care resources and patient compliance, while the use of metformin may be attended by significant side effects. Third, extrapolation of findings from randomized clinical trials to patients in the “real world” may be challenged by heterogeneity in this patient population and in their response to treatment. Kent et al used the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (OLDW) observational database to develop and validate a risk prediction model based on 11 variables (age, sex, race, smoking, BMI, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and HgbA1c); the predicted 3-year rates for diabetes faithfully correlated with observed rates. The OLDW model was then applied to the DPP data, with the following notable results: The effect of lifestyle modification was comparable across all risk groups on the relative scale, whereas the treatment effect of metformin increased as risk increased; the 3-year predicted risk of developing diabetes was 9.0%, 6.0%, and 3.9% for usual care, metformin therapy, and lifestyle modification, respectively; and either lifestyle modification or metformin prevented more than 50% or 70%, respectively, of preventable diabetic cases in the highest risk quartile of patients. This analysis and modeling by Kent et al are important and timely, especially as they culminated in a valuable EHR-compatible tool. This SMART app automatically predicts individual risk for type 2 diabetes; it identifies those high-risk patients for whom preventive intervention would likely interrupt the development of type 2 diabetes; and it promotes shared decision making with prediabetic patients regarding the prudent course of their management.\n\n【6】Kent DM, Nelson J, Pittas A, et al. An electronic health record-compatible model to predict personalized treatment effects from the diabetes prevention program: a cross-evidence synthesis approach using clinical trial and real-world data. _Mayo Clin Proc._ 2022;97(4):703-715.\n\n【7】Vigorous Physical Activity and the Risk of Primary Cardiac Arrest\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The health benefits of physical activity are indisputable and diverse, ranging widely from reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality to salutary effects on irritable bowel disease and depression. However, still to be fully resolved are such issues as the level of physical activity that exerts the optimal beneficial effects, the nature of the relationship between health benefits and a graded increase in physical activity, and the clearly troubling one whether too much physical activity may prove damaging, indeed, fatal. As regards the latter, vigorous physical activity has been linked, albeit relatively rarely, to sudden cardiac arrest. The study by Jin et al addresses such issues using primary cardiac arrest (PCA) as the primary outcome. These authors utilized the Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort database; this database includes a National Health Screening dataset that compiled data on questionnaire-derived physical activity. Physical activity was estimated as a metabolic equivalent task (MET) and ranked as 7 levels of increasing activity (MET-hour/week) that reflected multiples of the World Health Organization (WHO) and United States recommended minimum physical activity/week (7.5 MET-hour/week or 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity or 75 minutes/week of vigorous intensity). The data obtained from more than a half million participants in this screening program from 2009 to 2014 demonstrate the following key findings: 1) Compared with inactivity, physical activity was associated with less PCA, with beneficial effects discerned at levels of physical activity below the recommended minimum of 7.5 MET-hour/week and at all seven levels of activity, including physical activity greater than 37.5 MET-hour/week; 2) These associations generally held true, irrespective of age, sex, BMI, and relevant comorbidities; 3) Maximal benefit was observed with physical activity in the range of 15.0 to <22.5 MET-hour/week; 4) PCA was not increased when physical activity was ≥ 37.5 MET-hour/week, irrespective of lifestyle risk factors or cardiovascular disease and 5) Increased physical activity associated with diminished all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. These findings are important and reassuring because they underscore the beneficial effects of physical activity and they demonstrate that the highest levels of physical activity in this study were not associated with an increased risk for PCA.\n\n【9】Jin M-N, Yang P-S, Yu HT, et al.

{"seq_id": "3e30a9c9-861a-4fd9-9082-dca3b88a4038", "title": "Osteosarcoma", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that begins in the cells that form bones. Osteosarcoma is most often found in the long bones — more often the legs, but sometimes the arms — but it can start in any bone. In very rare instances, it occurs in soft tissue outside the bone.\n\n【2】Osteosarcoma tends to occur in teenagers and young adults, but it can also occur in younger children and older adults.\n\n【3】Treatment usually involves chemotherapy, surgery and, sometimes, radiation therapy. Doctors select treatment options based on where the osteosarcoma starts, the size of the cancer, the type and grade of the osteosarcoma, and whether the cancer has spread beyond the bone.\n\n【4】Treatment innovations for osteosarcoma have greatly improved the outlook (prognosis) for this cancer over the years. After completion of treatment, lifelong monitoring is recommended to watch for potential late effects of intense treatments.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Signs and symptoms of osteosarcoma may include, among others:\n\n【7】*   Swelling near a bone\n*   Bone or joint pain\n*   Bone injury or bone break for no clear reason\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】Make an appointment with your child's doctor if your child has any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you. Osteosarcoma symptoms are similar to many more-common conditions, such as sports injuries, so your doctor may investigate those causes first.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】It's not clear what causes osteosarcoma. Doctors know this cancer forms when something goes wrong in one of the cells that are responsible for making new bone.\n\n【12】Osteosarcoma begins when a healthy bone cell develops changes in its DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes tell the cell to start making new bone when it isn't needed. The result is a mass (tumor) of poorly formed bone cells that can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. Cells can break away and spread (metastasize) throughout the body.\n\n【13】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【14】These factors increase the risk of osteosarcoma:\n\n【15】*   Previous treatment with radiation therapy\n*   Other bone disorders, such as Paget's disease of bone and fibrous dysplasia\n*   Certain inherited or genetic conditions, including hereditary retinoblastoma, Bloom syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome and Werner syndrome\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】Complications of osteosarcoma and its treatment include:\n\n【18】*   **Cancer that spreads (metastasizes).** Osteosarcoma can spread from where it started to other areas, making treatment and recovery more difficult. Osteosarcoma that spreads most often spreads to the lungs and to other bones.\n*   **Adapting to limb amputation.** Surgery that removes the tumor and spares the limb is used whenever possible. But sometimes it's necessary to remove part of the affected limb in order to remove all of the cancer. Learning to use an artificial limb (prosthesis) will take time, practice and patience. Experts can help you adapt.\n*   **Long-term treatment side effects.** The aggressive chemotherapy needed to control osteosarcoma can cause substantial side effects, both in the short and long term. Your health care team can help you manage the side effects that happen during treatment and provide you with a list of side effects to watch for in the years after treatment.\n\n【19】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "76f428df-ebb1-4885-acee-8d67d7afcada", "title": "Bone marrow transplant", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】A bone marrow transplant is a procedure that infuses healthy blood-forming stem cells into your body to replace bone marrow that's not producing enough healthy blood cells. A bone marrow transplant is also called a stem cell transplant.\n\n【2】You might need a bone marrow transplant if your bone marrow stops working and does not produce enough healthy blood cells.\n\n【3】Bone marrow transplants may use cells from your own body (autologous transplant) or from a donor (allogeneic transplant).\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】A bone marrow transplant may be used to:\n\n【6】*   Safely allow treatment with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation by replacing or rescuing the bone marrow damaged by the treatment\n*   Replace bone marrow that's not working properly with new stem cells\n*   Provide new stem cells, which can help kill cancer cells directly\n\n【7】Bone marrow transplants can benefit people with a variety of both cancerous and noncancerous diseases, including:\n\n【8】*   Acute leukemia\n*   Adrenoleukodystrophy\n*   Aplastic anemia\n*   Bone marrow failure syndromes\n*   Chronic leukemia\n*   Hemoglobinopathies\n*   Hodgkin's lymphoma\n*   Immune deficiencies\n*   Inborn errors of metabolism\n*   Multiple myeloma\n*   Myelodysplastic syndromes\n*   Neuroblastoma\n*   Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\n*   Plasma cell disorders\n*   POEMS syndrome\n*   Primary amyloidosis\n\n【9】Risks\n-----\n\n【10】A bone marrow transplant can pose numerous risks. Some people experience minimal problems with a bone marrow transplant, while others can have serious complications that require treatment or hospitalization. Sometimes complications are life-threatening.\n\n【11】Your risks depend on many factors, including the disease or condition that caused you to need a transplant, the type of transplant, your age and your overall health.\n\n【12】Possible complications from a bone marrow transplant include:\n\n【13】*   Graft-versus-host disease (a complication of allogeneic transplant only)\n*   Stem cell (graft) failure\n*   Organ damage\n*   Infections\n*   Cataracts\n*   Infertility\n*   New cancers\n*   Death\n\n【14】Your health care provider can explain your risk of complications from a bone marrow transplant. Together you can weigh the risks and benefits to decide whether a bone marrow transplant is right for you.\n\n【15】### Graft-versus-host disease: A potential risk when stem cells come from donors\n\n【16】If you receive a transplant that uses stem cells from a donor (allogeneic transplant), you may be at risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This condition occurs when the donor stem cells that make up your new immune system see your body's tissues and organs as something foreign and attack them.\n\n【17】GVHD may happen at any time after your transplant. Many people who have an allogeneic transplant get GVHD at some point. The risk of GVHD is greater if the stem cells come from an unrelated donor. But GVHD can happen to anyone who gets a bone marrow transplant from a donor.\n\n【18】There are two kinds of GVHD: acute and chronic. Acute GVHD usually happens during the first months after your transplant. It typically affects your skin, digestive tract or liver. Chronic GVHD typically develops later and can affect many organs.\n\n【19】Chronic GVHD signs and symptoms include:\n\n【20】*   Joint or muscle pain\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Persistent cough\n*   Vision changes, such as dry eyes\n*   Skin changes, including scarring under the skin or skin stiffness\n*   Rash\n*   Yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes\n*   Dry mouth\n*   Mouth sores\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Nausea\n*   Vomiting\n\n【21】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【22】### Pretransplant tests and procedures\n\n【23】A series of tests and procedures can assess your general health and the status of your condition. The tests and procedures also ensure that you're physically prepared for the transplant. The evaluation may take several days or more.\n\n【24】In addition, a long, thin tube (intravenous catheter) will be implanted into a large vein in your chest or neck. The catheter, often called a central line, usually remains in place for the duration of your treatment. Your transplant team will use the central line to infuse the transplanted stem cells, medications and blood products into your body.\n\n【25】### Collecting stem cells for autologous transplant\n\n【26】If a transplant using your own stem cells (autologous transplant) is planned, you'll undergo a procedure called apheresis (af-uh-REE-sis) to collect blood stem cells.\n\n【27】Before apheresis, you'll receive daily injections of growth factor to increase stem cell production and move stem cells into your circulating blood so that they can be collected.\n\n【28】During apheresis, blood is drawn from a vein and circulated through a machine. The machine separates your blood into different parts, including stem cells. These stem cells are collected and frozen for future use in the transplant. The remaining blood is returned to your body.\n\n【29】### Collecting stem cells for allogeneic transplant\n\n【30】If you're having a transplant using stem cells from a donor (allogeneic transplant), you'll need a donor. Once a donor is found, stem cells are gathered from that person for the transplant.\n\n【31】Stem cells can come from your donor's blood or bone marrow. Your transplant team decides which is better for you based on your situation.\n\n【32】Another type of allogeneic transplant uses stem cells from the blood of umbilical cords (cord blood transplant). Mothers can choose to donate umbilical cords after their babies' births. The blood from these cords is frozen and stored in a cord blood bank until needed for a bone marrow transplant.\n\n【33】### The conditioning process\n\n【34】After completing the pretransplant tests and procedures, you'll begin a process known as conditioning. During conditioning, you'll undergo chemotherapy and possibly radiation to:\n\n【35】*   Destroy cancer cells if you're being treated for cancer that may spread to other parts of the body\n*   Suppress your immune system\n*   Prepare your bone marrow for the new stem cells\n\n【36】The type of conditioning process you receive depends on several factors, including the disease being treated, your overall health and the type of transplant planned. You may have both chemotherapy and radiation or just one of these treatments as part of your conditioning treatment.\n\n【37】Side effects of the conditioning process can include:\n\n【38】*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Hair loss\n*   Mouth sores or ulcers\n*   Infection\n*   Bleeding\n*   Infertility or sterility\n*   Anemia\n*   Fatigue\n*   Cataracts\n*   Organ complications, such as heart, liver or lung failure\n\n【39】You may be able to take medications or other measures to reduce such side effects.\n\n【40】### Reduced-intensity conditioning\n\n【41】Based on your age and health history, you may receive lower doses or different types of chemotherapy or radiation for your conditioning treatment. This is called reduced-intensity conditioning.\n\n【42】Reduced-intensity conditioning kills some cancer cells and suppresses your immune system. Then, the donor's cells are infused into your body. Donor cells replace cells in your bone marrow over time. Immune factors in the donor cells may then fight your cancer cells.\n\n【43】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【44】### During your bone marrow transplant\n\n【45】Your bone marrow transplant occurs after you complete the conditioning process. On the day of your transplant, stem cells are infused into your body through your central line.\n\n【46】The transplant infusion is painless. You'll be awake during the procedure.\n\n【47】### After your bone marrow transplant\n\n【48】When the new stem cells enter your body, they travel through your blood to your bone marrow. In time, they multiply and begin to make new, healthy blood cells. This is called engraftment. It usually takes several weeks before the number of blood cells in your body starts to return to the standard range. In some people, it may take longer.\n\n【49】In the days and weeks after your bone marrow transplant, you'll have blood tests and other tests to monitor your condition. You may need medicine to manage complications, such as nausea and diarrhea.\n\n【50】After your bone marrow transplant, you'll remain under close medical care. If you're experiencing infections or other complications, you may need to stay in the hospital for several days or longer. Depending on the type of transplant and the risk of complications, you'll need to remain near the hospital for several weeks to months to allow close monitoring.\n\n【51】You may also need periodic transfusions of red blood cells and platelets until your bone marrow begins producing enough of those cells on its own.\n\n【52】You may be at greater risk of infections or other complications for months to years after your transplant. For the rest of your life, you'll meet regularly with your health care provider to check for late complications.\n\n【53】### Medications\n\n【54】If your bone marrow transplant is using stem cells from a donor (allogeneic transplant), you may take medications to help prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and reduce your immune system's reaction. These drugs are called immunosuppressive medications.\n\n【55】After your transplant, it takes time for your immune system to recover. During this time, you may be given medications to prevent infections.\n\n【56】### Diet and other lifestyle factors\n\n【57】After your bone marrow transplant, you may need to adjust your diet to stay healthy and to prevent excessive weight gain. Your nutrition specialist (dietitian) and other members of your transplant team will work with you to create a healthy-eating plan that meets your needs and complements your lifestyle. Your dietitian can also give you food suggestions to control side effects of chemotherapy and radiation, such as nausea.\n\n【58】Your dietitian can also give you food suggestions to control side effects of chemotherapy and radiation, such as nausea.\n\n【59】Some of your dietitian's recommendations may include:\n\n【60】*   Following food safety guidelines to prevent foodborne infections\n*   Eating a wide variety of healthy foods, including vegetables; fruits; whole grains; lean meats, poultry and fish; legumes; and healthy fats, such as olive oil\n*   Limiting salt intake\n*   Restricting alcohol\n*   Avoiding grapefruit and grapefruit juice due to their effect on a group of immunosuppressive medications\n\n【61】After your bone marrow transplant, regular physical activity helps you control your weight, strengthen your bones, increase your endurance, strengthen your muscles and keep your heart healthy. As you recover, you can slowly increase your physical activity.\n\n【62】Taking steps to prevent cancer is even more important after your transplant. Don't smoke. Wear sunscreen when you're outside, and be sure to get recommended cancer screenings.\n\n【63】Results\n-------\n\n【64】A bone marrow transplant can cure some diseases and put others into remission. Goals of a bone marrow transplant depend on your condition but usually include controlling or curing your disease, extending your life, and improving your quality of life.\n\n【65】Some people have few side effects and complications from a bone marrow transplant. Others may experience short- and long-term side effects and complications. It can be difficult to predict the severity of side effects and the success of the transplant.\n\n【66】It can be helpful to remember that there are many people who have transplants who also experienced some very difficult days during the transplant process. But, ultimately, they had successful transplants and have returned to typical activities with good quality of life.\n\n【67】Coping and Support\n------------------\n\n【68】Living with a bone marrow transplant or waiting for a bone marrow transplant can be difficult. It's typical to have fears and concerns.\n\n【69】Having support from your friends and family can be helpful. Also, you and your family may benefit from joining a support group of people who understand what you're going through and who can provide support.\n\n【70】Support groups offer a place for you and your family to share fears, concerns, difficulties and successes with people who have had similar experiences. You may meet people who have already had a transplant or who are waiting for a transplant.\n\n【71】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The most common signs and symptoms are stuffy nose and skin flushing.\n\n【2】Alcohol intolerance is caused by a genetic condition in which the body can't break down alcohol efficiently. The only way to prevent these uncomfortable reactions is to avoid alcohol.\n\n【3】Although not a true allergy, in some cases, what seems to be alcohol intolerance might be your reaction to something in an alcoholic beverage — such as chemicals, grains or preservatives. Combining alcohol with certain medications also can cause reactions.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of alcohol intolerance — or of a reaction to ingredients in an alcoholic beverage — can include:\n\n【6】*   Facial redness (flushing)\n*   Red, itchy skin bumps (hives)\n*   Worsening of pre-existing asthma\n*   Runny or stuffy nose\n*   Low blood pressure\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n\n【7】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【8】Having a mild intolerance to alcohol or something else in alcoholic beverages might not require a trip to a doctor. Simply avoid alcohol, limit how much you drink or avoid certain types of alcoholic beverages.\n\n【9】However, if you have a serious reaction or severe pain, see your doctor. Also, if your symptoms seem to be linked to an allergy or a medication you're taking, see your doctor.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Alcohol intolerance occurs when your body doesn't have the proper enzymes to break down (metabolize) the toxins in alcohol. This is caused by inherited (genetic) traits most often found in Asians.\n\n【12】Other ingredients commonly found in alcoholic beverages, especially in beer or wine, can cause intolerance reactions. These include:\n\n【13】*   Sulfites or other preservatives\n*   Chemicals, grains or other ingredients\n*   Histamine, a byproduct of fermentation or brewing\n\n【14】In some cases, reactions can be triggered by a true allergy to a grain such as corn, wheat or rye or to another substance in alcoholic beverages.\n\n【15】Rarely, severe pain after drinking alcohol is a sign of a more serious disorder, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】Risk factors for alcohol intolerance or other reactions to alcoholic beverages include:\n\n【18】*   Being of Asian descent\n*   Having asthma or hay fever (allergic rhinitis)\n*   Having an allergy to grains or to another food\n*   Having Hodgkin's lymphoma\n\n【19】Complications\n-------------\n\n【20】Depending on the cause, complications of alcohol intolerance or other reactions to alcoholic beverages can include:\n\n【21】*   **Migraines.** Drinking alcohol can trigger migraines in some people, possibly as a result of histamines contained in some alcoholic beverages. Your immune system also releases histamines during an allergic reaction.\n*   **A severe allergic reaction.** In rare instances, an allergic reaction can be life-threatening (anaphylactic reaction) and require emergency treatment.\n\n【22】Prevention\n----------\n\n【23】Unfortunately, nothing can prevent reactions to alcohol or ingredients in alcoholic beverages. To avoid a reaction, avoid alcohol or the particular substance that causes your reaction.\n\n【24】Read beverage labels to see whether they contain ingredients or additives you know cause a reaction, such as sulfites or certain grains. Be aware, however, that labels might not list all ingredients.\n\n【25】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

We matched women aged 50 years and older with radiographically confirmed postoperative VTE (cases) by age, surgeon, year of surgery, and surgical joint (knee vs hip) with women without postoperative VTE (controls). Duration of anesthesia, operative variables, demographic data, comorbid illnesses, and laboratory data were determined by medical record review.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Eighty-eight cases were matched with 181 controls. Duration of anesthesia of 3.5 hours or longer (corresponding to the upper tertile of patients) was strongly associated with postoperative VTE compared with a shorter duration of anesthesia (odds ratio, 3.58; 95% confidence interval, 2.11-6.16; _P_ <.001). This relationship was maintained after controlling for multiple covariates with propensity score methods, including type of arthroplasty, route of anesthesia, type of antithrombotic prophylaxis, and surgical approach. In multivariate analysis, the important predictors of VTE included anesthesia duration of 3.5 hours or longer, type of antithrombotic prophylaxis, revision (vs primary) arthroplasty, and allogeneic blood transfusion.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】We found a marked association between the duration of anesthesia and postoperative VTE in patients undergoing joint arthroplasty. Although it is possible that unmeasured intraoperative variables account for this relationship, we suggest that duration of anesthesia may be an important risk factor for postoperative VTE after orthopedic surgery.\n\n【8】CCF ( Cleveland Clinic Foundation ), CI ( confidence interval ), DVT ( deep venous thrombosis ), IQR ( interquartile range ), OR ( odds ratio ), PE ( pulmonary embolism ), VTE ( venous thromboembolism )\n\n【9】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【13】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【15】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Depressive symptoms were estimated using the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and a validated nonexercise model estimated eCRF. Hazard ratios (HRs) were computed using Cox regression. All-cause mortality was ascertained using the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The mean age was 63.3±8.9 years, and 7932 (52.1%) were women. During the follow-up period of 7.1±1.1 years, 1157 participants (7.6%) died. Multivariable-adjusted analyses revealed that persistently low DSs were independently associated with a 28% risk reduction of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-0.92; _P_ \\=.008) as compared with persistently high DSs. Persistently high eCRF independently predicted a 26% lower risk of death (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.66-0.88; _P_ <.001) relative to low eCRF. Analyses of changes in DSs and eCRF revealed that persistently high eCRF combined with decreased or persistently low DSs decreased mortality risk by 49% (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.91; _P_ \\=.02) and 47% (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76, _P_ \\=.001), respectively.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Maintaining low DSs and high eCRF was independently associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. The lowest mortality risk was observed for persistently high eCRF combined with decreased or persistently low DSs. These results emphasize the effect of preventing DSs and maintaining high CRF on long-term mortality risk, which is potentially important for long-term population health.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CRF ( cardiorespiratory fitness ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), DSs ( depressive symptoms ), eCRF ( estimated cardiorespiratory fitness ), HADS ( Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ), HADS-D ( Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale – depression ), HR ( hazard ratio ), HUNT ( Nord-Trøndelag Health Study ), HUNT1 ( 1984-1986 ), HUNT2 ( 1995-1997 ), HUNT3 ( 2006-2008 ), PA ( physical activity ), RHR ( resting heart rate ), SBP ( systolic blood pressure ), WC ( waist circumference )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Between bites of _petit fours_ , 5 women physicians attending the fall 2019 Karolinska Institutet-Mayo Clinic meeting in Stockholm discussed innovation in medicine and physician joy. Inspired by the common yearning for increased autonomy, flexibility, and time for personal reflection, we pledged to continue our conversations and work stateside. Little did we know that our world was about to change.\n\n【2】Upon return, we began a study to trial remote working to increase flexibility and autonomy for physicians during nonclinical time. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. In an instant, our project was irrelevant, as we all began working from home, seemingly overnight.\n\n【3】Unwilling to allow our momentum to wane, we pondered, How can we use this historic event to learn something about ourselves, our colleagues, and our profession? We reimagined our project to conduct focus groups to explore how physicians were feeling during the tumultuous changes because of COVID-19. Just as the focus groups were launching, George Floyd died at the hands of Minneapolis police, and the world watched as our nation exploded in unrest and calls for action to address systemic racism. Again, our project seemed inadequate.\n\n【4】So we pivoted, broadening discussions to explore physician joy and well-being during times of extreme uncertainty. Between July and August 2020, 5 focus groups were held via Zoom with 20 participants (16 women, 4 men) from Mayo Clinic Arizona (8) and Mayo Clinic Minnesota (12), spanning all career stages. These sessions, each facilitated by 2 of us, allowed colleagues from different departments and geographic sites to come together to share perspectives and experiences. During each session, we explored the definition of joy, changes caused by COVID-19 and social-justice movements, work-life integration, and reflection on priorities.\n\n【5】Similar themes emerged from every focus group. Joy is cultivated by purpose and meaning in work. Connectivity to patients and colleagues is a cornerstone of that joy. Hard work and challenges do not prevent joy. More time at home fosters reflection and prioritization of values. Caring for patients and our community brings a sense of comfort. Teleworking breaks perceived barriers, allowing a window into our personal lives and humanity.\n\n【6】We learned a simple and critical lesson: providing the space to show up authentically created joy. To be present in a shared experience with others, to listen and to process complex emotions through discussion, felt joyful. Even though nothing material had changed in daily life, all participants benefitted. We, the 5 women who started this journey, perhaps benefitted most of all, as we had the joy to bear witness to these rich conversations and witness the creation of joy for others.\n\n【7】We stumbled into creating a space in which those with differing perspectives but common aspirations and values can be seen and heard. In a profession at risk for suicide and burnout, perhaps the deliberate creation of such spaces is the key to perpetuating the lessons learned from these uncertain times.\n\n【8】无关删除-2*   Gold K.J.\n*   Schwenk T.L.\n\n【9】Physician suicide: a personal and community tragedy.\n\n【10】无关删除-2_JAMA Psychiatry._ 2020; 77 : 559-560\n\n【11】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (6)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【12】无关删除-2*   West C.P.\n*   Dyrbye L.N.\n*   Shanafelt T.D.\n\n【13】Physician burnout: contributors, consequences and solutions.\n\n【14】无关删除-2_J Intern Med._ 2018; 283 : 516-529\n\n【15】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1028)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【16】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【17】The authors would like to thank Drs Nneka Comfere, Jennifer Horn, and Cynthia Stonnington for their invaluable contributions to the conception and execution of this project, including facilitating focus groups.

The 1883 individuals with CKD were enrolled from April 1, 2011, through February 28, 2016, and followed until May 31, 2017. Using a questionnaire, alcohol consumption pattern was classified according to the amount of alcohol per occasion (none, moderate, or binge) or drinking frequency (none, occasional, or regular). The primary endpoint was a composite of 50% or greater decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from the baseline level or end-stage renal disease.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】During a follow-up of 5555 person-years (median, 2.95 years), the primary outcome occurred in 419 patients. Unadjusted cause-specific hazards model showed that the risk of the primary outcome was lower in drinkers than in non-drinkers. However, a fully adjusted model including eGFR and proteinuria yielded a reverse association. Compared with non-drinking, regular and occasional binge drinking were associated with a 2.2-fold (95% CI, 1.38-3.46) and a 2.0-fold (95% CI, 1.33-2.98) higher risk of CKD progression, respectively. This association was particularly evident in patients who had decreased kidney function and proteinuria. There was a significant interaction between alcohol consumption and eGFR for CKD progression. The slopes of eGFR decline were steeper in binge drinkers among patients with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  .\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】Heavy alcohol consumption was associated with faster progression of CKD.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CCI ( Charlson comorbidity index ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), eGFR ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ), ESRD ( end-stage renal disease ), HR ( hazard ratio ), KNOW-CKD ( KoreaN Cohort Study for Outcome in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "ba77ab71-37f3-428e-ba0f-9487c1b6b9ca", "title": "Breast pain", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Breast pain (mastalgia) can be described as tenderness, throbbing, sharp, stabbing, burning pain or tightness in the breast tissue. The pain may be constant or it may occur only occasionally, and it can occur in men, women and transgender people.\n\n【2】Breast pain can range from mild to severe. It may occur:\n\n【3】*   Just a few days a month, in the two to three days leading up to a menstrual period. This normal, mild-to-moderate pain affects both breasts.\n*   A week or longer each month, starting before a period and sometimes continuing through the menstrual cycle. The pain may be moderate or severe, and affects both breasts.\n*   Throughout the month, not related to a menstrual cycle.\n\n【4】In men, breast pain is most commonly caused by a condition called \"gynecomastia\" (guy-nuh-koh-MAS-tee-uh). This refers to an increase in the amount of breast gland tissue that's caused by an imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone. Gynecomastia can affect one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly.\n\n【5】In transgender women, hormone therapy may cause breast pain. In transgender men, breast pain may be caused by the minimal amount of breast tissue that may remain after a mastectomy.\n\n【6】Most times, breast pain signals a noncancerous (benign) breast condition and rarely indicates breast cancer. Unexplained breast pain that doesn't go away after one or two menstrual cycles, or that persists after menopause, or breast pain that doesn't seem to be related to hormone changes needs to be evaluated.\n\n【7】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【8】Breast pain can be cyclic or noncyclic. Cyclic means that the pain occurs on a regular pattern. Noncyclic means that the pain is constant, or that there's not a regular pattern. Each type of breast pain has distinct characteristics.\n\n【9】Breast pain characteristics\n\n| Cyclic breast pain | Noncyclic breast pain |\n| --- | --- |\n| Clearly related to the menstrual cycle and changing hormone levelsDescribed as dull, heavy or achingOften accompanied by breast swelling, fullness or lumpinessUsually affects both breasts, particularly the upper, outer portions, and can radiate to the underarmIntensifies during the two weeks leading up to the start of the menstrual period, then eases up afterwardMore likely to affect people in their 20s and 30s, as well as people in their 40s who are transitioning to menopause | Unrelated to the menstrual cycleDescribed as tight, burning, stabbing or aching sensationConstant or intermittentUsually affects one breast, in a localized area, but may spread more diffusely across the breastIn women, most likely to occur after menopause |\n\n【11】### Extramammary breast pain\n\n【12】The term \"extramammary\" means \"outside the breast.\" Extramammary breast pain feels like it starts in the breast tissue, but its source is actually outside the breast area. Pulling a muscle in the chest, for example, can cause pain in the chest wall or rib cage that spreads (radiates) to the breast. Arthritis that involves the cartilage in the chest, also known as costochondritis, can also cause pain.\n\n【13】### When to see a doctor\n\n【14】Make an appointment with your doctor if breast pain:\n\n【15】*   Continues daily for more than a couple of weeks\n*   Occurs in one specific area of your breast\n*   Seems to be getting worse over time\n*   Interferes with daily activities\n*   Awakens you from sleep\n\n【16】Breast cancer risk is very low in people whose main symptom is breast pain, but if your doctor recommends an evaluation, it's important to follow through.\n\n【17】Causes\n------\n\n【18】Changing hormone levels can cause changes in the milk ducts or milk glands. These changes in the ducts and glands can cause breast cysts, which can be painful and are a common cause of cyclic breast pain. Noncyclic breast pain may be caused by trauma, prior breast surgery or other factors.\n\n【19】Sometimes, it's not possible to identify the exact cause of breast pain, but some factors may increase the risk.\n\n【20】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【21】Breast pain is more common among people who haven't completed menopause, although it may occur after menopause. Breast pain can also occur in men who have gynecomastia, and in transgender people who are undergoing gender reassignment.\n\n【22】Other factors that may increase the risk of breast pain include:\n\n【23】*   **Breast size.** People who have large breasts may experience noncyclic breast pain related to the size of their breasts. Neck, shoulder and back pain may accompany breast pain that's caused by large breasts.\n*   **Breast surgery.** Breast pain associated with breast surgery and scar formation can sometimes linger after incisions have healed.\n*   **Fatty acid imbalance.** An imbalance of fatty acids within the cells may affect the sensitivity of breast tissue to circulating hormones.\n*   **Medication use.** Certain hormonal medications, including some infertility treatments and oral birth control pills, may be associated with breast pain. Breast tenderness is a possible side effect of estrogen and progesterone hormone therapies that are used after menopause.

He is the son of an Air Force pilot. Perhaps this influences his deep interest in creatures endowed with the power of flight. Animals, especially birds, are Guelich's most widely used subject matter for his compositions, and his preferred medium is bronze. He includes the natural habitat of his subjects as an essential part of each creation. Guelich was awarded the National Sculpture Society gold medal in November 2000 for his depiction of a Serengeti African lion and the silver medal at the society's show in 2001 for his 6-ft rendition of great blue herons. He holds memberships in many other artist societies, such as the Society of Animal Artists.  Of his art, Guelich states: “A sculpture should be touchable, for much of its allure is feeling…. It is meant to be touched by people appreciating it.” \n\n【2】_Skyward Bound,_ a cast bronze by Guelich, reveals the majesty and grace of the peregrine falcon in flight. The uplifted wings waiting to catch the wind disclose the raw power of this small bird of prey. The turn of its head suggests that the falcon's sharp eyes have located its next meal and that it could swoop into a free-falling dive to catch the unsuspecting prey in its powerful talons, at any moment.\n\n【3】One of the many peripheral benefits at Mayo Clinic is the legacy, rooted in the founding values of Drs William J. and Charles H. Mayo, of caring for the world around us by sustaining current ecological and environmental concerns. An example is Mayo Clinic's program (in conjunction with University of Minnesota Raptor Center) to help restore the peregrine falcon population.  _Skyward Bound_ is a fitting commemoration of this program and stands as a sentinel for the live cameras during nesting season.\n\n【4】_Skyward Bound,_ a gift from Dr and Mrs John E.

The exposure of interest was a measure of the health care utilization environment during residency from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care Hospital Care Intensity (HCI) index of primary training hospitals. The main outcome measure was agreement with an 11-point cost-consciousness scale. The generalized estimating equations method was used to measure the association between exposure and outcome.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of the 2556 physicians who responded to the survey, 2424 had a valid HCI index (95%), representing 649 residency programs. The mean ± SD cost-consciousness score among physicians trained at hospitals in the lowest quartile of care intensity (31.8±5.0) was higher than that for physicians trained at hospitals in the top quartile of care intensity (30.7±5.1; _P_ <.001). Adjusting for other physician and practice characteristics, a population of physicians trained in hospitals with a 1.0-point higher HCI index would score approximately 0.83 points lower on the cost-consciousness scale (beta coefficient = –0.83; 95% CI, –1.60 to –0.05; _P_ \\=.04).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The intensity of the health care utilization environment during training may play a role in shaping physician cost consciousness later in their careers.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AMA ( American Medical Association ), HCI ( Hospital Care Intensity index ), HMO ( health maintenance organization )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

The rash often affects the groin and inner thighs and may be shaped like a ring. The condition is also called tinea cruris.\n\n【2】Jock itch gets its name because it's common in athletes. It's also common in people who sweat a lot. The condition can range from mild to serious. It usually clears up in 1 to 3 weeks with antifungal creams and self care.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Symptoms of jock itch are:\n\n【5】*   A spreading rash that begins in the crease of the groin and moves down the upper thigh and buttocks.\n*   A rash whose center tends to clear as the rash spreads.\n*   A rash that may be full or partially ring shaped.\n*   A rash bordered with small blisters.\n*   Itchiness.\n*   Scaly skin.\n*   A rash that might be red, brown, purple or gray depending on your skin color.\n\n【6】### When to see a doctor\n\n【7】See your doctor if your rash is painful or you develop a fever. And seek medical care if the rash hasn't improved after a week of self-care with the type of antifungal product you can get without a prescription. Also seek medical care if the rash hasn't cleared up fully after three weeks of treatment.\n\n【8】Causes\n------\n\n【9】Jock itch is caused by fungi that thrive in warm, moist areas of the body. Jock itch is often caused by the same organism that causes athlete's foot. The rash can spread from person to person with skin contact or from sharing contaminated towels or clothing. You can also spread an infection from the foot to groin by way of the hands or a towel.\n\n【10】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【11】You're at greater risk of jock itch if you:\n\n【12】*   Are male.\n*   Are a teen or young adult.\n*   Wear underwear, jeans or other clothing that's tight.\n*   Sweat heavily.\n*   Have a weak immune system.\n*   Have athlete's foot.\n\n【13】Prevention\n----------\n\n【14】Tips for reducing the risk of jock itch include:\n\n【15】*   **Stay dry.** Keep the groin area and inner thighs dry by drying with a clean towel after showering or exercising. Dry your feet last to avoid spreading athlete's foot to the groin area.\n*   **Wear clean clothes.** Change your underwear at least once a day or more often if you sweat a lot. It helps to wear underwear made of cotton or other fabric that breathes and keeps the skin drier. Wash workout clothes after each use.\n*   **Find the correct fit.** Choose underwear, athletic supporters and sports uniforms that fit well. Tight-fitting clothes can chafe your skin and up the risk of jock itch. Try wearing boxer shorts rather than briefs.\n*   **Don't share personal items.** Don't let others use your clothing, towels or other personal items. Don't borrow such items from others.\n*   **Treat or prevent athlete's foot.** Control athlete's foot to prevent its spread to the groin. Prevent athlete's foot by wearing waterproof footwear around public pools and in showers and locker rooms.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Edwards, my friend and colleague, regarding our recent article. Dr Edwards has taken exception to the term _molecular autopsy_ , preferring such postmortem genetic testing to be viewed as part of the standard existing armamentarium of tests available to the medical examiner, coroner, or forensic pathologist when conducting a postmortem evaluation (ie, an autopsy). Just as there is no _toxicologic autopsy_ or _immunohistochemical autopsy_ , Dr Edwards contends that neither should there be a _molecular autopsy_ .\n\n【1】In principle, I agree with Dr Edwards. He should be commended for his consistency with respect to terminology. Indeed, Dr Edwards was the senior author on one of the first articles describing molecular autopsies, published in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ in 1999,\n\n【2】*   Ackerman MJ\n*   Tester DJ\n*   Porter CJ\n*   Edwards WD\n\n【3】Molecular diagnosis of the inherited long-QT syndrome in a woman who died after near-drowning.\n\n【4】无关删除-2_N Engl J Med._ 1999; 341 : 1121-1125\n\n【5】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (119)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【6】in which we established by postmortem genetic testing the presence of a mutation that caused long QT syndrome in a woman who died after a near drowning as a result of this mutation. True to form, Dr Edwards then insisted and I obliged regarding use of the phrase _molecular-test finding at autopsy_ . Nowhere in this sentinel report does the term _molecular autopsy_ appear.\n\n【7】Shortly thereafter, we introduced the term _molecular autopsy_ in reference to solving an unexplained sudden death that occurred now nearly 30 years ago.\n\n【8】*   Ackerman MJ\n*   Tester DJ\n*   Porter CJ\n\n【9】Swimming, a gene-specific arrhythmogenic trigger for inherited long QT syndrome.\n\n【10】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 1999; 74 : 1088-1094\n\n【11】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (216)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【12】We were able to extract enough genetic material (DNA) of suitable quality from paraffin-embedded, archived autopsy tissue and eventually elucidate a mutation that caused long QT syndrome type 1. Although successful in this instance, paraffin-embedded tissue should be viewed as the enemy to postmortem genetic testing in contrast to the frozen tissue astutely procured at the time of the autopsy conducted by Dr Edwards.\n\n【13】Although popularity does not necessarily translate into correctness or appropriateness with respect to medical terminology, we are not alone when it comes to using the expression _molecular autopsy_ . In 2001, we published an article entitled “Molecular Autopsy of Sudden Unexplained Death in the Young” in _The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology_ ,\n\n【14】*   Ackerman MJ\n*   Tester DJ\n*   Driscoll DJ\n\n【15】Molecular autopsy of sudden unexplained death in the young.\n\n【16】无关删除-2_Am J Forensic Med Pathol._ 2001; 22 : 105-111\n\n【17】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (122)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【18】and no objections were raised by its readership comprising coroners, medical examiners, and forensic pathologists. We have continued to use the term _molecular autopsy_ in the first postmortem mutational analysis involving a population of infants succumbing to sudden infant death syndrome,\n\n【19】*   Ackerman MJ\n*   Siu BL\n*   Sturner WQ\n*   et al.\n\n【20】Postmortem molecular analysis of SCN5A defects in sudden infant death syndrome.\n\n【21】无关删除-2_JAMA._ 2001; 286 : 2264-2269\n\n【22】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (408)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【23】in medical examiner referrals of autopsy-negative sudden unexplained deaths occurring after the first year of life,\n\n【24】*   Tester DJ\n*   Spoon DB\n*   Valdivia HH\n*   Makielski JC\n*   Ackerman MJ\n\n【25】Targeted mutational analysis of the _RyR2_ \\-encoded cardiac ryanodine receptor in sudden unexplained death: a molecular autopsy of 49 medical examiner/coroner's cases.\n\n【26】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2004; 79 : 1380-1384\n\n【27】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (244)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【28】and most recently, in the study that provided a cogent explanation for the cause and manner of death in 2 cases of unexplained drowning, which prompted Dr Edward's letter. In addition, PubMed and Google searches of the term _molecular autopsy_ elicited 1298 and 227,000 hits, respectively. Finally, at the 2004 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in New Orleans, Professor Gaetano Thiene, an internationally known cardiovascular pathologist, said publicly, “This is a milestone in pathology,” following our presentation on the role of molecular autopsy in evaluating sudden unexplained death.\n\n【29】I fully agree that molecular autopsy, or cardiac channel mutational analysis, is just another tool available for the comprehensive postmortem evaluation of unexplained sudden death; however, it is by no means a standard tool in every medical examiner's toolbox. Until 2004, such testing, whether premortem or postmortem, was relegated solely to research laboratories. Even now, a postmortem genetic test for cardiac channel mutations remains primarily in the domain of research laboratories because most insurance companies have resisted paying for such sophisticated testing for a deceased individual, despite the profound implications that such testing may have for those left behind.\n\n【30】*   Lee A\n*   Ackerman MJ\n\n【31】Sudden unexplained death: evaluation of those left behind.\n\n【32】无关删除-2_Lancet._ 2003; 362 : 1429-1430\n\n【33】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (12)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【34】Furthermore, our intention in using the expression _molecular autopsy_ was to promote awareness among those responsible for performing autopsies. In particular, we have tried to provide instructions about the most fundamental aspects regarding the use of this tool, namely, proper procurement of DNA-friendly tissue. Blood in EDTA or frozen tissue enables such analyses to be conducted with technical ease, whereas current standard operating procedures involving paraffin and/or formalin to archive tissue are lethal to postmortem cardiac channel genetic testing. Even today, more than half of the medical examiner-initiated requests to the Mayo Clinic's Sudden Death Genomics Laboratory for a molecular autopsy in the setting of unexplained sudden death are not possible because of the absence of properly collected tissue.\n\n【35】When medical examiners, coroners, and forensic pathologists procure tissue in a DNA-friendly fashion as a standard operating procedure and are able to access appropriate, timely, and reimbursable postmortem genetic tests from a testing site approved by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments rather than from a free but painfully slow study conducted in a research laboratory such as our own, the molecular autopsy will indeed mature into just another component of the comprehensive autopsy that seeks to establish the cause and manner of death. Until then, it is difficult to conclude that postmortem genetic testing constitutes a standard tool in the armamentarium of available tools in the autopsy evaluation of unexplained and unexpected sudden death involving infants, children, adolescents, and young adults.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Physical activity was measured in 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009 and was categorized as very low, low, active, or very active at each survey, and a cumulative PA score for this 9-year period was created. Logistic regression was used to examine relationships between PA accumulated across all surveys (cumulative PA model) and PA at each survey (critical periods PA model), with change in BMI category (from healthy to overweight or healthy to obese) from 2000 to 2012.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In women with a healthy BMI in 2000, there were clear dose-response relationships between accumulated PA and transition to overweight ( _P_ \\=.03) and obesity ( _P_ <.01) between 2000 and 2012. The critical periods analysis indicated that very active levels of PA at the 2006 survey (when the women were 28-33 years old) and active or very active PA at the 2009 survey (age 31-36 years) were most protective against transitioning to overweight and obesity.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】These findings confirm that maintenance of very high PA levels throughout young adulthood will significantly reduce the risk of becoming overweight or obese.

Tekturna HCT\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide combination is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure will reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.\n\n【6】Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor. It works by blocking an enzyme in the body that is necessary to produce a substance that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, the blood vessels relax and decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen is increased to the heart.\n\n【7】Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below.

A quality improvement (QI) initiative was introduced on January 1, 2011, to maintain short DTB while improving outcomes. Outcomes were compared before and after the initiation of the DTB time protocol and similarly before and after the QI initiative. Outcomes were DTB time, the incidence of FP-STEMI, and in-hospital mortality. A review of the emergency catheterization database for the 10-year period from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2010, was performed for historical comparison.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of the 1031 consecutive patients with presumed STEMI who were assessed, 170 were considered to have FP-STEMI. The median DTB time decreased significantly from 76 to 61 minutes with the aggressive DTB time protocol ( _P_ \\=.001), accompanied by an increase of FP-STEMI (7.7% vs 16.5%; _P_ \\=.02). Although a nonsignificant reduction of in-hospital mortality occurred in patients with true-positive STEMI ( _P_ \\=.60), a significant increase in in-hospital mortality was seen in patients with FP-STEMI ( _P_ \\=.03). After the QI initiative, a shorter DTB time (59 minutes) was maintained while decreasing FP-STEMI in-hospital mortality.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Aggressive measures to reduce DTB time were associated with an increased incidence of FP-STEMI and FP-STEMI in-hospital mortality. Efforts to reduce DTB time should be monitored systematically to avoid unnecessary procedures that may delay other appropriate therapies in critically ill patients.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】DTB ( “door to balloon” ), ECG ( electrocardiography ), FP ( false-positive ), QI ( quality improvement ), STEMI ( ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ), TP ( true-positive )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Published recommendations are based on the expert opinion of a small number of authors without collaboration from multiple specialties. The Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) recognized the need for consensus recommendations in this area as well as the unique opportunity for its multidisciplinary membership to fill this void. In a series of articles within this journal, SPAQI provides preoperative medication management guidance based on available literature and expert multidisciplinary consensus. The aim of this consensus statement is to provide practical guidance on the preoperative management of gastrointestinal and pulmonary medications. A panel of experts with anesthesiology, perioperative medicine, hospital medicine, general internal medicine, and medical specialty experience was drawn together and identified the common medications in each of these categories. The authors then used a modified Delphi approach to review the literature and to generate consensus recommendations.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ACR/AAHKS ( American College of Rheumatology/American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons ), COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ), GLP-1 ( glucagon-like peptide 1 ), HBV ( hepatitis B virus ), HCV ( hepatitis C virus ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), 5-HT ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ), IBD ( inflammatory bowel disease ), IPF ( idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ), PDE ( phosphodiesterase ), PDE-5 ( phosphodiesterase type 5 ), PH ( pulmonary hypertension ), PPI ( proton pump inhibitor ), SPAQI ( Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement ), TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ), USFDA ( US Food and Drug Administration )\n\n【4】Medication management is key to optimizing the care of patients undergoing invasive procedures. Clinicians must ascertain whether a patient’s long-term medications may alter anesthetic or analgesic effects or increase surgery- or anesthesia-related bleeding risk. Common postoperative complications, including postoperative delirium and respiratory depression, may also be increased by some medications. However, inappropriate withholding of medications is equally important because of the risks associated with systemic disease and medication withdrawal syndromes. Further complicating management is the fact that surgery type must also be factored into decision-making. For some medications, outcomes with one type of surgery may be minimally affected, whereas complications are increased for another. Thus, close collaboration with proceduralists and specialists is imperative.\n\n【5】Continuous evolution of anesthetic and surgical practices and US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA)–approved therapies complicates the process of perioperative medication management. Coupled with a shortage of evidence-based resources, clinicians lack guidance for optimal practice. The Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) seeks to fill this practice gap by leveraging its specialized focus in the field of perioperative medicine.\n\n【6】SPAQI is an international, multidisciplinary society dedicated to the promotion of evidence-based perioperative medicine and has produced a number of recommendation papers and consensus statements in this field.\n\n【7】无关删除-2*   Wong J.\n*   An D.\n*   Urman R.D.\n*   et al.\n\n【8】Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) Consensus Statement on Perioperative Smoking Cessation.\n\n【9】无关删除-2_Anesth Analg._ 2020; 131 : 955-968\n\n【10】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (23)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【11】无关删除-2*   O'Rourke M.J.\n*   Keshock M.C.\n*   Boxhorn C.E.\n*   et al.\n\n【12】Preoperative management of opioid and nonopioid analgesics: Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) Consensus Statement.\n\n【13】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2021; 96 : 1325-1341\n\n【14】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (8)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【15】无关删除-2*   Pfeifer K.J.\n*   Selzer A.\n*   Mendez C.E.\n*   et al.\n\n【16】Preoperative management of endocrine, hormonal, and urologic medications: Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) Consensus Statement.\n\n【17】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2021; 96 : 1655-1669\n\n【18】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (7)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【19】SPAQI drafted a comprehensive plan for developing consensus recommendations for preoperative medication management using perioperative medicine, anesthesiology, internal medicine, hospital medicine, and medical subspecialty experts.

Gastrointestinal and pulmonary medications were combined for this consensus group to balance the volume of information across the series of recommendation statements. Members of the consensus group were recognized experts in the fields of perioperative medicine, anesthesiology, general internal medicine, hospital medicine, and subspecialty internal medicine from several different academic institutions.\n\n【22】The group first identified common USFDA-approved medications for pulmonary and gastrointestinal disease.

Specific drugs in this class include ipratropium, tiotropium, aclidinium, umeclidinium, revefenacin, and inhaled glycopyrrolate. Minimal literature about perioperative management of inhaled anticholinergics is available, but at least 2 studies found lower rates of pulmonary complications in patients using inhaled tiotropium (alone or in combination with formoterol and budesonide) preoperatively.\n\n【49】无关删除-2*   Nojiri T.\n*   Inoue M.\n*   Yamamoto K.\n*   et al.\n\n【50】Inhaled tiotropium to prevent postoperative cardiopulmonary complications in patients with newly diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring lung cancer surgery.\n\n【51】无关删除-2_Surg Today._ 2014; 44 : 285-290\n\n【52】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (24)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【53】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue inhaled anticholinergic medications up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【54】### β <sub>2 </sub> \\-Adrenergic Agonists\n\n【55】The β <sub>2 </sub> \\-adrenergic agonists activate cyclic adenosine monophosphate, causing relaxation of smooth muscles and improved airway flow. Medications in this class include inhaled agents that are short-acting (albuterol, metaproterenol, and levalbuterol) and long-acting (salmeterol, formoterol, aformoterol, indacaterol, and olodaterol). There is no specific evidence of perioperative adverse events related to these medications, and in a randomized trial with patients undergoing esophagectomy, salmeterol started immediately before surgery was associated with a significant decrease in pneumonia incidence.\n\n【56】无关删除-2*   Perkins G.D.\n*   Gates S.\n*   Park D.\n*   et al.\n\n【57】The beta agonist lung injury trial prevention.

Inhibition of PDE type 3 accounts for most of its bronchodilator effects, although it may also have anti-inflammatory effects. Cardiac adverse effects, drug interactions, and a narrow therapeutic window have led to drastically decreased use. We could identify no relevant literature guiding its preoperative management, but the negative aspects causing its decline in general use also raise concern for its perioperative administration.\n\n【63】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue theophylline before the day of surgery but hold on the day of surgery because of its narrow therapeutic window, potential for drug interactions, and cardiac adverse effects. Consider discussion of long-term necessity with the prescriber.\n\n【64】### Roflumilast\n\n【65】This inhaled medication inhibits PDE type 4, leading to reduction of inflammatory mediators.

Oral steroids cause many undesirable adverse effects, including adrenal suppression, bone demineralization, and immunosuppression, but the systemic impact of inhaled corticosteroids remains relatively low except when they are used at the highest dosages.\n\n【74】无关删除-2*   Ye Q.\n*   He X.O.\n*   D’Urzo A.\n\n【75】A review on the safety and efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of asthma.\n\n【76】无关删除-2_Pulm Ther._ 2017; 3 : 1-18\n\n【77】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (44)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【78】Specifically, there is no evidence of perioperative harm from use of inhaled corticosteroids, and some evidence suggests benefit from preoperative use.\n\n【79】无关删除-2*   Yamanashi K.\n*   Marumo S.\n*   Shoji T.\n*   et al.\n\n【80】The relationship between perioperative administration of inhaled corticosteroid and postoperative respiratory complications after pulmonary resection for non-small-cell lung cancer in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n【81】无关删除-2_Gen Thorac Cardiovasc Surg._ 2015; 63 : 652-659\n\n【82】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (8)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【83】无关删除-2*   Bölükbas S.\n*   Eberlein M.\n*   Eckhoff J.\n*   Schirren J.\n\n【84】Short-term effects of inhalative tiotropium/formoterol/budenoside versus tiotropium/formoterol in patients with newly diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring surgery for lung cancer: a prospective randomized trial.\n\n【85】无关删除-2_Eur J Cardiothorac Surg._ 2011; 39 : 995-1000\n\n【86】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (39)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【87】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue inhaled corticosteroids up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【88】### Combination Inhaled Medications\n\n【89】Multiple USFDA combinations of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting β <sub>2 </sub> agonists, and anticholinergics are available for treatment of asthma and COPD. Literature specific to these products is included in the preceding sections.\n\n【90】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue combination inhaled medications up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【91】### Leukotriene Inhibitors\n\n【92】Montelukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton are oral asthma medications that exert their therapeutic effect by blocking leukotriene-mediated inflammation. There is no specific literature about the perioperative use of these medications, but their adverse effect profile does not include elements that would preclude their use before surgery.\n\n【93】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue leukotriene inhibitors up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【94】### _N_ \\-Acetylcysteine\n\n【95】_N_ \\-Acetylcysteine is used for some patients with COPD to thin respiratory secretions and potentially to reduce the frequency of exacerbations. Given its relatively low incidence of serious adverse effects and the lack of literature about its perioperative use, continuation of therapy through surgery is appropriate.\n\n【96】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue _N_ \\-acetylcysteine up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【97】### H <sub>1 </sub> Antihistamines\n\n【98】Medications from this class include both first-generation H <sub>1 </sub> antihistamines and second-generation H <sub>1 </sub> antihistamines (cetirizine, levocetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine, and loratadine); they are used for several purposes, such as allergic rhinosinusitis, atopic dermatitis, insomnia, and anxiety. First-generation H <sub>1 </sub> antihistamines penetrate the blood-brain barrier (which may cause somnolence) and also have anticholinergic adverse effects.

Pirfenidone reduces fibroblast proliferation and inhibits collagen formation. Nintedanib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that impedes pulmonary fibrosis and has been found to improve quality of life and lung function in patients with IPF and other progressive pulmonary fibrosis conditions. Pirfenidone may cause hepatotoxic effects and is metabolized through CYP1A2, which could lead to toxicity of medications affecting this enzymatic pathway (eg, fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, paroxetine). Nintedanib is associated with increased risk of arterial thromboembolism, hepatotoxicity, and bleeding. Given their antifibrotic properties, concerns of impaired wound healing have been raised. Although one recent case report described wound dehiscence associated with nintedanib use after cardiac surgery, other literature found no apparent increased wound complications and fewer than expected IPF exacerbations in lung transplant patients receiving nintedanib and pirfenidone.\n\n【170】无关删除-2*   Balestro E.\n*   Solidoro P.\n*   Parigi P.\n*   Boffini M.\n*   Lucianetti A.\n*   Rea F.\n\n【171】Safety of nintedanib before lung transplant: an Italian case series.\n\n【172】_Respirol Case Rep._ 2018;

Nonparticulate antacids may be acceptable to take on the morning of surgery for patients at increased risk for pulmonary aspiration.\n\n【254】### Antiemetics\n\n【255】#### 5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor 3 (5-HT <sub>3 </sub> ) Antagonists\n\n【256】These agents are commonly used for control of nausea and vomiting in the perioperative period and in cancer patients and exert their effect by antagonizing 5-HT <sub>3 </sub> receptors centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Four 5-HT <sub>3 </sub> antagonists are approved by the FDA; they are ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, and palonosetron. These medications are well tolerated with few adverse effects. However, caution is advised when these medications are used concurrently with medications that prolong QT interval (torsades de pointes) or have serotonergic properties (serotonin syndrome).\n\n【257】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue 5-HT <sub>3 </sub> antagonists up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【258】#### Dopamine Antagonists\n\n【259】Promethazine, prochlorperazine, droperidol, and metoclopramide are centrally acting dopamine antagonists that are effective for treatment of nausea and vomiting in multiple settings. Metoclopramide is also used as a gastrointestinal stimulant to improve gastric emptying and bowel motility. Available data suggest that these medications are safe in the perioperative period; however, their antidopaminergic effect may lead to extrapyramidal symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and tardive dyskinesia (with prolonged therapy), and they can prolong the QT interval. These drugs have multiple drug-drug interactions with many medications; it may be beneficial to consult with a pharmacist if these medications are prescribed throughout the postoperative period.\n\n【260】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue dopamine antagonists up to and including the day of surgery, unless there are concerns of significant QT prolongation.\n\n【261】#### Aprepitant\n\n【262】Aprepitant is a neurokinin 1 antagonist that is a highly effective and costly oral antiemetic. It is well tolerated and has been found to be safe and effective in the perioperative setting.\n\n【263】无关删除-2*   Kanaparthi A.\n*   Kukura S.\n*   Slenkovich N.\n*   et al.\n\n【264】Perioperative administration of Emend (aprepitant) at a tertiary care children's hospital: a 12-month survey.\n\n【265】无关删除-2_Clin Pharmacol._ 2019; 11 : 155-160\n\n【266】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【267】Concurrent use of aprepitant with opioids, midazolam, alprazolam, or triazolam can increase risk of respiratory depression and opioid toxicity, but this is less of a concern if a single dose is used. It has also been reported to decrease the efficacy of oral contraceptive medications for up to 28 days; it is important to mention to women that an alternative form of contraception should be used for 1 month after the last dose of aprepitant. Aprepitant is a substrate, inhibitor, and inducer of CYP3A4 and an inducer of CYP2C9, so there are drug-drug interactions to be aware of if this medication is used consistently.\n\n【268】FDA prescribing information.\n\n【269】https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda\\_docs/label/2018/022023s017lbl.pdf\n\n【270】Date accessed: January 21, 2021\n\n【271】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【272】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue aprepitant up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【273】### Hepatitis B and C Antivirals\n\n【274】For all patients undergoing therapy for eradication or suppression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), the preoperative care clinician should discuss perioperative management with patients’ gastroenterology clinicians. Specifically, it should be determined whether a patient’s liver disease is sufficiently optimized to tolerate surgery and whether a nonurgent procedure should be delayed to allow the completion of eradication therapy.\n\n【275】#### Anti-HBV Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors\n\n【276】Entecavir, tenofovir, and lamivudine are used in the treatment of chronic HBV infection as well as HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. Entecavir and lamivudine are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Adefovir is another nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is rarely used and effective only for chronic HBV infection. All these mediations inhibit HBV replication but do not completely eliminate the virus; thus, these agents are usually taken indefinitely. All are also associated with potential nephrotoxicity, which should be taken into consideration for patients with alterations in renal function. Although HBV recurrence from brief withholding is unlikely, no specific perioperative adverse effects have been identified that would suggest a need to stop these medications. Some evidence suggests benefit from preoperative use of entecavir in patients undergoing HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma resection.\n\n【277】无关删除-2*   Zhang B.\n*   Xu D.\n*   Wang R.\n*   et al.\n\n【278】Perioperative antiviral therapy improves safety in patients with hepatitis B related HCC following hepatectomy.\n\n【279】无关删除-2_Int J Surg._ 2015; 15 : 1-5\n\n【280】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (10)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【281】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue entecavir, tenofovir, lamivudine, and adefovir up to and including the day of surgery but consult with the prescribing clinician. Assess renal and hepatic function before surgery because of nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity of these agents.\n\n【282】#### Pegylated Interferons\n\n【283】Pegylated interferon alfa-2a is a rarely used monotherapy for hepatitis B. Pegylated interferon alfa-2a and pegylated interferon alfa-2b may be used in combination with oral antivirals for treatment of hepatitis C. The antiviral mechanisms of interferons are immunoregulatory and complex. Unlike oral antivirals, these subcutaneous medications are administered for a defined time (24 to 48 weeks) and have the advantage of long-term sustained virologic response (20% to 30% for HBV and 40% to 60% for HCV). The potential adverse effects of interferons are well documented and common; they include immunologic, hematologic, metabolic, neuropsychiatric, and pulmonary complications. Because of these adverse effects and the efficacy of oral therapies, interferons are rarely used in the treatment of viral hepatitis. Perioperative safety data are lacking, but these drugs have metabolism interactions with opioids and lidocaine that raise concerns for their perioperative use. Based on their adverse effect profile, withholding of anti-HBV or anti-HCV interferon therapy before surgery would appear prudent. Because use of interferons for hepatitis treatment is unusual, decision-making for perioperative interferon management should be discussed in detail with the gastroenterology team.\n\n【284】_Consensus Recommendations_ : When interferons are used for treatment of viral hepatitis, stop them 1 to 2 weeks before surgery because of potential for perioperative complications but consult with the prescribing clinician.\n\n【285】#### Ribavirin\n\n【286】Ribavirin is an oral RNA nucleoside inhibitor and inhibits RNA functions required for viral replication. The drug is used in conjunction with pegylated interferons or other oral antivirals for the treatment of HCV infection, including coinfection with HIV and HBV. Ribavirin has multiple potentially serious adverse effects, including anemia and cardiovascular disease (hypertension and myocardial infarction). No evidence-based guidelines or literature are available for perioperative management. Because most adverse effects are chronic, it is reasonable to continue ribavirin up to the day of surgery, but it should be held on the morning of surgery because of the need to take it with food.\n\n【287】_Consensus Recommendations_ : Continue ribavirin up to the day of surgery but hold on the morning of surgery. If hemoglobin level has not recently been obtained, check it before surgery.\n\n【288】#### Other Oral Anti-HCV Medications\n\n【289】Several other oral anti-HCV medications have greater efficacy in achieving sustained virologic response and are used much more frequently than the aforementioned drugs. These include sofosbuvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/valpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir. Except for ritonavir, all these medications and their component drugs interfere with HCV viral RNA replication. Ritonavir is an HIV antiviral with no direct activity against HCV but is part of a combination with paritaprevir because it is a pharmacokinetic enhancer of that drug.\n\n【290】These medications are much better tolerated than interferons but still have important considerations. Sofosbuvir has several significant drug interactions, including amiodarone, PPIs, HIV antivirals, anticonvulsants, and antimycobacterials. Because of their cytochrome P450 metabolism, the other drugs in this group also have potential drug interactions with common perioperative medications. Elbasvir/grazoprevir, in particular, has several critical drug interactions, including opioids, antibiotics, benzodiazepines, and antiemetics. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir must also be taken with food. Data on the safety of these drugs in the perioperative setting are minimal, and management recommendations are based on the adverse effects, drug interactions, and administration requirements.\n\n【291】_Consensus Recommendations_ : Continue sofosbuvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir up to and including the day of surgery. Continue sofosbuvir/valpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir up to the day of surgery but hold on the morning of surgery. Discuss management with the patient’s gastroenterology clinician.\n\n【292】### Gallstone Solubilizing Agents\n\n【293】Ursodiol and chenodeoxycholic acid reduce gallstone formation after bariatric surgery and improve cholestasis in primary sclerosing cholangitis. No substantial perioperative literature is available for this class of medications, but when taken without food, they may cause nausea. For this reason and because their benefits are derived from long-term rather than short-term administration, withholding these medications while fasting is reasonable.\n\n【294】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue gallstone solubilizing agents up to the day before surgery but hold on the morning of surgery.\n\n【295】### Pancreatic Enzymes\n\n【296】These agents are commonly used for patients with pancreatic insufficiency related to inflammation, trauma, or surgical resection. Essentially no data are available on perioperative management of these medications. They are considered safe perioperatively, although during preoperative fasting, they should be held because they are usually not necessary in this situation.\n\n【297】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue pancreatic enzymes up to the day before surgery but hold on the morning of surgery.\n\n【298】### 5-Aminosalicylic Acid\n\n【299】Drugs in the 5-aminosalicylic acid class are used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many clinicians have concerns about the potential for bleeding risk due to platelet inhibition, but these agents are considered safe in the perioperative period because they have a primarily luminal impact with minimal systemic effects. A narrative review from 2011 recommended stopping 1 day in advance and resuming 3 days postoperatively in the setting of impaired glomerular filtration; however, in the setting of normal renal function, this is not necessary.\n\n【300】无关删除-2*   Kumar A.\n*   Auron M.\n*   Aneja A.\n*   Mohr F.\n*   Jain A.\n*   Shen B.\n\n【301】Inflammatory bowel disease: perioperative pharmacological considerations.\n\n【302】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2011; 86 : 748-757\n\n【303】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (39)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【304】Adverse effects include hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow suppression, pneumonitis, pancreatitis, and hemolytic anemia, but these are rare.\n\n【305】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue 5-aminosalicylic acid medications up to and including the day of surgery but consider holding on the morning of surgery if glomerular filtration rate is below 50 mL/min.\n\n【306】### Antidiarrheals\n\n【307】Symptomatic management of diarrhea is accomplished by antimotility agents that work through either opioid receptor agonism or anticholinergic activity. Antidiarrheals are generally safe, although loperamide in excessive doses leads to euphoria, cardiotoxicity, and central nervous system and respiratory depression. Atropine has anticholinergic effects and may lead to anesthetic interactions, and a systematic review recommended loperamide and diphenoxylate/atropine conditionally in critically ill patients.\n\n【308】无关删除-2*   Bugaev N.\n*   Bhattacharya B.\n*   Chiu W.C.\n*   et al.\n\n【309】Antimotility agents for the treatment of acute noninfectious diarrhea in critically ill patients: a practice management guideline from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma.\n\n【310】无关删除-2_J Trauma Acute Care Surg._ 2019; 87 : 915-921\n\n【311】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (3)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【312】It is appropriate to continue these agents preoperatively up to the day before surgery because the quality of life benefit outweighs the perioperative risks, given the short half-life of these agents.\n\n【313】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue antidiarrheals up to the day before surgery but hold on the morning of surgery because of the risk of opioid agonism and anticholinergic effects.\n\n【314】### Anticholinergics and Antispasmodics\n\n【315】Like antidiarrheal agents, these medications serve to slow gut transit time and reduce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting as well as to control upper airway and gastric secretions. In the general setting, these medications have multiple adverse effects (tachyarrhythmias, hypertension, urinary retention, and altered mentation), and their use is discouraged in elderly patients.\n\n【316】American Geriatrics Society 2019 Updated AGS Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults.\n\n【317】无关删除-2_J Am Geriatr Soc._ 2019; 67 : 674-694\n\n【318】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1847)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【319】无关删除-2*   Rudolph J.L.\n*   Salow M.J.\n*   Angelini M.C.\n*   McGlinchey R.E.\n\n【320】The anticholinergic risk scale and anticholinergic adverse effects in older persons.\n\n【321】无关删除-2_Arch Intern Med._ 2008; 168 : 508-513\n\n【322】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (580)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【323】A recent analysis found the use of these agents to be associated with multiple adverse postoperative outcomes, including decreased survival and increased length of stay, readmission, and costs of care.\n\n【324】无关删除-2*   McIsaac D.I.\n*   Wong C.A.\n*   Diep D.\n*   van Walraven C.\n\n【325】Association of preoperative anticholinergic medication exposure with postoperative healthcare resource use and outcomes: a population-based cohort study.\n\n【326】无关删除-2_Ann Surg._ 2019; 270 : 1049-1057\n\n【327】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (6)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【328】These medications have strong potential for contributing to perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ Brain Health Initiative recommends avoiding these agents in the surgical setting.\n\n【329】无关删除-2*   Berger M.\n*   Schenning K.J.\n*   Brown 4th, C.H.\n*   et al.\n\n【330】Best practices for postoperative brain health: recommendations from the Fifth International Perioperative Neurotoxicity Working Group.\n\n【331】无关删除-2_Anesth Analg._ 2018; 127 : 1406-1413\n\n【332】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (138)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【333】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue anticholinergics and antispasmodics up to the day before surgery but hold on the morning of surgery.

This medication is used to treat opioid-related constipation and other causes of chronic constipation. There is a paucity of perioperative literature for this medication.\n\n【336】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue lubiprostone up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【337】### Guanylate Cyclase C Agonists\n\n【338】This medication class includes linaclotide and plecanatide and is used treat chronic constipation by stimulating intestinal fluid secretion and transit.

There is no specific preoperative contraindication to the use of laxatives. However, clinicians may wish to avoid defecation risk in the operating room and the risk for gut motility disruption, especially before bowel surgery.\n\n【360】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue laxatives up to the day before surgery but hold on the morning of surgery.\n\n【361】### Immunomodulators\n\n【362】This broad category of agents is used for autoimmune diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, such as IBD, or for transplant-related immunosuppression. One must balance the risks of organ rejection or recrudescence of autoimmune disease with the risk of impaired wound healing and infection risk. Published literature on the perioperative management of these medications is conflicting and includes only small single-center studies.\n\n【363】_Consensus Recommendations:_ For patients taking these agents to prevent solid organ transplant rejection, continue up to and including the day of surgery. For other indications, management must be individualized on the basis of patient and surgical factors, and the risks and benefits of continuation must be discussed with the surgeon and prescribing clinician ( Table 3 ).\n\n【364】Table 3 Summary of Recommendations for the Preoperative Management of Gastrointestinal Immunomodulators\n\n| Medication class | Examples | Management before the morning of surgery | Management on the morning of surgery | Additional considerations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Purine analogues | 6-Mercaptopurine, azathioprine | Continue | Continue | Consult with prescribing clinician and surgeon |\n| Methotrexate |  | Continue | Continue | Consult with prescribing clinician and surgeon |\n| Tofacitinib |  | Withhold for 7 days before surgery | Hold | Consult with the prescribing clinician and surgeon to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption |\n| Ustekinumab |  | Withhold for at least 1 dosing interval before surgeryaThat is, if taken every 4 weeks, schedule surgery 5 weeks after the last dose. | Hold | Consult with the prescribing clinician and surgeon to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption |\n| Natalizumab |  | Withhold for at least 1 dosing interval before surgeryaThat is, if taken every 4 weeks, schedule surgery 5 weeks after the last dose. | Hold | Consult with the prescribing clinician and surgeon to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption |\n| Ozanimod |  | Withhold for at least 60 days before surgery | Hold | Consult with the prescribing clinician and surgeon to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption |\n| Vedolizumab |  | Withhold for at least 1 dosing interval before surgeryaThat is, if taken every 4 weeks, schedule surgery 5 weeks after the last dose. | Hold | Consult with the prescribing clinician and surgeon to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption; perioperative continuation may be reasonable for nonabdominal surgery |\n| Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors | Infliximab (and biosimilars), adalimumab (and biosimilars), golimumab and certolizumab | Withhold for at least 1 dosing interval before surgeryaThat is, if taken every 4 weeks, schedule surgery 5 weeks after the last dose. | Hold | Consult with the prescribing clinician and surgeon to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption |\n\n【366】a That is, if taken every 4 weeks, schedule surgery 5 weeks after the last dose.\n\n【367】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【368】#### Purine Analogues\n\n【369】6-Mercaptopurine and azathioprine have not been found to significantly increase the risk of postoperative complications.\n\n【370】无关删除-2*   Lightner A.L.\n*   Shen B.\n\n【371】Perioperative use of immunosuppressive medications in patients with Crohn's disease in the new \"biological era.\n\n【372】无关删除-2_Gastroenterol Rep (Oxf)._ 2017; 5 : 165-177\n\n【373】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (32)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【374】For patients undergoing arthroplasty, American College of Rheumatology/American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (ACR/AAHKS) guidelines recommend continuing azathioprine uninterrupted through surgery for patients with severe systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【375】无关删除-2*   Goodman S.M.\n*   Springer B.\n*   Guyatt G.\n*   et al.\n\n【376】2017 American College of Rheumatology/American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons guideline for the perioperative management of antirheumatic medication in patients with rheumatic diseases undergoing elective total hip or total knee arthroplasty.\n\n【377】无关删除-2_Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken)._ 2017; 69 : 1111-1124\n\n【378】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (63)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【379】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue purine analogues up to and including the day of surgery but consult with the surgeon and prescribing clinician.\n\n【380】#### Methotrexate\n\n【381】Methotrexate may be used in the treatment of IBD and other autoimmune conditions.

Ozanimod is also associated with increased risk of infections, bradyarrhythmias, and atrioventricular conduction delays, and its use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors is contraindicated because of potential for drug interactions. The mean half-life of active metabolites of ozanimod is approximately 11 days. No data on perioperative safety are available. On the basis of its immunosuppressant effects, we recommend discussion of perioperative management with the prescriber and surgeon and, if interruption of therapy is pursued, holding of ozanimod for 5 half-lives to ensure adequate clearance before surgery.\n\n【438】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Withhold vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and natalizumab for at least 1 dosing interval before surgery.

The mechanism of action in reducing appetite appears to be secondary to central nervous system effects, including stimulation of the hypothalamus to release norepinephrine. Available literature is somewhat variable, but most sources advise withholding before surgery because of the potential for cardiovascular adverse effects, the lack of evidence of serious withdrawal symptoms, and its use for a noncritical indication.\n\n【442】无关删除-2*   Lim S.\n*   Rogers L.K.\n*   Tessler O.\n*   Mundinger G.S.\n*   Rogers C.\n*   Lau F.H.\n\n【443】Phentermine: a systematic review for plastic and reconstructive surgeons.\n\n【444】无关删除-2_Ann Plast Surg._ 2018; 81 : 503-507\n\n【445】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (4)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【446】无关删除-2*   Hendricks E.J.\n*   Greenway F.L.\n\n【447】A study of abrupt phentermine cessation in patients in a weight management program.\n\n【448】无关删除-2_Am J Ther._ 2011; 18 : 292-299\n\n【449】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (25)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【450】无关删除-2*   Fischer S.P.\n*   Schmiesing C.A.\n*   Guta C.G.\n*   Brock-Utne J.G.\n\n【451】General anesthesia and chronic amphetamine use: should the drug be stopped preoperatively?.\n\n【452】无关删除-2_Anesth Analg._ 2006; 103 ( table of contents ) : 203-206\n\n【453】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (37)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【454】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Withhold phentermine for at least 4 days before surgery.\n\n【455】#### Lisdexamfetamine\n\n【456】This medication is used in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and binge eating disorder. It is a sympathomimetic amine that releases catecholamines from presynaptic nerve terminals and may block reuptake of catecholamines by competitive inhibition. Similar to phentermine, this medication has potential for cardiovascular adverse effects and is not associated with serious withdrawal symptoms. However, it has a shorter half-life than phentermine (12 hours vs 24 hours). There is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome when lisdexamfetamine is used concurrently with other serotoninergic drugs, many of which are used perioperatively, including fentanyl and its metabolites and tramadol.\n\n【457】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Withhold lisdexamfetamine for 72 hours before surgery if it is being taken for binge eating disorder. For patients at high risk for relapse of binge eating disorder, the medication may be continued before surgery and held only on the morning of surgery, but this requires discussion with the prescriber and anesthesiologist.\n\n【458】#### Phentermine/Topiramate\n\n【459】Phentermine is described earlier. Topiramate has appetite suppression and satiety enhancement by a variety of mechanisms, including blocking of neuronal voltage-dependent sodium channels, enhancement of γ-aminobutyric acid activity, antagonism of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainite glutamate receptors, and weak inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Topiramate has anticonvulsant activity, and withdrawal of phentermine/topiramate is associated with increased risk for seizures as described in the product prescribing information.\n\n【460】FDA prescribing information.\n\n【461】https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda\\_docs/label/2012/022580s000lbl.pdf\n\n【462】Date accessed: January 21, 2021\n\n【463】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【464】Use of this medication combination can be associated with hypokalemia, hyperchloremic or non–anion gap metabolic acidosis, and increased creatinine concentration.\n\n【465】_Consensus Recommendations_ : Withhold phentermine/topiramate for at least 4 days before surgery. Either wean the patient off the medication during the course of a week before surgery (according to product insert) or, while withholding, provide topiramate alone at the same dose.\n\n【466】#### Orlistat\n\n【467】This agent is a reversible inhibitor of gastric and pancreatic lipases that inhibits absorption of dietary fats. As a result, it exerts its effect with food ingestion and thus has little purpose in the preoperative fasting state. There are no other known adverse effects of perioperative concern.\n\n【468】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue orlistat up to the day before surgery but hold on the morning of surgery.\n\n【469】#### Liraglutide\n\n【470】This treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus is a long-acting analogue of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) that slows gastric emptying and diminishes appetite. It is described in detail in a previously published article in this consensus statement series.\n\n【471】无关删除-2*   Pfeifer K.J.\n*   Selzer A.\n*   Mendez C.E.\n*   et al.\n\n【472】Preoperative management of endocrine, hormonal, and urologic medications: Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) Consensus Statement.\n\n【473】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2021; 96 : 1655-1669\n\n【474】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (7)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【475】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Before the day of surgery, continue GLP-1 agonists unless there is heightened concern for postoperative nausea, vomiting, or gut dysfunction (eg, gastrointestinal surgery). In these situations, consider holding 24 hours for once- or twice-daily preparations and up to 1 week before surgery for weekly preparations (including holding dose within 7 days before surgery). Withhold GLP-1 agonists on the morning of surgery. If a weekly dose is due on the morning of surgery, delay taking it until later in the day after surgery.\n\n【476】#### Bupropion/Naltrexone\n\n【477】This preparation is a combination of an opioid antagonist and an inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake. The weight loss effects are not clearly understood but probably involve the hypothalamus and mesolimbic dopamine circuit. No specific perioperative literature was identified on our review. Because of its blockade of opioid receptors, continuing the medication through procedures requiring opioids for postoperative analgesia is problematic.\n\n【478】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Withhold bupropion/naltrexone for 72 hours before surgery if opioids are expected to be used perioperatively.\n\n【479】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【480】Preoperative medication management is a crucial part of perioperative care. Evidence to guide practice in this area remains deficient, and clinical decision-making is predominantly determined through application of knowledge of medication mechanisms of action and adverse effects. Summarized in Table 1 , Table 2 , Table 3 , this consensus statement provides recommendations of experts in anesthesiology, internal medicine, perioperative medicine, and medical subspecialties for the management of common pulmonary and gastrointestinal medications.\n\n【481】Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------\n\n【482】*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI5MmFkN2EwMjhlYjVkZTg2NTAzNzdjODE2MWIzOWUwMCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDA1OTQ5fQ.WsKlRUO3jq3ioQatw3NG8kEDotb8DUNZ6gxREBPVKOnl2RTcqX0JGL6nz5f3UXvvQf8zJkxWQmShv7NI2ucwEaDrGViyzNlsrH7QKWQwNwrYVqoUO2HViW-sMVaZcHMtTK05WMWLM4sRHKmAQ5xDgvu1dpeaoVI07Yiv-7a5i1ANjui9aFPDO\\_koDPQopjQsmlIexGKofvgY2dvr6T5sBFK9Z6S47EHOireHWH4ow0Dhjjj0tVY2lYTPvdbivhVLkr-ZL4K0\\_8466APuPzV5Gyi25KRSEApxoUtDT7dXYHQsMDiHl-AbWZJbl9yRKAhoIVzMDa5uMwZUrLJ0FSX3lA\n\n【483】    Download .mp4 (42.97 MB)\n\n【484】    Help with .mp4 files\n\n【485】    Supplementary video", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The association of the Doctors Mayo with the Sisters of Saint Francis, dating from the very early days of the practice, clearly reveals common ground shared by medicine and spirituality. A visible demonstration of spirituality at Mayo is a tapestry entitled “Renewal,” which hangs at Rochester Methodist Hospital and exemplifies the contemporary connections between spirituality and the practice of medicine at Mayo Clinic. More commonly, for patients, visitors, and staff alike, the spiritual dimensions of daily life at Mayo are invisible and difficult to articulate. So we treasure the moments when they come to light and are shaped into words. The Mayo historical collection provides glimpses of our founders' understanding of and commitment to the interrelationship of mind, body, and spirit in the whole patient.\n\n【1】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【5】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【7】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【8】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Pinworms are thin and white, measuring about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (about 6 to 13 millimeters) in length.\n\n【2】While the infected person sleeps, female pinworms lay thousands of eggs in the folds of skin surrounding the anus. Most people infected with pinworms have no symptoms, but some people experience anal itching and restless sleep.\n\n【3】Pinworm infection occurs most often in school-age children, and the tiny (microscopic) eggs are easily spread from child to child. Treatment involves oral drugs that kill the pinworms and thorough washing of pajamas, bedding and underwear. For best results, the entire family should be treated.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Symptoms of pinworm infection may include:\n\n【6】*   Itching of the anal or vaginal area\n*   Insomnia, irritability, teeth grinding and restlessness\n*   Occasional stomach pain and nausea\n\n【7】Pinworms often cause no symptoms.\n\n【8】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【9】Consult your doctor if you have severe anal itching, especially at night.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Accidentally swallowing or breathing in pinworm eggs causes a pinworm infection. The tiny (microscopic) eggs can be carried to your mouth by contaminated food, drink or your fingers. Once swallowed, the eggs hatch in the intestines and mature into adult worms within a few weeks.\n\n【12】Female pinworms move to the anal area to lay their eggs, which often results in anal itching. When you scratch the itchy area, the eggs cling to your fingers and get under your fingernails. The eggs then get transferred to other surfaces, such as toys, bedding or toilet seats. The eggs can also be transferred from contaminated fingers to food, liquids, clothes or other people.\n\n【13】Pinworm eggs can survive for two to three weeks on surfaces.\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】Risk factors for pinworm infection include:\n\n【16】*   **Being young.** Pinworm infections are most likely to occur in children ages 5 to 10. The tiny (microscopic) eggs are easily spread to family members, caregivers, or other children at school or child care centers. Pinworm infections are uncommon in children younger than age 2.\n*   **Living in crowded spaces.** People who live in institutions are at higher risk of developing pinworm infections.\n\n【17】Complications\n-------------\n\n【18】Typical pinworm infections don't cause serious problems. In rare circumstances, heavy infestations can cause infection of female genitals.\n\n【19】The parasite can travel from the anal area up the vagina to the uterus, fallopian tubes and around the pelvic organs. This can cause problems such as inflammation of the vagina (vaginitis) and inflammation of the inner lining of the uterus (endometritis).\n\n【20】Although rare, other complications of a pinworm infection may include:\n\n【21】*   Urinary tract infections\n*   Weight loss\n*   Infection of part of the abdomen (peritoneal cavity)\n\n【22】Prevention\n----------\n\n【23】Pinworm eggs can cling to surfaces, including toys, faucets, bedding and toilet seats, for two weeks. So besides regular cleaning of surfaces, methods to help prevent the spread of pinworm eggs or to prevent reinfection include:\n\n【24】*   **Wash in the morning.** Because pinworms lay their eggs at night, washing the anal area in the morning can help reduce the number of pinworm eggs on your body. Showering may help avoid possible re-contamination in bath water.\n*   **Change underwear and bedding daily.** This helps remove eggs.\n*   **Launder in hot water.** Wash bedsheets, pajamas, underwear, washcloths and towels in hot water to help kill pinworm eggs. Dry on high heat.\n*   **Don't scratch.** Avoid scratching the anal area. Trim your child's fingernails so there's less space for eggs to collect. Suggest that your child avoid biting his or her nails.\n*   **Wash your hands.** To reduce your risk of getting or spreading an infection, wash your hands well after using the toilet or changing a diaper and before eating.\n\n【25】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Three patients did not meet inclusion criteria. PET results were considered positive if increased fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake indicated malignancy (24 patients). Results from computed tomography were interpreted as positive if any suspect lesion was consistent with malignancy (26 patients).\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】One hundred four patients with PNS were identified from the PET central database; 73 patients had at least 1 positive result for paraneoplastic antibody, and 31 had antibody-negative PNS. Malignancy was confirmed pathologically in 10 patients, of whom 8 had positive PET results. There were 2 cases of confirmed malignancy (fallopian tube adenocarcinoma and spindle cell uterine carcinoma) for which PET results were negative. Two patients with positive PET results declined biopsy. Computed tomography was able to identify 3 of the 10 malignancies detected. Five cases of malignancy were detected only by PET. All patients with confirmed malignancy had positive results for at least 1 paraneoplastic antibody. One patient with positive results for PNS antibody and negative PET results was diagnosed as having small cell carcinoma on a follow-up PET scan after 27 months. PET had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 80%, 67%, 53%, and 88%, respectively.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】PET scan was shown to be more sensitive than computed tomography for detecting occult malignancy (confirmed by positive test results for autoantibody) among patients with suspected PNS. The greatest clinical utility of PET could be in its high negative predictive value.\n\n【8】CT ( computed tomography ), NPV ( negative predictive value ), PET ( positron emission tomography ), PNS ( paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome ), PPV ( positive predictive value )\n\n【9】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【13】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【15】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

The MMPIs were completed an average of 13.4 years before the QOL assessment. The QOL measures were completed an average of 12.5 years after cancer diagnosis. Patients were divided into quartiles based on their MMPI Optimism-Pessimism scale score. Analysis was performed for all patients, those with head and neck cancer, and those with thyroid cancer. Adjustments were made for age, sex, and disease stage.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】For all 190 patients, optimism was associated with a higher QOL on both the mental and the physical component scales and 6 of 8 subscales of the SF-12 and SF-36. For patients with head and neck cancer, optimism was associated with higher QOL on 3 subscales but neither component scale. For patients with thyroid cancer, optimism was associated with higher QOL on both component scales and 6 subscales. After adjusting for age, sex, and disease stage, optimism was not associated with QOL in the head and neck cancer group.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】Optimism was associated with a higher QOL in survivors of thyroid cancer compared with survivors of head and neck cancer.

Zanosar\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Streptozocin belongs to the group of medicines known as alkylating agents. It is used to treat cancer of the pancreas.\n\n【6】Streptozocin seems to interfere with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. It also directly affects the way the pancreas works. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by streptozocin, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.\n\n【7】Before you begin treatment with streptozocin, you and your doctor should talk about the good this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.\n\n【8】Streptozocin is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Powder for Solution\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】There is no specific information comparing use of streptozocin in children with use in other age groups.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of streptozocin in the elderly with use in other age groups.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【23】### Other Interactions\n\n【24】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【25】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【26】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【27】*   Chickenpox (including recent exposure) or\n*   Herpes zoster (shingles)—Risk of severe disease affecting other parts of the body\n\n【28】*   Type 2 diabetes mellitus—May be worsened\n\n【29】*   Infection—Streptozocin can decrease your body's ability to fight infection\n\n【30】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Effects of streptozocin may be increased because of slower removal from the body\n\n【31】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【32】While you are receiving streptozocin, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids so that you will pass more urine. This will help prevent kidney problems and keep your kidneys working well.\n\n【33】This medicine usually causes nausea and vomiting, which may be severe. However, it is very important that you continue to receive the medicine, even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your health care professional for ways to lessen these effects.\n\n【34】### Dosing\n\n【35】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【36】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【37】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【38】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check for any unwanted effects.\n\n【39】While you are being treated with streptozocin, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Streptozocin may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other people living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have recently taken oral polio vaccine. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.\n\n【40】If streptozocin accidentally seeps out of the vein into which it is injected, it may damage some tissues and cause scarring. Tell the health care professional right away if you notice redness, pain, or swelling at the place of injection.\n\n【41】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【42】Along with their needed effects, medicines like streptozocin can sometimes cause unwanted effects such as kidney problems and other side effects. These and others are described below. Also, because of the way these medicines act on the body, there is a chance that they might cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used. These delayed effects may include certain types of cancer, such as leukemia. Streptozocin has been shown to cause tumors (some cancerous) in animals. Discuss these possible effects with your doctor.\n\n【43】Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【44】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【45】#### Less common\n\n【46】1.  Anxiety, nervousness, or shakiness\n2.  chills, cold sweats, or cool, pale skin\n3.  drowsiness or unusual tiredness or weakness\n4.  fast pulse\n5.  headache\n6.  pain or redness at place of injection\n7.  unusual hunger\n\n【47】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【48】#### Rare\n\n【49】1.  Black, tarry stools\n2.  blood in urine or stools\n3.  cough or hoarseness\n4.  fever or chills\n5.  lower back or side pain\n6.  painful or difficult urination\n7.  pinpoint red spots on skin\n8.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n\n【50】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【51】#### More common\n\n【52】1.  Swelling of feet or lower legs\n2.  unusual decrease in urination\n\n【53】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【54】#### More common\n\n【55】1.  Nausea and vomiting (usually occurs within 2 to 4 hours after receiving dose and may be severe)\n\n【56】#### Less common\n\n【57】1.  Diarrhea\n\n【58】After you stop using this medicine, it may still produce some side effects that need attention. During this period of time, check with your doctor immediately if you notice the following side effects:\n\n【59】#### More common\n\n【60】1.  Decrease in urination\n2.  swelling of feet or lower legs\n\n【61】Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients.

As a result, the esophagus becomes paralyzed and dilated over time and eventually loses the ability to squeeze food down into the stomach. Food then collects in the esophagus, sometimes fermenting and washing back up into the mouth, which can taste bitter. Some people mistake this for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, in achalasia the food is coming from the esophagus, whereas in GERD the material comes from the stomach.\n\n【3】There's no cure for achalasia. Once the esophagus is paralyzed, the muscle cannot work properly again. But symptoms can usually be managed with endoscopy, minimally invasive therapy or surgery.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Achalasia symptoms generally appear gradually and worsen over time. Signs and symptoms may include:\n\n【6】*   Inability to swallow (dysphagia), which may feel like food or drink is stuck in your throat\n*   Regurgitating food or saliva\n*   Heartburn\n*   Belching\n*   Chest pain that comes and goes\n*   Coughing at night\n*   Pneumonia (from aspiration of food into the lungs)\n*   Weight loss\n*   Vomiting\n\n【7】Causes\n------\n\n【8】The exact cause of achalasia is poorly understood. Researchers suspect it may be caused by a loss of nerve cells in the esophagus. There are theories about what causes this, but viral infection or autoimmune responses have been suspected. Very rarely, achalasia may be caused by an inherited genetic disorder or infection.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

His father owned a drug and painting materials business, and young Justus learned to perform chemical experiments in the small laboratory affiliated with the business. Because his interest in chemistry was much greater than his interest in other school subjects, young Justus was apprenticed to an apothecary. However, he left his apprenticeship after less than a year and returned home to continue his chemical experiments.\n\n【2】At the age of 17 years, Liebig went to the University of Bonn (Germany) to study chemistry; he received his doctorate in 1822. Analytical chemistry was not well advanced in Germany at that time, so Liebig obtained a grant from Grand Duke Louis I of Hesse (1753–1830) to study in Paris (France). When Liebig published his work on fulminate of mercury, it came to the attention of the German naturalist and statesman Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), who arranged for Liebig to work with French chemist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac (1778–1850), the master of chemical analysis. Gay-Lussac emphasized the need to pay strict attention to the precise determinations of the composition of substances and directed Liebig to apply these techniques to organic substances.\n\n【3】At the urging of von Humboldt, Louis I had Liebig appointed extraordinary professor at the University of Giessen (Germany) in 1824. Liebig's first goal was to make available to a large number of students the same opportunities that he had had with Gay-Lussac. In collaboration with a mineralogist and a mathematician, Liebig proposed that a pharmaceutical training institute be established. Although the proposal was not approved, Liebig was allowed to set up a laboratory in a military barracks. In 3 years, chemistry dominated the curriculum, and the 20 positions in the laboratory were filled.\n\n【4】Liebig's first laboratory consisted of a single room. He had to buy most of the supplies and pay his assistant from his own salary. The institute was designed to enable students to progress systematically from elementary procedures to independent research under the guidance of an established investigator. The school was successful because of Liebig's analytic skills and teaching ability. As he trained others, he extended his own studies beyond what he could accomplish by himself. This approach-a team of many students with 1 scientist in charge-permitted extensive study of specific subjects. The example soon spread to other experimental sciences. Liebig eventually relinquished the teaching of this system to his assistants, while he worked with advanced students. Two of his assistants, Carl Remigius Fresenius (1818–1897) and Heinrich Will, published textbooks that outlined his methods. Many investigations on the methods for preparing inorganic substances were conducted in Liebig's laboratory.\n\n【5】In 1829, Liebig completed an extensive study of the decomposition of various chemical combinations by the use of chlorine. He and Friedrich Wöhler (1800–1882), who previously had synthesized urea, studied the composition of uric acid. In his studies of urea, Liebig discovered a compound he named “hippuric acid.” He also developed methods to analyze nonnitrogenous compounds. In 1835, Liebig discovered aldehydes. He was able to analyze many more compounds in a shorter time than his competitors because he could entrust the analyses to his students. With the help of many students, his laboratory produced hundreds of analyses annually.\n\n【6】Liebig was at the peak of his experimental productivity in the late 1830s. His grasp of theoretical issues was firm but also more flexible than before. Additional financial support allowed him to expand his training and research programs. In 1840, English physician-chemist Henry Bence Jones (1814–1873) spent 6 months in Liebig's laboratory studying his analytic techniques.\n\n【7】During these years, Liebig had disagreements with French chemists Jean-Baptiste-André Dumas (1800–1884) and Théophile-Jules Pelouze (1807–1867), as well as Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius (1779–1848), concerning Dumas' ether theory.\n\n【8】Liebig's major contributions to organic chemistry were based on the methods that he devised or refined and the many compounds and reactions that he discovered or described. Although few of his theories were original, he was considered the leading chemist of his day.\n\n【9】Turning his attention to agricultural chemistry, Liebig analyzed straw, hay, and fruits and concluded that the same land, whether cultivated or forested, produced the same total quantity of carbon in the composition of whatever plants grew on it. When he examined the alkaline earth elements in plants, he noted that those grown in various localities contained different proportions of metals. For example, pine trees in one region contained magnesium, whereas those in another region did not. He theorized that the differences were due to compounds in the soil and that the role of fertilizer is to supply ammonia and such salts as potassium silicate, calcium phosphate, and magnesium phosphate. He refuted the theory that humus was one of the main nutrients for plant growth. He believed that nitrogen was supplied by means of ammonia washed out of the atmosphere, that the role of fertilizer was to add elements that plants could not obtain from the atmosphere, and that the best source of phosphorus was pulverized animal bones. Subsequently, he revised his previous opinion and stated that farmers should supplement the natural supply of nitrogen by adding ammonium salts. He still maintained that mineral nutrients were essential for fertilizers.\n\n【10】In 1845, Liebig developed a formula for making artificial fertilizers using mineral salts, but his fertilizers did not increase the crop yield. To provide answers, Liebig purchased a plot of land near Giessen and began to study the effect of his fertilizer. In 4 years, he was able to convert the plot into a fertile field. He finally realized that the delayed benefit was due to the fusion of potash with calcium carbonate in the soil. Because this compound is insoluble, plant roots cannot absorb it.\n\n【11】In another study, Liebig's fertilizers did not improve the yield, but the addition of ammonium salts did. Critics claimed that Liebig's mineral theory was invalid. However, Liebig argued that he had never said that agricultural yields were dependent only on the mineral constituents in the soil or that one should not add ammonia. He argued that, in most cases, it is superfluous to add ammonia and that fertilizers cannot be evaluated by their nitrogen content. He again stated that nitrogen is replenished from the atmosphere but that the minerals come only from the soil. He emphasized that a single constituent will increase the crop yield only if the other necessary elements also are present in greater quantities. Consequently, few of the essential minerals might become the controlling factor. This generalization became known as Liebig's “Law of the Minimum.” In 1862, he published the seventh and last edition of his _Chemistry and Its Applications to Agriculture and Physiology_ .\n\n【12】Liebig became interested in the chemical aspects of physiology and maintained that animal heat was produced solely by the oxidation of nutrients to carbon dioxide and water. He claimed that animals could convert dietary starch to fat, contrary to the view of French chemists that the source of fat was plant nutrients. Liebig and his students also made contributions to the dye industry. His assistant, August W. von Hofmann (1818–1892), analyzed a light oil from the distillation of coal tar and isolated aniline. Hofmann substituted other organic radicals for the remaining hydrogen atoms in aniline and thus laid the foundation for the synthetic dye industry.\n\n【13】Liebig tired of teaching and moved to Munich (southern Germany) in 1852, where a laboratory had been built for him. This laboratory was small, and he had only a few selected assistants and students. He spent most of his time writing and developed a series of evening talks on scientific topics of broad interest. He died in Munich on April 18, 1873, at the age of 69 years, the day after the death of his old friend and student Henry Bence Jones. Liebig was honored on a stamp issued by Germany in 1953 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of his birth and another issued by the German Democratic Republic in 1978.\n\n【14】Article info\n------------\n\n【15】### Identification\n\n【16】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/76.9.921\n\n【17】### Copyright\n\n【18】© 2001 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

However, not anticoagulating high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation can lead to cardioembolic stroke, another disastrous outcome. Physicians may tend to avoid blame by inaction, which can result in underprescribing. Such clinical inertia is not unique to anticoagulating patients with atrial fibrillation. Clinical inertia has been noted in the treatment of several common chronic conditions, such as treating blood pressure in patients with hypertension and treating hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus. To combat clinical inertia, some have suggested the need to structure routine practice where resolution of symptoms is not sufficient to guide care, such that clinically recommended guidelines and targets are pursued and achieved.\n\n【1】无关删除-2*   Phillips L.S.\n*   Branch W.T.\n*   Cook C.B.\n*   Doyle J.P.\n*   El-Kebbi I.M.\n*   Gallina D.L.\n*   et al.\n\n【2】Clinical inertia.\n\n【3】无关删除-2_Ann Intern Med._ 2001; 135 : 825-834\n\n【4】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1180)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【5】To help physicians make well-informed decisions about anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, several practical clinical tools have been created and validated in diverse populations to help balance risks and benefits. The HAS-BLED score was designed to predict the one-year risk of major hemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation. To calculate the HAS-BLED score you need to know: age; medical history of hypertension, renal dialysis or renal transplant, cirrhosis, stroke, major bleeding, and alcohol or drug use; medications; and routine laboratory studies including creatinine, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and trends in prior international normalized ratios. The CHA2DS2-VASc score was designed to predict the one year risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation who are not anticoagulated. To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score you need to know: age; sex; and medical history of heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, transient ischemic attack, other thromboembolism, peripheral artery diseases, myocardial infarction, and aortic plaque.\n\n【6】As reflected in the HAS-BLED score, much has been learned about clinical predictors of ICH through careful analysis of large epidemiological studies and randomized trials. However, it is important to consider what the HAS-BLED lacks. The score incorporates no direct or indirect insights into the state of the cerebral vessels in patients being considered for anticoagulation. Insights into the state of cerebral vessels may help to stratify risk of hemorrhage more effectively than can be done on the basis of scores that rely only on demographic and clinical characteristics. A neuropathological process associated with ICH is cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The pathology consists of progressive loss of smooth muscle cells with accumulation of an eosinophilic hyaline material, mostly composed of amyloid-β40.\n\n【7】无关删除-2*   Charidimou A.\n*   Boulouis G.\n*   Gurol M.E.\n*   Ayata C.\n*   Bacskai B.J.\n*   Frosch M.P.\n*   et al.\n\n【8】Emerging concepts in sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy.\n\n【9】无关删除-2_Brain._ 2017; 140 : 1829-1850\n\n【10】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (265)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【11】When severely affected, vessels with amyloid angiopathy show detachment and delamination in the tunica media and fibrinoid necrosis. When a cerebral vessel ruptures, it leads to parenchymal, typically lobar, hemorrhage presenting clinically as stroke. Less commonly recognized is the ability of CAA to present with subacute focal symptoms as an amyloidoma, progressive dementia, or transient neurologic deficits.\n\n【12】无关删除-2*   Wermer M.J.H.\n*   Greenberg S.M.\n\n【13】The growing clinical spectrum of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.\n\n【14】无关删除-2_Curr Opin Neurol._ 2018; 31 : 28-35\n\n【15】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (52)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【16】Though a definitive diagnosis of CAA requires the examination of brain tissue, a diagnosis can be inferred on the basis of clinical and radiographic information. The most widely used criteria for making an antemortem diagnosis of CAA is the modified Boston Criteria.

The review identified 65 patients; slightly more than half of the patients had possible or probable CAA based on the modified Boston Criteria. The HAS-BLED scores were significantly lower on average in patients who had evidence of CAA than patients without evidence of CAA. The implication is that, other clinical factors being equal, patients with CAA have a lower threshold for ICH than patients without CAA. The investigators also found that among those patients with evidence of CAA, the HAS-BLED score tended to underestimate the risk of recurrent ICH. What this means in practical terms is that clinicians should review, when available, prior brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in patients before starting or continuing anticoagulation and proceed with greater caution if the MRI demonstrates signs of CAA.\n\n【23】The Olmsted County study was not racially or ethnically diverse. Only 2 patients were nonwhite. This does not invalidate or make any less important the results of the study, but it does mean that additional studied are needed in diverse populations before assuming that the results apply to all patients.

His research explained how the immune system can produce a vast diversity of antibodies, each of which reacts with and counteracts the effects of a separate antigen (a foreign molecule or microbe). He demonstrated how only a limited number of genes could be rearranged to produce millions of different antibodies in an individual, thus revealing a fundamental mechanism in the immune system.\n\n【2】Tonegawa was born on September 6, 1939, in Nagoya, Japan, on the southern part of Honshu Island. He was the second child in the family, having an older brother and a younger brother and sister. His father was an engineer for a textile company. Early in his life, Tonegawa lived in several small rural towns as the family moved to accommodate his father's jobs. When he was an adolescent, Tonegawa and his brother were sent to Tokyo to live with relatives so that they could receive a better education. He attended the prestigious Hibiya High School in Tokyo, from which he graduated in 1959. While in high school, he developed an interest in chemistry.\n\n【3】In 1959, Tonegawa entered the Imperial University of Kyoto (about 50 miles west of his birthplace), from which he received a BS degree in chemistry in 1963. While at the Imperial University, he became interested in molecular biology. To further his education, Tonegawa went to the United States in 1963 to attend the University of California, San Diego. From 1963 to 1964, he was a research assistant and became a teaching assistant in 1964. For 4 years (1964-1968), he taught and pursued graduate work, earning a PhD degree in molecular biology in 1968.\n\n【4】Tonegawa then accepted a postdoctoral position at the Salk Institute in San Diego, where he worked for 2 years (1968-1970). Because his visa expired in 1970, Tonegawa was required by law to leave the United States for 2 years before he could receive another visa. In 1971, he received a Fulbright travel grant, which enabled him to go to Switzerland, where he became a member of the Basel Institute of Immunology. Instead of returning to the United States after 2 years, he remained in Switzerland until 1981. It was in Basel that he performed most of the work for which he received the Nobel Prize.\n\n【5】In 1981, Tonegawa returned to the United States and joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA. There, he became a professor of molecular biology at the Center of Cancer Research, conducting research and teaching in the Department of Biology.\n\n【6】Besides the Nobel Prize, Tonegawa has received many honors and awards, one of which was the Albert Lasker Medical Award (1987). He was honored on a stamp (Scott No. 1635c) issued by Gambia in 1995, on a sheet of stamps honoring Nobel laureates.\n\n【7】Article info\n------------\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/mcp.2011.0033\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2011 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Also, progesterone is given to help maintain a pregnancy when not enough of it is made by the body.\n*   To prevent estrogen from thickening the lining of the uterus (endometrial hyperplasia) in women around menopause who are being treated with estrogen for ovarian hormone therapy (OHT). OHT is also called hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT).\n*   To treat pain that is related to endometriosis, a condition where the endometrial tissue which lines the uterus becomes displaced in other female organs.\n*   To treat a condition called endometriosis, to help prevent endometrial hyperplasia, or to treat unusual and heavy bleeding of the uterus (dysfunctional uterine bleeding) by starting or stopping the menstrual cycle.\n*   To help treat cancer of the breast, kidney, or uterus. Progestins help change the cancer cell's ability to react to other hormones and proteins that cause tumor growth. In this way, progestins can stop the growth of a tumor.\n*   To test the body's production of certain hormones such as estrogen.\n*   To treat loss of appetite and severe weight or muscle loss in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or cancer by causing certain proteins to be produced that cause increased appetite and weight gain.\n\n【10】Progestins may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.\n\n【11】Depending on how much and which progestin you use or take, a progestin can have different effects. For instance, high doses of progesterone are necessary for some women to continue a pregnancy while other progestins in low doses can prevent a pregnancy from occurring. Other effects include causing weight gain, increasing body temperature, developing the milk-producing glands for breast-feeding, and relaxing the uterus to maintain a pregnancy.\n\n【12】Progestins can help other hormones work properly. Progestins may help to prevent anemia (low iron in blood), too much menstrual blood loss, and cancer of the uterus.\n\n【13】Progestins are available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【14】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【15】*   Tablet\n*   Suspension\n*   Gel/Jelly\n*   Capsule, Liquid Filled\n*   Capsule\n*   Suppository\n*   Kit\n\n【16】Before Using\n------------\n\n【17】### Allergies\n\n【18】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【19】### Pediatric\n\n【20】Although there is no specific information comparing use of progestins in children or teenagers with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children or teenagers than it does in adults.\n\n【21】### Geriatric\n\n【22】This medicine has been tested and has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.\n\n【23】### Pregnancy\n\n【24】Progesterone, a natural hormone that the body makes during pregnancy, has not caused problems. In fact, it is sometimes used in women to treat a certain type of infertility and to aid in egg donor or infertility procedures.\n\n【25】Other progestins have not been studied in pregnant women. Be sure to tell your doctor if you become pregnant while using any of the progestins. It is best to use some kind of birth control method while you are receiving progestins in high doses. High doses of progestins are not recommended for use during pregnancy since there have been some reports that they may cause birth defects in the genitals (sex organs) of a male fetus. Also, some of these progestins may cause male-like changes in a female fetus and female-like changes in a male fetus, but these problems usually can be reversed. Low doses of progestins, such as those doses used for contraception, have not caused major problems when used accidentally during pregnancy.\n\n【26】### Breastfeeding\n\n【27】Although progestins pass into the breast milk, they have not been shown to cause problems in nursing babies. However, progestins may change the quality or amount (increase or decrease) of the mother's breast milk. It may be necessary for you to take another medicine or to stop breast-feeding during treatment. Be sure you have discussed the risks and benefits of the medicine with your doctor.\n\n【28】### Drug Interactions\n\n【29】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【30】Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with a medication in this class or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【31】*   Boceprevir\n*   Cobicistat\n*   Dofetilide\n*   Tranexamic Acid\n\n【32】Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【33】*   Abametapir\n*   Amobarbital\n*   Amoxicillin\n*   Ampicillin\n*   Amprenavir\n*   Apalutamide\n*   Aprepitant\n*   Aprobarbital\n*   Armodafinil\n*   Artemether\n*   Bacampicillin\n*   Barbital\n*   Belzutifan\n*   Betamethasone\n*   Bexarotene\n*   Boceprevir\n*   Bosentan\n*   Butabarbital\n*   Butalbital\n*   Carbamazepine\n*   Carbenicillin\n*   Cefaclor\n*   Cefadroxil\n*   Cefdinir\n*   Cefditoren\n*   Cefixime\n*   Cefpodoxime\n*   Cefprozil\n*   Ceftazidime\n*   Ceftibuten\n*   Cefuroxime\n*   Cenobamate\n*   Ceritinib\n*   Clobazam\n*   Cloxacillin\n*   Colesevelam\n*   Conivaptan\n*   Cyclacillin\n*   Cyclosporine\n*   Dabrafenib\n*   Darunavir\n*   Dexamethasone\n*   Dicloxacillin\n*   Dipyrone\n*   Doxycycline\n*   Efavirenz\n*   Elagolix\n*   Elvitegravir\n*   Encorafenib\n*   Enzalutamide\n*   Eslicarbazepine Acetate\n*   Eterobarb\n*   Etravirine\n*   Fedratinib\n*   Felbamate\n*   Fexinidazole\n*   Fosamprenavir\n*   Fosaprepitant\n*   Fosnetupitant\n*   Fosphenytoin\n*   Grazoprevir\n*   Griseofulvin\n*   Guar Gum\n*   Heptabarbital\n*   Hexobarbital\n*   Indinavir\n*   Isotretinoin\n*   Itraconazole\n*   Ivosidenib\n*   Lesinurad\n*   Lixisenatide\n*   Lopinavir\n*   Lorlatinib\n*   Lumacaftor\n*   Mavacamten\n*   Mephobarbital\n*   Methohexital\n*   Minocycline\n*   Mitapivat\n*   Mitotane\n*   Mobocertinib\n*   Modafinil\n*   Mycophenolate Mofetil\n*   Mycophenolic Acid\n*   Nafcillin\n*   Nelfinavir\n*   Netupitant\n*   Nevirapine\n*   Octreotide\n*   Omaveloxolone\n*   Oxacillin\n*   Oxcarbazepine\n*   Oxytetracycline\n*   Penicillin G\n*   Penicillin G Procaine\n*   Penicillin V\n*   Pentobarbital\n*   Phenobarbital\n*   Phenylbutazone\n*   Phenytoin\n*   Pitolisant\n*   Prednisolone\n*   Prednisone\n*   Primidone\n*   Red Clover\n*   Rifabutin\n*   Rifampin\n*   Rifapentine\n*   Rilpivirine\n*   Ritonavir\n*   Rufinamide\n*   Saquinavir\n*   Secobarbital\n*   Simeprevir\n*   St John's Wort\n*   Sugammadex\n*   Sultamicillin\n*   Tazemetostat\n*   Telaprevir\n*   Telotristat Ethyl\n*   Tetracycline\n*   Theophylline\n*   Thiopental\n*   Thioridazine\n*   Ticarcillin\n*   Tigecycline\n*   Tipranavir\n*   Tirzepatide\n*   Tizanidine\n*   Topiramate\n*   Troglitazone\n*   Ulipristal\n*   Voxilaprevir\n*   Warfarin\n\n【34】### Other Interactions\n\n【35】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【36】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【37】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【38】*   Asthma or\n*   Epilepsy (or history of) or\n*   Heart or circulation problems or\n*   Kidney disease (severe) or\n*   Migraine headaches—Progestins may cause fluid retention which may cause these conditions to become worse.\n\n【39】*   Bleeding problems, undiagnosed, such as blood in the urine or changes in vaginal bleeding—May make diagnosis of these problems more difficult.\n\n【40】*   Blood clots, or history of or\n*   Breast cancer, or history of or\n*   Deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg), active or history of or\n*   Heart attack, active or history of or\n*   Liver disease, including jaundice, or history of or\n*   Pulmonary embolism (clot in the lung), active or history of or\n*   Stroke , active or history of or\n*   Venous thromboembolism (clot in the veins), or history of—Progestins should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【41】*   Breast disease (such as breast lumps or cysts), history of—May make this condition worse for diseases that do not react in a positive way to progestins.\n\n【42】*   Diabetes mellitus—May cause an increase in your blood sugar and a change in the amount of medicine you take for diabetes; progestins in high doses are more likely to cause this problem.\n\n【43】*   Memory loss (dementia)—May make this condition worse.\n\n【44】*   Vision changes—This medicine may cause changes in vision; your medicine may need to be stopped if these conditions become worse.\n\n【45】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【46】To make the use of a progestin as safe and reliable as possible, you should understand how and when to take it and what effects may be expected. Progestins usually come with patient directions. Read them carefully before taking or using this medicine.\n\n【47】Take this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects. Try to take the medicine at the same time each day to reduce the possibility of side effects and to allow it to work better.\n\n【48】Progestins are often given together with certain medicines. If you are using a combination of medicines, make sure that you take each one at the proper time and do not mix them. Ask your health care professional to help you plan a way to remember to take your medicines at the right times.\n\n【49】### Dosing\n\n【50】The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【51】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【52】#### For medroxyprogesterone\n\n【53】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   For controlling unusual and heavy bleeding of the uterus (dysfunctional uterine bleeding) or treating unusual stopping of menstrual periods (amenorrhea):\n        *   Adults and teenagers—5 to 10 milligrams (mg) per day for five to ten days as directed by your doctor.\n    *   For preparing the uterus for the menstrual period:\n        *   Adults and teenagers—10 milligrams (mg) per day for five or ten days as directed by your doctor.\n    *   For preventing estrogen from thickening the lining of the uterus (endometrial hyperplasia) when taking estrogen for ovarian hormone therapy in postmenopausal women:\n        *   Adults—When taking estrogen each day on Days 1 through 25: Oral, 5 to 10 milligrams (mg) of medroxyprogesterone per day for ten to fourteen or more days each month as directed by your doctor.

Your doctor may want you to receive the medicine for up to eleven weeks.\n\n【60】### Missed Dose\n\n【61】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【62】For all progestins, except for progesterone capsules for postmenopausal women: If you miss a dose of this medicine, take the missed dose as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【63】For progesterone capsules for postmenopausal women: If you miss a dose of 200 mg of progesterone capsules at bedtime, take 100 mg in the morning then go back to your regular dosing schedule. If you take 300 mg of progesterone a day and you miss your morning and evening doses, you should not take the missed dose. Return to your regular dosing schedule.\n\n【64】### Storage\n\n【65】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【66】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【67】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【68】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【69】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits. This will allow for your dosage to be adjusted and for any unwanted effects to be detected. These visits will usually be every 6 to 12 months, but some doctors require them more often.\n\n【70】The Prometrium® capsules contain peanut oil. If you have an allergy to peanuts, make sure your doctor knows this before you take this brand of progestin.\n\n【71】Progestins may cause some people to become dizzy. For oral or vaginal progesterone, dizziness or drowsiness may occur 1 to 4 hours after taking or using it. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert.\n\n【72】Unusual or unexpected vaginal bleeding of various amounts may occur between your regular menstrual periods during the first 3 months of use. This is sometimes called spotting when slight, or breakthrough menstrual bleeding when heavier. If this should occur, continue on your regular dosing schedule. Check with your doctor:\n\n【73】*   If unusual or unexpected vaginal bleeding continues for an unusually long time.\n*   If your menstrual period has not started within 45 days of your last period.\n\n【74】Missed menstrual periods may occur. If you suspect a pregnancy, you should stop taking this medicine immediately and call your doctor. Your doctor will let you know if you should continue taking the progestin.\n\n【75】If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your health care professional that you are taking a progestin. Progestins can change certain test results.\n\n【76】In some patients, tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of the gums may occur. Brushing and flossing your teeth carefully and regularly and massaging your gums may help prevent this. See your dentist regularly to have your teeth cleaned. Check with your medical doctor or dentist if you have any questions about how to take care of your teeth and gums, or if you notice any tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of your gums.\n\n【77】You will need to use a birth control method while taking progestins for noncontraceptive use if you are fertile and sexually active.\n\n【78】If you are using vaginal progesterone, avoid using other vaginal products for 6 hours before and for 6 hours after inserting the vaginal dose of progesterone.\n\n【79】Since it is possible that certain doses of progestins may cause temporary thinning of the bones by changing your hormone balance, it is important that your doctor know if you have an increased risk of osteoporosis. Some things that can increase your risk for having osteoporosis include cigarette smoking, abusing alcohol, taking or drinking large amounts of caffeine, and having a family history of osteoporosis or easily broken bones. Some medicines, such as glucocorticoids (cortisone-like medicines) or anticonvulsants (seizure medicine), can also cause thinning of the bones. However, it is thought that progestins can help protect against osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.\n\n【80】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【81】Along with their needed effects, progestins used in high doses sometimes cause some unwanted effects such as blood clots, heart attacks, and strokes, or problems of the liver and eyes. Although these effects are rare, some of them can be very serious and cause death. It is not clear if these problems are due to the progestin. They may be caused by the disease or condition for which progestins are being used.\n\n【82】The following side effects may be caused by blood clots. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they need immediate medical attention.\n\n【83】Get emergency help immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【84】#### Rare\n\n【85】1.  Symptoms of blood clotting problems, usually severe or sudden, such as:\n2.  headache or migraine\n3.  loss of or change in speech, coordination, or vision\n4.  numbness of or pain in chest, arm, or leg\n5.  unexplained shortness of breath\n\n【86】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【87】#### More common\n\n【88】1.  Changes in vaginal bleeding (increased amounts of menstrual bleeding occurring at regular monthly periods, lighter vaginal bleeding between menstrual periods, heavier vaginal bleeding between regular monthly periods, or stopping of menstrual periods)\n2.  symptoms of blood sugar problems (dry mouth, frequent urination, loss of appetite, or unusual thirst)\n\n【89】#### Less common\n\n【90】1.  Mental depression\n2.  skin rash\n3.  unexpected or increased flow of breast milk\n\n【91】#### Rare\n\n【92】##### For megestrol—During chronic treatment\n\n【93】1.  Backache\n2.  dizziness\n3.  filling or rounding out of the face\n4.  irritability\n5.  mental depression\n6.  nausea or vomiting\n7.  unusual decrease in sexual desire or ability in men\n8.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n\n【94】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【95】#### More common\n\n【96】1.  Abdominal pain or cramping\n2.  bloating or swelling of ankles or feet\n3.  blood pressure increase (mild)\n4.  dizziness\n5.  drowsiness (progesterone only)\n6.  headache (mild)\n7.  mood changes\n8.  nervousness\n9.  pain or irritation at place of injection site\n10.  swelling of face, ankles, or feet\n11.  unusual or rapid weight gain\n\n【97】#### Less common\n\n【98】1.  Acne\n2.  breast pain or tenderness\n3.  brown spots on exposed skin, possibly long-lasting\n4.  hot flashes\n5.  loss or gain of body, facial, or scalp hair\n6.  loss of sexual desire\n7.  trouble in sleeping\n\n【99】Not all of the side effects listed above have been reported for each of these medicines, but they have been reported for at least one of them. All of the progestins are similar, so any of the above side effects may occur with any of these medicines.\n\n【100】After you stop using this medicine, your body may need time to adjust. The length of time this takes depends on the amount of medicine you were using and how long you used it. During this period of time check with your doctor if you notice the following side effect:\n\n【101】#### For megestrol\n\n【102】1.  Dizziness\n2.  nausea or vomiting\n3.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n\n【103】Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients. If you notice any other effects, check with your healthcare professional.\n\n【104】无关删除-1Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

{"seq_id": "5333510d-2119-411f-bdea-7eab97333bac", "title": "Keratoconus", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Keratoconus (ker-uh-toe-KOH-nus) is an eye condition in which your cornea — the clear, dome-shaped front of your eye — gets thinner and gradually bulges outward into a cone shape.\n\n【2】A cone-shaped cornea causes blurred vision and may cause sensitivity to light and glare. Keratoconus usually affects both eyes. However, it can affect one eye more than the other. It generally begins to affect people between the late teens and 30 years of age. The condition may progress slowly for 10 years or longer.\n\n【3】In the early stages of keratoconus, you might be able to correct vision problems with glasses or soft contact lenses. Later, you may have to be fitted with rigid, gas permeable contact lenses or other types of lenses, such as scleral lenses. If your condition gets worse, you may need a cornea transplant.\n\n【4】A procedure called corneal collagen cross-linking may help to slow or stop keratoconus from progressing, possibly preventing the need for a future cornea transplant. This treatment may be offered in addition to the vision correction options above.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Symptoms of keratoconus may change as the disease progresses. They include:\n\n【7】*   Blurred or distorted vision.\n*   Increased sensitivity to bright light and glare, which can cause problems with night driving.\n*   A need for frequent changes in eyeglass prescriptions.\n*   Sudden worsening or clouding of vision.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】See your eye doctor if your eyesight is worsening rapidly, which might be caused by an irregular curvature of the eye, called astigmatism. Your eye doctor also may look for signs of keratoconus during routine eye exams.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】No one knows what causes keratoconus, although genetic and environmental factors are thought to be involved. Around 1 in 10 people with keratoconus also has a parent with the condition.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】These factors can increase your chances of developing keratoconus:\n\n【14】*   Having a family history of keratoconus.\n*   Rubbing your eyes vigorously.\n*   Having certain conditions, such as retinitis pigmentosa, Down syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, hay fever and asthma.\n\n【15】Complications\n-------------\n\n【16】In some situations, your cornea may swell quickly and cause sudden reduced vision and scarring of the cornea. This is caused by a condition in which the inside lining of your cornea, called Descemet's membrane, breaks down. This causes fluid to enter the cornea, a condition known as hydrops.

Although strides have been made in the treatment of some risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, surprisingly, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) continues to be ignored as a risk factor in cardiology. It is embarrassing to think that patients may undergo canalization of their femoral arteries and angiography of their coronary arteries with no real thought given to the ascertainment of arterial disease in noncoronary segments. In the current issue of the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , Singh et al\n\n【1】*   Singh M\n*   Lennon RJ\n*   Darbar D\n*   Gersh BJ\n*   Holmes Jr, DR\n*   Rihal CS\n\n【2】Effect of peripheral arterial disease in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with intracoronary stents.\n\n【3】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2004; 79 : 1113-1118\n\n【4】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (61)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【5】call attention to the prevalence of manifest PAD in the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) population-18%-a number worthy of our notice. Furthermore, the in-hospital and long-term outcomes of patients with PAD are substantially worse than the outcomes of patients without PAD. This study, which included 1397 patients with PAD, is one of the largest of its kind.\n\n【6】Identification of PAD serves several useful purposes. Singh et al show that PAD identifies a patient population at particular risk of ischemic complications in both the short term and long term. In-hospital mortality rates were 3 times higher in patients with PAD compared with those without PAD-an important observation by Singh et al. Rates of inhospital myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient ischemic attack were also higher, whereas rates of procedural success were lower. Other studies in contemporary PCI literature have corroborated this elevated risk for patients with PAD.\n\n【7】*   Chiu JH\n*   Topol EJ\n*   Whitlow PL\n*   et al.\n\n【8】Peripheral vascular disease and one-year mortality following percutaneous coronary revascularization.\n\n【9】无关删除-2_Am J Cardiol._ 2003; 92 : 582-583\n\n【10】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (35)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【11】*   Nikolsky E\n*   Mehran R\n*   Mintz GS\n*   et al.\n\n【12】Impact of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease on 1-year mortality in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions.\n\n【13】无关删除-2_J Endovasc Ther._ 2004; 11 : 60-70\n\n【14】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (41)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【15】Despite the fact that PAD poses a specific hazard to patients undergoing PCI, it is encouraging that Singh et al found that results of PCI have improved in recent years. This is due in large part to routine coronary stenting and superior generations of stents that are easier to deploy. Advances in pharmacotherapy such as intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition and clopidogrel also have contributed to this improvement. Ongoing advances such as the incorporation of drug-eluting stents into routine practice will likely further improve the results obtained with PCI in patients with PAD, although this is unlikely to eliminate the gap between patients with and without PAD on end points such as death.\n\n【16】The rates of stroke as a complication of PCI were extremely low in this study; however, it is notable that the rate of stroke was twice as high in patients with PAD (0.6%), emphasizing again the need for special care during catheterization of patients with PAD. Use of smaller-diameter catheters and exchange length wires for all catheter exchanges may help minimize the embolic potential in patients with PAD. Also, patients with PAD who undergo PCI have a higher risk of bleeding complications. Singh et al report a risk of bleeding that is essentially doubled with PAD, with a transfusion rate of 11% vs 5.8%. Vascular access may be more complicated due to the presence of atherosclerosis and calcification in the artery being punctured. Potentially, improvements in adjunctive pharmacotherapy such as use of the direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin instead of heparin could minimize this bleeding hazard in patients with PAD.\n\n【17】*   Bhatt DL\n\n【18】Heparin in peripheral vascular intervention—time for a change?.\n\n【19】无关删除-2_J Invasive Cardiol._ 2003; 15 : 249-250\n\n【20】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【21】More effective methods to provide hemostasis after arterial sheath removal also are being explored.\n\n【22】Singh et al are to be commended for the comprehensive definition of PAD used in their study, which includes disease of the cranial and extracranial arteries, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and lower extremity arterial disease. It is appropriate that cerebrovascular disease be included in this definition. Indeed, the patient with involvement of 1 arterial bed has a high likelihood of either symptomatic or asymptomatic involvement of another arterial bed, and this global approach to atherothrombosis is the direction in which the field is heading.\n\n【23】*   Chan AW\n\n【24】Expanding roles of the cardiovascular specialists in panvascular disease prevention and treatment.\n\n【25】无关删除-2_Can J Cardiol._ 2004; 20 : 535-544\n\n【26】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【27】*   Jaff MR\n\n【28】Clinical evaluation and options for infrainguinal atherosclerosis therapy: when to intervene?.\n\n【29】无关删除-2_J Interv Cardiol._ 2001; 14 : 529-532\n\n【30】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【31】Several simple measures could be instituted to detect PAD in patients requiring catheterization ( Figure 1 ). Blood pressure levels should be measured in both arms to screen for subclavian artery stenosis, a particular concern in patients who have or may later receive internal mammary artery bypass grafts. All pulses should be examined carefully, including listening for carotid, subclavian, and femoral artery bruits. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements also would be useful to screen for PAD.\n\n【32】*   Resnick HE\n*   Lindsay RS\n*   McDermott MM\n*   et al.\n\n【33】Relationship of high and low ankle brachial index to all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality: the Strong Heart Study.\n\n【34】无关删除-2_Circulation._ 2004; 109 : 733-739\n\n【35】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (772)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【36】Indeed, since blood pressure levels and pedal pulses are recorded routinely anyway, incorporation of ABI measurements would seem to be a natural step in the catheterization laboratory assessment as an extension of the physical examination.\n\n【37】*   Dieter RS\n*   Tomasson J\n*   Gudjonsson T\n*   et al.\n\n【38】Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease in hospitalized patients with coronary artery disease.\n\n【39】无关删除-2_Vasc Med._ 2003; 8 : 233-236\n\n【40】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (91)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【41】Of course, a normal resting ABI would not rule out PAD; an exercise ABI should be obtained if claudication is clinically suspected. However, for PAD screening, a resting ABI would be a good start. In patients with hypertension and/or renal insufficiency, renal artery stenosis (RAS) should be considered a possible contributory factor, with perhaps noninvasive or invasive screening. In a catheterization laboratory setting, angiography may be an expedient screen for RAS. As suggested by prior work from the Mayo Clinic, RAS is highly prevalent among patients undergoing coronary angiography, particularly in those with hypertension, and screening abdominal angiography should be considered.\n\n【42】*   Rihal CS\n*   Textor SC\n*   Breen JF\n*   et al.\n\n【43】Incidental renal artery stenosis among a prospective cohort of hypertensive patients undergoing coronary angiography.\n\n【44】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2002; 77 : 309-316\n\n【45】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (204)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【46】Other groups have confirmed these observations regarding the prevalence of previously undiagnosed RAS in the catheterization laboratory, with a potential benefit of percutaneous revascularization.\n\n【47】*   White CJ\n\n【48】Screening renal artery angiography at the time of cardiac catheterization \\[editorial\\].\n\n【49】无关删除-2_Catheter Cardiovasc Interv._ 2003; 60 : 295-296\n\n【50】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (6)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【51】*   Khosla S\n*   Kunjummen B\n*   Manda R\n*   et al.\n\n【52】Prevalence of renal artery stenosis requiring revascularization in patients initially referred for coronary angiography.\n\n【53】无关删除-2_Catheter Cardiovasc Interv._ 2003; 58 : 400-403\n\n【54】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (60)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【55】*   Bhatt DL\n\n【56】Embolization—a pathological mechanism in renal artery stenosis.\n\n【57】无关删除-2_J Invasive Cardiol._ 2004; 16 : 196-197\n\n【58】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【59】FIGURE 1 Algorithm for identifying peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with coronary artery disease serious enough to warrant percutaneous (or surgical) revascularization.

The Well Physician–California program, designed by the Stanford University WellMD Center and funded by the California Medical Association, includes the full spectrum of strategies in the population health framework ( Table ).\n\n【140】Table Well-Physician California: A Population Health Approach to Promote Physician Well-Being\n\n| Intervention level | Initial planned strategies |\n| --- | --- |\n| Foster change in professional norms and culture | Advocacy for necessary regulatory and policy changes |\n|  | Improve the efficiency of the practice environment (eg, attenuate “prior authorization” burden). |\n|  | Reduce barriers to seeking help (eliminate medical board licensing policies that penalize physicians who seek care for mental health issues) |\n|  | Systematic engagement of organizations |\n|  | Assess level of burnout and professional well-being and provide state-level benchmarks |\n|  | Guide senior leaders in interpretation of assessment results and a framework for action |\n|  | Engage physicians in the organization to identify opportunities to build values alignment and improve the practice environment |\n|  | Convene graduate and undergraduate medical education leaders |\n|  | Share best practices and identify gaps |\n|  | Create consensus training well-being standards across the state |\n|  | Develop flexible but consistent curriculum (shared framework) |\n| Promotion of professional fulfillment: organization level strategies | Sponsored participation for immersion Chief Wellness Officer training through existing Stanford Program |\n|  | Leadership Academy for first-line leaders to cultivate leadership skills that promote professional fulfillment |\n|  | Disseminate best practices to promote psychological safety, appreciation, vulnerability, professionalism, mission alignment, and compassion for patients, colleagues and self |\n| Universal prevention of burnout: organization and individual level strategies | Online interactive tools to self-calibrate |\n|  | Individualized feedback linked to resources for wellness promotion |\n|  | Maintenance of Certificaiton and Continuing Medical Education certified well-being training modules |\n|  | Develop communities of physicians through a state-wide commensality group program |\n| Selective prevention for physicians at elevated risk for burnout | Provide timely resources and support for physicians named in malpractice suits or dealing with difficult clinical outcomes (eg, peer support program) |\n|  | Provide timely resources for physicians in transition (eg, facilitated mentorship at the health care organization or county medical society level, for newly licensed physicians in the state or physicians joining the organization) |\n| Indicated intervention for physicians with burnout | Professional coaching for physicians with mild to moderate burnout |\n|  | Free 1 week retreat available 4 times per year to begin process of recovery for physicians experiencing severe burnout |\n| Timely mental health treatment | Online self-assessment linked to modules with information regarding mental health issues |\n|  | Vetted network of health care providers across the state with expertise in physician mental health, able to deliver rapid access |\n\n【142】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【143】These strategies will be delivered through a combination of online resources, local communities of physicians, centrally coordinated peer-support and coaching resources, free week-long recovery programs for physicians with severe burnout who are considering leaving the profession, and a robust and vetted referral network of mental health care professionals across the state trained to deliver timely treatment to physicians when needed. All licensed physicians in the state will receive invitations to complete self-assessment along with delivery of personalized recommendations regarding resources in the program they may find most helpful. The program also includes a robust process to support and engage the organizations in which physicians work through longitudinal assessment, customized reports with benchmarking, and partnership, as well as training for both executive and first-line leaders in those organizations to help them strengthen organizational culture and improve the practice environment. Undergraduate and post-graduate medical education leaders across the state will be convened to create standardized physician well-being curriculum objectives. The program also includes state- and federal-level advocacy to promote necessary regulatory and policy changes to address issues in the health care delivery system that contribute to clinician distress.\n\n【144】The endeavor includes rigorous quantitative and qualitative data analysis to guide development, evaluation, and iterative improvement of program components at each level of the population health framework.\n\n【145】Ideal Future State\n------------------\n\n【146】We envision a future state for the profession of medicine characterized by highly engaged, professionally fulfilled, and dedicated physicians practicing in a thoughtfully designed environment. A population health approach to achieve this future state is characterized by an integrated set of universal strategies to promote well-being for all physicians, selective prevention for groups of physicians at higher than average risk, indicated intervention for individual physicians experiencing job-related distress, and unfettered access to treatment for physicians with anxiety, depression, or suicidal ideation. For optimum efficacy, this approach must engage organizations and incite change in the culture of medicine by promulgating a professional environment of self-care, community, peer-support, and help-seeking when distress occurs.\n\n【147】无关删除-2*   Shanafelt T.D.\n*   Schein E.\n*   Minor L.B.\n*   Trockel M.\n*   Schein P.\n*   Kirch D.\n\n【148】Healing the Professional Culture of Medicine.\n\n【149】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2019; 94 : 1556-1566\n\n【150】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (86)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【151】Large-scale implementation of this approach is already underway in California.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Arixtra\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Fondaparinux is used to prevent deep vein thrombosis, a condition in which harmful blood clots form in the blood vessels of the legs. These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism. This medicine is used for several days after hip fracture surgery, hip or knee replacement surgery, and in some cases following abdominal or stomach surgery, while you are unable to walk. It is during this time that blood clots are most likely to form.\n\n【6】Fondaparinux is also used together with warfarin to treat acute deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg) and pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung).\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Solution\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of fondaparinux in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fondaparinux in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have bleeding problems and age-related kidney disease, which may require caution or an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fondaparinux.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below.

We describe a 70-year-old man who developed multifocal vertebral osteomyelitis and late prosthetic joint infection caused by this pathogen. The patient was a farmer who had daily contact with cows and drank unpasteurized milk, although the portal of the pathogen's entry remains speculative. Culture of the vertebral disk biopsy specimen and cultures during resection arthroplasty yielded _S simulans_ . A review of the literature suggests that _S simulans_ may be more virulent than other species of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Accurate identification of _S simulans_ isolates would facilitate studies to further define its pathogenic role in human infections.\n\n【1】CoNS ( coagulase-negative staphylococcus ), CRP ( C-reactive protein ), ESR ( erythrocyte sedimentation rate ), MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ), PJI ( prosthetic joint infection ), THA ( total hip arthroplasty ), WBC ( white blood cell )\n\n【2】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【3】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【4】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【5】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【6】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【8】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【9】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

The study population was divided into 4 interquartiles according to HbA <sub>1c </sub> levels (<5.5%, 5.5%-5.7%, 5.8%-6.1%, and >6.1%).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Patients with higher HbA <sub>1c </sub> levels tended to be older, overweight, and hypertensive, had higher blood glucose levels, and had lower glomerular filtration rates. Higher HbA <sub>1c </sub> levels were associated in a graded fashion with the presence of CAD, disease severity (higher number of diseased vessels and presence of left main and/or triple vessel disease), and disease complexity (higher SYNTAX score, higher number of patients in intermediate or high SYNTAX tertiles, coronary calcium, and chronic total occlusions). After adjustment for major conventional cardiovascular risk factors, compared with patients with HbA <sub>1c </sub> levels less than 5.5%, the odds ratios of occurrence of CAD in the HbA <sub>1c </sub> quartiles of 5.5% to 5.7%, 5.8% to 6.1%, and greater than 6.1% were 1.8 (95% CI, 1.2-2.7), 3.5 (95% CI, 2.3-5.3), and 4.9 (95% CI, 3.0-8.1), respectively.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The HbA <sub>1c </sub> level has a linear incremental association with CAD in nondiabetic individuals. The HbA <sub>1c </sub> level is also independently correlated with disease severity and higher SYNTAX scores. Thus, HbA <sub>1c </sub> measurement could be used to improve cardiovascular risk assessment in nondiabetic individuals.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BMI ( body mass index ), CAD ( coronary artery disease ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), e-GFR ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ), HbA1c ( hemoglobin A1c ), OR ( odds ratio )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【31】*   Glaucoma—The dexamethasone in the eyedrops may cause glaucoma or make it worse if the eyedrops are used for a long time\n\n【32】*   Herpes infection of the eye or\n*   Any other eye infection, including bacterial and fungal—The dexamethasone in the eyedrops may make existing infections worse or cause new infections\n\n【33】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【34】For patients using the ophthalmic suspension (eye drops) form of this medicine:\n\n【35】*   Always shake the container very well just before applying the eye drops.\n*   To use:\n\n【36】    *   First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed and apply pressure to the inner corner of the eye with your finger for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.\n    *   If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eye properly, use another drop.\n    *   To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Always keep the container tightly closed.\n\n【37】For patients using the ophthalmic ointment form of this medicine:\n\n【38】*   To use:\n    *   First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Squeeze a thin strip of ointment into this space. A 1/2-inch strip of ointment is usually enough. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Keep the eyes closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to come into contact with the irritation.\n    *   To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). After using the eye ointment, wipe the tip of the ointment tube with a clean tissue. Do not wash the tip with water. Always keep the tube tightly closed.\n\n【39】### Dosing\n\n【40】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【41】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【42】*   For ophthalmic ointment dosage form:\n    *   For eye disorders:\n        *   Adults—Use about a 1/2-inch strip of ointment in the eye up to three or four times a day.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n*   For ophthalmic suspension (eye drops) dosage form:\n    *   For eye disorders:\n        *   Adults—Use 1 or 2 drops in the eye every four to six hours. Your doctor may have you use the drops more frequently during the first day or two and will probably have you space the doses farther apart as the eye gets better.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【43】### Missed Dose\n\n【44】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule.

The annual rate of RP remained relatively stable, from 1425 RPs per million in the period 1998 to 1999 to 1330 RPs per million in the period 2010 to 2011 (7% decrease; _P_ \\=.90). The annual rate of open RP decreased from 1424 per million to 435 per million ( _P_ <.001), whereas the annual rate of minimally invasive RP increased from less than 1 per million to 895 per million ( _P_ <.001). Since 2006, hospitals providing open RP decreased by 18% (from 2288 to 1870; _P_ <.001), whereas hospitals providing minimally invasive RP increased by 191% (from 341 to 993; _P_ <.001). The median open RP caseload per hospital decreased by 7% (from 68 to 63; _P_ <.001), whereas the median caseload for hospitals providing minimally invasive RP declined by 17% (from 122 to 101; _P_ <.001). The hospitals providing fewer than 50 minimally invasive RPs per year increased from 12% to 26% (from 144 of 1240 to 3020 of 11,644; _P_ <.001).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Per capita utilization of RP in the United States has remained stable from 1998 to 2011.

Their sample is the largest clinical group yet studied, comprising 667 hospitalized adults. For data collection, they used the relatively brief 9-item Self-administered Alcoholism Screening Test (SAAST)-an instrument developed, standardized, and normed at the Mayo Clinic. Their study replicates previous work in several ways but also provides new information regarding alcoholism and the role of clinicians and clinical facilities in its recognition and care. Observations on these similarities and differences follow.\n\n【6】First, the patient response rate was very high (84%), again demonstrating that most patients are willing to complete this type of screening questionnaire. This is similar to other previous work, including a similar study conducted at the University of Minnesota a quarter century ago by me and my colleagues\n\n【7】*   Westermeyer J\n*   Doheny S\n*   Stone B\n\n【8】An assessment of hospital care for the alcoholic patient.\n\n【9】无关删除-2_Alcohol Clin Exp Res._ 1978; 2 : 53-57\n\n【10】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (18)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【11】and cited by Schneekloth et al.\n\n【12】Second, a notable difference was staff acceptance of the modern Mayo Clinic study, in which all medical, surgical, and psychiatric staff at 2 hospitals approved of and participated in the study. Twenty-five years ago at University of Minnesota Hospital, 5 of 25 attending physicians refused to allow the study to be conducted on their wards, averring that it would insult, distress, or alienate their patients. This change in attitude suggests increased staff acceptance of such screening.\n\n【13】Third, the rate of alcoholism among 667 Mayo Clinic respondents was 7.4%. This figure is comparable to the 9% rate observed 25 years ago at University Hospitals, although the screening instrument used then was longer (24 items on the full-scale Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test) and modified to question use of drugs other than alcohol. Despite inclusion of questions about drug use in the earlier study, most identified substance abusers used alcohol excessively, either alone or in combination with other drugs. In addition to different survey instruments, comparison could be flawed if the patient populations in these 2 times and places were notably different in demographic ways that might alter the prevalence of alcoholism.\n\n【14】Data collection in the older study proceeded over a longer time (several days rather than a single day). In any event, the rates show that the challenge for clinicians in both times and places was remarkably similar. Were this a life-threatening, chronic, yet treatable infectious disease with comparable gravity (say, tuberculosis), much effort would be devoted to its recognition and treatment. Or if we had a low-cost screening measure for detecting a life-threatening, high-cost cancer or cardiovascular disease or endocrine disorder with point prevalence comparable to alcoholism, we would routinely screen for the disorder. Obviously, preventive measures and mass education have not reduced the prevalence rate of alcoholism in hospitalized populations over the rates found 25 years ago. As Schneekloth et al point out, the rate of 7.4% is low compared with other hospital surveys indicating prevalence rates around 20%. Of course, some of the nonresponders may be alcoholics. However, the demographic differences between nonresponders and SAAST-positive patients does not suggest a particularly high rate of alcoholism among the non-responders.\n\n【15】Fourth, the percentage of positive cases was significantly higher on psychiatric units compared with the rate on medical and surgical units. This replicates the comparable finding of the University Hospital study. The alcoholism rates on the medical/surgical unit did not differ appreciably across the 2 studies (about 7% in both times and places). Although the prevalence rate was much higher on psychiatric services in both studies, the consultation for addictive disorders was also notably on psychiatric services in both studies. Still, psychiatrists avoided making a diagnosis of alcoholism on the discharge summary, even when abundant data supported their doing so.\n\n【16】Fifth, the authors found that the attending clinicians obtained addiction or psychiatric consultation for only 31% of positive patients. This rate of consultation is virtually identical to the 33% consultation rate at University Hospitals 25 years ago.\n\n【17】Sixth, 7% of discharge diagnoses in the Mayo Clinic study included alcoholism in positive cases compared with 15% at University Hospitals a quarter century ago-not a significant difference even if the 2 samples were considered to be comparable. Even taking into account the false-positive rate of 0.6% on the SAAST, this low rate of referral and diagnosis reveals that the “ostrich syndrome” vis-à-vis alcoholism remains alive and well in our profession.\n\n【18】Schneekloth and coworkers made a new and valuable observation in noting that only 4 of 42 SAAST-positive patients were abstinent former problem drinkers. Thus, those identified in the screening typically were active alcohol abusers, not recovered alcoholics. Only 26% of SAAST-positive patients had ever been told that they had a diagnosis of alcoholism. Thus, for the majority of patients this was new information-the critical first step toward recovery from alcoholism.\n\n【19】These fifth and sixth similarities are especially discouraging to clinicians who have devoted their professional careers to improving the clinical skills and attitudes to recognize and refer alcoholic patients for care. The dereliction of physicians in this regard indicates that they are either unaware of the cost-effectiveness of early recognition and care, or they lack the confidence and skill to effect a consultation and referral (not a simple task), or they do not care in any event. Regardless of the explanations, this important finding suggests that nothing has changed among physicians’ referral patterns. As Schneekloth and his coauthors conclude in the abstract, “This finding may indicate persistent problems in physicians detection, assessment, and diagnosis of alcoholism.” By the same token, the locus of resistance has changed. Physicians do not object to their patients’ being screened for alcoholism, but they resist being involved in negotiating a referral and brokering a consultative recommendation when alcoholism is the diagnosis. The latter conclusion is as clear now as it was 25 years ago.\n\n【20】What can be done at this point to remedy this untoward situation, a travesty that adds to the morbidity, mortality, and cost of care? Schneekloth and coworkers call for redoubled efforts in the educational and research arenaechoing my same thoughts from a generation ago. At this time, I would venture that another tack is needed. It is not reprehensible to fail, as we have done and are doing in this regard. It is reprehensible to ignore and to repeat our failings-a fault for which our descendants can and should judge us harshly. A viable alternative lies in automatic screening and automatic consultation for all hospitalized patients, much as we once did with tuberculin tests and chest x-ray examinations to identify and treat tuberculosis when it was a common scourge. Hospitals could mandate these procedures, or legislatures could require them.\n\n【21】Technology and information exist that would minimize the cost and maximize the efficacy of screening for alcoholism. To minimize costs, a 2-step screening process might be used. For example, those persons screening positive on the SAAST might be more extensively screened by a trained technician; this might be moderately costly, although the cost would probably be less than half the charge for a chest x-ray. Considerably less expensive would be the use of a longer, more in-depth questionnaire such as the Minnesota Substance Abuse Problems Scale\n\n【22】*   Westermeyer J\n*   Crosby R\n*   Nugent S\n\n【23】The Minnesota Substance Abuse Problems Scale: psychometric analysis and validation in a clinical population.\n\n【24】无关删除-2_Am J Addict._ 1998; 7 : 24-34\n\n【25】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【26】or similar instrument that might tap into associated health and social problems, along with previous substance abuse treatment, recent use, and readiness for treatment. These in-depth questionnaires typically require about 20 to 30 minutes to complete, and they can be scored within seconds for pennies with use of an optical scanner and a computer. If the second stage of screening supported the need for further assessment and perhaps intervention, a third stage would involve face-to-face evaluation by a clinician schooled in the assessment of addictive disorders.\n\n【27】In sum, clinicians stand greatly in debt to Schneekloth and his colleagues. They have done more than provide us with a replication of past work. They have shown us where we have wandered over the last few decades and where, without adoption of new and effective interventions, we can expect to be in another quarter century.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "0f9633cd-022f-4096-8085-6a867375cfa4", "title": "Canagliflozin (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Canagliflozin (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Invokana\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Canagliflozin is used together with proper diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. It is also used to lower the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart or blood vessel disease. This medicine works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. Canagliflozin does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.\n\n【6】Canagliflozin is also used to lower the risk of end stage kidney disease, worsening of kidney function, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease with a certain amount of protein in the urine.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Tablet\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Clinicians are increasingly being asked by patients to share information about or certify them for medical cannabis. In order to engage in informed discussions with patients or be comfortable certifying them in states with medical cannabis laws, clinicians may benefit from an understanding of the current state of medical knowledge about medical cannabis. Intended for the generalist and subspecialist, this review provides an overview of the legal status, pharmacology, benefits, risks, and abuse liability of medical cannabis along with a general framework for counseling patients.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CB1 ( type 1 cannabinoid receptor ), CB2 ( type 2 cannabinoid receptor ), CBD ( cannabidiol ), MS ( multiple sclerosis ), MVC ( motor vehicle collision ), NASEM ( National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine ), THC ( Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation Statement:** In support of improving patient care, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science is jointly accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), and the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) to provide continuing education for the healthcare team.\n\n【8】无关删除-2*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【9】**Credit Statements:**\n\n【10】**AMA:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s).™ Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【11】**MOC Credit Statement:** Successful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1 MOC point in the American Board of Internal Medicine’s (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program.

The purpose of this concise review is to provide clinicians with information facilitating discussions with patients about medical cannabis.\n\n【30】Legal Status\n------------\n\n【31】The US Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 prohibits the use of cannabis for any purpose, listing it as a Drug Enforcement Agency schedule I drug (ie, “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse”).\n\n【32】Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, Pub L No. 91-513, 84 Stat 1236. 1970\n\n【33】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【34】US states are the first governmental bodies in the world to legalize cannabis. Presently, 30 US states and the District of Columbia have programs authorizing cannabis use for specific medical conditions.\n\n【35】States generally restrict indications for medical cannabis to specific qualifying conditions. Some states allow physicians to determine additional qualifying conditions. States have variable statutory approaches for patient legal protections addressing legal arrest, housing, and employment.\n\n【36】Americans for Safe Access  \nMedical marijuana access in the United States: a patient-focused analysis of the patchwork of state laws.\n\n【37】http://www.safeaccessnow.org/medical\\_marijuana\\_access\\_in\\_the\\_usa\n\n【38】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【39】Because cannabis is illegal under federal law, clinicians cannot prescribe it and pharmacies cannot dispense it. States require willing health care professionals to be registered in order to certify patients for cannabis use. Clinicians who certify are protected against federal legal repercussions because states limit their role to documentation of qualifying medical conditions under state law. Some states require that patients have an ongoing relationship with the certifying clinician, generally defined as an interaction including a complete examination and medical history with ongoing care involvement. Clinician certification must be reviewed periodically in most states.\n\n【40】Cannabis is supplied to patients through state-licensed medical cannabis dispensaries. Dispensaries are predominantly for-profit centers selling any preparation or product in compliance with state regulations; however, no “good manufacturing practices” exist since they are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. Routes of medical cannabis self-administration vary by state, with many providing capsules, oil, and vaporizing liquid. Most medical cannabis states allow patient access to dried flowers or whole-plant cannabis.\n\n【41】Americans for Safe Access  \nMedical marijuana access in the United States: a patient-focused analysis of the patchwork of state laws.\n\n【42】http://www.safeaccessnow.org/medical\\_marijuana\\_access\\_in\\_the\\_usa\n\n【43】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【44】Many states have possession limits; in Minnesota, for example, state law limits patients to a 30-day supply of cannabinoids. Patients generally pay a fee to participate in the cannabis program, and cannabis obtained through state dispensaries is not covered by insurance. As a result, cost can be prohibitive. Currently, federal legislation restricts the Department of Justice from using federal funds to prevent states from implementing state cannabis laws.\n\n【45】Endocannabinoid System\n----------------------\n\n【46】Cannabis interacts with the endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system is a distributed network of receptors, signaling molecules, and synthetic and degrading enzymes. The type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB <sub>1 </sub> ) is highly expressed in the central nervous system on neurons concentrated in the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. Retrosynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid signaling generates the neuropsychiatric effects of cannabis.\n\n【47】无关删除-2*   Hoehe M.R.\n*   Caenazzo L.\n*   Martinez M.M.\n*   et al.\n\n【48】Genetic and physical mapping of the human cannabinoid receptor gene to chromosome 6q14-q15.\n\n【49】无关删除-2_New Biol._ 1991; 3 : 880-885\n\n【50】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【51】无关删除-2*   Gérard C.\n*   Mollereau C.\n*   Vassart G.\n*   Parmentier M.\n\n【52】Nucleotide sequence of a human cannabinoid receptor cDNA.\n\n【53】_Nucleic Acids Res._ 1990; 18 : 7142\n\n【54】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (115)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【55】The CB <sub>1 </sub> receptors are also found in smooth muscle, myocardium, adipocytes, and preganglionic sympathetic neurons integrated with the autonomic and endocrine systems.

Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol can cause self-limited tachycardia, hypotension, orthostasis, xerostomia, and xerophthalmia. Its use does not result in the respiratory depression observed with benzodiazepine or opioid administration because CB <sub>1 </sub> receptors are not found in medullary respiratory centers.

Recreational use of illegally synthesized cannabinoid receptor agonists with unpredictable pharmacological properties are marketed as “incense” and sold over-the-counter labeled as “K-2,” “Black Mamba,” “Crazy Clown,” or “Spice.” These agents of abuse have been associated with multiple adverse effects such as psychosis, agitation, autonomic dysregulation, vomiting, and death. These substances have no role in any type of clinical therapy.\n\n【113】Efficacy\n--------\n\n【114】The list of conditions for which medical cannabis has been allowed varies at the state level.

Data for this indication is extremely weak, suggesting that any positive effect of cannabinoids administered orally, ophthalmically, or intravenously is short term.\n\n【162】When discussing the efficacy of medical cannabis with patients, clinicians should consider a few issues. First, clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of medical cannabis for pain, nausea and/or vomiting, and spasticity in MS is derived from trials evaluating different preparations such as smoked or vaporized plant flower, plant-derived oral THC and THC-CBD combinations, and synthetic THC. Strong inferences about clinical efficacy can only be made about these preparations. Second, conclusive or substantial evidence suggesting that cannabis is effective for the treatment of any medical condition does not presently exist and instead suggests that it may be effective for symptom control only. Finally, a substantial proportion of the medical conditions for which states allow certified patients to consume cannabis are not supported by high-level clinical evidence of efficacy.\n\n【163】Health Risks\n------------\n\n【164】The NASEM concluded that there is _substantial evidence_ for an association between cannabis smoking and respiratory disease, motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), lower birth weight offspring, and schizophrenia or other psychoses.\n\n【165】National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine  \nThe Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids: The Current State of Evidence and Recommendations for Research.\n\n【166】The National Academies Press , Washington, DC 2017\n\n【167】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【168】### Respiratory Disease\n\n【169】Although some data suggest that short-term exposure to cannabis smoking is associated with bronchodilation, benefits may be offset by long-term cannabis effects including lower forced expiratory volume. Smoked cannabis is associated with chronic cough, phlegm production, and chronic bronchitis. Limited evidence exists that smoked cannabis is associated with the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Available evidence suggests that cannabis does not increase the risk for lung cancer. As this data relates almost exclusively to inhaled smoked organic cannabis plant material, little is known about the impact of cannabis oil vaporization on lung function, lung health, or cancer risk. Studies have suggested that vaporization of cannabis is associated with fewer respiratory symptoms.\n\n【170】无关删除-2*   Van Dam N.T.\n*   Earleywine M.\n\n【171】Pulmonary function in cannabis users: support for a clinical trial of the vaporizer.\n\n【172】无关删除-2_Int J Drug Policy._ 2010; 21 : 511-513\n\n【173】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (57)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【174】### Motor Vehicle Collisions\n\n【175】Available data suggest that driving under the influence of cannabis indicated by self-report or the presence of THC in bodily fluid is associated with significantly higher odds of an MVC.\n\n【176】无关删除-2*   Rogeberg O.\n*   Elvik R.\n\n【177】The effects of cannabis intoxication on motor vehicle collision revisited and revised.\n\n【178】无关删除-2_Addiction._ 2016; 111 : 1348-1359\n\n【179】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (199)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【180】Uncertainty remains about the level of THC associated with impaired driving ability and may relate to chronicity of individual use. Cannabidiol is not known to have psychoactive activity and is likely not associated with increased risk for MVCs.\n\n【181】### Lower Birth Weight Offspring\n\n【182】Endocannabinoids are involved with critical steps in neurodevelopment. Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol crosses the placenta and is secreted in breast milk. Cannabis use during pregnancy is linked to lower birth weight infants. Earlier in utero exposures to cannabis may affect organogenesis, and later in utero exposures may affect fetal growth. Most of the data for cannabis use during pregnancy is related to smoked organic material potentially confounded with concomitant tobacco and alcohol consumption; very little data exist for this association with other forms of cannabis use.\n\n【183】### Psychosis\n\n【184】The relationship between cannabis use and psychosis-related outcomes (eg, schizophrenia, schizoaffective, schizophreniform, and psychotic disorders) appears to be moderate to large and dose dependent. Studies have evaluated cannabis use as a class of a drug across multiple different populations and have not focused on limited phytocannabinoid preparations (ie, THC only, THC-CBD, or CBD only). Available evidence suggests that the prevalence of cannabis use among people with schizophrenia is higher than that in the general population. Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol has psychoactive effects, whereas CBD has antipsychotic effects.\n\n【185】无关删除-2*   Zuardi A.W.\n*   Crippa J.A.\n*   Hallak J.E.\n*   et al.\n\n【186】A critical review of the antipsychotic effects of cannabidiol: 30 years of a translational investigation.\n\n【187】无关删除-2_Curr Pharm Des._ 2012; 18 : 5131-5140\n\n【188】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【189】Preparations with lower levels of THC and higher levels of CBD may be anticipated to have lower psychosis-inducing liabilities than that observed in the population-based studies.

Clinicians should feel comfortable disclosing to their patients the gaps in knowledge that exist about the efficacy and safety of medical cannabis. Clinicians whose patients ask about medical cannabis should be prepared to discuss (1) known risks and benefit, specifically its benefits for pain, nausea and/or vomiting, and spasticity and the risks of respiratory disease, MVCs, low birth weight offspring, and psychotic symptoms and (2) that medical cannabis remains illegal under federal law, which should be considered when flying or driving across state lines.\n\n【199】Caution should be exercised when considering medical cannabis for individuals under the age of 25 years because the brain continues to develop until this age, and the potential for cannabis to have a lasting impact on cognitive performance is unknown.\n\n【200】National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine  \nThe Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids: The Current State of Evidence and Recommendations for Research.\n\n【201】The National Academies Press , Washington, DC 2017\n\n【202】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【203】Clinicians should manage patient expectations by relating that it is difficult to extrapolate currently available evidence on medical cannabis to patient-experienced benefits or harms from medical cannabis products obtained from state programs because horticultural techniques, drug extraction techniques, and drug delivery modalities are rapidly evolving.\n\n【204】Certifying clinicians should additionally discuss with patients (1) that clinicians do not prescribe medical cannabis but only certify for the condition that qualifies patients under state programs, (2) recommendations for discontinuing medical cannabis if it is not beneficial or if they are experiencing adverse effects, (3) the importance of continuing other therapies because medical cannabis needs to be part of a comprehensive symptom management strategy rather than a singular solution, (4) how to taper off other medications such as opioids or pain-modifying agents if desired, (5) how their progress with medical cannabis should be/will be monitored, and (6) how frequently they need to be certified because states require different time lengths for recertification.\n\n【205】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【206】Medical cannabis laws provide clinicians with the opportunity to provide selected patients with an additional tool to help them manage disabling or troubling symptoms. Clinician awareness of potential benefits and adverse effects will help patients make informed choices about using medical cannabis to improve their quality of life. Clinicians have a unique opportunity to guide selected patients to this emerging treatment strategy.\n\n【207】Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------\n\n【208】*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI5YTZhNmY3MGM0MjZjZjUzYTNlYjBhZDJiOWI2MWYzOSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDIyMjU2fQ.EFNyt-w-j2tgKVxOg4wA\\_YkiL\\_jU54B3chy5SVTjWDqkt5RpvOAsSm0577z4YMDwOeVEr7H9pJzFn8KMYR8XnMICYZMEgsG-P3PAfTUieeAOfFmLcsUO3Sj\\_eFLud4Myennlk2qBj\\_oNQDi68OtecbMVAv4tOyEfg2c2wxgehbobTjkcurImkTuA68fjFpJDUVP6A4XreB9m6Fbp4kdr9fAhK\\_JZKMicEC\\_2vVtgIIhF39bSCaptlJg624709hZ6jRfwrAHNXEy5MReGMjCl9L01dLfskGl\\_HxvuzoNBBow4kVvbWsx0MAXNFwoY96g83HFDOwHi8euwoio4FJa1Eg\n\n【209】    Download .mp4 (119.71 MB)\n\n【210】    Help with .mp4 files\n\n【211】    Supplemental Video", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "82f745b5-935e-4cc7-a255-a496f03ec36c", "title": "Coronary angioplasty and stents", "text": "【0】Coronary angioplasty and stents\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】Coronary angioplasty (AN-jee-o-plas-tee), also called percutaneous coronary intervention, is a procedure used to open clogged heart arteries. Angioplasty uses a tiny balloon catheter that is inserted in a blocked blood vessel to help widen it and improve blood flow to the heart.\n\n【2】Angioplasty is often combined with the placement of a small wire mesh tube called a stent. The stent helps prop the artery open, decreasing its chance of narrowing again. Most stents are coated with medication to help keep the artery open (drug-eluting stents). Rarely, bare-metal stents are used.\n\n【3】Angioplasty can improve symptoms of blocked arteries, such as chest pain and shortness of breath. Angioplasty is also often used during a heart attack to quickly open a blocked artery and reduce the amount of damage to the heart.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Angioplasty is used to treat the buildup of fatty plaques in the heart's blood vessels. This buildup is a type of heart disease known as atherosclerosis.\n\n【6】Angioplasty may be a treatment option for you if:\n\n【7】*   You have tried medications or lifestyle changes but these have not improved your heart health.\n*   You have chest pain (angina) that is worsening.\n*   You have a heart attack. Angioplasty can quickly open a blocked artery, reducing damage to your heart.\n\n【8】Angioplasty isn't for everyone. Depending on the extent of your heart disease and your overall health, your doctor may determine that coronary artery bypass surgery is a better option than angioplasty for you.\n\n【9】You may need coronary artery bypass surgery if:\n\n【10】*   The main artery that brings blood to the left side of your heart is narrow\n*   Your heart muscle is weak\n*   You have diabetes and multiple severe blockages in your arteries\n\n【11】In coronary artery bypass surgery, the blocked part of your artery is bypassed using a healthy blood vessel from another part of your body.\n\n【12】Risks\n-----\n\n【13】Although angioplasty is a less invasive way to open clogged arteries than bypass surgery is, the procedure still carries some risks.\n\n【14】The most common angioplasty risks include:\n\n【15】*   **Re-narrowing of your artery.** When angioplasty is combined with drug-eluting stent placement, there's a small risk the treated artery will become clogged again. The risk of re-narrowing of the artery is higher when bare-metal stents are used.\n*   **Blood clots.** Blood clots can form within stents even after the procedure. These clots can close the artery, causing a heart attack. It's important to take aspirin in combination with clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient) or another medication that helps reduce the risk of blood clots exactly as prescribed to decrease the chance of clots forming in your stent.\n\n【16】    Talk to your doctor about how long you'll need to take these medications. Never stop taking these medications without discussing it with your doctor.\n\n【17】*   **Bleeding.** You may have bleeding in your leg or arm where a catheter was inserted. Usually this simply results in a bruise, but sometimes serious bleeding occurs and may require a blood transfusion or surgical procedures.\n\n【18】Other rare risks of angioplasty include:\n\n【19】*   **Heart attack.** Though rare, you may have a heart attack during the procedure.\n*   **Coronary artery damage.** The coronary artery may be torn or ruptured during the procedure. These complications may require emergency bypass surgery.\n*   **Kidney problems.** The dye used during angioplasty and stent placement can cause kidney damage, especially in people who already have kidney problems. If you're at increased risk, your doctor may take steps to try to protect your kidneys, such as limiting the amount of contrast dye and making sure that you're well hydrated during the procedure.\n*   **Stroke.** During angioplasty, a stroke can occur if plaques break loose when the catheters are being threaded through the aorta. Blood clots also can form in catheters and travel to the brain if they break loose. A stroke is an extremely rare complication of coronary angioplasty. Blood thinners are used during the procedure to reduce the risk.\n*   **Abnormal heart rhythms.** During the procedure, the heart may beat too quickly or too slowly. These heart rhythm problems are usually short-lived, but sometimes medications or a temporary pacemaker is needed.\n\n【20】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【21】Before a scheduled angioplasty, your doctor will review your medical history and do a physical exam. You may need to have some tests, including a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram and blood tests, before your procedure. Your doctor will also perform an imaging test called a coronary angiogram to see if the arteries to your heart are blocked and if they can be treated with angioplasty.\n\n【22】If your doctor finds a blockage during your coronary angiogram, he or she may decide to perform angioplasty and stenting immediately after the angiogram while your heart is still catheterized.\n\n【23】Your doctor will give you instructions to help you prepare.\n\n【24】*   Your doctor may instruct you to adjust or stop taking certain medications before angioplasty, such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or blood thinners. Be sure to tell your doctor about all medications you take, including herbal supplements.\n*   Usually, you'll need to stop eating or drinking six to eight hours before an angiography.\n*   Take approved medications with only small sips of water on the morning of your procedure.\n*   Gather all of your medications to take to the hospital with you, including nitroglycerin, if you take it.\n*   Arrange for transportation home. Angioplasty usually requires an overnight hospital stay, and you won't be able to drive yourself home the next day.\n\n【25】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【26】### During the procedure\n\n【27】Angioplasty is performed by a heart specialist (cardiologist) and a team of specialized cardiovascular nurses and technicians in a special operating room called a cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n\n【28】Angioplasty is performed through an artery in your groin, arm or wrist area. General anesthesia isn't needed. You'll receive a sedative to help you relax, but you may be awake during the procedure depending on how deeply you are sedated.\n\n【29】*   You'll receive fluids, medications to relax you and blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants) through an IV catheter in your hand or arm.\n*   Your heart rate, pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level will be monitored during the procedure.\n*   Your doctor will prepare the area in your leg, arm or wrist with an antiseptic solution and will place a sterile sheet over your body.\n*   Your doctor will use a local anesthetic to numb the area where a very small incision will be made. A small, thin guidewire is then inserted into the blood vessel.\n*   With the help of live X-rays, your doctor will thread a thin tube (catheter) through your artery.\n*   Contrast dye is injected through the catheter once it is in place. This allows your doctor to see the inside of your blood vessels and identify the blockage on X-ray images called angiograms.\n*   A small balloon with or without a stent at the tip of the catheter is inflated at the site of the blockage, widening the blocked artery. After the artery is stretched, the balloon is deflated and the catheter is removed.\n*   If you have several blockages, the procedure may be repeated at each blockage.\n\n【30】Angioplasty can take up to several hours, depending on the difficulty and number of blockages and whether any complications arise.\n\n【31】You might feel pressure in the area where the catheter is inserted. You may also feel some mild discomfort when the balloon is inflated and your artery is stretched, but typically you shouldn't feel any sharp pain during the procedure.\n\n【32】#### Stent placement\n\n【33】Most people who have angioplasty also have a stent placed in their blocked artery during the same procedure. A stent, which looks like a tiny coil of wire mesh, supports the walls of your artery and helps prevent it from re-narrowing after angioplasty.\n\n【34】Here's what happens during a stent placement:\n\n【35】*   The stent, which is collapsed around a balloon at the tip of the catheter, is guided through the artery to the blockage.\n*   At the blockage, the balloon is inflated and the spring-like stent expands and locks into place inside the artery.\n*   The stent stays in the artery permanently to hold it open and improve blood flow to your heart. In some cases, more than one stent may be needed to open a blockage.\n*   Once the stent is in place, the balloon catheter is deflated and removed.\n*   More X-ray images (angiograms) are taken to see how well blood flows through your newly widened artery.\n\n【36】Most stents implanted during an angioplasty are drug coated. The medication in the stent is slowly released to help prevent future plaque buildup and the re-narrowing of the blood vessel.\n\n【37】After your stent placement, your doctor will prescribe medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta) or prasugrel (Effient), to reduce the chance of blood clots forming on the stent.\n\n【38】### After the procedure\n\n【39】If you had a nonemergency procedure, you'll probably remain at the hospital overnight while your heart is monitored and your medications are adjusted. You generally should be able to return to work or your normal routine the week after angioplasty.\n\n【40】When you return home, drink plenty of fluids to help flush your body of the contrast dye. Avoid strenuous exercise and lifting heavy objects for at least a day afterward. Ask your doctor or nurse about other restrictions in activity.\n\n【41】无关删除-1Call your doctor's office or hospital staff immediately if:\n\n【42】无关删除-1*   The site where your catheter was inserted starts bleeding or swelling\n*   You develop pain or discomfort at the site where your catheter was inserted\n*   You have signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, drainage or fever\n*   There's a change in temperature or color of the leg or arm that was used for the procedure\n*   You feel faint or weak\n*   You develop chest pain or shortness of breath\n\n【43】无关删除-1#### Blood thinners\n\n【44】无关删除-1It's important that you closely follow your doctor's recommendations about your treatment with blood-thinning medications — aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient) or similar medications.\n\n【45】无关删除-1Most people who have undergone angioplasty with or without stent placement will need to take aspirin indefinitely.

These articles are also featured on the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings’_ YouTube Channel ( https://youtu.be/MT3ZFDAOKYU ).\n\n【1】Safety of Convalescent Plasma in COVID-19\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【2】With the current absence of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and the ongoing search for therapies for COVID-19, the therapeutic potential of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 is now under active investigation. This therapeutic strategy in infectious diseases, based on passive immunization, reaches back more than 100 years to its use during the influenza pandemic of 1918 and to the award of the inaugural Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1901 to Emil von Behring for demonstrating its efficacy in diphtheria. Passive immunization relies on neutralizing antibodies that bind to proteins on the surface of infectious agents, thereby neutralizing these agents and interrupting processes that drive the infectious disease; other constituents in convalescent plasma may also exert beneficial effects. Neutralizing antibodies are engendered in the course of recovery from an infectious disease, and those that target SARS-CoV-2 are present in convalescent plasma in variable amounts in patients recovering from COVID-19. To study the potential efficacy of convalescent plasma in COVID-19, Joyner and collaborators set the stage in early 2020 for a multicenter investigation of this question, recognizing at the very onset that a fundamental requirement would be the collection of convalescent plasma and its distribution to regional medical centers caring for patients with COVID-19. This goal was successfully achieved by a national Expanded Access Program created by the US Food and Drug Administration in partnership with Mayo Clinic and blood banking centers nationwide. In the present issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , Joyner et al provide a safety analysis in 20,000 patients with severe COVID-19 or at risk for developing severe COVID-19 who were administered convalescent plasma; this study is a follow-up to their prior safety analysis of the first 5000 patients so treated, all of whom are included in the present analysis. Convalescent plasma was administered to participants as clinically decided by the managing physician and as part of a modified clinical trial design. Within 4 hours of transfusion, less than 1% of transfusions were attended by serious adverse events, the latter including circulatory overload, acute lung injury, and severe allergic reactions. Of the 63 fatalities that occurred at this timepoint, 12 possibly, 1 probably, 0 definitely were linked to the plasma transfusion. At 7 days after transfusion, cardiac events and thromboembolic/thrombotic events occurred in approximately 3% and less than 1% respectively, but the overwhelming majority of these events were not ascribable to transfusion with convalescent plasma. The seven-day mortality averaged 8.6% and was higher in those subsets of patients either in the intensive care unit, requiring ventilator support, with septic shock, or with multi-organ dysfunction. Interestingly, in their prior report of 5000 patients with COVID-19 treated with convalescent plasma, the mortality rate was higher at 12%. Joyner et al offer 3 possible explanations for this decline in mortality in the present analysis: 1) general improvement in US health care systems in managing ill patients with COVID-19; 2) earlier administration of convalescent plasma to patients; and 3) more expeditious recruitment of donors recovering from COVID-19 and obtaining their plasma, thereby increasing the likelihood that their convalescent plasma would be more enriched with neutralizing antibodies. The reassuring and important finding of the present study is the relative safety of administering convalescent plasma to hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Joyner and collaborators are to be congratulated for their percipience in envisioning the need for this study and their herculean accomplishment in rapidly organizing and spearheading this logistically challenging study. Their forthcoming study on the efficacy of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 is anxiously awaited.\n\n【3】Joyner MJ, Bruno KA, Klassen SA, et al.

This abrupt redeployment of health care resources to such exigencies created by an unanticipated pandemic impacts aspects of the health care system in at least two major ways: First, such diversion interrupts attention to and conduct of the primary mission of aspects of health care; and, second, the stress of COVID-19 lays bare and exacerbates their pre-existing inadequacies. In the present issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , two perspectives discuss the latter consideration as it applies to primary care and broadly outline how to address this issue. As pointed out by Lin et al, long before the COVID-19 era, primary care faced numerous challenges including insufficient time afforded to patients because of the number of patients needed to be seen; insufficient or inconsistent attention to chronic care and preventive services; limitations and disparities in capacity and access; uneven quality of care; affordability; the importance accorded to primary care; and the reimbursement for primary care. In envisioning the path ahead, Lin et al note that the constraints of the COVID-19 crisis necessitated and enabled the rapid growth of telemedicine, and this powerful and versatile technology (with a more supportive reimbursement environment) has become an indispensable component in primary care now and into the future. Lin et al emphasize the importance of patient-generated data through an expanding menu of technology-based tools, the advisability of preventive care undertaken between visits, and the importance of population health management. With these essential components, Lin et al propose an integrated and sequential process that incorporates pre-scheduling, pre-visit planning, the medical visit, and inter-visit care management, all shaped and directed by human governance aided by the remarkable power of artificial intelligence. In an accompanying perspective, Sinsky agrees with the transformative potential of telemedicine, but emphasizes that the optimism surrounding telemedicine should be tempered by recognition of its potential risks and limitations. Sinsky draws an analogy to the advent and incorporation of the electronic health record (EHR) in primary care some 20 years ago, an advance similarly met with high expectations. But, for all its indubitable benefits, the mixed blessings of the EHR became readily apparent, including its substantiated role in contributing to physician burnout. Sinsky underscores that telemedicine should be incorporated in primary care within a framework that is cognizant of the importance of teamwork and relationships in patient care, the risks of multitasking, the importance of a faithful accounting of all time that is spent, and the need to decide which patients are more suited for virtual care. Sinsky concludes with a perspective that differs from the one provided by Lin et al on workflows and processes in primary care, and how preventive care should be organized. Both perspectives, however, are united in the view that now is the time to address and heal the ills that afflict primary care, in part by the judicious incorporation of telemedicine and other technological innovations. Primary care is a cornerstone in health care, and insightful discussions such as those provided by Lin et al and Sinsky enable the informed restructuring and strengthening of primary care and the fuller realization of its indispensable mission.\n\n【6】Lin SY, Sattler A, Smith M.

For this to occur the viral spike proteins must bind to the ACE2 receptor on cellular surfaces. An obligatory prior step is the priming of the spike protein as it is cleaved at specific sites, a function in which another surface receptor, TMPRSS2 (a proteolytic enzyme), is instrumental. Viral entry into cells then ensues after which the virus proliferates and kills cells, thereby incurring local and systemic inflammatory responses; interestingly, after viral cell entry occurs, the ACE2 receptor is downregulated. Two articles in the present issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ discuss the therapeutic implications surrounding the involvement of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. Poland et al point out that while ACE2 expression enables viral entry, ACE2 exerts cytoprotective effects in tissues. Such beneficial effects occur because ACE2 degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, the latter representing a vasodilating, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic peptide, and thus one that opposes the recognized vasoconstricting, proinflammatory, and profibrotic actions of angiotensin II; ACE2 expression, through angiotensin 1-7, thus mitigates angiotensin II-dependent inflammation and other adverse effects on tissues. As further pointed out by Poland et al, divergent effects may also surround the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). On the one hand, ARBs increase plasma concentrations of angiotensin II which serves to increase expression of ACE2 and thus, theoretically, increasing cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2; on the other, such increased expression of ACE2 exerts cytoprotective effects in tissue via its anti-inflammatory and other salutary actions. These latter effects of ARBs serve as the basis, in part, for the clinical trials of these agents in COVID-19. Another approach involves blocking the virus in the extracellular space by recombinant ACE2 protein, a soluble form of ACE2 that acts as a decoy and diverts SARS-CoV-2 away from the membrane bound ACE2. The other surface receptor involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, TMPRSS2, is also a potential therapeutic target in COVID-19 for multiple reasons, as clearly delineated by Baughn et al in the same issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ . First, preclinical studies indicate that as tissues are inflamed and injured, TMPRSS2, unlike ACE2, does not appear to exert a cytoprotective role; thus inhibiting the function of TMPRSS2 may not exert adverse effects. Second, rodent models with genetic deficiency of TMPRSS2 exhibit less severe disease when infected by SARS-CoV; extrapolating from these preclinical findings to COVID-19 raises the possibility that suppressing the expression/action of TMPRSS2 may be beneficial. Third, agents that inhibit TMPRSS2 activity are clinically available (for example, camostat and nafamostat) and, indeed, these agents are currently undergoing clinical trials in COVID-19. Fourth, the _TMPRSS2_ gene can be induced by androgen-dependent pathways, and thus its expression may be suppressed by androgen deprivation therapy or antiandrogens. The _TMPRSS2_ gene is expressed in diverse tissues, and highly so in the prostate. Androgen deprivation therapy and/or antiandrogens are established approaches in the treatment of prostate cancer and thus represent a plausible therapeutic strategy in COVID-19. In sum, therapeutic strategies targeting receptors for SARS-CoV-2 may offer clinical benefit in COVID-19, and the results of relevant ongoing studies are thus of considerable interest.\n\n【10】Poland GA, Bass J, Goldstein MR.

The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. It is also known as a “flu shot”.\n\n【6】There are many kinds of influenza viruses, but not all will cause problems in any given year. Therefore, before the influenza vaccine is produced each year, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. and Canadian Public Health Services decide which viruses will most likely cause influenza infections for that year. The antigens, which are substances that cause protective antibodies to be formed, for these viruses are included in the influenza vaccine. Usually, the U.S. and Canada use the same influenza vaccine, however, they are not required to do so.\n\n【7】It is necessary to receive an influenza vaccine injection each year, since influenza infections are usually caused by different kinds of viruses and the protection gained by the vaccine lasts for less than a year.\n\n【8】Influenza is a virus infection of the throat, bronchial tubes, and lungs. It causes fever, chills, cough, headache, muscle aches, and pains in your back, arms, and legs. In addition, adults and children weakened by other diseases or medical conditions, and persons 50 years of age and older, even if they are healthy, may get a much more serious illness that may have to be treated in a hospital. Each year, thousands of people die as a result of an influenza infection.\n\n【9】The best way to help prevent influenza infections is to get an influenza vaccination each year, usually in early November. Immunization (getting a vaccine) against influenza is approved for infants 6 months of age and older, all children, and all adults (including 65 years of age and older).\n\n【10】This vaccine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.\n\n【11】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【12】*   Suspension\n\n【13】Before Using\n------------\n\n【14】In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this vaccine, the following should be considered:\n\n【15】### Allergies\n\n【16】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【17】### Pediatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Agriflu®, Flulaval™, Fluzone® High-Dose, Fluzone® Intradermal, or Fluzone® Intradermal Quadrivalent in the pediatric population.

Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【22】### Geriatric\n\n【23】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of influenza virus vaccine in the elderly.\n\n【24】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Fluzone® Intradermal or Fluzone® Intradermal Quadrivalent in the geriatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【25】### Breastfeeding\n\n【26】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【27】### Drug Interactions\n\n【28】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this vaccine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【29】Receiving this vaccine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【30】*   Rituximab\n\n【31】### Other Interactions\n\n【32】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【33】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【34】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this vaccine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【35】*   Allergy to eggs, egg products, or chicken proteins, history of—Should not be used in patients with this condition.\n\n【36】*   Bleeding problems (eg, hemophilia, thrombocytopenia)—Use with caution. May have an increased risk of bleeding at the injection site.\n\n【37】*   Guillain-Barré syndrome (severe nerve and muscle problem), history of—Use with caution. May cause the symptoms of this condition to return.\n\n【38】*   Illness with fever, moderate or severe—You may need to wait until you feel better before you receive the vaccine.\n\n【39】*   Immune system problems from a disease or medicine—May not work as well in patients with this condition.\n\n【40】*   Kanamycin, neomycin, or polymyxin allergy, history of—Only certain brands of the influenza vaccine can be used. Talk with your doctor about this.\n\n【41】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【42】A nurse or other trained health professional will give you or your child this vaccine. It is given as a shot into one of your muscles or into your skin, usually in the upper arm.\n\n【43】Sometimes there is not enough flu vaccine for everyone. If this happens and you are a healthy adult, you might need to wait until later in the flu season before getting your vaccination.\n\n【44】You need to get the flu vaccine every year to protect you from the flu.\n\n【45】Some children may need a second dose of the vaccine. If your child needs a second dose of the vaccine, it is very important for your child to receive the second dose on schedule. If you must cancel the appointment, make another appointment as soon as possible.\n\n【46】Fluzone® Intradermal Quadrivalent and Fluzone® Quadrivalent come with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\n【47】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【48】It is very important that your child return to your doctor’s office at the right time if your child needs a second dose of the vaccine. Be sure to notify your doctor of any side effects that occur after you or your child receive this vaccine.\n\n【49】This vaccine may cause a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after receiving the injection.\n\n【50】Children who have received a certain brand of the influenza vaccine (Afluria®, Afluria® Quadrivalent) have developed a fever and in some cases a fever with seizures. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about this.\n\n【51】If you are very sick and have a high fever, you will probably need to wait until you are well before you receive this vaccine.\n\n【52】Influenza virus vaccine may not protect everyone who receives it. It will not also treat flu symptoms if you already have the virus.\n\n【53】The tip cap of the prefilled syringe for certain brands of the injection (Agriflu®, Flucelvax®, Fluvirin®, Fluzone®, Fluzone® High-Dose) contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you or your child have a latex allergy before you receive this vaccine.\n\n【54】Tell your doctor if you or your child are using a medicine or treatment that weakens your immune system, including steroid, radiation, or cancer treatment. This vaccine may not work as well if you are also using these treatments. Your doctor may still want you to get the vaccine because it can give you some protection.\n\n【55】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【56】In 1976, a number of people who received the “swine flu” influenza vaccine developed Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a disease that may cause paralysis. Most of these people were over 25 years of age. Although only 10 out of every one million people who received the vaccine actually developed GBS, this number was 6 times higher than would normally have been expected. Most of the people who got GBS recovered completely.\n\n【57】It is assumed that the “swine flu” virus included in the 1976 vaccine caused the problem, but this has not been proven. Since that time, studies have shown that the risk of acquiring GBS from an influenza vaccine is very low (one out of every million people).\n\n【58】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【59】Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【60】#### More common\n\n【61】1.

Data from consecutive patients with definite IE and possible left-sided IE were collected. Propensity score matching and adjustment for survivor bias were used to control for confounders. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 1019 patients with a mean age of 61 years (interquartile range, 47-71 years) were included. Early surgical treatment was performed in 417 episodes (40.9%). By propensity score, we matched 316 episodes: 158 who underwent early surgical treatment and 158 who did not (medical treatment group). In-hospital mortality and late mortality were lower in the surgically treated group (26.6% vs 41.8%; absolute risk reduction \\[ARR\\], −15.2%; _P_ \\=.004 and 29.7% vs 46.2%; ARR, −16.5%; _P_ \\=.002, respectively). Operation was independently associated with a lower risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22-0.79; _P_ \\=.007). Operation was associated with reduced mortality in patients with paravalvular complications (ARR, −40.5%), severe heart failure (ARR, −32%), and native valve endocarditis (ARR, −17.8%).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】This study supports the benefit of surgical treatment in patients with left-sided IE carried out during the initial phase of hospitalization, especially in patients with moderate or severe heart failure and paravalvular extension of infection.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AAR ( absolute risk reduction ), IE ( infective endocarditis ), OR ( odds ratio ), PS ( propensity score ), TEE ( transesophageal echocardiography )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "f8a56a2f-320c-433c-8421-c3593b08f1e6", "title": "Ibrutinib (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Ibrutinib (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Imbruvica\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Ibrutinib is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) in patients with 17p deletion, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). It is also used to treat chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGHVD) after one or more lines of treatment did not work. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Ibrutinib is an antineoplastic agent (cancer medicine).\n\n【6】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Capsule\n*   Tablet\n*   Suspension\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【11】### Allergies\n\n【12】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【13】### Pediatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ibrutinib to treat chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGHVD) in children younger than 1 year of age and to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) with 17p deletion, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【15】### Geriatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ibrutinib in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, anemia, pneumonia, bleeding problems, high blood pressure, heart rhythm problems), which may require caution in patients receiving ibrutinib.\n\n【17】### Breastfeeding\n\n【18】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

{"seq_id": "173961ee-c2a2-4476-bf86-6b8a2f5a8f59", "title": "Microcephaly", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Microcephaly (my-kroh-SEF-uh-lee) is a rare neurological condition in which an infant's head is much smaller than the heads of other children of the same age and sex. Sometimes detected at birth, microcephaly often occurs when there is a problem with brain development in the womb or when the brain stops growing after birth.\n\n【2】Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors. Children with microcephaly often have developmental issues. Although there's no treatment for microcephaly, early intervention with speech, occupational and other supportive therapies may help enhance a child's development and improve quality of life.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】The primary symptom of microcephaly is having a head size that is much smaller than that of other children of the same age and sex.\n\n【5】Head size is a measure of the distance around the top of the child's head (circumference). Using standardized growth charts, health care providers compare the measurement with other children's measurements in percentiles.\n\n【6】Some children just have small heads, with a measurement that falls below an established value for children of the same age and sex. In children with microcephaly, head size measures much smaller than average for the child's age and sex.\n\n【7】A child with more-severe microcephaly may also have a sloping forehead.\n\n【8】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【9】Chances are your health care provider will detect microcephaly at your baby's birth or at a regular well-baby checkup. However, if you think your baby's head is small for the baby's age and sex or isn't growing as it should, talk to your provider.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Microcephaly usually is the result of a problem with brain development, which can occur in the womb (congenital) or during infancy. Microcephaly may be genetic. Other causes may include:\n\n【12】*   **Craniosynostosis (kray-nee-o-sin-os-TOE-sis).** Early fusing of the joints (sutures) between the bony plates that form an infant's skull keeps the brain from growing. Treating craniosynostosis usually means an infant needs surgery to separate the fused bones. This surgery relieves pressure on the brain, giving it enough space to grow and develop.\n*   **Genetic changes.** Down syndrome and other conditions may result in microcephaly.\n*   **Decreased oxygen to the fetal brain (cerebral anoxia).** Certain complications of pregnancy or delivery can impair oxygen delivery to a baby's brain.\n*   **Infections passed to the fetus during pregnancy.** These include toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, German measles (rubella), chickenpox (varicella) and Zika virus.\n*   **Exposure to drugs, alcohol or certain toxic chemicals in the womb.** Any of these may affect fetal brain development during pregnancy.\n*   **Severe malnutrition.** Not getting enough nutrients during pregnancy may hurt fetal brain development.\n*   **Uncontrolled phenylketonuria (fen-ul-kee-toe-NU-ree-uh), also known as PKU, in the mother.** phenylketonuria (PKU) hampers the mother's ability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine and may affect brain development of the fetus during pregnancy.\n\n【13】Complications\n-------------\n\n【14】Some children with microcephaly achieve developmental milestones even though their heads will always be small for their age and sex. But depending on the cause and severity of the microcephaly, complications may include:\n\n【15】*   Developmental delays, including speech and movement\n*   Difficulties with coordination and balance\n*   Dwarfism or short stature\n*   Facial distortions\n*   Hyperactivity\n*   Intellectual delays\n*   Seizures\n\n【16】Prevention\n----------\n\n【17】Learning your child has microcephaly can raise questions about future pregnancies. Work with your health care provider to determine the cause of the microcephaly. If the cause is genetic, you may want to talk to a genetics counselor about the risk of microcephaly in future pregnancies.\n\n【18】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Participants were followed until December 31, 2003, or until the date of death. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses evaluated the strength of the associations, controlling for covariates.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Participants (3220 \\[25%\\] women) averaged 53.0±11.3 years of age at baseline. During a median follow-up of 13.5 years, 1139 deaths occurred. Receiving social support from relatives reduced mortality risk by 19% (hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95). Receiving spousal/partner support also reduced mortality risk by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99). Receiving social support from friends was not associated with mortality risk (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.75-1.09); however, participants reporting social contact with 6 or 7 friends on a weekly basis had a 24% lower mortality risk than did those in contact with 0 or 1 friend (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-0.98). Contact with 2 to 5 or 8 or more friends was not associated with mortality risk, nor was the number of weekly contacts with relatives.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Receiving social support from one’s spouse/partner and relatives and maintaining weekly social interaction with 6 to 7 friends reduced mortality risk. Such data may inform interventions to improve long-term survival.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACLS ( Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Inclusion criteria included randomized or nonrandomized studies with a minimum CR dose of 4 or higher and presence of a control/comparison group. Citations were considered for inclusion, and data were extracted in included studies independently by 2 investigators. Studies were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression where warranted (covariates included study quality, country, publication year, and diagnosis).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 4630 unique citations, 33 trials were included comparing CR to usual care (ie, no dose). In meta-regression, greater dose was significantly related to lower all-cause mortality (high: −0.77; SE, 0.22; _P_ <.001; medium: −0.80; SE, 0.21; _P_ <.001) when compared with low dose. With regard to morbidity, meta-analysis revealed that dose was significantly associated with fewer percutaneous coronary interventions (high: relative risk, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50-0.84; medium/low: relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.74-1.48; between subgroup difference _P_ \\=.03).

It is thought to be primarily an inherited disease associated with a multitude of clinical manifestations; age at onset varies. Atopic dermatitis may coexist with allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis and asthma, and these 3 conditions are referred to as the atopic triad. Some patients may develop 1, 2, or all 3 of these disorders, which do not necessarily have a parallel course.\n\n【2】Atopic dermatitis is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings obtained from the history and physical examination. Occasionally, laboratory tests such as determination of total or specific IgE levels are helpful, as is skin biopsy. Most affected patients have dry skin, are intolerant of harsh soaps and detergents, and report that wool clothing creates an itchy sensation on the skin. Pruritus may be severe and is often maximal in the fold or flexural areas of the sides of the neck and in the antecubital and popliteal fossae. Scratching the skin often causes thickened or “lichenified” areas, and secondary impetiginization from gram-positive bacteria ( _Staphylococcus aureus_ ) is common. Other physical findings include excessive wrinkling of the skin over the extensor aspects of the hands and around the eyes, particularly the lower eyelid. This latter finding is referred to as Dennie-Morgan folds. Some patients have subtle circumoral pallor and may demonstrate white dermatographism on stroking of the skin, as opposed to the normal triple response of Lewis. Hand eczema may be the presenting sign, especially in persons who must wash their hands repeatedly throughout the day. Patients with atopic dermatitis have altered skin immunity manifested by increased susceptibility to infection with herpesvirus and bacteria. Rarely, those with severe atopy may develop a widespread herpetic infection of the skin known as eczema herpeticum or Kaposi varicelliform eruption. Patients with atopic dermatitis also have increased eosinophils in the skin and sometimes in the peripheral blood. Serum IgE levels are often elevated, and specific IgE levels to allergens may be increased. Furthermore, patients with atopic dermatitis have diminished ability for sensitization to topically applied allergens. This seems somewhat paradoxical but is another reflection of the altered immune status of such patients.\n\n【3】The treatment of atopic dermatitis requires recognition of factors that aggravate and exacerbate the condition in a specific patient, including environmental and infectious factors. Contact irritants and allergens must be identified and removed. Treatment of the skin consists of hydrating lotions and creams, and topical corticosteroid or immunomodulating creams/ointments are used to decrease inflammation. Antihistamines may be therapeutic in some patients.\n\n【4】Article info\n------------\n\n【5】### Identification\n\n【6】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/80.1.107\n\n【7】### Copyright\n\n【8】© 2005 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

{"seq_id": "c9989585-e6c2-4c91-8bb9-c3a7b9c91935", "title": "Cleft lip and cleft palate", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Cleft lip and cleft palate are openings or splits in the upper lip, the roof of the mouth (palate) or both. Cleft lip and cleft palate result when facial structures that are developing in an unborn baby don't close completely.\n\n【2】Cleft lip and cleft palate are among the most common birth defects. They most commonly occur as isolated birth defects but are also associated with many inherited genetic conditions or syndromes.\n\n【3】Having a baby born with a cleft can be upsetting, but cleft lip and cleft palate can be corrected. In most babies, a series of surgeries can restore normal function and achieve a more normal appearance with minimal scarring.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Usually, a split (cleft) in the lip or palate is immediately identifiable at birth. Cleft lip and cleft palate may appear as:\n\n【6】*   A split in the lip and roof of the mouth (palate) that affects one or both sides of the face\n*   A split in the lip that appears as only a small notch in the lip or extends from the lip through the upper gum and palate into the bottom of the nose\n*   A split in the roof of the mouth that doesn't affect the appearance of the face\n\n【7】Less commonly, a cleft occurs only in the muscles of the soft palate (submucous cleft palate), which are at the back of the mouth and covered by the mouth's lining. This type of cleft often goes unnoticed at birth and may not be diagnosed until later when signs develop. Signs and symptoms of submucous cleft palate may include:\n\n【8】*   Difficulty with feedings\n*   Difficulty swallowing, with potential for liquids or foods to come out the nose\n*   Nasal speaking voice\n*   Chronic ear infections\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】A cleft lip and cleft palate are usually noticed at birth, and your doctor may start coordinating care at that time. If your baby has signs and symptoms of a submucous cleft palate, make an appointment with your child's doctor.\n\n【11】Causes\n------\n\n【12】Cleft lip and cleft palate occur when tissues in the baby's face and mouth don't fuse properly. Normally, the tissues that make up the lip and palate fuse together in the second and third months of pregnancy. But in babies with cleft lip and cleft palate, the fusion never takes place or occurs only part way, leaving an opening (cleft).\n\n【13】Researchers believe that most cases of cleft lip and cleft palate are caused by an interaction of genetic and environmental factors. In many babies, a definite cause isn't discovered.\n\n【14】The mother or the father can pass on genes that cause clefting, either alone or as part of a genetic syndrome that includes a cleft lip or cleft palate as one of its signs. In some cases, babies inherit a gene that makes them more likely to develop a cleft, and then an environmental trigger actually causes the cleft to occur.\n\n【15】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【16】Several factors may increase the likelihood of a baby developing a cleft lip and cleft palate, including:\n\n【17】*   **Family history.** Parents with a family history of cleft lip or cleft palate face a higher risk of having a baby with a cleft.\n*   **Exposure to certain substances during pregnancy.** Cleft lip and cleft palate may be more likely to occur in pregnant women who smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or take certain medications.\n*   **Having diabetes.** There is some evidence that women diagnosed with diabetes before pregnancy may have an increased risk of having a baby with a cleft lip with or without a cleft palate.\n*   **Being obese during pregnancy.** There is some evidence that babies born to obese women may have increased risk of cleft lip and palate.\n\n【18】Males are more likely to have a cleft lip with or without cleft palate. Cleft palate without cleft lip is more common in females. In the United States, cleft lip and palate are reportedly most common in Native Americans and least common in African-Americans.\n\n【19】Complications\n-------------\n\n【20】Children with cleft lip with or without cleft palate face a variety of challenges, depending on the type and severity of the cleft.\n\n【21】*   **Difficulty feeding.** One of the most immediate concerns after birth is feeding. While most babies with cleft lip can breast-feed, a cleft palate may make sucking difficult.\n*   **Ear infections and hearing loss.** Babies with cleft palate are especially at risk of developing middle ear fluid and hearing loss.\n*   **Dental problems.** If the cleft extends through the upper gum, tooth development may be affected.\n*   **Speech difficulties.** Because the palate is used in forming sounds, the development of normal speech can be affected by a cleft palate. Speech may sound too nasal.\n*   **Challenges of coping with a medical condition.** Children with clefts may face social, emotional and behavioral problems due to differences in appearance and the stress of intensive medical care.\n\n【22】Prevention\n----------\n\n【23】After a baby is born with a cleft, parents are understandably concerned about the possibility of having another child with the same condition. While many cases of cleft lip and cleft palate can't be prevented, consider these steps to increase your understanding or lower your risk:\n\n【24】*   **Consider genetic counseling.** If you have a family history of cleft lip and cleft palate, tell your doctor before you become pregnant. Your doctor may refer you to a genetic counselor who can help determine your risk of having children with cleft lip and cleft palate.\n*   **Take prenatal vitamins.** If you're planning to get pregnant soon, ask your doctor if you should take prenatal vitamins.\n*   **Don't use tobacco or alcohol.** Use of alcohol or tobacco during pregnancy increases the risk of having a baby with a birth defect.\n\n【25】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Take a break from regular activities.\n*   **Ice.** Place an ice pack or bag of frozen peas on the ankle for 15 to 20 minutes three times a day.\n*   **Compression.** Wrap the area with a compression bandage to reduce swelling.\n*   **Elevation.** Raise the foot above the level of the heart to help reduce swelling.\n*   **Pain medicines you can get without a prescription.** Medicines such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) can ease pain and aid healing.\n\n【12】Even with the best of care, the ankle might swell, be stiff or hurt for several weeks.

Intuitively, targeted BES exercises would increase balance and decrease the risk of falls, thereby potentially decreasing the incidence of subsequent fractures. However, the data that Huntoon and Sinaki present may not be substantial enough to recommend that all osteoporotic individuals participate in a program of targeted BES exercises for the purpose of fracture prevention.\n\n【1】The 2002 study by Sinaki et al\n\n【2】*   Sinaki M\n*   Itoi E\n*   Wahner HW\n*   et al.\n\n【3】Stronger back muscles reduce the incidence of vertebral fractures: a prospective 10 year follow-up of postmenopausal women.\n\n【4】无关删除-2_Bone._ 2002; 30 : 836-841\n\n【5】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (325)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【6】of BES exercises for prevention of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women is one of only a few studies to report a statistically significant reduction in vertebral fractures in the intervention group compared with the control group.

Sinaki et al reported that 65 women were randomized, but follow-up was available for only 50 patients because of patient attrition over 10 years. Their data analysis reports the number of fractured vertebrae rather than the number of patients with fracture. Therefore, some patients had more than 1 fracture, which would not normally be considered as independent events for analysis if the primary end point was the presence or absence of fracture. Their study showed that 7 of 23 subjects in the control group and 3 of 27 subjects in the exercise group had at least 1 new fracture. This difference is not significant ( _P_ \\=.0853), possibly because of the small sample sizes in the study. However, from the patient's and physician's perspective, fewer fractures are better than more fractures, and the statistically significant difference in total number of fractures is clinically relevant. Nevertheless, the findings of their study may be insufficient to support a general recommendation that all patients undergo a rigorous program of BES exercises to prevent fractures.\n\n【12】The article by Turner and Robling\n\n【13】*   Turner CH\n*   Robling AG\n\n【14】Designing exercise regimens to increase bone strength.\n\n【15】无关删除-2_Exerc Sport Sci Rev._ 2003; 31 : 45-50\n\n【16】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (344)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【17】mentions that exercise can effectively reduce fracture risk even without dramatic effects on bone mass.

Acute kidney injury stage 3 was identified by an electronic surveillance tool, and patients who received loop diuretics in a dosage of at least 1mg/kg intravenous bolus furosemide equivalent were included. Urine output following loop diuretic challenge was modeled as a restricted cubic spline. We then compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for urine outputs at 2 hours and 6 hours after loop diuretic challenge to predict the need for dialysis within the next 24 hours.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 687 patients included in the study, those who received dialysis were younger and had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores on the day of loop diuretic challenge. Urine outputs at 2 hours and 6 hours were lower in patients who needed dialysis, but urine output by 6 hours was better in predicting dialysis initiation within 24 hours (area under the curve, 0.71 vs 0.67; _P_ \\=.02).

We concur fully but note that nursing presence and involvement can vary by service and institution. A dedicated nephrology nurse-educator may prove vital to the initial disease explanation, treatment clarification, and anxiety reduction for a patient with newly diagnosed chronic kidney disease. In contrast, an “agency” or “shift” nurse who may not have reviewed the patient's medical record is unlikely to ease the patient's stress generated by awareness of the failure of a vital system. Our renal service incorporates and relies on nursing presence, starting with the patient's first contact, and subsequently depends on a skilled nephrology nurse to fill the void sometimes created by incomplete discussions with the responsible but “rushed” nephrologist.\n\n【1】With a growing “shift mentality” for duty hours among health care providers and the large number of various professionals who interact with patients during their progressively shorter hospitalizations, there must be recognition of the necessity for proper staff identification to the patient by the health care “team.” This will be the key to humanizing our care. In the field of medicine, fiscal pressures have resulted in replacement of nurses by technicians and other ancillary staff, complicating the task of fusing patients to a specific nurse or physician. Depersonalized health care generally is perceived as inferior health care. Our study was intended to define a problem that many professionals, both nurses and physicians, have been too busy to note.\n\n【2】Article info\n------------\n\n【3】### Identification\n\n【4】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/81.1.133-b\n\n【5】### Copyright\n\n【6】© 2006 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

People who have SCAD often don't have risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes.\n\n【4】SCAD can cause sudden death if it isn't diagnosed and treated promptly. Seek emergency attention if you have heart attack symptoms — even if you think you aren't at risk of a heart attack.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Symptoms of SCAD can include:\n\n【7】*   Chest pain\n*   A rapid heartbeat or fluttery feeling in the chest\n*   Pain in the arms, shoulders, back or jaw\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Sweating\n*   Unusual, extreme tiredness\n*   Nausea\n*   Dizziness\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】If you have chest pain or think you might be having a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only as a last resort.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】The cause of spontaneous coronary artery dissection is unknown.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】Risk factors for SCAD include:\n\n【14】*   **Female sex.** Though SCAD can occur in both men and women, it tends to affect women more than men.\n*   **Childbirth.** Some women who have had SCAD have recently given birth. SCAD has been found to occur most often in the first few weeks after delivery, but it can also occur during pregnancy.\n*   **Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD).** This condition, which causes irregular growth of cells in artery walls, can weaken artery walls, leading to blockages, dissections or aneurysms. It can also cause high blood pressure, stroke and tears in other blood vessels. Women are more likely to have FMD than men.\n*   **Hormone use.** Hormone therapy, such as from oral contraceptives or infertility treatments, has been associated with SCAD.\n*   **Other conditions affecting blood vessels.** Diseases that cause inflammation of the blood vessels, such as lupus and polyarteritis nodosa, also have been associated with SCAD.\n*   **Inherited connective tissue diseases.** Genetic diseases that cause problems with the body's connective tissues, such as vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome, have been found to occur in people who have had SCAD.\n*   **Very high blood pressure.** Severe high blood pressure can be associated with SCAD.\n*   **Illegal drug use.** Using cocaine or other illegal drugs might increase the risk of SCAD.\n\n【15】Some episodes of SCAD have occurred after extreme or intense physical exercise and severe emotional stress.\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】SCAD is a tear inside an artery that carries blood to the heart. When the inner layers of the artery separate from the outer layers, blood can pool in between the layers. The pressure of the pooling blood can make a short tear longer. Blood trapped between the layers can form a blood clot.\n\n【18】SCAD can slow blood flow through the artery, which weakens the heart muscle. Or blood flow through the artery can stop, causing heart muscle to die (heart attack). A heart attack as a result of SCAD is different from a heart attack caused by hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).\n\n【19】SCAD can happen more than once, despite successful treatment, either soon after the first episode or years later. People who have SCAD can also have a higher risk of other heart problems, such as heart failure due to the damage to the heart muscle from heart attacks.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "d9ca5743-2994-4011-a3fc-efdf1a90e101", "title": "Chest X-rays", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Chest X-rays produce images of your heart, lungs, blood vessels, airways, and the bones of your chest and spine. Chest X-rays can also reveal fluid in or around your lungs or air surrounding a lung.\n\n【2】If you go to your doctor or the emergency room with chest pain, a chest injury or shortness of breath, you will typically get a chest X-ray. The image helps your doctor determine whether you have heart problems, a collapsed lung, pneumonia, broken ribs, emphysema, cancer or any of several other conditions.\n\n【3】Some people have a series of chest X-rays done over time to track whether a health problem is getting better or worse.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Chest X-rays are a common type of exam. A chest X-ray is often among the first procedures you'll have if your doctor suspects heart or lung disease. A chest X-ray can also be used to check how you are responding to treatment.\n\n【6】A chest X-ray can reveal many things inside your body, including:\n\n【7】*   **The condition of your lungs.** Chest X-rays can detect cancer, infection or air collecting in the space around a lung, which can cause the lung to collapse. They can also show chronic lung conditions, such as emphysema or cystic fibrosis, as well as complications related to these conditions.\n*   **Heart-related lung problems.** Chest X-rays can show changes or problems in your lungs that stem from heart problems. For instance, fluid in your lungs can be a result of congestive heart failure.\n*   **The size and outline of your heart.** Changes in the size and shape of your heart may indicate heart failure, fluid around the heart or heart valve problems.\n*   **Blood vessels.** Because the outlines of the large vessels near your heart — the aorta and pulmonary arteries and veins — are visible on X-rays, they may reveal aortic aneurysms, other blood vessel problems or congenital heart disease.\n*   **Calcium deposits.** Chest X-rays can detect the presence of calcium in your heart or blood vessels. Its presence may indicate fats and other substances in your vessels, damage to your heart valves, coronary arteries, heart muscle or the protective sac that surrounds the heart. Calcified nodules in your lungs are most often from an old, resolved infection.\n*   **Fractures.** Rib or spine fractures or other problems with bone may be seen on a chest X-ray.\n*   **Postoperative changes.** Chest X-rays are useful for monitoring your recovery after you've had surgery in your chest, such as on your heart, lungs or esophagus. Your doctor can look at any lines or tubes that were placed during surgery to check for air leaks and areas of fluid or air buildup.\n*   **A pacemaker, defibrillator or catheter.** Pacemakers and defibrillators have wires attached to your heart to help control your heart rate and rhythm. Catheters are small tubes used to deliver medications or for dialysis. A chest X-ray usually is taken after placement of such medical devices to make sure everything is positioned correctly.\n\n【8】Risks\n-----\n\n【9】You may be concerned about radiation exposure from chest X-rays, especially if you have them regularly. But the amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is low — even lower than what you're exposed to through natural sources of radiation in the environment.\n\n【10】Even though the benefits of an X-ray outweigh the risk, you may be given a protective apron if you need multiple images. Tell your doctor if you're pregnant or might be pregnant. The procedure can be performed in a way to protect your abdomen from the radiation.\n\n【11】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【12】Before the chest X-ray, you generally undress from the waist up and wear an exam gown. You'll need to remove jewelry from the waist up, too, since both clothing and jewelry can obscure the X-ray images.\n\n【13】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【14】During the procedure, your body is positioned between a machine that produces the X-rays and a plate that creates the image digitally or with X-ray film. You may be asked to move into different positions in order to take views from both the front and the side of your chest.\n\n【15】During the front view, you stand against the plate, hold your arms up or to the sides and roll your shoulders forward. The X-ray technician may ask you to take a deep breath and hold it for several seconds. Holding your breath after inhaling helps your heart and lungs show up more clearly on the image.\n\n【16】During the side views, you turn and place one shoulder on the plate and raise your hands over your head. Again, you may be asked to take a deep breath and hold it.\n\n【17】Having X-rays taken is generally painless. You don't feel any sensation as the radiation passes through your body. If you have trouble standing, you may be able to have the exam while seated or lying down.\n\n【18】Results\n-------\n\n【19】A chest X-ray produces a black-and-white image that shows the organs in your chest. Structures that block radiation appear white, and structures that let radiation through appear black.\n\n【20】Your bones appear white because they are very dense. Your heart also appears as a lighter area. Your lungs are filled with air and block very little radiation, so they appear as darker areas on the images.\n\n【21】A radiologist — a doctor trained to interpret X-rays and other imaging exams — analyzes the images, looking for clues that may suggest if you have heart failure, fluid around your heart, cancer, pneumonia or another condition.\n\n【22】Your own doctor will discuss the results with you as well as what treatments or other tests or procedures may be necessary.\n\n【23】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

To better understand contemporary utilization trends and outcomes, we reviewed hospitalizations, identified using _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision_ and _International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision_ codes, in which the patient underwent TMVr or mitral valve repair (MVr) with a diagnosis of mitral regurgitation, without stenosis, from the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample from 2014 to 2017. We included 10,020 hospitalizations in which the patient underwent TMVr and 5845 in which the patient underwent MVr and assessed trends in demographic characteristics, patient comorbidities, total hospital charges, and outcomes. Transcatheter mitral valve repair experienced exponential growth, increasing from 150 to 5115 over the study period ( _P_ <.001 for trend), whereas MVr grew to a lesser degree. The median length of stay for TMVr decreased from 4 to 2 days; mortality declined from 3.3% to 1.6% ( _P_ <.001 for both). Both TMVr and MVr rates of discharge home increased over the study period. Total charges for TMVr increased from $149,582 to $178,109, whereas those for MVr increased to a lesser degree, from $149,426 to $157,146 ( _P_ <.001 for both). Discharge disposition, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality all exhibited favorable trends for both procedures. Caution must be exercised in direct comparisons between procedures as they target somewhat different populations. With expanded indications for TMVr, we anticipate further increases in procedural volume, although the effect on MVr remains unclear.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), LOS ( length of stay ), MR ( mitral regurgitation ), MVr ( open (surgical) mitral valve repair ), NIS ( National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample ), TMVr ( transcatheter mitral valve repair )\n\n【4】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【5】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【6】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【7】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【8】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【9】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【10】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【11】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Who could have envisioned that this journal, which began as a weekly, 4-page, in-house publication on April 26, 1926, would achieve its present stature? Currently, the journal has a monthly circulation of 120,000, and it is read-and quoted-worldwide.\n\n【1】Throughout its history, the _Proceedings_ has had close philosophical ties to its sponsor, Mayo Foundation. Far from attempting to dictate the contents of this journal, the Foundation's support has instead served as a philosophical beacon. An understanding of the form and substance of the Mayo philosophy is perhaps best achieved by examining the Mayo emblem, the triple shield, liberally reproduced throughout each issue of the _Proceedings_ . The 3 shields represent the integrated contributions of clinical practice, research, and education in advancing health care. The values represented by this symbol permeate daily life at Mayo Foundation and the _Proceedings_ . Mayo physicians and scientists desire this; the patients in our care and the readers of this journal demand it. _Proceedings_ readers tell us—through voice, electronic, and written communications—that the quality of this journal is meaningfully influenced by translating Mayo Foundation values into the pages of each issue.\n\n【2】To understand better the values that we hold dear to this journal, it is beneficial to hear from those at Mayo Foundation responsible for directing the future of this organization and the future of its clinical care, research, and education. To address this issue, readers of the April 2000 _Proceedings_ are treated to 3 editorials by Foundation leaders. Michael B. Wood, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mayo Foundation, discusses the Foundation's dedication to its core values and its approach to addressing future growth.\n\n【3】*   Wood MB\n\n【4】Mayo Foundation at the turn of the 21 st century: adapting to change but consistent in values.\n\n【5】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2000; 75 : 333-334\n\n【6】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【7】Next, Thomas H.

In this regard, the journal has benefited from a dedicated and talented staff and committed leadership. Among the current office staff, which now numbers 8 full- and part-time members, the senior 5 members have a collective 8 decades of service to this journal. Further, the _Proceedings_ has benefited from the input of 7 different Editors-in-Chief.\n\n【18】The first physician Editor-in-Chief, Edwin D. Bayrd, MD, was appointed in 1964. He was responsible for overseeing the activities of the newly formed Editorial Board and expanding the scope and influence of the journal. Since the term of Dr Bayrd, the journal has continually evolved, with each step reflecting, in some measure, the personality and vision of the Editor-in-Chief at the time. In this issue, we are fortunate to hear from 5 of the 6 former Editors-in-Chief.\n\n【19】*   Bayrd ED\n*   Juergens JL\n*   Siekert RG\n*   Palumbo PJ\n*   Prakash UBS\n\n【20】Reflections from past editors.\n\n【21】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2000; 75 : 340-343\n\n【22】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (5)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【23】(The sixth, Alvin B.

Further, you can read, between the lines and appreciate their highly individual personalities and the values they emphasized while directing the journal.\n\n【24】As the history of this publication (and its antecedent publications) began long before the appointment of the first Editor-in-Chief in 1964, techniques other than Editors' reminiscences are needed to comprehend fully the evolution of the journal. Fortunately, a more comprehensive accounting of the _Proceedings'_ history is provided within the pages of this issue by Jane C. Lantz, Executive Editor of the _Proceedings_ , and Carolyn Stickney Beck, PhD, of the Mayo Center for Humanities in Medicine.\n\n【25】*   Lantz JC\n*   Beck CS\n\n【26】_MayoClinic Proceedings:_ from internal newsletter to international journal.\n\n【27】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2000; 75 : 329-330\n\n【28】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (4)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【29】The occasion of our 75th year of service is an opportunity both to examine the present and past of this journal and to look forward. What will be the future direction of the journal? Obviously, it will be dictated not only by the vision of its leaders but also by the exigencies and demands of the day. Hints of the direction of the journal can be made simply by extrapolating from our past through our present. We have evolved from “a journal of reports by Mayo physicians for Mayo physicians” “(circa April 1926) to “a journal published by Mayo Foundation for physicians worldwide.” Not only has the journal's audience changed, so have its contributors. Authors from around the world who share the journal's vision currently seek out the _Proceedings_ for publication of their work, and they will increasingly contribute to the journal's content in the future. Such a prediction requires little speculation. In 1999 and early 2000, approximately half of the manuscripts submitted. to this journal originated from authors not directly affiliated with Mayo Foundation.\n\n【30】I envision that the _Proceedings_ will take a more active leadership role in identifying issues of critical importance to the future of health care. This will be accomplished through reports of original research, editorials, commentaries, and reviews. Further, I predict that the messages delivered in our print journal will be disseminated to nontraditional audiences by the latest in communication techniques. We are seeing this evolution already. The current _Proceedings_ will become increasingly available to all audiences through the pages of our Web site and other repositories of electronic information. Further, the lay media, which have access to this information, are spreading our messages as well. For example, an article published in the February 2000 issue\n\n【31】*   Manila T\n*   Colligan RC\n*   Malinchoc M\n*   Offord KP\n\n【32】Optimists vs pessimists: survival rate among medical patients over a 30-year period.\n\n【33】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2000; 75 : 140-143\n\n【34】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【35】reached an audience of about 94 million within 1 month after the article's publication (John J. Murphy, oral communication, March 2000).\n\n【36】This journal has the promise of a brilliant future. Worldwide, clinical advances and scientific discoveries are progressing at an unprecedented pace. Reports based on this work provide increasingly rich material for each _Proceedings_ issue. Further, advances in communications technology and the willingness of this journal to refine its communication methods will improve exchanges among authors and readers and will shorten the time from manuscript receipt to publication.\n\n【37】At _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , we have a passion for excellence. We hope to inspire others to join our cause so that together we can produce the best _Proceedings_ ever. To some, such a statement may appear to be unbridled idealism; to others, it is an attainable vision. At Mayo Foundation and the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the two. As Charles H. Mayo, MD, said of the Mayo experience, “If we excel in anything, it is in our capacity for translating idealism into action.” This concept has served us well in the past, and it will help guide our path into the future.\n\n【38】The beginning of our 75th year is a time of celebration and anticipation for those of us who contribute to, lead, and read this journal. Our expectations are great. As we look forward, we are ever mindful of the loyal support of our authors and readers.

We studied preoperative comorbidity, intraoperative hypotension, and postoperative data in patients with postoperative stupor or coma and compared the characteristics with control patients (surgical intensive care unit patients with neurologic consultations for other reasons).\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】A total of 35 patients with stupor or coma after surgery and 31 control patients participated in this study. Comatose patients were older ( _P_ \\=.004) and had significantly more presurgical comorbidity ( _P_ <.001), cardiovascular surgical procedures ( _P_ <.001), and intraoperative hypotension ( _P_ \\=.03). Adjusted for age and comorbidity, intraoperative hypotension remained statistically significant but not after adjusting for cardiovascular surgery. Of the 34 computed tomograms obtained, 41% showed abnormal results; of the 12 magnetic resonance images obtained, 58% showed abnormal results. Both showed primarily infarctions. In 4 patients with normal computed tomographic results, magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple territorial infarctions.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Prior comorbidity, older age, intraoperative hypotension, and cardiovascular surgery may predispose patients to postoperative coma. Widespread structural ischemic brain damage was often documented by neuroimaging. Metabolic causes for coma were uncommon.\n\n【8】CT ( computed tomography ), EEG ( electroencephalography ), ICU ( intensive care unit ), MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging )\n\n【9】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【13】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【15】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "1d2ffbf9-4635-450c-8c07-cda817044854", "title": "Ordering Blood for the Wrong Patient—Getting Inside the Minds of Ordering Physicians", "text": "【0】Ordering Blood for the Wrong Patient—Getting Inside the Minds of Ordering Physicians\n### Objective\n\n【1】To assess the impact on ordering errors when physicians stopped handwriting patient identifiers on requests for blood transfusion.\n\n【2】### Material and Methods\n\n【3】Physicians, frustrated by the amount of time required to complete paper forms to order blood, asked if the requirement for handwritten patient identifiers, which were in addition to such information “stamped” on blood requests, could be eliminated. We acquiesced to the request, modified the blood ordering forms accordingly, and continued to monitor ordering errors.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】After elimination of the handwritten identifiers in 1997, ordering errors increased from an annual rate of 1 in 10,000 to 6 in 10,000 blood requests by late 1999. We alerted the clinicians by newsletter, and the rate decreased somewhat (3 in 10,000 requests). However, the error rate did not decrease to its previous level of 1 in 10,000 requests until mid-2001, about 21/2 years after reinstitution of the requirement for handwritten patient identifiers.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】An obligatory second entry of demographic identifiers on a blood order requires ordering physicians to carefully consider the identity of the patient receiving a transfusion and reduces the likelihood of transfusion of an unintended recipient. Error management tools, such as a predetermined method for planning, reviewing, and documenting all changes, facilitate detection of trends and responses to corrective actions.\n\n【8】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【9】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【10】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【11】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【12】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【13】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【14】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【15】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Per protocol, FETO was offered for life-threatening severe CDH at between 26 and 29 weeks' gestation. Regenerative outcome end point was fetal lung growth. Gestational age at procedure and maternal and perinatal outcomes were additional monitored parameters.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Diagnosis by ultrasonography of severe CDH was based on extremely reduced lung size (observed-to-expected lung area to head circumference ratio \\[o/e-LHR\\], eg, o/e-LHR of 20.3% for fetus 1 and 23.0% for fetus 2) along with greater than one-third of the liver herniated into the chest in both fetuses. Both patients underwent successful FETO at 28 weeks. At the time of intervention, no maternal or fetal complications were observed. Postintervention, fetal lung growth was observed in both fetuses, reaching an o/e-LHR of 62.7% at 36 weeks in fetus 1 and 52.4% at 32 weeks in fetus 2. The balloons were removed successfully at 35 weeks and 4 days by ultrasound-guided puncture in the first patient and at 32 weeks and 3 days by ex utero intrapartum therapy-to-airway procedure in the second patient. Postnatal management followed standard of care with patch CDH therapy. At discharge, one patient was breathing normally, whereas the other required minimal nasal cannula oxygen support.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The successful launch of the first fetoscopic therapy for CDH at Mayo Clinic reveals its feasibility and safety, with early signs of benefit documented by fetal lung growth and reversal of severe pulmonary hypoplasia.\n\n【9】### Trial Registration\n\n【10】clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: G170062.\n\n【11】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【12】CDH ( congenital diaphragmatic hernia ), EXIT ( ex utero intrapartum therapy ), FETO ( fetoscopic tracheal occlusion ), IV ( intravenous ), o/e-LHR ( observed-to-expected lung area to head circumference ratio ), MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging )\n\n【13】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【14】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【15】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【16】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【17】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【18】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【19】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【20】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

M-M-R II\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccine (live) is an active immunizing agent that is given to protect against infections caused by measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles). It works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the virus.\n\n【6】Measles (also known as coughing measles, hard measles, morbilli, red measles, rubeola, and 10-day measles) is an infection that is easily spread from one person to another. Infection with measles can cause serious problems, including stomach problems, pneumonia, ear infections, sinus problems, convulsions (seizures), brain damage, and possibly death. The risk of serious complications and death is greater for adults and infants than for children and teenagers.\n\n【7】Mumps is an infection that can cause serious problems, such as encephalitis and meningitis, which affect the brain. In addition, adolescent boys and men are very susceptible to a condition called orchitis, which causes pain and swelling in the testicles and scrotum and, in rare cases, sterility. Also, mumps infection can cause spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) in women during the first 3 months of pregnancy.\n\n【8】Rubella (also known as German measles) is a serious infection that causes miscarriages, stillbirths, or birth defects in unborn babies when pregnant women get the disease.\n\n【9】This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Powder for Solution\n*   Powder for Suspension\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this vaccine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Priorix® injection in infants younger than 12 months of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【18】Use of M-M-R® II is not recommended in children younger than 12 months of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established for measles vaccine in children younger than 6 months of age and for mumps and rubella vaccine in children younger than 12 months of age.\n\n【19】### Geriatric\n\n【20】Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of Priorix® and M-M-R® II injection have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of Priorix® injection in the elderly.\n\n【21】### Breastfeeding\n\n【22】Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.\n\n【23】### Drug Interactions\n\n【24】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this vaccine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【25】Receiving this vaccine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

People with the disease have low levels of von Willebrand factor, a protein that helps blood clot, or the protein doesn't perform as it should.\n\n【2】Most people with the disease are born with it, having inherited it from one or both parents. However, warning signs, such as heavy bleeding after a dental procedure, might not show up for years.\n\n【3】Von Willebrand disease can't be cured. But with treatment and self-care, most people with this disease can lead active lives.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Many people with von Willebrand disease don't know it because the signs are mild or absent. The most common sign of the condition is abnormal bleeding.\n\n【6】There are three main types of the disease. The amount of bleeding varies from one person to another, depending on the type and severity of the disease.\n\n【7】If you have von Willebrand disease, you might have:\n\n【8】*   Excessive bleeding from an injury or after surgery or dental work\n*   Frequent nosebleeds that don't stop within 10 minutes\n*   Heavy or long menstrual bleeding\n*   Heavy bleeding during labor and delivery\n*   Blood in your urine or stool\n*   Easy bruising or lumpy bruises\n\n【9】Menstrual signs and symptoms might include:\n\n【10】*   Blood clots greater than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter in your menstrual flow\n*   The need to change your menstrual pad or tampon more than once an hour\n*   The need to use double sanitary protection for menstrual flow\n*   Symptoms of anemia, including tiredness, fatigue or shortness of breath\n\n【11】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【12】Contact your doctor if you have bleeding that lasts a long time or is hard to stop.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】The usual cause of von Willebrand disease is an inherited abnormal gene that controls von Willebrand factor — a protein that plays a key role in blood clotting.\n\n【15】When you have low levels of this protein or it doesn't work as it should, small blood cells called platelets cannot stick together properly nor attach themselves normally to the blood vessel walls when an injury has occurred. This interferes with the clotting process and can sometimes cause uncontrolled bleeding.\n\n【16】Many people with von Willebrand disease also have low levels of factor VIII, another protein that helps in clotting.\n\n【17】Factor VIII is involved in another inherited clotting disorder called hemophilia. But unlike hemophilia, which mainly affects males, von Willebrand disease affects males and females and is usually milder.\n\n【18】Rarely, von Willebrand disease can develop later in life in people who didn't inherit an affected gene from a parent. This is known as acquired von Willebrand syndrome, and it's likely caused by an underlying medical condition.\n\n【19】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【20】The main risk factor for von Willebrand disease is having a family history of it. Parents pass the gene for the disease to their children. Rarely, the disease skips generations.\n\n【21】The disease is usually an \"autosomal dominant inherited\" disorder, which means you need a mutated gene from only one parent to get the disease. If you have the gene for von Willebrand disease, you have a 50% chance of transmitting this gene to your children.\n\n【22】The most severe form of the condition is \"autosomal recessive,\" which means both of your parents have to pass a mutated gene to you.\n\n【23】Complications\n-------------\n\n【24】Rarely, von Willebrand disease can cause uncontrollable bleeding, which can be life-threatening. Other complications of von Willebrand disease can include:\n\n【25】*   **Anemia.** Heavy menstrual bleeding can cause iron deficiency anemia.\n*   **Swelling and pain.** This can be a result of abnormal bleeding in the joints or soft tissue.\n\n【26】Prevention\n----------\n\n【27】If you plan to have children and have a family history of von Willebrand disease, consider genetic counseling. If you carry the gene for von Willebrand disease, you can pass it on to your offspring, even if you don't have symptoms.\n\n【28】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

All hospitalizations were examined for the 2 years following incident HF, and each was categorized as due to HF, other cardiovascular causes, or noncardiovascular causes. Negative binomial regression examined associations between time periods (0-30, 31-182, 183-365, and 366-730 days after diagnosis) and hospitalizations.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】During the 2 years after diagnosis, 3495 hospitalizations were observed among 1336 of the 1972 patients with HF. The age- and sex-adjusted rates of hospitalizations were highest in the first 30 days after diagnosis (3.33 per person-year vs 1.33, 1.07, and 1.00 per person-year for 31-182 days, 183-365 days, and 366-730 days, respectively). The rates of hospitalizations were similar across sex, presentation of HF (inpatient or outpatient), and type of HF (preserved or reduced ejection fraction). Patients diagnosed as inpatients who had long hospital stays (>5 days) experienced more than a 30% increased risk of rehospitalization within 30 days of dismissal. Importantly, most hospitalizations (2222 of 3495 \\[63.6%\\]) were due to noncardiovascular causes, and a minority (440 of 3495 \\[12.6%\\]) were due to HF. The rates of noncardiovascular hospitalizations were higher than those for HF or other cardiovascular hospitalizations across all follow-up for all time periods after HF.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Patients with HF experience high rates of hospitalizations, particularly within the first 30 days, and mostly for noncardiovascular causes. To reduce hospitalizations in patients with HF, an integrated approach focusing on comorbidities is required.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】EF ( ejection fraction ), HF ( heart failure ), ICD-9-CM ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ), LVEF ( left ventricular EF )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Included were all adults with a first purchase of an ACE-I, an ARB, or a calcium channel blocker (CCB) between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2009, defined as the index date. Measures of Hb levels before and 1 year after the index date were reviewed, and the change was calculated. All the analyses were stratified by pharmaceutical class. The main exposure variables were the proportion of days covered (PDC) by these drugs and the mean enalapril dosage (for enalapril users only).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Levels of Hb before and after treatment were available for 14,754 patients taking ACE-Is, 751 taking ARBs, and 3087 taking CCBs. A high PDC was significantly associated with greater yearly reductions in Hb levels compared with a low PDC for CCB use, but was more pronounced for ACE-I and ARB use. A high PDC was also associated with a higher odds of developing anemia in ACE-I users (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 1.59; _P_ <.001) and ARB users (OR, 2.21; _P_ \\=.05). In nonanemic enalapril users, every 10-mg increment in daily dose was associated with an OR of 1.45 for the development of anemia ( _P_ <.001). The association remained after excluding nonadherent patients.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Levels of Hb are reduced during the first year of use of ACE-Is and to a lesser extent with use of ARBs. This association is dose dependent and is not explained by patient adherence.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACE-I ( angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ), ARB ( angiotensin II receptor blocker ), CCB ( calcium channel blocker ), Hb ( hemoglobin ), IHD ( ischemic heart disease ), MHS ( Maccabi Healthcare Services ), OR ( odds ratio ), PDC ( proportion of days covered ), WHO ( World Health Organization )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Zimamox\n\n【6】### Descriptions\n\n【7】Amoxicillin is used to treat bacterial infections in many different parts of the body. It is also used with other medicines (e.g., clarithromycin, lansoprazole) to treat H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcers.\n\n【8】Amoxicillin belongs to the group of medicines known as penicillin antibiotics. It works by killing the bacteria and preventing their growth. However, this medicine will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Tablet\n*   Powder for Suspension\n*   Tablet, Chewable\n*   Tablet, Extended Release\n*   Capsule\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of amoxicillin in children. However, newborns and infants 3 months of age and younger have incompletely developed kidney functions, which may need a lower dose of this medicine.\n\n【18】### Geriatric\n\n【19】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of amoxicillin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving amoxicillin.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

{"seq_id": "a3dd0da0-8e64-4b9a-afbd-d6b3a13bf9dc", "title": "Anastrozole (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Anastrozole (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Arimidex\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Anastrozole is used to treat early hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. It is also used for first-line treatment of hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-unknown advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer. Anastrozole is also used to treat advanced breast cancer that has grown or spread after tamoxifen treatment. This medicine is used only in women who have already stopped menstruating (postmenopausal).\n\n【6】Many breast cancer tumors grow in response to estrogen. This medicine interferes with the production of estrogen in the body. As a result, the amount of estrogen that the tumor is exposed to is reduced, limiting the growth of the tumor.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Tablet\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of anastrozole in children. However, efficacy has not been established to treat teenage boys with pubertal gynecomastia and to treat precocious puberty in teenage girls with McCune-Albright Syndrome.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of anastrozole in the elderly.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【22】### Other Interactions\n\n【23】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【24】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【25】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【26】*   Bone problems (eg, osteoporosis) or\n*   Hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol or fat in the blood) or\n*   Ischemic heart disease (eg, heart attack, angina), history of, or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【27】*   Premenopausal women (still having menstrual cycles)—Should not be used in these patients.\n\n【28】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【29】Take this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance for side effects.\n\n【30】This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【31】You may take this medicine with or without food.\n\n【32】Anastrozole sometimes causes nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. However, it is very important that you continue to use the medicine, even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your doctor for ways to prevent these effects or make them less severe.\n\n【33】### Dosing\n\n【34】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【35】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【36】*   For oral dosage form (tablets):\n    *   For breast cancer:\n        *   Adults—1 milligram (mg) once a day.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【37】### Missed Dose\n\n【38】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【39】### Storage\n\n【40】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【41】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【42】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【43】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【44】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【45】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【46】It is unlikely that a postmenopausal woman may become pregnant. But, you should know that using this medicine while you are pregnant could harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control during treatment with this medicine and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while using this medicine, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【47】Do not use this medicine together with tamoxifen (Nolvadex®, Soltamox®).\n\n【48】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have itching, hives, hoarseness, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.\n\n【49】Check with your doctor right away if you start having chest pains or difficulty with breathing. This medicine may increase the chance of heart problems, including heart attack, in women who have a history of ischemic heart disease.\n\n【50】This medicine may decrease bone mineral density when used for a long time. A low bone mineral density can cause weak bones or osteoporosis. If you have any questions about this, talk to your doctor.\n\n【51】This medicine may increase your cholesterol or fat in the blood. If this happens, your doctor may give you medicine to lower the cholesterol and fat.\n\n【52】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.

Most discussions of CER have focused on definitions, topic prioritization, and the potential impact of this discipline on individual patient care decisions. Less has been said about the role of health care delivery organizations (herein considered to be establishments with centralized, multidisciplinary resources to provide direct patient care, such as an integrated health system or a practice network) in contributing to the CER knowledge base and applying CER findings.\n\n【1】A recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report describes CER as “the generation and synthesis of evidence that compares the benefits and harms of alternative methods to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor a clinical condition or to improve the delivery of care.”\n\n【2】*   Institute of Medicine of the National Academies\n\n【3】Initial National Priorities for Comparative Effectiveness Research.

Comparative effectiveness research can be conducted on a wide range of substrates, including databases, systematic literature reviews, or clinical studies. The essential purpose of CER is to improve health outcomes at both the individual and the population levels by empowering consumers, clinicians, and policymakers to arrive at informed decisions.\n\n【7】The Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research (established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) has identified 4 areas of CER activity and investment: research, human and scientific capital, data infrastructure, and dissemination and translation into practice.\n\n【8】*   US Department of Health and Human Services\n\n【9】Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research: Report to the President and Congress.

As such, the categories of CER activity have not been earmarked for specific health care entities. In contrast to basic science research, in which academic centers or industry often have advantages because of enhanced resources or experience, due to its nascence, these associations have a limited role in CER.\n\n【13】Within this evolving CER framework, health care delivery organizations will emerge with overlapping roles both as developers and as end-users of CER content. Delivery organizations integrate the 2 main stakeholders in CER: clinicians and patients. Clinical staff can generate CER either indirectly (eg, partnerships in data sharing networks) or directly through active research pursuits (this is less common). Interactions among clinical staff, processes of care, and patients represent opportunities for application of CER. In a fundamental shift from judgment based primarily on service performance alone, health care delivery organizations are increasingly being measured according to outcomes.\n\n【14】*   Bohmer RM\n*   Lee TH\n\n【15】The shifting mission of health care delivery organizations.\n\n【16】无关删除-2_N Engl J Med._ 2009; 361 : 551-553\n\n【17】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (31)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【18】Operationalization of CER at an institutional level supports this transition.\n\n【19】In the current issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , Simpson et al\n\n【20】*   Simpson Jr, RJ\n*   Signorovitch J\n*   Birnbaum H\n*   et al.\n\n【21】Cardiovascular and economic outcomes after initiation of lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin vs simvastatin in an employed population.\n\n【22】无关删除-2_Mayo Clinic Proc._ 2009; 84 : 1065-1072\n\n【23】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (22)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【24】illustrate the complexities of the relationship between CER and health care delivery organizations. Their observational study showed a benefit between cardiovascular outcomes and total cost equivalency with atorvastatin use compared with simvastatin in a large population of patients with employer-based health insurance. The work fulfills the criteria of CER, but from the standpoint of a delivery organization, it triggers an additional series of questions beyond the clinical findings. For example, how do patients within the health care delivery organization compare to the study population? Does responsibility for accessing the study and applying its results fall to individual physicians, or should deployment of CER results be coordinated by designated personnel within the organization? What level of evidence is required to add a new drug to the formulary if an alternative is already in place?\n\n【25】To address these sorts of questions and realize the improved outcomes targeted by CER, health care delivery organizations need to engage the topic on multiple fronts. Mapping the 4 categories of CER activity to delivery organizations' operational and care processes offers mechanisms whereby this engagement can be achieved ( Table ). Often, the foundation for participation in CER can be accomplished by building on or adjusting existing workflows.\n\n【26】TABLE Overlap of CER Activities With Health Care Delivery Organization Processes and Investments\n\n| CER activity category | Examples of related processes within delivery organizations |\n| --- | --- |\n| Research | Patient-centered investigation (internal and external to organization)Contributing to collaborative data exchanges or repositories |\n| Human and scientific capital | Training a core set of staff in data collection and interpretationAppointment of “knowledge management” teamsPersonnel with protected time away from direct patient care |\n| Data infrastructure | Health information technology applicationsClinical analytics (eg, ready access to internal data for process change)Electronic reporting (eg, CMS, adverse events) |\n| Dissemination and translation | Clinical decision supportStandardized order setsEvidence-based quality improvement/patient safety initiativesAdaptive implementation strategiesDefined governance structures for system decision making |\n\n【28】CER = comparative effectiveness research; CMS = Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n【29】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【30】An expanded view of what constitutes CER provides opportunities for delivery organizations that previously have had minimal involvement in the research enterprise.

Indeed, as CER seeks to produce pragmatic information that can improve health care for all Americans, activation of “real-world” systems in the research endeavor is fundamental to success of that mission.\n\n【41】*   Conway PH\n*   Clancy C\n\n【42】Comparative-effectiveness research—implications of the Federal Coordinating Council's report.\n\n【43】无关删除-2_N Engl J Med._ 2009; 361 : 328-330\n\n【44】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (135)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【45】In many health care delivery organizations, human and scientific capital for CER will probably need to take the form of designated groups specializing in its identification, distribution, and adoption. A relatively small number of sites will have capabilities to conduct original research or develop internal CER training programs, so organizational acumen in obtaining and interpreting the communal CER output is of heightened importance. Oversight of this CER knowledge management would potentially fit well in an organization's quality or evidence-based care departments.\n\n【46】Health information technology (HIT) underpins the data infrastructure development activity for CER. Most health care delivery organizations are currently in some stage of HIT implementation. HIT facilitates involvement in CER because the data used in daily operations can be modified for research data exchanges or applied locally to guide process improvement. Beyond the data, especially in view of the impetus toward EHRs, HIT will increasingly be used during transactions between patients and clinicians.\n\n【47】Dissemination and translation activity are the critical leverage points for health care delivery organizations to bring CER to their patients. The extended delays between evidence of an intervention's efficacy and its consistent delivery in practice (eg, β-blockers after acute myocardial infarction) have been well documented.\n\n【48】*   Lee TH\n\n【49】Eulogy for a quality measure.\n\n【50】无关删除-2_N Engl J Med._ 2007; 357 : 1175-1177\n\n【51】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (111)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【52】Clearly, in this era of a rapidly growing scientific knowledge base, expecting individual practitioners to keep up with a new wave of CER publications as a singular mechanism of information knowledge and use is unlikely to yield meaningful gains. Furthermore, because the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Federal Council, and IOM have no authority or plans to adjudicate on specific treatment decisions, this responsibility lies within delivery organizations on a macro (Will a particular statin drug be offered on the system formulary?) and micro (Which statin drug on the formulary will this particularpatient be offered on the basis of his or her risk profile?) level.\n\n【53】Accelerated application of CER in health care delivery organizations can manifest in several forms. Use of standardized order sets is one readily visible example. Growing evidence indicates a favorable impact of order sets and guideline-driven care on metrics such as mortality and length of hospital stay, most recently with pneumonia.\n\n【54】*   Fleming NS\n*   Ogola G\n*   Ballard DJ\n\n【55】Implementing a standardized order set for community-acquired pneumonia: impact on mortality and cost.\n\n【56】无关删除-2_Jt Comm J Qual Patient Saf._ 2009; 35 : 414-421\n\n【57】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【58】*   McCabe C\n*   Kirchner C\n*   Zhang H\n*   Daley J\n*   Fisman DN\n\n【59】Guideline-concordant therapy and reduced mortality and length of stay in adults with community-acquired pneumonia: playing by the rules.\n\n【60】无关删除-2_Arch Intern Med._ 2009; 169 : 1525-1531\n\n【61】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (177)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【62】Construction of these order sets allows embedding of CER content into care processes. For order sets to function efficiently as a CER implementation tool, delivery organizations need to articulate parameters of ownership and approval, explicit standards for content, and education and rollout. This active diffusion of CER represents a practical way to move to the final stage (from effectiveness knowledge to improved health care quality and value) on the translational road map.\n\n【63】*   Dougherty D\n*   Conway PH\n\n【64】The “3T's” road map to transform US health care: the “how” of high-quality care.\n\n【65】无关删除-2_JAMA._ 2008; 299 : 2319-2321\n\n【66】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (288)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【67】*   Naik AD\n*   Petersen LA\n\n【68】The neglected purpose of comparative-effectiveness research.\n\n【69】无关删除-2_N Engl J Med._ 2009; 360 : 1929-1931\n\n【70】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (62)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【71】Clinical decision support for individual order items provides another scenario for implementing CER. This might play out when a health care professional who is using an EHR orders drug A, but, on the basis of specific characteristics of that patient, an alert suggests changing the prescription to drug B. The decision on whether to include both drugs as safe and therapeutically equivalent ordering options would be made at the organizational level; the decision for what to eventually prescribe at the point of care remains in the hands of the health care professional. The optimal workflow for delivering this type of evidence while being sensitive to alert fatigue is an area for future investigation.\n\n【72】Finally, because many health care delivery organizations have embraced quality improvement methodology as a mechanism to effect rapid process change, this approach represents an alternative avenue for translation of CER content. An appealing feature of quality improvement is that it would allow organizations to incorporate CER in selected priority areas quickly, independent of HIT or the more comprehensive systematic cultural and governance changes necessary for order set deployment.\n\n【73】As producers of generalizable knowledge and as stakeholders in CER content and application, health care delivery organizations will need to display adaptability to fully engage CER. Linking current organizational operations to the areas of CER activity is a first step in achieving that protean role. Ultimately, success with CER will be gauged by a health care delivery organization's ability to integrate this information into care processes that improve patient outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Medical records were reviewed to assess technical success, complications, and the need for repeat procedures. Patient satisfaction with DPEJ was also evaluated by means of standardized telephone interviews.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】In 26 (72%) of 36 patients, DPEJ placement was successful. During the mean follow-up of 107 days, none of the patients with DPEJ required reintervention for tube malfunction or displacement. Two patients developed a persistent enterocutaneous fistula following the removal of the DPEJ tube. No other procedure-related complications were noted. Fifteen (78%) of 19 patients who responded to follow-up questions reported an overall satisfaction rating of 8 or higher on a 10–point scale (1, completely dissatisfied, to 10, completely satisfied).\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】We conclude that DPEJ is an effective and safe method for providing jejunal tube feeding. A low reintervention rate along with high patient satisfaction makes DPEJ an attractive alternative to the more commonly placed jejunostomy feeding tubes.\n\n【8】DPEJ ( direct percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy ), PEG ( percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ), PEGJ ( endoscopically positioned transgastric jejunal tube )\n\n【9】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【13】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【15】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\n【6】This medicine does not cure or prevent HIV or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of problems that usually result from AIDS or HIV disease. It will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have some of the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Tablet\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

For achieving success in lowering cancer mortality, current screening practices are highly dependent on evidence-based guidelines from the USPSTF and other organizations. Screening rates for breast, cervix, endometrial, and colorectal cancers far exceed those for malignant melanoma as a possible reflection of more favorable guidelines.

Accordingly, at least a portion of the incremental costs may have a survival benefit and improve the unfavorable years per life lost for this cancer.

Tumor thickness and regional spread at the time of diagnosis are well established as the most important predictors of melanoma mortality. In several case-control and population-based trials, physician-based screening increased the detection of thinner melanomas; we summarize the results of these trials in the following paragraphs and in the Table .

Residents of Germany's most northern state, Schleswig-Holstein (N=1.9 million), were eligible to participate in screening; 360,288 patients (19%) received a visual whole-body skin examination performed by a physician chosen by the participants. Seventy-seven percent of patients (278,741) in the study group were initially evaluated by primary care physicians who completed the training course, and the remainder were evaluated by a dermatologist based on skin cancer risk factors. Data collected 5 years after study inception revealed a 48% reduction in melanoma mortality for the screened group compared with a matched unscreened control group from another locale in Germany. Melanoma detection was 90% for cancers smaller than 1.0 mm. For the detection of 1 melanoma, 620 persons needed to be screened. Biopsies were performed in 50 persons to detect 1 melanoma in men aged 20 to 49 years, with the number dropping to 20 persons for men older than 65 years.\n\n【91】The second arm of the SCREEN project involved screening 28 million patients older than 35 years in the rest of Germany from 2008 through 2013.

Ethical implications and design limitations contribute to the lack of high-quality evidence from randomized studies evaluating the efficacy of cancer screening. Until the evidence base for melanoma screening is further expanded, we propose that a heightened focus is necessary for patients with the highest risk of this disease. White men older than 50 years have a higher risk of dying of this disease, and risk in this group continues to increase with age. This group of men averages 3 to 4 visits to their primary care doctors annually, providing an opportunity for skin cancer screenings. Other well-established risk factors, such as lighter skin pigmentation, sunburns, indoor tanning bed exposure, personal and family history of melanoma, personal history of nonmelanoma skin cancer, multiple nevi, and evolving nevi, should also warrant more frequent skin examinations.\n\n【149】In 2016, US President Barack Obama launched a national cancer initiative program known as the Cancer Moonshot Task Force. The Moonshot Program, developed at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, includes goals for initial screenings and the development of early treatments for some of the deadliest cancers. Patients surveyed in this program ranked melanoma second in importance. Although the USPSTF has not found sufficient evidence to advocate for widespread melanoma screening, we have identified other pathways to improving outcomes for malignant melanoma. Primary prevention through public awareness and education has been found to be a pathway for success. Educating primary care residents and primary care physicians on skin cancer evaluation is recommended for improving early detection.

Cases were matched with 3 controls on event/index month, age, geographic region, diagnosis of hypogonadism, and diagnosis of any underlying prothrombotic condition. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs for the risk of VTE associated with previous exposure to testosterone therapy.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Exposure to testosterone therapy in the 15 days before the event/index date was not associated with an increased risk of VTE (aOR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.73-1.12). None of the specific routes of administration examined were associated with an increased risk of VTE (topical \\[aOR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.61-10.41\\], transdermal \\[aOR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.38-2.16\\], and intramuscular \\[aOR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.80-1.64\\]). These findings persisted using exposure windows that extended to 30 and 60 days before the event/index date.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Having filled a prescription for testosterone therapy was not associated with an increased risk of VTE in commercially insured middle-aged and older men. These findings may provide clinically relevant information about the benefit-risk assessment for men with testosterone deficiency considering treatment.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】aOR ( adjusted odds ratio ), CDM ( Clinformatics Data Mart ), DVT ( deep vein thrombosis ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), ICD-9-CM ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ), NSAID ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ), PE ( pulmonary embolism ), VTE ( venous thromboembolism )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Butisol Sodium\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Butabarbital is used to treat insomnia (trouble sleeping). It is also used before a surgical procedure to make a person sleep (be unconscious).\n\n【6】Butabarbital belongs to the group of medicines called barbiturates. They act in the central nervous system (CNS) to slow down the nervous system. When used to treat insomnia, butabarbital will help you get to sleep faster and sleep throughout the night. In most cases, sleep medicines should only be used for short periods of time, such as 1 or 2 days, and for no longer than 1 or 2 weeks.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Tablet\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of butabarbital in children when used before a surgical procedure. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children to treat insomnia.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of butabarbital in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine and are more likely to have age-related liver or kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【28】Using this medicine with any of the following may cause an increased risk of certain side effects but may be unavoidable in some cases. If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use this medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】*   Ethanol\n\n【30】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【31】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【32】*   Alcohol abuse, history of or\n*   Asthma or\n*   Depression or\n*   Drug abuse, history of or\n*   Mental illness, history of or\n*   Patients with suicidal thoughts or behavior—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【33】*   Kidney disease or\n*   Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【34】*   Liver disease, severe (eg, hepatic coma) or\n*   Porphyria (enzyme problem), manifest or latent, history of—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\n\n【35】*   Patients with acute or chronic pain (except pain after surgery or chemotherapy)—Use with caution.

Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. If too much is taken, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence).\n\n【38】If you are using butabarbital to treat insomnia:\n\n【39】*   Take it just before going to bed, when you are ready to go to sleep. This medicine works very quickly to put you to sleep.\n*   Do not take this medicine when your schedule does not permit you to get a full night's sleep (about 7 to 8 hours). If you must wake up before this, you may continue to feel drowsy and may experience memory problems, because the effects of the medicine have not had time to wear off.\n\n【40】Take this medicine on an empty stomach.\n\n【41】Shake the oral liquid well before each use. Measure the medicine with a marked measuring spoon, oral syringe, or medicine cup. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.\n\n【42】### Dosing\n\n【43】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【44】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【45】*   For oral dosage forms (solution, tablets):\n    *   For daytime sleepiness:\n        *   Adults—15 to 30 milligrams (mg) 3 or 4 times a day.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For insomnia:\n        *   Adults—50 to 100 milligrams (mg).\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n    *   For sleepiness before surgery:\n        *   Adults—50 to 100 milligrams (mg), 60 to 90 minutes before surgery.\n        *   Children—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The dose is usually 2 to 6 mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight per day. However, the dose is not more than 100 mg per day.\n\n【46】### Missed Dose\n\n【47】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【48】If you use this medicine to treat insomnia, take it only when you cannot sleep. You do not need to keep a schedule for taking it.\n\n【49】### Storage\n\n【50】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【51】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【52】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【53】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【54】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【55】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【56】Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Birth control pills may not work as well to prevent pregnancy when used with this medicine. Use another form of birth control (eg, condoms, spermicide) along with your pills. If you think you have become pregnant while using this medicine, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【57】If you think you need to take butabarbital for more than 7 to 10 days, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Insomnia that lasts longer than this may be a sign of another medical problem.\n\n【58】Butabarbital may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hives, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat while you are using this medicine.\n\n【59】This medicine contains a yellow dye called tartrazine, which may cause severe allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any allergies, including an allergy to aspirin, or asthma.\n\n【60】This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are using this medicine.\n\n【61】This medicine may cause some people, especially older persons, to become drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, clumsy or unsteady, or less alert than they are normally, which may lead to falls. Even though butabarbital is taken at bedtime, it may cause some people to feel drowsy or less alert on arising. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\n【62】If you develop any unusual and strange thoughts or behavior while you are using butabarbital, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Some changes that have occurred in people using this medicine are like those seen in people who drink alcohol and then act in a manner that is not normal. Other changes may be more unusual and extreme, such as confusion, worsening of depression, hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there), suicidal thoughts, and unusual excitement, nervousness, or irritability.\n\n【63】This medicine may cause you to do things while you are still asleep that you may not remember the next morning. It is possible you could drive a car, sleepwalk, have sex, make phone calls, or prepare and eat food while you are asleep or not fully awake. Tell your doctor right away if you learn that any of these has happened.\n\n【64】Do not change your dose or stop using it without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping completely. Stopping this medicine suddenly may cause withdrawal side effects.\n\n【65】If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once. Taking an overdose of butabarbital or taking alcohol or other CNS depressants with butabarbital may lead to serious breathing problems and unconsciousness. Some signs of an overdose include: severe drowsiness, severe nausea or vomiting, staggering, and troubled breathing.\n\n【66】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【67】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【68】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【69】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【70】#### Rare\n\n【71】1.

Validated instruments were used to assess burnout, depression, and quality of life (QOL). Students were also asked about the prevalence of significant personal life events in the previous 12 months and strategies used to cope with stress.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Although symptoms of depression and overall burnout were similar among minority and nonminority students, minority students were more likely to have a low sense of personal accomplishment ( _P_ \\=.02) and lower QOL in a number of domains (all _P_ ≤.05). These differences persisted on multivariate analysis that controlled for demographic characteristics and recent life events. Minority students were also more likely to have a child ( _P_ \\=.01), originate from outside Minnesota ( _P_ <.001), and experience a major personal illness in the last 12 months ( _P_ \\=.03).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】As a group, the minority medical students in this survey had a lower sense of personal accomplishment and QOL than nonminority students. Additional studies are needed to provide insight regarding the causes of these inequities and the unique challenges faced by minority medical students. Efforts to improve minority students' well-being, QOL, and learning experience may help prevent attrition among minority medical students and promote diversification in the physician workforce.\n\n【8】LASA ( Linear Analogue Self Assessment Well-being Survey ), QOL ( quality of life ), SF-8 ( Medical Outcomes Study 8-Item Short-Form Health Survey ), URM ( underrepresented minority )\n\n【9】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【13】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【15】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

We assessed the annual incidence, clinical characteristics, morbidity, mortality, and cost of IE-related hospitalizations.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The incidence of IE-related hospitalizations increased from 34,488 (15.9; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 15.73, 16.06) per 100,000 adults) in 2003 to 54,405 (21.8; 95% CI, 21.60-21.97) per 100,000 adults) in 2016 ( _P_ <.001). The prevalence of patients below 30 years of age, and those who inject drugs, increased from 7.3% to 14.5% and from 4.8% to 15.1%, respectively ( _P_ <.001). The annual volume of valve surgery for IE increased from 4049 in 2003 to 6460 in 2016 ( _P_ <.001), but the ratio of valve surgery to IE-hospitalizations did not decrease (11.7% in 2003; 11.8% in 2016). There was also a temporal increase in risk-adjusted rates of stroke (8.0% to 13.2%), septic shock (5.4% to 16.3%), and mechanical ventilation (7.7% to 16.5%; _P_ <.001). However, risk-adjusted mortality decreased from 14.4% to 9.8% ( _P_ <.001). Median length-of-stay and mean inflation-adjusted cost decreased from 11 to 10 days and from $45,810±$61,787 to $43,020±$55,244, respectively, ( _P_ <.001). Nonetheless, the expenditure on IE hospitalizations increased ($1.58 billion in 2003 to $2.34 billion in 2016; _P_ <.001).\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】There is a substantial recent rise in endocarditis hospitalizations in the United States. Although the adjusted in-hospital mortality of endocarditis and the cost of admission decreased over time, the overall expenditure on in-hospital care for endocarditis increased.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】IE ( infective endocarditis ), IVDU ( intravenous drug use ), NIS ( National Inpatient Sample ), OR ( odds ratio )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

His home medications included aspirin (81 mg), pantoprazole (40 mg), paroxetine (37.5 mg), rosuvastatin (20 mg), and terazosin (10 mg) daily. Review of systems was notable for increasing exertional and supine shortness of breath. He also reported occasional chest discomfort on the right side with and without exertion. He had no fevers, chills, diaphoresis, palpitations, syncope, abdominal pain, changes in his bowel/urinary habits, or skin abnormalities.\n\n【1】Vital signs included blood pressure of 118/62 mm Hg, a bounding pulse rate of 93 beats/min, temperature of 36.8 °C, and oxygen saturation of 96%. On physical examination, the patient was a well-appearing man in no acute distress. His skin was warm, and no thyromegaly, cervical adenopathy, carotid bruit, or jugular vein distention was noted. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal rate and regular rhythm; the S <sub>1 </sub> and S <sub>2 </sub> were normal, but a notable grade 2/4 early diastolic decrescendo murmur was detected, most prominently heard over the right second intercostal space. Pulmonary examination revealed bilateral lower lobe rales. His abdomen was soft and nontender with normal bowel sounds. He was alert and oriented. Because of the presence of a new diastolic murmur and symptomatic congestive heart failure on examination, he was advised to go to the emergency department.\n\n【2】*   1.\n\n【3】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ cause of this patient’s diastolic murmur?**\n\n【4】    *   a.\n\n【5】        Pulmonary regurgitation (PR)\n\n【6】    *   b.\n\n【7】        Aortic regurgitation (AR)\n\n【8】    *   c.\n\n【9】        Aortic stenosis (AS)\n\n【10】    *   d.\n\n【11】        Mitral stenosis\n\n【12】    *   e.\n\n【13】        Mitral regurgitation\n\n【14】Cardiac auscultation serves as the most widely used method of screening for valvular heart diseases. Murmurs are described by their shape (ie, crescendo, decrescendo, both, or continuous), the timing in systole or diastole, location and pitch, and audible intensity grade. A heart murmur may be benign or indicate valvular or structural abnormalities of the heart. Diastolic murmurs, however, are almost always pathologic.\n\n【15】The most common causes of diastolic murmurs are PR and AR. Pulmonary regurgitation is described as an early decrescendo blowing diastolic murmur. Pulmonary regurgitation is most commonly caused by pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【16】The diastolic murmur of AR tends to be a high-pitched diastolic decrescendo murmur that begins with A <sub>2 </sub> . Its duration in diastole depends on whether the AR is acute or chronic as well as the severity of the regurgitation.\n\n【17】Differentiation of PR murmur from AR can be difficult by auscultation alone. The correlation of the patient’s history with the physical examination plays an important role. The presence of known aortic pathology in this patient makes AR the most likely cause of his diastolic murmur.\n\n【18】The murmur associated with AS tends to be heard over the right second intercostal space. The AS murmur is a harsh systolic ejection murmur and may be transmitted to the carotid arteries. Because the murmur in our patient is diastolic, AS is unlikely.\n\n【19】Mitral stenosis causes a mid-diastolic murmur with an associated rumbling characteristic and an opening snap. This murmur is best heard over the cardiac apex and not the right second intercostal space. Our patient’s murmur was not associated with an opening snap.\n\n【20】Mitral regurgitation is characteristically a high-pitched holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex. Our patient’s murmur was diastolic rather than systolic.\n\n【21】In the emergency department, laboratory studies yielded the following (reference ranges provided parenthetically): hemoglobin, 12.1 g/dL (13.2 to 16.6 g/dL); leukocyte count, 6.8 × 10  /L (3.4 to 9.6 × 10  /L); platelets, 256 × 10  /L (135 to 317 × 10  /L); sodium, 136 mmol/L (135 to 145 mmol/L); potassium, 4.8 mmol/L (3.6 to 5.2 mmol/L); creatinine, 1.16 mg/dL (0.74 to 1.35 mg/dL); bicarbonate, 24 mmol/L (22 to 29 mmol/L); glucose, 99 mg/dL (70 to 140 mg/dL); serum urea nitrogen, 16 mg/dL; plasma lactate, 0.9 mmol/L (0.5 to 2.2 mmol/L); troponin T, 29 ng/L (≤15 ng/L); N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, 4032 pg/mL (≤103 pg/mL).\n\n【22】*   2.\n\n【23】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _best_ initial diagnostic test for investigation of heart murmur?**\n\n【24】    *   a.\n\n【25】        Electrocardiography\n\n【26】    *   b.\n\n【27】        Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)\n\n【28】    *   c.\n\n【29】        Chest radiography\n\n【30】    *   d.\n\n【31】        Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\n【32】    *   e.\n\n【33】        Cardiac computed tomography (CT)\n\n【34】Although electrocardiography is excellent for aiding in the diagnosis of conduction disorders and acute myocardial infarction, it would not be the initial test to evaluate for structural heart issues. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormality, however, would support the diagnosis of chronic AR.\n\n【35】Echocardiography is the most appropriate test for the initial evaluation of a heart murmur. According to the 2020 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, TTE or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is essential not only for confirming the presence of the AR but also for determining the severity of the regurgitation and the etiology. It visualizes the aortic root and enables evaluation of left ventricular size and systolic function.\n\n【36】无关删除-2*   Otto C.M.\n*   Nishimura R.A.\n*   Bonow R.O.\n*   et al.\n\n【37】2020 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\n【38】_Circulation._ 2021; 143 ( \\[published correction appears in Circulation. 2021;143(5):e229\\] ) : e72-e227\n\n【39】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【40】Although chest radiography provides adjunctive information about the effects of valvular dysfunction (ie, diagnosis of heart failure), it does not provide diagnostic information with regard to the nature of valvular disease.\n\n【41】Cardiac MRI is indicated if there has been inadequate evaluation of suspected valvular disease with TTE or TEE.

Electrocardiography revealed left atrial enlargement but no other notable abnormalities. Computed tomographic angiography of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolism yielded normal findings. The patient was admitted to the cardiology service for further monitoring. Lisinopril and furosemide were administered for his new-onset heart failure with subjective improvement in his symptoms of dyspnea. On day 2 of hospitalization, however, he had an acute increase in creatinine from his baseline of 1.16 mg/dL to 1.94 mg/dL.\n\n【48】*   3.\n\n【49】    **Which _one_ of the following _best_ explains the increase in this patient’s creatinine level?**\n\n【50】    *   a.\n\n【51】        Type 1 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS)\n\n【52】    *   b.\n\n【53】        Type 2 CRS\n\n【54】    *   c.\n\n【55】        Type 3 CRS\n\n【56】    *   d.\n\n【57】        Type 4 CRS\n\n【58】    *   e.\n\n【59】        Type 5 CRS\n\n【60】Cardiorenal syndrome is a complex medical condition in which an insult to either the heart or the kidneys causes dysfunction in the other organ.

It is caused by an acute heart failure exacerbation leading to an acute kidney injury (AKI). In the case of our patient, his increased creatinine level was likely caused by the administration of furosemide decreasing his preload. This decrease of his preload in the context of severe AR likely resulted in a lack of forward blood flow to the kidneys causing the AKI.\n\n【66】Type 2 CRS is also known as chronic CRS. It is a chronic state of heart failure that eventually causes chronic kidney disease (CKD) that results in the slow increase of creatinine over time. Type 2 CRS is unlikely to have been the cause of the acute creatinine rise in our patient because his creatinine level on admission was within normal limits. Given the acuity seen in our patient, type 1 CRS is more likely.\n\n【67】Type 3 CRS is also known as acute renocardiac syndrome. In this case, an AKI results in substantial volume overload resulting in an acute heart failure exacerbation. It is multifactorial, involving inflammatory markers and metabolic abnormalities with uremia. Because our patient’s symptoms of heart failure preceded his initial increase in creatinine, type 3 CRS is unlikely.\n\n【68】Type 4 CRS is also known as chronic renocardiac syndrome. It results from CKD leading to chronic heart failure. Over time, CKD will lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy. Our patient did not have baseline CKD, making type 4 CRS an unlikely cause of his increase in creatinine.\n\n【69】Type 5 CRS is also known as secondary cardiorenal syndrome. Secondary cardiorenal syndrome is caused by a systemic condition leading to reduction in cardiac and kidney function. Examples include sepsis, hypovolemic shock, or vasculitis. Our patient had no signs of another underlying systemic condition that would explain his kidney findings.\n\n【70】The patient’s diuretics were withheld, and dobutamine was administered for inotropic support to assist with increased renal perfusion. Once his AKI improved, he underwent cardiac catheterization, which identified nonobstructive coronary disease. Cardiac CT displayed normal coronary heights compatible for a valve-in-valve (ViV) procedure. His TEE was negative for signs of vegetations or paravalvular leak.

Prosthetic valve regurgitation can be symptomatic or asymptomatic depending on the severity, hemodynamics, and provoking factors. The typical auscultatory finding is early diastolic decrescendo murmur with a blowing character that can be heard well on the second right intercostal space and left sternum. Symptomatic patients can present with unexplained or new-onset heart failure or severe hemolysis. In those symptomatic patients, infective endocarditis should be kept in mind and excluded first. If it is suspected, antibiotic treatment should be initiated to avoid delay in surgical or transcatheter intervention. In symptomatic patients with prosthetic valve regurgitation, the appropriate management is correction of the underlying valve failure. Even in asymptomatic patients, replacement may be considered because of rapid disease progression. The backward flow of AR can cause systolic dysfunction and decrease in cardiac output. Type 1 CRS is associated with diminished end-organ perfusion secondary to acute decompensated heart failure. Management with inotropic agents can increase kidney perfusion and help improve this condition. In cases of AKI secondary to acute valvular disease, kidney function improves after correction of the underlying structural abnormality.\n\n【145】For a long period of time, the standard practice of valvular reintervention was surgery. Given the drastic increase in the use of bioprosthetic valves and concomitant increase in the requirement of reoperation, less invasive procedures were developed. The transcatheter ViV procedure was first performed in Germany in 2007 for aortic valve replacement. Since then, it has become an attractive alternative for patients who are not candidates for surgery. The updated 2020 ACC/AHA guideline helped elucidate the choice of intervention between surgery or a ViV procedure.

Conversely, coronary artery obstruction is the most worrisome concern with aortic ViV procedures. The common mechanism behind it is the previously placed tissue valve leaflets being pushed outward by the new one. This leads to direct contact with coronary ostia or the sinotubular junction. In addition to procedure-dependent factors, patients might have anatomic differences that make them more prone to coronary artery obstruction after a ViV procedure. In order to evaluate for low-lying coronary ostia or narrow sinotubular junction, angiography is performed prior to ViV procedures, although it is not part of routine practice yet.\n\n【162】The follow-up of patients with prosthetic heart valves is defined in AHA/ACC guidelines.\n\n【163】无关删除-2*   Nishimura R.A.\n*   Otto C.M.\n*   Bonow R.O.\n*   et al.\n\n【164】2017 AHA/ACC focused update of the 2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\n【165】_Circulation._ 2017; 135 : e1159-e1195\n\n【166】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1513)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【167】The first outpatient visit should be 6 weeks to 3 months after the procedure.

Afterward, routine follow-up visits should be scheduled annually. If patients have any auscultatory changes on examination or if they become symptomatic (ie, with symptoms of anemia or new-onset heart failure), a diagnostic work-up should be undertaken without waiting for the next appointment.

To achieve this objective, we analyzed data on 29,513 adults who came to the Cooper Clinic (Dallas, Texas) between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2010, for a preventive medicine visit. Patients completed a comprehensive medical survey including information on family medical history, physical activity, and other lifestyle behaviors. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to examine the relationship between having a family history of chronic disease and meeting physical activity guidelines. The results indicated that individuals with a family history of disease had reduced odds for meeting or exceeding physical activity guidelines. For example, participants with a family history of 3 diseases were 36% less likely to meet or exceed physical activity guidelines than their counterparts without a family history of disease (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.58-0.72), while controlling for covariates. Among this large sample of adults, those with a family history of chronic disease were less inclined to regularly engage in physical activity. Thus, targeted programs encouraging adoption and maintenance of health-promoting physical activity might be warranted, specifically targeting individuals with familial history of disease.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CCLS ( Cooper Center Longitudinal Study ), CHD ( coronary heart disease ), FHD ( family history of disease ), MET ( metabolic equivalent )\n\n【4】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【5】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【6】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【7】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【8】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【9】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【10】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【11】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

In addition, many patients referred for outpatient transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) undergo polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing as a requirement for other clinical evaluations. All patients have a PCR nasopharyngeal swab testing 48 to 72 hours before exercise stress testing (EST) or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and on admission to the hospital; results are typically available within 24 hours. In patients with a positive clinical screen or positive PCR test result, the indication and acuity of the study are evaluated by the responsible echocardiography physician to determine whether the indication for the study is urgent/emergent or whether the test can be safely postponed. Patients in whom the study (TTE, EST, or TEE) indication is deemed to be urgent/emergent where the PCR test results are pending are managed similar to PCR test–positive patients with respect to requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE) ( Figure 1 ).\n\n【16】Figure 1 Algorithm of triaging echocardiographic studies.

Frequent wiping of surfaces, keyboards, and phones are encouraged with ready availability of appropriate cleaning materials.\n\n【30】### Physical Distancing\n\n【31】Coronavirus disease 2019 has necessitated a reorganization of the physical space of the laboratory, including conference rooms, classrooms, and offices to accommodate workstations 6 feet apart. Further measures to ensure distancing in break room locations include staggered schedules and alternate break room locations.\n\n【32】### Personal Protective Equipment for Staff Performing TTE\n\n【33】For the typical patient without COVID-19 or in whom testing is pending but without clinical suspicion of infection, the sonographer wears a surgical mask and protective eyewear. For patients with known or suspected COVID-19, although a surgical mask may be sufficient in some cases, to provide a consistent approach, the sonographer performing a TTE wears an N95 respirator, face shield, gown, and gloves. This policy was strongly influenced by the close proximity of the sonographer’s front and side of the face to the patient’s face, the duration of exposure (>30 minutes), and the common frequency that the inpatient is unable to wear a mask and that many patients have had a concomitant aerosol generating procedure (AGP) (recent intubation, positive pressure ventilation, nebulizer use, or high flow oxygen). Between wearings, N95 respirators are carefully stored in a clean, labeled, plastic container. A continually worn N95 respirator should be replaced at the end of each shift and after cumulative use for 10 to 12 hours, when it has been worn 5 times, or if the user seal check fails, the mask is visibly soiled, breathing through it becomes difficult, or it becomes wet. Dedicated space for storage of masks is available in the laboratory.\n\n【34】All staff members were fitted for N95 respirators. For those staff members who failed fit testing, a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) is used in place of an N95. Fluoroscope cover drapes as a barrier between the patient and the sonographer are available for use in COVID-19–positive patients. All staff with direct patient contact are encouraged to wear scrubs.\n\n【35】### Management of the Machine\n\n【36】Machines are cleaned carefully after _every use_ using a viricidal disinfectant, with emphasis on manufacturer-recommended “wet time.” Reduction in contamination of the critical machine elements (keyboard, controls, and touch panel) is accomplished through the use of an elastic fluoroscope drape (Genesys, Echolab) ( Figure 2 ) for all TEE and TTE procedures performed on patients with COVID-19. For studies performed in patients with COVID-19, the machine is cleaned in the room and again after leaving the room. We have dedicated machines for use on COVID-19–positive patients, which we store in a separate location. The standard procedure for TEE scope processing is adequate to kill the virus, but staff must follow standard processes carefully including the use of PPE while cleaning the probe.\n\n【37】Figure 2 Use of an elastic fluoroscopy drape (Genesys, Echolab) placed over the keyboard, controls, and touch panel allows a degree of protection of these critical difficult-to-clean machine elements from contamination. This is recommended for all transesophageal echocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography procedures performed in patients with COVID-19.\n\n【38】无关删除-2*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【39】Transesophageal Echocardiography\n--------------------------------\n\n【40】Transesophageal echocardiography is recognized as a high-risk AGP with an increased risk of transmission; therefore, airborne precautions are necessary for all team members (gown, gloves, N95/PAPR, surgical cap, and face shield) ( Figure 3 ) in all patients with an unprotected airway, regardless of COVID-19 PCR status. For the intubated and paralyzed patient (eg, in the operating room), TEE staff are not required to wear N95/PAPR unless the patient is known or suspected to have COVID-19 infection.\n\n【41】Figure 3 Steps for donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) for transesophageal echocardiography. AGP = aerosol generating procedure.\n\n【42】无关删除-2*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【43】Exercise Stress Testing and Pericardiocentesis Procedures\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Exercise stress testing is also considered aerosol generating. For the supervision of EST, all staff members wear N95 respirators (or PAPRs) and face shields during exercise and recovery periods. Exercise stress testing is not performed in patients with active COVID-19 infection. Pharmacological testing and pericardiocentesis procedures, as non–aerosol generating, are treated similarly to TTE with respect to PPE. As cardiopulmonary resuscitation is considered aerosol generating, PPE kits (N95 and gown) are available outside all stress rooms in case of emergency.\n\n【45】Room Turnover After AGP\n-----------------------\n\n【46】All AGP rooms used were tested for air exchange by our department of engineering, with alterations (additional air filtration units) to increase air flow made where possible. After TEE or EST, the room must be left idle for 7 complete air exchanges to allow for 99.9% clearance before the next patient can be roomed. Air exchange rates dictated that most rooms have a 10- to 30-minute idle time between procedures. For TEE, the time starts upon removal of the TEE probe, and for EST, 6 minutes after the termination of exercise.\n\n【47】Transthoracic Echocardiography in Patients With Known or Suspected COVID-19 Infection\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】Inpatient studies are performed at the patient’s bedside. Studies are focused to address the specific indication accurately while minimizing the contact time of staff with the patient. The study scope is discussed with the physician before entering the patient’s room. Usually this will be a focused study evaluating biventricular function, assessment for pericardial effusion, and initial 2-dimensional and color Doppler screening for significant valvular stenosis or regurgitation ( Supplemental Figure , available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ). Additional image acquisition and quantification of valvular heart lesions are performed only when pertinent. Staff have a low threshold for echocardiography enhancement (contrast) imaging to reduce imaging time. Measurements are performed _outside_ the room. To allow instantaneous study review and optimize diagnostic scanning, special internal phones are used for direct communication between the sonographiser and the reviewer.\n\n【49】Because myocardial injury reported in up to half of patients, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has a role in bedside assessment and triage of patients with clinical deterioration.\n\n【50】无关删除-2*   Dweck M.R.\n*   Bularga A.\n*   Hahn R.T.\n*   et al.\n\n【51】Global evaluation of echocardiography in patients with COVID-19.\n\n【52】无关删除-2_Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging._ 2020; 21 : 949-958\n\n【53】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (252)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【54】无关删除-2*   Johri A.M.\n*   Galen B.\n*   Kirkpatrick J.N.\n*   Lanspa M.\n*   Mulvagh S.\n*   Thamman R.\n\n【55】ASE statement on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) during the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\n【56】无关删除-2_J Am Soc Echocardiogr._ 2020; 33 : 670-673\n\n【57】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (94)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【58】Point-of-care ultrasound can help diagnose acute left ventricular dysfunction (myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, or stress cardiomyopathy), right ventricular systolic dysfunction (worsening hypoxia or pulmonary embolism), and worsening pulmonary status (consolidation, effusion, and pulmonary edema).

Echocardiography reading sessions were changed to live sessions on Zoom within 2 weeks of the declaration of the pandemic, and additional teaching sessions included those on congenital echocardiography, core curriculum sessions, and informal reading sessions for level 1 fellows led by advanced fellows. We scheduled simulator training for basic understanding of different TEE views for fellows as TEE practice was restricted to urgent cases and only advanced fellows with previous training and experience in TEE participated in performing these studies. As the elective clinical practice returned, fellows returned to in-person training, working 1-on-1 with sonographers (learning to scan) and with physicians (learning to interpret and perform TEE). With careful organization of the schedule, almost all learners (∼40 at one time) have been accommodated with only modest limitations placed on numbers. All echocardiography educational conferences and meetings are now held virtually, including a weekly morning imaging grand rounds and a noon case conference in which the interesting cases of the week are informally presented and discussed by fellows and faculty.\n\n【82】Research\n--------\n\n【83】Whether as part of clinical practice or a clinical research trial, monitoring with echocardiography is important in the serial assessment of cardiovascular function and has continued throughout the pandemic. Many investigators, both trainees and staff, were able to take advantage of the reduction in clinical volume to engage in research activities that normally occurred off hours.\n\n【84】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【85】Within the current era of COVID-19, it is important to provide echocardiography services safely for staff and patients as echocardiography remains the cornerstone of the diagnosis and follow-up of most cardiac conditions and cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 infection. Here we provide our experience of safe practices while maintaining excellent patient care and learner education.\n\n【86】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【87】The authors appreciate the tireless work of the echocardiography laboratory administration and supervisor team including Melissa Bowman, CEP, Joshua Finstuen, MA, RDCS, Kristy Hockens, Mark Johnson, RN, Adriana Lange, CRAT, Daniel McCullough, MBA, RDCS, Lezlie Peterson, RN, and Stacy Pronga, MA, RDCS; the Safety, Management and Resource Taskforce (SMaRT); Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, MD, MBA; and all the laboratory and division staff for their input regarding these processes and their care to patients.\n\n【88】Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------\n\n【89】Supplemental Figure\n\n【90】无关删除-2*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【91】*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI3MmRhNGQ3MzY5NTk2ZjRmYTc2MTY0ZTZlYTQwNjg5OSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDA2MzM4fQ.NnXqycb57i5U1Jrr3sGwX-nGJnCpnTn44qVI00zxPZClQx7wstN-XxSAcHJtGE3MOfQVXGuAFBIdqVFCPDbXzXzf9JgaARX6BJ3DE6ykmmSd0\\_UF0BcCzAuhWHAhPolGaF4UmttcmhIOQ0M7D0hQQJOG4Ju0Ow\\_VEwC52rCwY4nFbfjL\\_fIuzMvXCwCbQNCH631wzQWYbDQZFugc-5fz80\\_Ilq3zZbfvqmtCtnn9Fn\\_0M4StoVpmP2RGrAp8VxzKCUwPaS-USEwV3GeU8cYYPPGi2vIhmJzUbDaXFcqNkQ2SroCewgV0keuo2-OkuCcpvWDMjMPHXUkEkMMkem6DSw\n\n【92】    Download .mp4 (84.76 MB)\n\n【93】    Help with .mp4 files\n\n【94】    Video", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "f7cec642-d61b-4d7f-b51b-ac3702d14bd3", "title": "Melphalan (Intravenous Route)", "text": "【0】Melphalan (Intravenous Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Alkeran IV\n2.  Evomela\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Melphalan injection is used to treat multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer) before receiving a stem cell transplant (conditioning treatment). Melphalan belongs to the group of medicines called alkylating agents (cancer medicines). It works by interfering with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by melphalan, other unwanted effects will also occur. Before you begin treatment with melphalan, talk to your doctor about the benefits as well as the risks of using it.\n\n【6】This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Powder for Solution\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【11】### Allergies\n\n【12】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【13】### Pediatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of melphalan injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【15】### Geriatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of melphalan injection in the elderly.\n\n【17】### Breastfeeding\n\n【18】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【21】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【22】*   Measles Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Mumps Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Rotavirus Vaccine, Live\n*   Rubella Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Varicella Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Zoster Vaccine, Live\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【24】*   Adenovirus Vaccine\n*   Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin Vaccine, Live\n*   Cholera Vaccine, Live\n*   Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine, Live\n*   Influenza Virus Vaccine, Live\n*   Poliovirus Vaccine, Live\n*   Smallpox Vaccine\n*   Typhoid Vaccine, Live\n*   Yellow Fever Vaccine\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【26】*   Buthionine Sulfoximine\n*   Nalidixic Acid\n\n【27】### Other Interactions\n\n【28】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【29】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【30】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【31】*   Anemia or\n*   Bone marrow suppression or\n*   Leukopenia (low white blood cells) or\n*   Liver disease or\n*   Thrombocytopenia (low platelets in the blood)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【32】*   Infection—May decrease your ability to fight an infection.\n\n【33】*   Kidney disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.\n\n【34】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【35】A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital or cancer treatment center. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. This medicine must be given slowly, so the IV tube will need to stay in place for at least 30 minutes. It is usually given for 2 days before receiving a stem cell transplant.\n\n【36】This medicine should come with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【37】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【38】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【39】Receiving this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control while you are receiving this medicine and for at least 6 months after the last dose to keep from getting pregnant. Males who are receiving this medicine, with female partners who can become pregnant, must use effective birth control during and for at least 3 months after the last dose of this medicine. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving the medicine, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【40】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hives, hoarseness, lightheadedness or fainting, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are receiving this medicine.\n\n【41】Melphalan can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【42】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【43】While you are being treated with melphalan, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Melphalan may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.\n\n【44】Melphalan can cause diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, or sores or ulcers in the mouth, sometimes even after you receive medicine to prevent these effects. Ask your doctor or nurse about ways to control these symptoms.\n\n【45】Using this medicine may increase your risk of getting other types of cancer (eg, myeloproliferative syndrome, acute leukemia). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.\n\n【46】Tell your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.\n\n【47】Some men and women using this medicine have become infertile (unable to have children). This medicine might make a woman stop having menstrual periods temporarily. Talk with your doctor if this is a concern.\n\n【48】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【49】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.

Many of these discoveries were funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the NIH remains a leader in supporting research in the United States. However, as the field has developed, the NIH has responded proactively to identify roadblocks and to develop solutions that will accelerate translation of basic discoveries to the clinical setting. These activities range from organizing specialized workshops and coordinating activities among international organizations and the different arms of the government to funding small-scale industry. In addition, the NIH has been a key driver in providing needed infrastructure in areas in which the private sector has been unable to, or does not believe it can, invest. These activities of the NIH are as important as its traditional funding role, and I believe they have contributed to the innovation and rapid pace of discovery in this field.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CGMP ( Current Good Manufacturing Practices ), ESC ( embryonic stem cell ), IPSC ( induced pluripotent stem cell ), NIH ( National Institutes of Health )\n\n【4】The stem cell domain of the regenerative medicine field has seen fundamental changes initiated by seminal discoveries in cell biology, genetic engineering, and whole genome sequencing.

In addition, as the field has developed, the NIH has responded proactively to identify roadblocks and to develop solutions that will accelerate translation of basic discoveries to the clinical setting.\n\n【5】The NIH and Its Role in Advancing Regenerative Medicine Science Into Practice\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】As the largest provider of research dollars in the Unites States, the NIH plays an important role in funding research and, as with any other field, has played a leading role in supporting regenerative medicine research. The dollar amount invested in research is substantial ( Figure ), and approximately a billion dollars a year are invested directly into stem cell research.\n\n【7】National Institutes of Health. www.nih.gov .

As in any new area, the government’s role is larger than simply providing research dollars ( Table 1 ). To be responsive to the community it serves, the NIH must be able to identify trends, anticipate change, develop programs, and be prepared to respond to these anticipated challenges.\n\n【10】无关删除-2*   Rao M.S.\n*   Collins F.S.\n\n【11】Steering a new course for stem cell research: NIH’s intramural Center for Regenerative Medicine.\n\n【12】无关删除-2_Stem Cells Transl Med._ 2012; 1 : 15-17\n\n【13】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (11)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【14】In the subsequent sections, I provide an overview of where I see the field moving and how I see the NIH responding to these challenges.\n\n【15】Figure National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for research has doubled over the past 10 years and has remained at this high level over the past 5 years.

These trends, I believe, have shaped the way the field has grown. They affect the choice of cells researchers use, the regulatory pathways investigators follow, the type of manufacturing paradigm they utilize, how they obtain funding for the development process to generate a regulated product, and how they market the product. Because the NIH is the premier source of funding in the United States, it is perhaps only reasonable to assume that NIH funding decisions contributed to these trends, and I have no doubt that ongoing allocation efforts by the NIH will continue to shape the field. What the NIH recognized and what none of the other funding agencies anticipated was the rapid translation of these fundamental discoveries to clinical practice and how quickly the NIH must respond if it wishes to remain proactive rather than reactive.\n\n【22】Table 2 Major Trends Shaping the Field of Regenerative Medicine\n\n【23】PSC = pluripotent stem cell.\n\n| Rapid technological advances in PSC technology |\n| --- |\n| Ability to manufacture, freeze, and ship cells on a large scale |\n| Decreasing cost of next-generation sequencing |\n| Breakthroughs in gene engineering technologies |\n| Ability to make 3-dimensional structures |\n| Regulations defining what is a product vs practice of medicine |\n| The changing patent landscape |\n| Changes in the funding landscape |\n| The pharmaceutical business model is undergoing revamping |\n| New business models for autologous therapy |\n| Hospitals and academic institutions taking the lead in personalized medicine |\n| The drug reimbursement model is changing |\n| Health care delivery and cost containment models are being reevaluated |\n\n【25】a PSC = pluripotent stem cell.\n\n【26】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【27】In hindsight, perhaps one could have anticipated this acceleration. The change has been rapid because the field could take advantage of independent discoveries that were being made by scientists in other domains and apply these solutions to current problems in the regenerative medicine field.

Although no list can be comprehensive, the following breakthroughs have contributed to the accelerating pace of change and contributed to the birth of entire industries.\n\n【61】Each of the breakthroughs I have identified has had a fundamental effect on the field, although some at first blush may sound trivial. The ability to freeze cells and ship them, for example, has led to the development of a tissue banking service that includes storage and shipping of organs for transplant, providing bone marrow and apheresis products, and banking of cord blood and other newer cell types now being considered for therapy. More than 150 cord blood storage companies exist worldwide, and bone marrow transplant is the standard of care with tissue routinely being shipped from one country to another for transplant.\n\n【62】Next-generation sequencing companies abound, and in addition to providing services to the academic community, they provide sequencing services to the medical community and have made testing for a large number of familial diseases feasible. It is now possible to design a breast cancer screen or a familial Parkinson disease screen to look at all sequence variations in a subset of genes to determine risk and perform preventive medical procedures. Sequencing in individuals with undiagnosed diseases has already yielded dividends for those individuals or families.

One obvious example is the number of companies that are being established to consider cell-based therapy. Several of the companies that have somatic cell products have now successfully navigated the regulatory pathway to have commercial products. These companies range from mesenchymal stem cell companies and cord blood–based services to skin- and cartilage-based product providers. Companies using other cell types have products in late-stage trials, and such companies include neural stem cell–based companies, ESC-derived retinal cell– and islet cell–based companies, and more recently, IPSC-derived product–based companies.\n\n【78】Although there are not as many companies in the screening and toxicology field, it is perhaps important to note that the screening world and in particular the toxicology screening world is undergoing a change as a result of the advances in our ability to generate specific types of stem cells. Perhaps the earliest example of change was the adoption of the ESC test for toxicology by the European Center for Validation of Alternate Methods. More recently, the availability of cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent cells on a large scale from a number of companies and the demonstration that human cardiomyocytes are a better predictor of cardiotoxicity than cardiomyocytes from other species has led to widespread adoption of this test in early-stage drug screening.\n\n【79】*   Himmel H.M.\n\n【80】Drug-induced functional cardiotoxicity screening in stem cell-derived human and mouse cardiomyocytes: effects of reference compounds.\n\n【81】无关删除-2_J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods._ 2013; 68 : 97-111\n\n【82】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (72)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【83】*   Knollmann B.C.\n\n【84】Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes: boutique science or valuable arrhythmia model?.\n\n【85】无关删除-2_Circ Res._ 2013; 112 : 969-976\n\n【86】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (50)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【87】Thanks to the advances in bioreactor technology, the availability of other cell types in bulk cultures will further accelerate adoption. Equally important has been the work of several investigators documenting the utility of pluripotent stem cell–derived cells in screening for new therapeutics and their utility for screening in orphan and rare disorders. These new findings have led to the availability of novel screening services and the establishment of public-private partnerships to identify compounds using panels of ESC- and PSC-derived cells.\n\n【88】The NIH interprets these trends to allocate resources and guide its budget decisions and to identify experts, think tanks, and societies that can help provide feedback on how best to move forward.\n\n【89】无关删除-2*   Williams R.L.\n*   Johnson S.B.\n*   Greene S.M.\n*   et al.\n\n【90】Principal Investigators of Clinical Research Networks Initiative  \nSignposts along the NIH roadmap for reengineering clinical research: lessons from the Clinical Research Networks initiative.\n\n【91】无关删除-2_Arch Intern Med._ 2008; 168 : 1919-1925\n\n【92】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (18)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【93】Equally important, the NIH has tried to understand what roadblocks need to be resolved first to enable the rapid pace of change to continue.\n\n【94】Despite Positive Trends, Roadblocks Exist and Need to Be Resolved\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【95】The NIH has identified several major roadblocks that hamper translational science ( Table 3 ), ranging from the obvious, such as the reduction in funding from federal sources, to the less obvious practical issues, such as the lack of appropriate consent documents. Although space constraints limit a detailed discussion, I will discuss some examples of the types of efforts undertaken by the NIH to resolve some of these roadblocks.\n\n【96】Table 3 Translational Science Roadblocks and NIH Solutions\n\n| Roadblocks | NIH solutions |\n| --- | --- |\n| Difficulties in procuring cells | Develop consent documents, identify tissue sourcing agencies, identify and fund storage and banking groups and enable them to distribute tissue |\n| Difficulty in navigating the patent landscape | Develop landscape documents, develop a UBMTA, establish standardized LULLS for engineering technologies |\n| Lack of infrastructure to manufacture cells | Develop PACT centers, enable companies, identify CMOs, resolve roadblocks to academic-industry collaborations with service providers |\n| No coordinating activity | NIHCRM, CNRM, work with ATCC on testing, help coordinate FDA harmonization efforts, work with international repositories, develop controls and standards, identify biorepositories and ensure distribution of cells, work with NIEHS on cell panels, annual meeting with pharmaceutical firms to coordinate and establish public-private partnerships |\n| Limited funding for translational efforts | PO1, SBIR, STTR, cofunding with other funding agencies, establish public-private partnerships |\n| No regulatory clarity | NIH-FDA meetings, international harmonization, work with societies and other stakeholders |\n| Lack of screening programs | NCATS, NIH funding for screening centers, public-private partnerships |\n| Lack of clarity for the cell therapy process | NIH-FDA meetings, develop intramural capability, NIH Clinical Center for orphan and rare diseases, CTSAs |\n\n【98】ATTC = American Type Culture Collection; CMO = contact manufacturing organization; CNRM = Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine; CTSA = Clinical and Translational Sciences Award; FDA = Food and Drug Administration; LULLS = limited-use label licenses; NCATS = National Center for Advancing Translational Science; NIEHS = National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; NIH = National Institutes of Health; NIHCRM = NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine; PACT = Production Assistance for Cellular Therapies; PO1 = Research Program Project grant; SBIR = Small Business Innovation Research program; STTR = Small Business Technology Transfer program; UBMTA = uniform biological material transfer agreement.\n\n【99】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【100】To obtain the best return on scarce research dollars, the NIH, in addition to its direct research support, has partnered with other government agencies such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Institute of Science and Technology, and the Environmental Protection Agency to help coordinate funding efforts and has begun to develop common data sets of information. The NIH has noted that funding for this activity has come from other sources as well, including private foundations, state governments, and industry, and the NIH has worked hard to help coordinate such activity and develop public-private partnerships.\n\n【101】*   Rao M.\n\n【102】Public private partnerships: a marriage of necessity.\n\n【103】无关删除-2_Cell Stem Cell._ 2013; 12 : 149-151\n\n【104】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (19)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【105】Important components of the public-private partnership that have been the cornerstones of innovation in biotechnology are the Small Business Innovation Research program, the Small Business Technology Transfer program, and advanced technology funding programs. The NIH has encouraged stem cell companies to register and apply for these grants and has worked at the institutional level to ensure that companies could access the requisite technology to be competitive in the bidding process ( http://oamp.od.nih.gov/contracts/contract.htm ).\n\n【106】The NIH realized that current funding programs may not be suited for translational research and that necessary infrastructure would need to be developed to allow for successful translation. As the NIH engaged in discussion with stakeholders, there existed a need to modify the standard Research Project Grant (R01) program and introduce longer-term grants and larger project grants with larger dollar amounts to enable preclinical studies to be performed by academic investigators.\n\n【107】无关删除-2*   Williams R.L.\n*   Johnson S.B.\n*   Greene S.M.\n*   et al.\n\n【108】Principal Investigators of Clinical Research Networks Initiative  \nSignposts along the NIH roadmap for reengineering clinical research: lessons from the Clinical Research Networks initiative.\n\n【109】无关删除-2_Arch Intern Med._ 2008; 168 : 1919-1925\n\n【110】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (18)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【111】Three major initiatives introduced by Dr Francis S. Collins, director of the NIH, deserve special mention. The National Center for Advancing Translational Science was established to meet the tasks of accelerating translational science, including work with stem cells in screening and toxicology, and helping bridge the gap that exists because of a dearth of funding from traditional investing sources. The NIH has identified the NIH Clinical Center as an invaluable resource and developed plans to allow access to NIH-funded investigators worldwide. Dr John I. Gallin, the director of the Clinical Center, has identified different ways researchers can work with the center,\n\n【112】Clinical Center.

More recently, Dr Collins established the NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine to help identify the roadblocks that exist for this field and to develop creative solutions to resolve such roadblocks.\n\n【115】In an attempt to develop synergy and enhance the ability of investigators to move their results to the next step on the translation path, the NIH has developed model consent forms and material transfer agreements, identified patent issues, and negotiated appropriate limited-use label licenses to enable researchers to distribute their results widely and access services from service providers. To further ensure access to key reagents, the NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine generated IPSC lines including engineered reporter lines, deposited them with repositories, and ensured that these repositories could distribute cell lines worldwide with minimal restrictions at a reasonable cost. The NIH has also developed Program Assistance for Cellular Therapeutics centers for manufacturing clinical-grade cells and university-based screening centers to allow investigators access to resources that would be difficult to generate for any individual group. The NIH has also transferred expertise and reagents to service providers so that such technology would be widely disseminated and allow individual investigators to focus on key questions rather than having to develop and standardize protocols themselves.\n\n【116】To reduce the cost of access to clinically compliant lines that will be required for therapy and to make preclinical studies easier, the NIH funded the development of an ESC bank at a Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) site and the generation of a set of IPSC lines from healthy donors using commercial contract manufacturing organizations. In addition, it funded the development of reporter cell line subclones in these CGMP-compliant lines. Because the government bore the initial costs, obtaining a matched research-grade stock of the cells will cost individual investigators much less and, more importantly, will save them time while providing some security that lines made with a similar process will behave similarly. The reporter cell line subclones will make biodistribution and other required safety studies much easier to assess, and because they will be closely related to the CGMP line, it will likely mean fewer concerns about interpreting the results. A criterion for these reporter cell lines was that they be available to both commercial and noncommercial groups. This stipulation was important because it meant that as research transitioned from an academic to a more applied approach, investigators would not have to go back and remake lines (or develop new constructs) or negotiate licenses at a later and more expensive stage.\n\n【117】It is hoped that while each initiative may have only a small effect, the cumulative effect of resolving roadblocks along the entire path may be synergistic. It is further hoped that any investigator armed with the appropriate consent forms, material transfer agreements, and licenses and with access to standardized cell lines and controls (that can be obtained at a reasonable cost by a single phone call) can readily develop a screening or therapeutic intervention protocol. Further development of the novel protocol can be funded via novel granting mechanisms or with the assistance of the National Center for Advancing Translational Science, the NIH Clinical Center, or university-funded screening and cell manufacturing centers, enabling rapid development that can then be disseminated widely via service providers, small businesses, and pharmaceutical partners who in turn are funded by specialized granting programs or public-private partnerships to permit widespread access to cell-based therapy.\n\n【118】The NIH Must Develop New Ways to Support New Business Models\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【119】Although the NIH believes that the aforementioned efforts will play an important role in accelerating the development of cell-based therapeutic interventions, it recognizes that many of the old models of drug delivery may not work, and new business models will have to be supported. In examining the field, the new efforts can be broadly divided into 3 different groups: engineered cells, hospital-based services, and “homegrown” tissues.\n\n【120】### Engineered Cells\n\n【121】As discussed previously, major advances have been made in engineering of cells and continuous improvements in vector design, delivery, and development of self-inactivating vectors or integration-free gene delivery technologies. Gene therapy companies have begun to adopt these techniques, and companies have initiated clinical trials with such therapies. Three different approaches are being adopted: (1) the use of cells as delivery vehicles whereby the product is inserted into a “safe harbor” site using vectors that allow conditional delivery that is not epigenomically silenced for the lifetime of the individual, (2) a knockout strategy in which the abnormal product is deleted using precision excision methods, and (3) a repair strategy in which the specific defect is corrected. Individual groups and companies are exploring these technologies for therapy in diseases such as cancer, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and lysosomal storage disorders.\n\n【122】无关删除-2*   Garate Z.\n*   Davis B.R.\n*   Quintana-Bustamante O.\n*   Segovia J.C.\n\n【123】New frontier in regenerative medicine: site-specific gene correction in patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells.\n\n【124】无关删除-2_Hum Gene Ther._ 2013; 24 : 571-583\n\n【125】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (31)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【126】无关删除-2*   Keung E.Z.\n*   Nelson P.J.\n*   Conrad C.\n\n【127】Concise review: genetically engineered stem cell therapy targeting angiogenesis and tumor stroma in gastrointestinal malignancy.\n\n【128】无关删除-2_Stem Cells._ 2013; 31 : 227-235\n\n【129】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (46)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【130】### Hospital-Based Services\n\n【131】Two trends in practice in some medical centers are changing treatment paradigms.

The second is personalized therapy such as testing drugs on tumor cells from an individual patient’s tumor to develop the right “cocktail” of effective drugs for treatment of that patient.\n\n【132】无关删除-2*   Merker J.D.\n*   Valouev A.\n*   Gotlib J.\n\n【133】Next-generation sequencing in hematologic malignancies: what will be the dividends?.\n\n【134】无关删除-2_Ther Adv Hematol._ 2012; 3 : 333-339\n\n【135】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (17)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【136】无关删除-2*   Gonzalez de Castro D.\n*   Clarke P.A.\n*   Al-Lazikani B.\n*   Workman P.\n\n【137】Personalized cancer medicine: molecular diagnostics, predictive biomarkers, and drug resistance.\n\n【138】无关删除-2_Clin Pharmacol Ther._ 2013; 93 : 252-259\n\n【139】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (188)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【140】无关删除-2*   Dietel M.\n*   Jöhrens K.\n*   Laffert M.\n*   et al.\n\n【141】Predictive molecular pathology and its role in targeted cancer therapy: a review focussing on clinical relevance.\n\n【142】无关删除-2_Cancer Gene Ther._ 2013; 20 : 211-221\n\n【143】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (54)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【144】*   Matsui S.\n\n【145】Genomic biomarkers for personalized medicine: development and validation in clinical studies.\n\n【146】_Comput Math Methods Med._ 2013; 2013 : 865980\n\n【147】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (21)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【148】### Homegrown Tissue\n\n【149】Several hospital- and institute-based services have begun to adopt biomaterial engineering services and combine them with cell culture techniques to build 3-dimensional structures.

However, the NIH has continued to experiment with providing CGMP-grade cells to multiple users, developing banks of IPSCs, and providing royalty-free licenses. Time will tell what is the best method moving forward, but it is important to note that the NIH understands the need and is proactively attempting to develop a solution.\n\n【181】The NIH Needs to Anticipate and Support Tomorrow’s Breakthroughs\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【182】As with any prediction, it is far more likely that I will be wrong than right, but nevertheless, I can perhaps make some cautious predictions, summarized in Table 4 . It seems to me that the genetic engineering breakthroughs coupled with the ability to make differentiated cells of various kinds will allow for functional cures. Perhaps the earliest success will come in the hematopoietic system or in the retina, where viral delivery of a missing gene product has already had success. Using safe harbor technologies and strategies to prevent silencing and regulating gene expression in immune-matched cells that are differentiated into a tissue or organ phenotype will allow controlled and regulated therapy. Another breakthrough that I believe will change the field is the ability to make more complex 3-dimensional structures. Currently, we have been limited by our inability to construct a true vasculature that will allow nutrient delivery in synthetic constructs that are more than 8 or 10 cell layers thick. Keeping organ structures alive while a vasculature develops has been difficult as well. Current work in angiogenesis, the ability to print organs layer by layer, and the isolation of endothelial cells in large numbers suggest that we are close. A third breakthrough that builds on the work on IPSCs is the idea of direct transdifferentiation using readily available sources of adult cells and directing their differentiation into a difficult to obtain cell type.\n\n【183】Table 4 New Breakthroughs That May Change the Field of Cell Therapy\n\n| Ability to expand HSC or make HSC from PSC |\n| --- |\n| Developing a cost-effective model to resolve the immune rejection issue |\n| Accelerating maturation of PSC-derived cells |\n| Somatic cell engineering |\n| Directed differentiation without a stable PSC stage |\n| Developing a way to vascularize tissue |\n| In vivo directed differentiation |\n\n【185】HSC = hematopoietic stem cells; PSC = pluripotent stem cells.\n\n【186】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【187】The NIH has recognized that funding such innovation is key and will continue to focus on funding the best science. However, it also recognizes that novel discoveries may render earlier efforts obsolete and that it needs to constantly evaluate its priorities and allocations to remain responsive. This is all the more crucial in this field that is moving far faster than we had anticipated. The NIH will continue its efforts to gather information and obtain feedback and encourages readers to write or respond to the Requests for Information that the NIH publishes.\n\n【188】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【189】The NIH sees the stem cell field as a broad area that has many subfields with investigators at various stages of progress on the translational pathway. The NIH believes that its role in accelerating translation includes not just funding the field but also identifying trends, anticipating challenges, and proactively developing novel solutions to enable researchers’ efforts. These solutions include resolving issues related to access to tissues and cells, providing clarification on regulations, reducing costs, and enabling access to key reagents and resources that are not easily obtained elsewhere. Equally important, the NIH realizes that it cannot do it alone and that it needs to help develop public-private interactions to ensure that progress continues. The NIH encourages feedback and looks forward to developing novel programs and novel solutions based on such interactions.\n\n【190】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【191】The opinions expressed in this article reflect my personal view and do not in any way represent or indicate the views of the NIH.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Overall survival and different subgroups were studied over 3 periods of diagnoses (2004-2006, 2007-2009, and 2010-2013).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Median age at diagnosis was 76 years. The most common subtype was MDS-unclassifiable, which represented 55.6% of all cases. We found that males, older patients, patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts, Medicare insurance recipients, and those treated at nonacademic centers had the worse survival ( _P_ <.001). Overall survival did not improve over time, except in younger patients (<40 years old).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In the past decade, overall outcome of MDS did not improve despite the advent of new therapies. More studies are needed to understand the impact of newly approved treatments on the outcome of patients with MDS.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】IPSS-R ( International Prognostic Scoring System–Revised ), MDS ( myelodysplastic syndrome ), MDS-U ( MDS-unclassifiable ), NCDB ( National Cancer Data Base ), OS ( overall survival ), RAEB ( refractory anemia with excess blasts ), RARS ( refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts ), SEER ( Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ), t-MDS ( therapy-related MDS ), WHO ( World Health Organization )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "82bbb036-f4d5-444b-b806-0641adefe01c", "title": "Holter monitor", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】A Holter monitor is a small, wearable device that records the heart's rhythm. It's used to detect or determine the risk of irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias).\n\n【2】A Holter monitor test may be done if a traditional electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) doesn't provide enough details about the heart's condition. If the irregular heartbeats are infrequent, a longer term monitor called an event recorder may be needed.\n\n【3】Some personal devices, such as smartwatches, offer electrocardiogram monitoring. Ask your health care provider if this is an option for you.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】A health care provider may recommend a Holter monitor if you have:\n\n【6】*   Signs and symptoms of an irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia)\n*   Unexplained fainting\n*   A heart condition that increases the risk of arrhythmias\n\n【7】Before you get a Holter monitor, you'll have an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). An ECG is a quick and painless test that uses sensors (electrodes) taped to the chest to check the heart's rhythm.\n\n【8】If you have infrequent arrhythmias, an ECG may not detect them. A Holter monitor may be able to spot irregular heart rhythms that an ECG missed.\n\n【9】If standard Holter monitoring doesn't capture an irregular heartbeat, a device called an event monitor may be recommended to record heartbeats over several weeks.\n\n【10】Risks\n-----\n\n【11】There are no significant risks involved in wearing a Holter monitor. Some people have minor discomfort or skin irritation where the sensors (electrodes) were placed.\n\n【12】Holter monitors aren't usually affected by other electrical appliances. But some devices may interrupt the signal from the electrodes to the Holter monitor. If you have a Holter monitor, you should avoid the following:\n\n【13】*   Electric blankets\n*   Electric razors and toothbrushes\n*   Magnets\n*   Metal detectors\n*   Microwave ovens\n\n【14】Also, keep cellphones and portable music players at least 6 inches from the Holter monitor for the same reason.\n\n【15】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【16】A Holter monitor is placed at a care provider's office during a scheduled appointment. Unless your health care provider tells you otherwise, plan to bathe before this appointment. Most monitors can't be removed and must be kept dry once monitoring begins.\n\n【17】A care provider will place sensors (electrodes) on your chest. These electrodes detect the heartbeat. They're about the size of a silver dollar. If you have hair on your chest, some of it may be shaved to make sure the electrodes stick.\n\n【18】Wires attached to the electrodes connect to the Holter monitor recording device. The device is about the size of a deck of cards.\n\n【19】Once your Holter monitor is fitted and you've received instructions on how to wear it, you can leave your provider's office and return to everyday activities.\n\n【20】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【21】### During\n\n【22】A Holter monitor is typically worn for 1 to 2 days. During that time, the device records all of the heartbeats.\n\n【23】Holter monitoring is painless and noninvasive. The sensors (electrodes) and wires can be hidden under clothing. The device is worn on a belt or attached to a strap.\n\n【24】Don't take the Holter monitor off — it must be worn during the entire recording period, even while sleeping.\n\n【25】Water can damage a Holter monitor. Don't swim, shower or bathe for the entire time you're wearing a Holter monitor. If you have a wireless Holter monitor, you'll be shown how to disconnect and reconnect the sensors and the monitor so that you can shower or bathe.\n\n【26】While you wear a Holter monitor, you can do most other daily activities unless your provider tells you otherwise. You may be given a form to record your activities and any symptoms. It's particularly important to note if and when you have any of the following symptoms:\n\n【27】*   Pounding, fluttering or skipped heartbeats\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Chest pain\n*   Lightheadedness\n\n【28】Write down what activities you do and exactly what time you do them.\n\n【29】### After\n\n【30】Once your monitoring period is over, you'll return the device to your health care provider's office. If you were asked to keep a record of symptoms that you had while wearing the device, your provider can compare the Holter monitor's data with your notes. This can help your provider make an accurate diagnosis.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Your care provider will review the Holter monitor test results and discuss them with you. Information from Holter monitor testing can tell your provider if you have a heart condition and if any heart medicines you currently take are or aren't working.\n\n【33】If you didn't have any irregular heart rhythms while you wore the monitor, your provider may recommend a wireless Holter monitor or an event recorder, both of which can be worn longer than a standard Holter monitor. Event recorders are similar to Holter monitors and generally require you to push a button when you feel symptoms. There are several different types of event recorders.\n\n【34】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "0de9b3c6-d756-4a96-9af4-25b478edb1af", "title": "Ventricular fibrillation", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Ventricular fibrillation is a type of irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia). During ventricular fibrillation, the lower heart chambers contract in a very rapid and uncoordinated manner. As a result, the heart doesn't pump blood to the rest of the body.\n\n【2】Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention. It's the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death.\n\n【3】Emergency treatment for ventricular fibrillation includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks to the heart with a device called an automated external defibrillator (AED). Medications, implanted devices or surgery may be recommended to prevent episodes of ventricular fibrillation.\n\n【4】Ventricular fibrillation may also be called VFib, V-fib or VF.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Collapse and loss of consciousness are the most common symptoms of ventricular fibrillation.\n\n【7】Before a ventricular fibrillation episode, you may have symptoms of an irregularly fast or erratic heartbeat (arrhythmia). You may have:\n\n【8】*   Chest pain\n*   Very fast heartbeat (tachycardia)\n*   Dizziness\n*   Nausea\n*   Shortness of breath\n\n【9】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【10】Make an appointment with a heart doctor (cardiologist) if you have an unexplained fast or pounding heartbeat.\n\n【11】If you see someone collapse, seek emergency medical help immediately. Follow these steps:\n\n【12】*   Call 911 or your local emergency number.\n*   If the person is unconscious, check for a pulse.\n*   If no pulse, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to help keep blood flowing through the body until an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available. The American Heart Association recommends hands-only CPR. Push hard and fast on the person's chest — about 100 to 120 times a minute. It's not necessary to check the person's airway or deliver rescue breaths. Continue until emergency medical help arrives.\n*   Use an automated external defibrillator (AED) as soon as it's available. Deliver a shock following the prompts on the device.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】Ventricular fibrillation is caused by either:\n\n【15】*   A problem in the heart's electrical properties\n*   A disruption of the blood supply to the heart muscle\n\n【16】Sometimes, the cause of ventricular fibrillation is unknown.\n\n【17】To understand more about how ventricular fibrillation occurs, it may be helpful to know how the heart typically beats.\n\n【18】### The heartbeat\n\n【19】The typical heart has four chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Within the upper right chamber of the heart (right atrium) is a group of cells called the sinus node. The sinus node is the heart's natural pacemaker. It produces the signals that start each heartbeat.\n\n【20】These electrical signals move across the atria, causing the heart muscles to squeeze (contract) and pump blood into the ventricles.\n\n【21】Next, the signals arrive at a cluster of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node, where they slow down. This slight delay allows the ventricles to fill with blood. When the signals reach the ventricles, the lower heart chambers contract and pump blood to the lungs or to the rest of the body.\n\n【22】In a typical heart, this heart signaling process usually goes smoothly, resulting in a typical resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute. But in ventricular fibrillation, rapid, irregular electrical signals cause the lower heart chambers to quiver uselessly instead of pumping blood.\n\n【23】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【24】Things that may increase the risk of ventricular fibrillation include:\n\n【25】*   A previous episode of ventricular fibrillation\n*   A previous heart attack\n*   A heart problem present at birth (congenital heart defect)\n*   Heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy)\n*   Injuries that cause damage to the heart muscle, such as being struck by lightning\n*   Drug misuse, especially with cocaine or methamphetamine\n*   A severe imbalance of potassium or magnesium\n\n【26】Complications\n-------------\n\n【27】Without immediate treatment, ventricular fibrillation can cause death within minutes. The condition's rapid, erratic heartbeats cause the heart to abruptly stop pumping blood to the body. Blood pressure drops suddenly and significantly. The longer the body lacks blood, the greater the risk of damage to the brain and other organs.\n\n【28】Ventricular fibrillation is the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death. The risk of other long-term complications depends on how fast treatment is received.\n\n【29】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

A thrombotic tendency, should it exist, is commonly treated with aspirin. In this issue of _Proceedings_ , Fang and colleagues\n\n【11】*   Fang M\n*   Agha S\n*   Lockridge L\n*   et al.\n\n【12】Medical management of a large aortic thrombus in a young woman with essential thrombocythemia.\n\n【13】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2001; 76 : 427-431\n\n【14】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (14)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【15】describe the case of a middle-aged woman with ET who presented with abdominal and lower extremity pain, gastrointestinal cramping and diarrhea, and transient mottling of the toes. By abdominal computed tomography, the patient was found to have visceral infarctions and a large aortic thrombus. Treatment with hydroxyurea and aspirin was accompanied by complete resolution of the thrombus after 3 weeks, with no apparent clinical sequelae. The authors state that, to their knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the resolution of an aortic thrombus in a patient with ET treated with medical therapy alone.\n\n【16】Platelet function in patients with ET can be either normal or abnormal; dysfunctional platelets are frequently hemostatically incompetent, leading to hemorrhage, or hyperaggregable, leading to thrombosis. Thrombotic events are typically arterial or microvascular and commonly develop in situ. The renal and splenic infarctions reported in this patient without documented atherosclerotic vascular disease may have been a consequence of in situ thrombosis; however, owing to the size of the aortic thrombus and its location, we cannot exclude peripheral embolization as an underlying pathophysiological mechanism for these visceral infarctions. In support of this mechanism are the transient mottling of the patient's left foot on presentation and the irregular nature of the aortic thrombus, both clues to the embolic propensity of the thrombus.\n\n【17】The authors claim that the resolution of the aortic thrombus was a direct consequence of the therapy administered to the patient. This hypothesis is provocative and warrants careful consideration. Hydroxyurea suppresses clonal expansion and decreases the platelet count, thereby reducing the rate of accretion of platelets to the thrombus both by decreasing the derivation of hyperaggregable platelets from the clone and by a cellular “mass action” effect. In addition, aspirin suppresses platelet activation and granule secretion,\n\n【18】*   Awtry EH\n*   Loscalzo J\n\n【19】Aspirin.\n\n【20】无关删除-2_Circulation._ 2000; 101 : 1206-1218\n\n【21】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (723)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【22】which limits recruitment of platelets to the thrombus. However, to attribute the dissolution of the thrombus to the effects of these agents alone is not supported by known mechanisms of thrombus clearance.\n\n【23】Antithrombotic agents, including both antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, principally prevent thrombus growth by inhibiting platelet activation and fibrin formation. Thrombus is cleared from the circulation by endogenous thrombolytic mechanisms, including plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis and macrophage-mediated clearance through the action of lysozomal enzymes such as cathepsin D.\n\n【24】*   Simon DI\n*   Ezratty AM\n*   Francis SA\n*   Rennke H\n*   Loscalzo J\n\n【25】Fibrin(ogen) is internalized and degraded by activated human monocytoid cells via Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18): a nonplasmin fibrinolytic pathway.\n\n【26】无关删除-2_Blood._ 1993; 82 : 2414-2422\n\n【27】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【28】One may argue that the platelet-rich nature of the ET thrombus limits its ability to be cleared by these endogenous mechanisms, and available data do, indeed, support the platelet-rich predominance of these “white” thrombi, at least in the microvasculature.\n\n【29】*   van Genderen PJ\n*   Lucas IS\n*   van Strik R\n*   et al.\n\n【30】Erythromelalgia in essential thrombocythemia is characterized by platelet activation and endothelial cell damage but not by thrombin generation.\n\n【31】无关删除-2_Thromb Haemost._ 1996; 76 : 333-338\n\n【32】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【33】However, no thrombus, least of all an extensive, large aortic thrombus, is likely to be a “pure” platelet thrombus.

We compared this cohort with a previously reported cohort of pediatric patients with IE from our institution diagnosed from 1950 to 1979.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We identified 47 patients (24 males; mean ± SD age at diagnosis, 12.3±5.5 years \\[range, 1 day to 18.9 years\\]) who had 53 episodes of IE. The most common isolated organisms were viridans streptococci (17 of 53 episodes \\[32%\\]) and _Staphylococcus aureus_ (12 of 53 episodes \\[23%\\]). Of the 47 patients, 36 (77%) had congenital heart disease, 24 of whom had cardiac surgery before their first episode of IE (mean ± SD time to IE diagnosis after surgery, 4.2±3.2 years \\[range, 64 days to 11.3 years\\]). Fourteen patients (30%) required valve replacement because of valvular IE, and 16 (34%) had complications, including mycotic aneurysm, myocardial abscess, or emboli. Vegetations were identified using echocardiography in 37 of the 53 unique episodes of IE (70%). Endocarditis-related mortality occurred in 1 patient. Compared with the historical (1950-1979) cohort, there were no differences in patient demographic characteristics, history of congenital heart disease, or infecting organisms. One-year mortality was significantly lower in the modern cohort (4%) compared with the historical cohort (38%) ( _P_ <.001).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Most pediatric episodes of IE occur in patients with congenital heart disease. Mortality due to endocarditis has decreased in the modern era.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CHD ( congenital heart disease ), IE ( infective endocarditis ), VSD ( ventricular septal defect )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Patients with hypercholesterolemia and LDL-C levels exceeding National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III goals were randomized (2:1) to receive either ezetimibe (10 mg/d) or placebo in addition to their ongoing statin therapy for 6 weeks.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】A total of 5802 patients were screened at baseline for the Ezetimibe Add-On to Statin for Effectiveness study. Of these, 2772 were excluded, and the remaining 3030 eligible patients were randomized. Ezetimibe, compared with placebo, added to statin therapy significantly reduced LDL-C levels from statin-treated baseline by 23.0% (white patients), 23.0% (black patients), and 21.0% (Hispanic patients). This effect was consistent across race and ethnicity groups ( _P_ \\>.50 for treatment-byrace interactions). Ezetimibe added to statin therapy also statistically significantly ( _P_ <.001) increased the percentage of patients attaining their LDL-C goal for their National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III risk category in black (63.0%), Hispanic (64.8%), and white (72.3%) patients compared with placebo plus statin (32.9% black patients, 19.0% Hispanic patients, and 19.7% white patients). Ezetimibe treatment improved other lipid parameters across groups, including triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels. Finally, the addition of ezetimibe reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels overall, and no significant interaction of treatment by race occurred ( _P_ \\=.83), indicating a consistent effect across races. Ezetimibe was generally well tolerated, and no detectable differences occurred in the adverse event profile by race or ethnicity.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Ezetimibe added to statin therapy is effective and well tolerated for improving the lipid profile and LDL-C goal attainment of patients regardless of race or ethnicity.\n\n【8】AE ( adverse event ), ALT ( alanine aminotransferase ), ANOVA ( analysis of variance ), AST ( aspartate aminotransferase ), CHD ( coronary heart disease ), CK ( creatine kinase ), CRP ( C-reactive protein ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), EASE ( Ezetimibe Add-On to Statin for Effectiveness ), HDL-C ( high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), LDL-C ( low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), NCEP ATP III ( National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III ), TG ( triglyceride ), ULN ( upper limit of normal )\n\n【9】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【13】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【15】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "95d755e1-54de-4187-806d-6486cfa80396", "title": "Vulvodynia", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Vulvodynia (vul-voe-DIN-e-uh) is chronic pain or discomfort around the opening of your vagina (vulva) for which there's no identifiable cause and which lasts at least three months. The pain, burning or irritation associated with vulvodynia can make you so uncomfortable that sitting for long periods or having sex becomes unthinkable. The condition can last for months to years.\n\n【2】If you have vulvodynia, don't let the absence of visible signs or embarrassment about discussing the symptoms keep you from seeking help. Treatment options are available to lessen your discomfort. And your doctor might be able to determine a cause for your vulvar pain, so it's important to have an examination.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】The main vulvodynia symptom is pain in your genital area, which can be characterized as:\n\n【5】*   Burning\n*   Soreness\n*   Stinging\n*   Rawness\n*   Painful intercourse (dyspareunia)\n*   Throbbing\n*   Itching\n\n【6】Your pain might be constant or occasional. It might occur only when the sensitive area is touched (provoked). You might feel the pain in your entire vulvar area (generalized), or the pain might be localized to a certain area, such as the opening of your vagina (vestibule).\n\n【7】Vulvar tissue might look slightly inflamed or swollen. More often, your vulva appears normal.\n\n【8】A similar condition, vestibulodynia, causes pain only when pressure is applied to the area surrounding the entrance to your vagina.\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】Although women often don't mention vulvodynia to their doctors, the condition is fairly common.\n\n【11】If you have pain in your genital area, discuss it with your doctor or ask for a referral to a gynecologist. It's important to have your doctor rule out more easily treatable causes of vulvar pain — for instance, yeast or bacterial infections, herpes, precancerous skin conditions, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and medical problems such as diabetes.\n\n【12】It's also important not to repeatedly use over-the-counter treatments for yeast infections without seeing your doctor. Once your doctor has evaluated your symptoms, he or she can recommend treatments or ways to help you manage your pain.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】Doctors don't know what causes vulvodynia, but possible contributing factors include:\n\n【15】*   Injury to or irritation of the nerves surrounding your vulvar region\n*   Past vaginal infections\n*   Allergies or sensitive skin\n*   Hormonal changes\n*   Muscle spasm or weakness in the pelvic floor, which supports the uterus, bladder and bowel\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】Because it can be painful and frustrating and can keep you from wanting sex, vulvodynia can cause emotional problems. For example, fear of having sex can cause spasms in the muscles around your vagina (vaginismus). Other complications might include:\n\n【18】*   Anxiety\n*   Depression\n*   Sleep disturbances\n*   Sexual dysfunction\n*   Altered body image\n*   Relationship problems\n*   Decreased quality of life\n\n【19】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

His symptoms included subjective fever, cough productive of creamy white sputum, and nasal congestion of 3 months' duration. He denied dyspnea, hemoptysis, weight loss, or night sweats. Approximately 10 days before admission, he had been seen by his primary care physician for worsening of symptoms and was treated empirically with an undefined antibiotic. Subsequently, palpitations and severe fatigue developed, and the patient was admitted to a local hospital, where he was noted to be febrile and hypoxic with pulse oximetry readings in the high 80% range. Acute coronary syndrome was excluded, and ceftriaxone and moxifloxacin were initiated empirically. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest without intravenous contrast was performed. Compared with chest CT performed 4 years earlier, no new pulmonary infiltrate was evident; however, both the superior and the lateral aspect of the right hilum were more prominent than in the previous study and were suspicious for adenopathy. The patient was transferred to our institution approximately 2 days later for further evaluation.\n\n【1】On admission, the patient's main symptoms were fever, fatigue, palpitations, mild chest discomfort, cough, and nasal congestion. Findings on the rest of the systems review were unremarkable. The patient had a history of asthma, chronic sinusitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis, aspirin intolerance, nasal polyposis with multiple prior polypectomies, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. His medical regimen consisted of omeprazole, atorvastatin, doxazosin, irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide, montelukast, and fluticasone-salmeterol. His family history was notable for a sibling's death due to lung cancer at age 28 years.\n\n【2】On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 37.9 °C, heart rate of 95 beats/min (regular), blood pressure of 149/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and pulse oximetry of 94% while breathing 3 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. He appeared comfortable and had palpable anterior cervical chain and submandibular lymph nodes, jugular venous distension 3 cm above the clavicle, faint inspiratory crackles at both lung bases, and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur best heard at the apex.

Transbronchial hilar lymph node biopsy could be helpful in ruling out lymphoma or lung cancer as an etiology of the hilar enlargement seen on the prior CT chest scan. Although a bone marrow biopsy could be useful in the case of a hematologic malignancy, it is not indicated at this early stage.\n\n【50】Blood cultures and a detailed autoimmune panel were negative.

Acyclovir blocks viral DNA synthesis and is used to treat infection due to herpes simplex virus 1 and 2.\n\n【99】Acute Q fever is the most probable diagnosis given the patient's exposure to cattle; his presentation with fever, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis; and the presence of phase II IgM antibodies. Although a phase II IgG antibody would also be expected to be present after 3½ months of symptoms, it is possible that acute Q fever developed when the patient began to feel ill 10 days before admission. In that case, the phase II IgG antibody would be expected to be negative since IgM antibodies are first to appear early in the course of illness.\n\n【100】Treatment was initiated with 100 mg of doxycycline twice daily, for a total course of 14 days.

Acellular vaccine, available in the United States, is used primarily for individuals engaged in research with pregnant sheep or live _C burnetii_ . Patients should also have negative skin and serologic test results for Q fever before receiving acellular vaccine. Educating patients who already have Q fever on sources of infection is the most effective method of preventing the spread of infection. This includes appropriate disposal of birth products and aborted fetuses from facilities that house sheep and goats, consumption of only pasteurized milk and milk products, routinely testing animals for _C burnetii_ infection, and quarantine of imported animals. Individuals at high risk of complications of Q fever, including patients with cardiac valvulopathy, pregnant women, and vascular graft recipients, should avoid contact with livestock.\n\n【114】*   Fenollar F\n*   Fournier PE\n*   Carrieri MP\n*   Habib G\n*   Messana T\n*   Raoult D\n\n【115】Risks factors and prevention of Q fever endocarditis.\n\n【116】无关删除-2_Clin Infect Dis._ 2001 Aug 1; 33 ( Epub 2001 Jun 25. ) : 312-316\n\n【117】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (253)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【118】Q fever is not transmitted human-to-human, and testing patient's family members is unnecessary.

The designation Q fever (from Query) was coined in 1935 after an outbreak of febrile illness in an abattoir in Queensland, Australia. Although previously classified as a rickettsial organism, _C burnetii_ has been placed into the subdivision of the _Proteobacteria_ , which are closer to _Legionella_ and _Francisella_ than to _Rickettsia_ . The most commonly identified sources of human infection are farm animals such as cattle, goats, and sheep.\n\n【122】Clinical signs of Q fever are often mild or absent. Symptomatic illness can be divided into acute and chronic forms. Of patients with acute Q fever, 40% to 60% have hepatitis; 20%, pneumonia plus hepatitis; 14% to 17%, pneumonia; and 17%, fever alone. Hepatitis develops more often in younger people, and pneumonia more often in older people, usually immunocompromised patients. Fibrin-ring granulomas, which have been associated with Q fever, may rarely be seen in the liver and bone marrow and may appear “doughnut-like” because of a lipid vacuole surrounded by a fibrinoid ring.\n\n【123】*   Bonilla MF\n*   Kaul DR\n*   Saint S\n*   Isada CM\n*   Brotman DJ\n\n【124】Clinical problem-solving: ring around the diagnosis.\n\n【125】无关删除-2_N Engl J Med._ 2006; 354 : 1937-1942\n\n【126】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (13)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【127】Chest radiography can show normal findings or pleural-based opacities, effusions, atelectasis, and, rarely, hilar adenopathy. Results of laboratory studies are usually normal except for mild elevations in the peripheral white blood cell count (30% of patients); thrombocytopenia is noted in 25% of patients. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually moderately elevated. Liver enzymes are elevated in almost three-fourths of patients. Q fever is principally diagnosed by serologic methods. The presence of phase I IgM and/or IgG antibodies indicates recent infection, whereas a phase I IgG antibody titer greater than 1:800 indicates chronic infection.\n\n【128】Chronic Q fever may develop within a year or as long as 20 years after the initial infection. It occurs primarily in patients with previous valvular heart disease, immunocompromised patients, and pregnant women. Mortality rates can be as high as 30% to 60%. Q fever endocarditis is identified on the basis of the modified Duke criteria, and a single positive blood culture for _C burnetii_ or a _C burnetii_ anti-phase I IgG titer of greater than 1:800 is considered a major criterion for diagnosis.\n\n【129】The treatment of choice for acute Q fever is doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, for 15 to 21 days. Fluoroquinolones are also efficacious and may be used. In pregnant women, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be used as long as the neonate is monitored for potential hyperbili-rubinemia. However, given the potential toxic effects of treatment, most therapies are purely to control infection, with curative therapy initiated after the patient has been delivered of her newborn.\n\n【130】Once acute Q fever has been diagnosed, transthoracic echocardiography should be performed to look for valvulopathy; if present, treatment should be initiated for infective endocarditis.\n\n【131】*   Landais C\n*   Fenollar F\n*   Thuny F\n*   Raoult D\n\n【132】From acute Q fever to endocarditis: serological follow-up strategy.\n\n【133】无关删除-2_Clin Infect Dis._ 2007 May 15; 44 ( Epub 2007 Apr 4. ) : 1337-1340\n\n【134】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (90)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【135】If valve lesions are not present, then repeated serologic testing should be performed at 3- and 6-month follow-up.

This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins. The medicine must be injected slowly, so your IV tube will need to stay in place for at least 15 minutes.\n\n【33】For hypercalcemia, this medicine is usually given only once. If your doctor decides that you need additional doses, you will receive the medicine again after at least 7 days have passed. This treatment will continue until your body responds to the medicine.\n\n【34】For bone cancer and multiple myeloma, this medicine is usually given every 3 to 4 weeks. This treatment will continue until your body responds to the medicine.\n\n【35】For osteoporosis, this medicine is usually given once a year and will continue until your body responds to the medicine.\n\n【36】You may also receive other medicines to help keep your body from losing too much fluid.\n\n【37】Your doctor may also give you vitamins containing Vitamin D and calcium. Tell your doctor if you are unable to take these supplements.\n\n【38】Drink extra fluids so you will pass more urine while you are using this medicine. This will keep your kidneys working well and help prevent kidney problems. However, it is very important to not drink too much liquid. Talk to your doctor about the right amount of liquids for you.\n\n【39】This medicine comes with a Medication Guide. It is very important that you read and understand this information. Be sure to ask your doctor about anything you do not understand.\n\n【40】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【41】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits after you have received zoledronic acid injection. If your condition has improved, your progress must still be checked. The results of laboratory tests or the occurrence of certain symptoms will tell your doctor if your condition is coming back and if a second treatment is needed. You will need a yearly dose of this medicine if you are being treated for postmenopausal osteoporosis, so check with your doctor regularly.\n\n【42】Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【43】You should not use other medicines that also contain zoledronic acid, such as Reclast® or Zometa®. Using these medicines together may increase your chance for more serious side effects.\n\n【44】This medicine may rarely cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.

We aimed to investigate whether long-term change in CRF, as assessed by the gold standard method of respiratory gas exchange during exercise, is associated with all-cause mortality. A population-based sample of 579 men aged 42 to 60 years with no missing data at baseline examination (V1) and at reexamination at 11 years (V2) were included. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO <sub>2max </sub> ) was measured at both visits using respiratory gas exchange during maximal exercise testing, and the difference (ΔVO <sub>2max </sub> ) was calculated as VO <sub>2max </sub> (V2) − VO <sub>2max </sub> (V1). Deaths were ascertained annually using national death certificates during 15 years of follow-up after V2. The mean ΔVO <sub>2max </sub> was −5.2 mL/min\\*kg. During median follow-up of 13.3 years (interquartile range, 12.5-14.0 years), 123 deaths (21.2%) were recorded. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for baseline age, VO <sub>2max </sub> , systolic blood pressure, smoking status, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, C-reactive protein level, body mass index, alcohol consumption, physical activity, socioeconomic status, and history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease, a 1 mL/min\\*kg higher ΔVO <sub>2max </sub> was associated with a 9% relative risk reduction of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.87-0.95). This study suggested that in this population, long-term CRF reduction was associated with an increased risk of mortality, emphasizing the importance of maintaining good CRF over the decades.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】BMI ( body mass index ), CRF ( cardiorespiratory fitness ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), eCRF ( estimated cardiorespiratory fitness ), HDL ( high-density lipoprotein ), HR ( hazard ratio ), IQR ( interquartile range ), LDL ( low-density lipoprotein ), MET ( metabolic equivalent ), RER ( respiratory exchange ratio ), VO2max ( maximal oxygen uptake ), ΔVO2max ( VO2max at 11 years − VO2max at baseline )\n\n【4】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【5】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【6】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【7】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【8】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【9】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【10】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【11】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

The patient reported that the lesions were intially small blisters that had progressed to large painful hemorrhagic bullae. He had no history of intravenous drug use, high-risk sexual behavior, or tobacco abuse. Findings on physical examination were notable for anterior scleritis, cyanotic fingers, and bilateral 2+ lower extremity edema with numerous well-demarcated bullous lesions that had a hemorrhagic fluid-filled appearance. A complete blood cell count and metabolic profile were normal; urinalysis revealed trace hematuria. Skin biopsy demonstrated vascular thrombi with sweat gland necrosis consistent with coma bullae. Computed tomography of the chest revealed scattered, well-circumscribed pulmonary nodules. Serologic testing confirmed a positive cytoplastic antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody titer of 1:160 with anti-proteinase 3 antibodies. Renal biopsy was consistent with Wegener granulomatosis, and treatment was initiated with intravenous methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. At 4-month follow-up, the patient's renal function was normal, and he had no further complications.\n\n【1】Coma bullae are commonly associated with use of opiates, tricyclic antidepressants, and antipsychotics. They have also been observed in patients with chronic renal failure, hypercalcemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and a variety of neurologic conditions. The skin lesions usually resolve in 2 to 4 weeks, but early recognition and treatment of the underlying condition are crucial. Etiology of these pathogenic lesions is broad, should be based on the clinical presentation, and should include autoimmune disorders such as Wegener granulomatosis.\n\n【2】无关删除-2*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【3】Article info\n------------\n\n【4】### Identification\n\n【5】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/mcp.2010.0364\n\n【6】### Copyright\n\n【7】© 2011 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

{"seq_id": "e077975f-733b-490d-8779-693bf0c9ca51", "title": "Breast reconstruction with flap surgery", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Breast reconstruction is a surgical procedure that restores shape to your breast after a mastectomy — surgery that removes your breast to treat or prevent breast cancer. Breast reconstruction with flap surgery involves taking a section of tissue from one area of your body — most often your abdomen — and relocating it to create a new breast mound.\n\n【2】Breast reconstruction with flap surgery is a complex procedure performed by a plastic surgeon. Much of the breast reconstruction using your body's own tissue can be accomplished at the time of your mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), though sometimes it can be done as a separate procedure later (delayed reconstruction).\n\n【3】Your plastic surgeon may recommend a two-stage procedure. The first stage is to place an implant expander and the second stage is to complete the tissue reconstruction.You'll likely need another operation to perform nipple reconstruction.\n\n【4】Risks\n-----\n\n【5】Breast reconstruction with flap surgery is a major procedure and carries with it the possibility of significant complications, including:\n\n【6】*   Changes in breast sensation\n*   Prolonged time in surgery and under anesthesia\n*   Extended recovery and healing time\n*   Poor wound healing\n*   Fluid collection (seroma)\n*   Infection\n*   Bleeding\n*   Tissue death (necrosis) due to insufficient blood supply\n*   Loss of sensation at the tissue donor site\n*   Abdominal wall hernia or weakness\n\n【7】Radiation therapy delivered to the skin and chest wall may pose complications during healing if it's given after breast reconstruction surgery. Your doctor may recommend waiting until you're finished with radiation therapy before proceeding with the second stage of the breast reconstruction.\n\n【8】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【9】Before a mastectomy, your doctor may recommend that you meet with a plastic surgeon. Consult a plastic surgeon who's board certified and experienced in breast reconstruction following mastectomy. Ideally, your breast surgeon and the plastic surgeon should work together to develop the best surgical treatment and breast reconstruction strategy in your situation.\n\n【10】Your plastic surgeon will describe your surgical options and may show you photos of women who have had different types of breast reconstruction. Your body type, health status and cancer treatment factor into which type of reconstruction will give you the best result. The plastic surgeon also provides information on anesthesia, where the operation will be performed and what kind of follow-up procedures may be necessary.\n\n【11】Your plastic surgeon may discuss the pros and cons of surgery on your opposite breast, even if it's healthy, so that it more closely matches the shape and size of your reconstructed breast. Surgery to remove your healthy breast (contralateral prophylactic mastectomy) can double the risk of surgical complications, such as bleeding and infection. Also, there may be less satisfaction with cosmetic outcomes after surgery.\n\n【12】Before surgery, follow your doctor's instructions on preparing for the procedure. This may include guidelines on eating and drinking, adjusting current medications, and quitting smoking.\n\n【13】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【14】Chances are your new breast won't look exactly like your natural one did. However, the contour of your new breast can usually be restored so that your silhouette looks similar to your silhouette before surgery.\n\n【15】Breast reconstruction with flap surgery is the most complex breast reconstructive option. Your surgeon transfers a section of skin, muscle, fat and blood vessels from one part of your body to your chest to create a new breast mound. In some cases, the skin and tissue need to be augmented with a breast implant to achieve the desired breast size.\n\n【16】### Surgical methods\n\n【17】Autologous tissue breast reconstruction uses one of two surgical methods:\n\n【18】*   **Pedicled flap surgery** The surgeon cuts some of the blood vessels to the tissue to be transferred but keeps other blood vessels intact. Tunneling the tissue beneath your skin to your chest area, the surgeon then creates the new breast mound or pocket for the implant.\n*   **Free flap surgery.** The surgeon disconnects the tissue completely from its blood supply and reattaches the tissue to new blood vessels near your chest. Because of reattaching blood vessels, free flap surgery typically takes longer than does pedicled flap surgery.\n\n【19】### Types of flap surgery\n\n【20】The tissue for reconstructing your breast most often comes from your abdomen. Tissue from your back or — less commonly — your buttocks may also be used. Your surgeon determines which method is best for you based on your body type and your medical and surgical history.\n\n【21】*   **Abdomen (TRAM flap).** Your surgeon removes tissue — including muscle — from your abdomen in a procedure known as a transverse rectus abdominis muscle (TRAM) flap. The TRAM flap can be transferred as a free flap or a pedicled flap.\n\n【22】    A pedicled TRAM flap uses your whole rectus muscle — one of the four major muscles in your abdomen. For a muscle-sparing free TRAM flap, your surgeon takes only a portion of your rectus abdominis muscle, which may help you retain abdominal strength after surgery.\n\n【23】*   **Abdomen (DIEP flap).** A newer procedure, deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap, is similar to an msTRAM flap, but only skin and fat are removed. Most of the abdominal muscle is left in place and minimal muscle tissue is taken to form the new breast mound. Reattaching blood vessels requires expertise in surgery through a microscope (microsurgery).\n\n【24】    An advantage to this type of breast reconstruction is that you'll retain more strength in your abdomen. If your surgeon can't perform a DIEP flap procedure for anatomical reasons, he or she might opt for the msTRAM procedure instead.\n\n【25】*   **Abdomen (SIEA flap).** A variation of the DIEP flap, the superficial inferior epigastric artery (SIEA) flap uses the same abdominal tissue but relies on blood vessels that aren't as deep within the abdomen. This provides a less invasive option, but not all women's SIEA blood vessels are adequate for this type of flap surgery.\n*   **Back (latissimus dorsi flap).** This surgical technique takes skin, fat and muscle from your upper back, tunneling it under your skin to your chest. Because the amount of skin and other tissue is generally less than in a TRAM flap surgery, this approach may be used for small and medium-sized breasts or for creating a pocket for a breast implant. Although uncommon, some women experience muscle weakness in the back, shoulder or arm after this surgery.\n*   **Buttocks (gluteal flap).** A gluteal flap is a free flap procedure that takes tissue from your buttocks and transplants it to your chest area. A gluteal flap may be an option for women who prefer tissue reconstruction but who don't have enough extra tissue in their backs or abdomens.\n*   **Inner thigh (TUG).** Another newer option, the transverse upper gracilis (TUG) flap, uses muscle and fatty tissue from the bottom of the buttocks to the inner thigh. TUG flap surgery, which isn't available everywhere, may be an option for women whose thighs touch and who have small to medium-sized breasts.\n\n【26】Because adequate blood supply is critical to the survival of transplanted tissue in flap surgery, your surgeon may prefer not to perform a pedicled flap procedure if you're a smoker or if you have diabetes, vascular disease or a connective tissue disorder. If you smoke, you may be asked to quit for four to six weeks before your surgery. Also, obesity may preclude you from having a pedicled TRAM flap.\n\n【27】In general, flap breast reconstruction surgery is more extensive than is mastectomy or implant reconstruction. Flap procedures result in larger incisions that take longer to heal, so they require a longer recovery period and may require a longer hospital stay.\n\n【28】A new technique for breast reconstruction, autologous fat grafting, uses liposuction to gather fat tissue from your thighs, abdomen or buttocks to reconstruct the breast or to improve the appearance of your breast after reconstruction.\n\n【29】### Nipple reconstruction\n\n【30】Breast reconstruction may also entail reconstruction of your nipple, if you choose, including tattooing to define the dark area of skin surrounding your nipple (areola).\n\n【31】### Recovery\n\n【32】You may be tired and sore for a few weeks after your surgery. Your doctor can prescribe medication to control your pain. You may have drainage tubes in place for a short time after your surgery to remove excess fluids that collect in the surgical site.\n\n【33】Wearing an elastic bandage or support bra can help keep swelling down and support your breast while it heals.\n\n【34】You'll also have stitches (sutures) after your surgery. They'll probably be absorbable sutures, though, so you won't need to have them removed. Scarring is permanent, but the scars generally fade over time.\n\n【35】Getting back to normal activities may take up to six weeks or more. Your doctor will let you know of any restrictions to your activities, such as avoiding overhead lifting or strenuous physical activities. Don't be surprised if it seems to take a long time to bounce back from surgery — some women report that it takes as long as a year or two before feeling completely healed and back to normal.\n\n【36】### Future breast cancer screening\n\n【37】If you've had only one breast reconstructed, you'll need to have screening mammography done regularly on your other breast. Mammography isn't necessary on breasts that have been reconstructed.\n\n【38】You may also choose to perform breast self-exams on your natural breast and the skin and surrounding area of your reconstructed breast. This may help you become familiar with the changes to your breast after surgery so that you can be alert to any new changes and report those to your doctor.\n\n【39】Results\n-------\n\n【40】Keep your expectations realistic about your surgery. Breast reconstruction offers many benefits, but it won't make your breast look or feel exactly like it did before your mastectomy.\n\n【41】What breast reconstruction can do:\n\n【42】*   Give you a breast contour\n*   Help your breasts look natural under clothing or a bathing suit\n*   Help you avoid the need for using a form (external prosthesis) inside your bra\n\n【43】What breast reconstruction might do:\n\n【44】*   Improve your self-esteem and body image\n*   Partially erase the physical reminders of your disease\n*   Require additional surgery to correct reconstructive problems\n\n【45】What breast reconstruction won't do:\n\n【46】*   Make you look exactly the same as before\n*   Give your reconstructed breast the same sensations as your normal breast\n\n【47】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Knowledge of gene sequences should not be equated with a comprehensive understanding of gene function. The issue is the threshold for categorizing a gene as having a “known” function. Most physicians would agree that we know the function of hemoglobin because it has been studied in detail for many years and the textbooks tell us that it is an oxygen transport protein. However, there are certainly aspects of hemoglobin function that deserve further scrutiny. A database search for National Institutes of Health grants that relate to hemoglobin delivers more than 100 “hits.” Clearly, more work needs to be done before we are confident that we know everything about hemoglobin's function.\n\n【1】In their article describing the sequence of the human genome and the identification of human genes, Venter et al\n\n【2】*   Venter JC\n*   Adams MD\n*   Myers EW\n*   et al.\n\n【3】The sequence of the human genome \\[published correction appears in _Science_ . 2001;292:1838\\].\n\n【4】无关删除-2_Science._ 2001; 291 : 1304-1351\n\n【5】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (10770)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【6】estimated that there are between 26,000 and 38,000 human genes and noted that only about 60% of the known and predicted genes (just over 15,000 genes) have a “known or predicted function.” This is the standard we alluded to in our article. Clearly, this is a low threshold for attributing function to a DNA sequence. The point we were trying to emphasize is that even with this low threshold there are still a startlingly high number of putative genes for which we are completely unable to assign a function.

The main outcome was AF incidence from national hospital registers until April 2018. The association of risk factors with AF incidence was assessed by cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regression and Fine-Gray subdistribution hazards regression analysis.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】During a maximum of 14.4 years of follow-up (median, 8.9 years), incident AF was observed in 3449 men and 2772 women with 845 (95% CI, 815 to 875) and 514 (95% CI, 494 to 535) events per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The age-adjusted hazard of incident AF was 63% (95% CI, 55% to 72%) higher in men compared with women. Risk factors for AF were generally similar in men and women, except men were taller than women (179 cm vs 166 cm, respectively; _P_ <.001). When controlling for height, the difference in hazard of incident AF between sexes disappeared. For population attributable risk of AF, height was the most important risk factor investigated and explained 21% and 19% of the risk of incident AF in men and women, respectively.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】A 63% higher risk of incident AF in men compared with women is explained by differences in height.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AF ( atrial fibrillation ), BMI ( body mass index ), BP ( blood pressure ), HF ( heart failure ), IHD ( ischemic heart disease ), PAR ( population attributable risk )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Information on self-reported physical activity and cognitive frailty status were collected at baseline. Analyses were performed with Cox regression after adjustment for confounders.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The median follow-up was 14 years (range, 0.03-14.25 years), corresponding to 40,447 person-years, with a total of 1634 deaths. The hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality among participants with cognitive frailty compared with robust participants was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.43-2.01). Being active was associated with a mortality reduction of 36% (95% CI, 21%-47%) in cognitively frail individuals. Compared with those who were robust and active, participants with cognitive frailty who were inactive had the highest mortality risk (HR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.73-2.61), which was equivalent to being 6.8 (95% CI, 5.33-7.99) years older.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Cognitive frailty was more markedly associated with increased mortality in inactive older adults, and being active reduced the mortality risk among cognitively frail individuals by 36%. These novel results highlight that engaging in physical activity could improve survival among cognitively frail older adults.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BDNF ( brain-derived neurotrophic factor ), FRAIL ( fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss of weight ), HR ( hazard ratio ), MCI ( mild cognitive impairment ), MMSE ( Mini-Mental Status Examination )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

The most common causes for PRES were hypertension (n=61 \\[84%\\]) and immunosuppression (n=22 \\[30%\\]). Renal failure was present in 42 (58%) patients. The median interval between clinical onset of PRES and CSF analysis was 1 day (interquartile range \\[IQR\\], 0-2 days). The median opening pressure was 23 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O or 17 mm Hg (IQR, 18-28 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O or 13-21 mm Hg), although it was available in only 27 patients. The median CSF protein level was 58 mg/dL (IQR, 44-81 mg/dL; normal value, <35 mg/dL). The median CSF protein level was higher in patients with more extensive vasogenic edema. The median white blood cell count was 1 cell/μL (IQR, 1-2 cells/μL).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Elevated CSF protein level without CSF pleocytosis commonly occurs in patients with PRES and is directly associated with the extent and topographical distribution of cerebral edema. Although mild CSF pleocytosis can also occur, it is an uncommon finding and may prompt consideration for further diagnostic testing.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CNS ( central nervous system ), CSF ( cerebrospinal fluid ), IQR ( interquartile range ), MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ), OP ( opening pressure ), PRES ( posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

It tends to be a long-lasting (chronic) condition, and some types can be life-threatening without treatment. Treatment with medication usually controls it.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Pemphigus causes blisters on your skin and mucous membranes. The blisters rupture easily, leaving open sores, which may ooze and become infected.\n\n【5】The signs and symptoms of two common types of pemphigus are as follows:\n\n【6】*   **Pemphigus vulgaris.** This type usually begins with blisters in your mouth and then on your skin or genital mucous membranes. The blisters typically are painful but don't itch. Blisters in your mouth or throat may make it hard to swallow and eat.\n*   **Pemphigus foliaceus.** This type causes blisters on the chest, back and shoulders. The blisters tend to be more itchy than painful. Pemphigus foliaceus doesn't cause mouth blisters.\n\n【7】Pemphigus is distinct from bullous pemphigoid, which is a blistering skin condition that affects older adults and may cause death.\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】See your doctor if you have blisters inside your mouth or on your skin that don't heal.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder. Normally, your immune system produces antibodies to fight off harmful invaders, such viruses and bacteria. But in pemphigus, the body produces antibodies that damage cells of your skin and mucous membranes.\n\n【12】Pemphigus isn't contagious. In most cases, it's unknown what triggers the disease.\n\n【13】Rarely, pemphigus is triggered by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, penicillamine and other drugs.\n\n【14】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【15】Your risk of pemphigus increases if you're middle-aged or older. The condition tends to be more common in people of Middle Eastern or Jewish descent.\n\n【16】Complications\n-------------\n\n【17】Possible complications of pemphigus include:\n\n【18】*   Infection of your skin\n*   Infection that spreads to your bloodstream (sepsis)\n*   Malnutrition, because painful mouth sores make it difficult to eat\n*   Medication side effects, such as high blood pressure and infection\n*   Death, if certain types of pemphigus are left untreated\n\n【19】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

In this condition, pressure on sensitive points in your muscles (trigger points) causes pain in the muscle and sometimes in seemingly unrelated parts of your body. This is called referred pain.\n\n【2】This syndrome typically occurs after a muscle has been contracted repetitively. This can be caused by repetitive motions used in jobs or hobbies or by stress-related muscle tension.\n\n【3】While nearly everyone has experienced muscle tension pain, the discomfort associated with myofascial pain syndrome persists or worsens. Treatment options include physical therapy and trigger point injections. Pain medications and relaxation techniques also can help.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of myofascial pain syndrome may include:\n\n【6】*   Deep, aching pain in a muscle\n*   Pain that persists or worsens\n*   A tender knot in a muscle\n*   Difficulty sleeping due to pain\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience muscle pain that doesn't go away. Nearly everyone experiences muscle pain from time to time. But if your muscle pain persists despite rest, massage and similar self-care measures, make an appointment with your doctor.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Sensitive areas of tight muscle fibers can form in your muscles after injuries or overuse. These sensitive areas are called trigger points. A trigger point in a muscle can cause strain and pain throughout the muscle. When this pain persists and worsens, doctors call it myofascial pain syndrome.\n\n【11】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【12】Myofascial pain syndrome is caused by a stimulus, such as muscle tightness, that sets off trigger points in your muscles. Factors that may increase your risk of muscle trigger points include:\n\n【13】*   **Muscle injury.** An acute muscle injury or continual muscle stress may lead to the development of trigger points. For example, a spot within or near a strained muscle may become a trigger point. Repetitive motions and poor posture also may increase your risk.\n*   **Stress and anxiety.** People who frequently experience stress and anxiety may be more likely to develop trigger points in their muscles. One theory holds that these people may be more likely to clench their muscles, a form of repeated strain that leaves muscles susceptible to trigger points.\n\n【14】Complications\n-------------\n\n【15】Complications associated with myofascial pain syndrome may include:\n\n【16】*   **Sleep problems.** Signs and symptoms of myofascial pain syndrome may make it difficult to sleep at night. You may have trouble finding a comfortable sleep position. And if you move at night, you might hit a trigger point and awaken.\n*   **Fibromyalgia.** Some research suggests that myofascial pain syndrome may develop into fibromyalgia in some people. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that features widespread pain. It's believed that the brains of people with fibromyalgia become more sensitive to pain signals over time. Some doctors believe myofascial pain syndrome may play a role in starting this process.\n\n【17】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "8c2c5996-ee94-45f8-9c11-ab983e302a0b", "title": "Oophorectomy (ovary removal surgery)", "text": "【0】Oophorectomy (ovary removal surgery)\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】An oophorectomy (oh-of-uh-REK-tuh-me) is a surgical procedure to remove one or both of your ovaries. Your ovaries are almond-shaped organs that sit on each side of the uterus in your pelvis. Your ovaries contain eggs and produce hormones that control your menstrual cycle.\n\n【2】When an oophorectomy involves removing both ovaries, it's called bilateral oophorectomy. When the surgery involves removing only one ovary, it's called unilateral oophorectomy.\n\n【3】An oophorectomy can also be done as part of an operation to remove the uterus (hysterectomy).\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】An oophorectomy may be performed for:\n\n【6】*   A tubo-ovarian abscess — a pus-filled pocket involving a fallopian tube and an ovary\n*   Ovarian cancer\n*   Endometriosis\n*   Noncancerous (benign) ovarian tumors or cysts\n*   Reducing the risk of ovarian cancer or breast cancer in those at increased risk\n*   Ovarian torsion — the twisting of an ovary\n\n【7】Risks\n-----\n\n【8】An oophorectomy is a relatively safe procedure. However, with any surgical procedure, there are risks involved.\n\n【9】Risks of an oophorectomy include the following:\n\n【10】*   Bleeding\n*   Infection\n*   Damage to nearby organs\n*   Rupture of a tumor, spreading potentially cancerous cells\n*   Retention of ovary cells that continue to cause signs and symptoms, such as pelvic pain, in premenopausal women (ovarian remnant syndrome)\n*   Inability to get pregnant on your own, if both ovaries are removed\n\n【11】### Menopause after oophorectomy\n\n【12】If you haven't undergone menopause, you will experience menopause if both ovaries are removed. This deprives the body of the hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, produced in the ovaries, leading to complications such as:\n\n【13】*   Menopause signs and symptoms, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness\n*   Depression or anxiety\n*   Heart disease\n*   Memory problems\n*   Decreased sex drive\n*   Osteoporosis\n\n【14】Undergoing an oophorectomy at a younger age, such as before 45, may increase the risks related to early menopause. Talk with your doctor about the risks as they relate specifically to your situation.\n\n【15】Taking low doses of hormone replacement drugs after surgery and until about age 50 may reduce the risk of these complications. But hormone replacement therapy has risks of its own. Discuss your options with your doctor.\n\n【16】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【17】To prepare for an oophorectomy, your doctor may ask that you:\n\n【18】*   Stop eating a certain number of hours before your surgery and limit liquids\n*   Stop taking certain medications\n*   Undergo imaging tests, such as ultrasound and blood tests, to help surgeons plan for the procedure\n\n【19】### Plan for infertility\n\n【20】If you want to have children, talk with your doctor about your options. There may be ways to preserve your ability to become pregnant, depending on your particular situation. Ask your doctor to refer you to a fertility specialist who can review your options with you.\n\n【21】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【22】### During oophorectomy\n\n【23】During oophorectomy surgery you'll receive anesthetics to put you in a sleep-like state. You won't be aware during the procedure.\n\n【24】An oophorectomy can be performed two ways:\n\n【25】*   **Laparotomy.** In this surgical approach, the surgeon makes one long incision in your lower abdomen to access your ovaries. The surgeon separates each ovary from the blood supply and tissue that surrounds it and removes the ovary.\n*   **Minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery.** In this surgical approach, the surgeon makes a couple of very small incisions in your abdomen.\n\n【26】    The surgeon inserts a tube with a tiny camera through one incision and special surgical tools through the others. The camera transmits video to a monitor in the operating room that the surgeon uses to guide the surgical tools.\n\n【27】    Each ovary is separated from the blood supply and surrounding tissue and placed in a pouch. The pouch is pulled out of your abdomen through one of the small incisions.\n\n【28】    Laparoscopic oophorectomy can also be done with the assistance of a surgical robot. During robotic surgery, the surgeon watches a 3D monitor and uses hand controls that allow movement of the surgical tools.\n\n【29】Whether your oophorectomy is an open, laparoscopic or robotic procedure depends on your situation. Laparoscopic or robotic oophorectomy usually offers quicker recovery, less pain and a shorter hospital stay. But these procedures aren't appropriate for everyone, and in some cases, surgery that begins as laparoscopic may need to be converted to an open procedure during the operation.\n\n【30】### After oophorectomy\n\n【31】After an oophorectomy, you can expect to:\n\n【32】*   Spend time in a recovery room as your anesthesia wears off\n*   Move to a hospital room where you may spend a few hours to a few days, depending on your procedure\n*   Get up and about as soon as you're able in order to help your recovery\n\n【33】Most people are able to go home after oophorectomy surgery and won't need to spend the night in the hospital.\n\n【34】Results\n-------\n\n【35】How quickly you can go back to your normal activities after an oophorectomy depends on your situation, including the reason for your surgery and how it was performed.\n\n【36】Most people can return to full activity in two to four weeks after surgery.\n\n【37】Discuss exercise, driving, sexual restrictions and overall activity level with your surgeon.\n\n【38】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

It works by acting on the kidneys to increase the flow of urine.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Solution\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of furosemide injection to treat fluid retention and swelling in children. However, premature babies are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, kidney stones, hearing problems), which may require caution in patients receiving furosemide injection.\n\n【17】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of furosemide injection to treat congestion caused by excess amount of fluid in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【18】### Geriatric\n\n【19】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of furosemide injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving furosemide injection.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

We identified residents of Olmsted County who sought care for cellulitis from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 1999, reviewed medical records to ascertain agreement with a case definition of lower-extremity cellulitis, and calculated the population-based incidence of lower-extremity cellulitis.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】During 1999, 176 episodes met the case definition of lower-extremity cellulitis; the incidence of lower-extremity cellulitis in Olmsted County was 199 per 100,000 person-years. Sex-specific incidence was 197 per 100,000 person-years for women and 201 per 100,000 person-years for men. In a sex-adjusted model, the incidence increased 3.7% (95% confidence interval, 2.9%-4.5%) per year increment in age or 43.8% (95% confidence interval, 33.6%-54.7%) per 10-year increment. The incidence of cellulitis significantly increased with age ( _P_ <.001 in Poisson regression) but was not statistically significantly different between the sexes.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】The incidence of lower-extremity cellulitis in this population-based study was high and was affected by age. In contrast, sex did not influence infection incidence. The need for hospitalization and the prevalence of recurrence of lower-extremity cellulitis added to the burden of disease in Olmsted County.\n\n【8】CI ( confidence interval ), HICDA ( hospital adaptation of the International Classification of Diseases ), ICD-9 ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ), REP ( Rochester Epidemiology Project ), WBC ( white blood cell )\n\n【9】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【13】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【15】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "04fedbf8-516c-4bd5-9c26-a3ff365c1b00", "title": "Paroxetine (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Paroxetine (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Brisdelle\n2.  Paxil\n3.  Paxil CR\n4.  Pexeva\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Paroxetine is used to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Brisdelle® is used only to treat moderate to severe hot flashes caused by menopause.\n\n【6】Paroxetine belongs to a group of medicines known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These medicines are thought to work by increasing the activity of the chemical called serotonin in the brain.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Capsule\n*   Tablet\n*   Suspension\n*   Tablet, Extended Release\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of paroxetine in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】Use of Brisdelle® is not indicated in the pediatric population.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of paroxetine in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults, and are more likely to have hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood), which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving paroxetine.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

The Israel Cancer Registry provided comprehensive data on the occurrence of KS among Ethiopian immigrants and in the non-Ethiopian population of Israel.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】A total of 39.1% and 57% of the HIV-negative and HIV-positive Ethiopians, respectively, were infected with HHV-8 ( _P_ \\>.03). However, none of the Ethiopians examined and none of the other HIV-negative Ethiopians among about 45,000 immigrants had KS. Moreover, only 1 (0.85%) of 118 Ethiopian patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed KS compared with 49 (12.5%) of 391 non-Ethiopian AIDS patients ( _P_ \\>.001).\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】Although HHV-8 infection is common in Ethiopian Jewish immigrants to Israel, these patients almost never develop KS, in marked contrast to the strong association usually observed. The mechanism behind this population's unique protection requires further study.\n\n【8】AIDS ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ), CI ( confidence interval ), HHV-8 ( human herpesvirus 8 ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), ICD-O ( International Classification of Diseases for Oncology ), ICR ( Israel Cancer Registry ), KS ( Kaposi sarcoma )\n\n【9】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【13】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【15】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Androgen replacement in women improves libido, bone density, and body composition. The adverse effects, like hirsutism, are generally mild, and the safety profile of transdermal testosterone replacement is more favorable than that of other modes of androgen therapy. Further studies may help to determine the effect of lipid changes on cardiac outcomes. We believe that long-term studies are necessary to observe the potential effect of androgen replacement on cardiovascular mortality, breast and endometrial tissues, and mood and anger before this therapy can be used routinely in women.\n\n【1】*   CAD = coronary artery disease\n*   FMD = flow-mediated vasodilation\n*   GTN = glyceryl trinitrate\n*   HDL = high-density lipoprotein\n*   LDL = low-density lipoprotein\n*   TC = total cholesterol\n*   TG = triglyceride\n\n【2】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【3】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【4】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【5】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【6】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【8】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【9】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Symfi\n2.  Symfi Lo\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Efavirenz, lamivudine, and tenofovir combination is used alone to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\n【6】This medicine does not cure or prevent HIV or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of problems that usually result from AIDS or HIV disease. It will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have some of the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Tablet\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Symfi™ in children weighing 40 kilograms (kg) or more or Symfi Lo™ in children weighing 35 kg or more. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children weighing less than 40 kg using Symfi™ and in children weighing less than 35 kg using Symfi Lo™.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of efavirenz, lamivudine, and tenofovir combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution in patients receiving efavirenz, lamivudine, and tenofovir combination.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below.

For most people, palliative care is not provided by hospice and palliative medicine specialists, but rather by their primary care providers. The recognition of hospice and palliative medicine as its own medical subspecialty in 2006 highlighted the importance of palliative care to the practice of medicine, yet many health care professionals harbor misconceptions about palliative care, which may be a barrier to ensuring that the palliative care needs of their patients are identified and met in a timely fashion. When physicians discuss end-of-life concerns proactively, many patients choose more comfort-focused care and receive care more aligned with their values and goals. This article defines palliative care, describes how it differs from hospice, debunks some common myths associated with hospice and palliative care, and offers suggestions on how primary care providers can integrate palliative care into their practice.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CPR ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation ), EOL ( end of life ), HPM ( hospice and palliative medicine ), PCP ( primary care provider )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Target Audience:** The target audience for _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is primarily internal medicine physicians and other clinicians who wish to advance their current knowledge of clinical medicine and who wish to stay abreast of advances in medical research.\n\n【6】**Statement of Need:** General internists and primary care physicians must maintain an extensive knowledge base on a wide variety of topics covering all body systems as well as common and uncommon disorders. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ aims to leverage the expertise of its authors to help physicians understand best practices in diagnosis and management of conditions encountered in the clinical setting.\n\n【7】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【8】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .

Palliative care addresses symptoms directly to improve how the patient feels, regardless of the cause. As defined by the Center to Advance Palliative Care: Palliative care, also known as palliative medicine, is specialized medical care for people living with serious illness. It focuses on providing relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness—whatever the diagnosis. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the family.\n\n【28】Center to Advance Palliative Care. About palliative care. https://www.capc.org/about/palliative-care/ .

Nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers, chaplains, and pharmacists work alongside physicians to address psychosocial and spiritual concerns of patients and families in addition to physical symptoms. Symptom management, psychosocial-spiritual support, and facilitation of medical decision making are 3 key domains of palliative care. The Table describes common elements of palliative care in each of these domains. Even with tremendous growth in the past 2 decades, including recognition of hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) as an official subspecialty of the American Board of Medical Subspecialties and the American Osteopathic Association, there remains a shortage of HPM specialists, which is projected to increase as the population ages.\n\n【31】*   Lupu D.\n\n【32】American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine Workforce Task Force.

This lack of awareness creates an opportunity for clinicians to frame the benefits of palliative care for patients and their families. Yet the survey also found that most health care professionals erroneously equated palliative care with end-of-life (EOL) care. Clinicians who perceive palliative care as EOL care, or lack a clear understanding of its benefits, will miss critical opportunities to identify and address palliative care needs in their patients. Primary palliative care competencies for PCPs include (1) recognition of palliative care needs in patients, (2) prognostication, (3) advance care planning, (4) assessment and management of common symptoms in the seriously ill, (5) referral to specialty palliative, and (6) appropriate and timely referral to hospice.\n\n【54】Recognizing Palliative Care Needs in Primary Care Patients\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】Patients with a serious illness often experience substantial physical burden due to pain and symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and dyspnea. Anxiety and depression are also common after the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness. Any of these symptoms may alter a person's ability to fulfill roles critical to self-identity, such as athlete, caring spouse, or devoted parent. Through their longitudinal relationship, PCPs can help individuals explore these issues and find ways to adapt and prioritize in the face of a serious illness.\n\n【56】Many PCPs already engage in primary palliative care but may not recognize their actions as palliative care. Primary care providers commonly provide careful assessment of symptoms and recognition of how the symptoms affect that individual's quality of life. Many also routinely prescribe and titrate opioids for patients in pain.\n\n【57】*   Matlock D.D.\n\n【58】The pain pendulum swinging again.\n\n【59】无关删除-2_J Palliat Med._ 2015; 18 : 734-735\n\n【60】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【61】Primary care providers often focus on maximizing quality of life by helping patients and their families find value and meaning, particularly when a patient's time or function is limited. It is important to help PCPs gain insight into primary palliative care that they already provide, so they may disentangle palliative care and EOL care and integrate palliative care to meet the needs of their patients. Effective symptom management promotes a patient's ability to remain active in important activities and relationships. When appropriate, palliative care counseling by PCPs can extend to family caregivers during active caregiving and into bereavement.\n\n【62】Prognostication and Communication\n---------------------------------\n\n【63】Patients with a serious illness commonly face difficult medical choices.

A key challenge for PCPs is anticipating palliative care needs in patients before they are in medical crisis. Elderly patients and patients with multiple chronic conditions, but no clear life-threatening diagnosis, can rapidly deteriorate from being spry and independent into a state in which they are too compromised to participate meaningfully in medical decision making. Thus, heightened awareness of patient factors that predict a shortened survival or elevated risks of decline are key palliative care skills. Estimating prognosis is challenging even in illnesses with a defined trajectory, such as malignancy. However, online resources, such as www.ePrognosis.org , may help PCPs determine prognostic estimates, particularly for complex patients.\n\n【74】无关删除-2*   McClymont K.M.\n*   Lee S.J.\n*   Schonberg M.A.\n*   Widera E.\n*   Miao Y.\n*   Smith A.K.\n\n【75】Usefulness and effect of online prognostic calculators.\n\n【76】无关删除-2_J Am Geriatr Soc._ 2014; 62 : 2444-2445\n\n【77】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (12)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【78】PCPs could also adopt “the surprise question,” which is a simpler strategy to identify patients at high risk for mortality. Clinicians may ask themselves, “Would I be surprised if this patient died in the next year?” A “No” response to this question has been shown to be strongly associated with an increased likelihood of dying within the next year in various populations.\n\n【79】无关删除-2*   Moss A.H.\n*   Ganjoo J.\n*   Sharma S.\n*   et al.\n\n【80】Utility of the “surprise” question to identify dialysis patients with high mortality.\n\n【81】无关删除-2_Clin J Am Soc Nephrol._ 2008; 3 : 1379-1384\n\n【82】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (254)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【83】Advance Care Planning\n---------------------\n\n【84】As the medical professionals who know their patients best, PCPs are often uniquely suited to help elicit an individual's personal goals, establish priorities, and facilitate informed medical decisions that reflect the patient's values. Most PCPs believe that advance care planning is within their purview, but struggle to find adequate time during patient visits and address competing health conditions appropriately. In 2016, the Medicare program began reimbursing clinicians for counseling patients about advance care planning. This was an important step toward supporting clinicians for the considerable time it takes to have these crucial conversations. More deliberate prognostication efforts may help PCPs identify their patients for whom advance care planning is a priority.\n\n【85】Advance care planning includes encouraging patients to appoint a health care proxy or surrogate decision maker, facilitating discussions between the patient and their proxy about their wishes in the event of serious illness, and documenting these discussions. Importantly, most patients want information about prognosis in the setting of serious illness.\n\n【86】无关删除-2*   Hagerty R.G.\n*   Butow P.N.\n*   Ellis P.M.\n*   et al.\n\n【87】Communicating with realism and hope: incurable cancer patients' views on the disclosure of prognosis.\n\n【88】无关删除-2_J Clin Oncol._ 2005; 23 ( \\[published correction appears in J Clin Oncol. 2005;23(15):3652.

Primary care providers who take time to explore a patient's wishes in light of a life-threatening illness can profoundly influence decisions made and care received near the EOL. Patients who discuss EOL concerns with a physician earlier are more likely to take a comfort-focused approach to care at the EOL.\n\n【91】无关删除-2*   Wright A.A.\n*   Zhang B.\n*   Ray A.\n*   et al.\n\n【92】Associations between end-of-life discussions, patient mental health, medical care near death, and caregiver bereavement adjustment.\n\n【93】无关删除-2_JAMA._ 2008; 300 : 1665-1673\n\n【94】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2030)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【95】Patients who make their wishes known in advance are more likely to receive care aligned with their preferences.\n\n【96】无关删除-2*   Silveira M.J.\n*   Kim S.Y.\n*   Langa K.M.\n\n【97】Advance directives and outcomes of surrogate decision making before death.\n\n【98】无关删除-2_N Engl J Med._ 2010; 362 : 1211-1218\n\n【99】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (963)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【100】Advance care planning can also improve the mental health outcomes for their family caregivers.\n\n【101】无关删除-2*   Wright A.A.\n*   Zhang B.\n*   Ray A.\n*   et al.\n\n【102】Associations between end-of-life discussions, patient mental health, medical care near death, and caregiver bereavement adjustment.\n\n【103】无关删除-2_JAMA._ 2008; 300 : 1665-1673\n\n【104】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2030)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【105】无关删除-2*   Wright A.A.\n*   Keating N.L.\n*   Balboni T.A.\n*   Matulonis U.A.\n*   Block S.D.\n*   Prigerson H.G.\n\n【106】Place of death: correlations with quality of life of patients with cancer and predictors of bereaved caregivers' mental health.\n\n【107】无关删除-2_J Clin Oncol._ 2010; 28 : 4457-4464\n\n【108】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (586)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【109】When to Refer to Specialty Palliative Care\n------------------------------------------\n\n【110】There is no evidence to suggest that early integration of palliative care shortens survival.

Primary care providers may then opt to involve specialty palliative care in patients with refractory symptoms or for patients with anxiety, depression, or poor coping skills that might interfere with decision making.\n\n【154】Figure Palliative care—models of integration.\n\n【155】Adapted from _J Palliat Med_ .\n\n【156】无关删除-2*   Temel J.S.\n*   Greer J.A.\n*   Muzikansky A.\n*   et al.\n\n【157】Early palliative care for patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.\n\n【158】无关删除-2_N Engl J Med._ 2010; 363 : 733-742\n\n【159】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (5224)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【160】无关删除-2*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【161】Referring Patients to Hospice\n-----------------------------\n\n【162】Historically, the field of palliative care grew out of the hospice movement, shaping a public misconception that they are synonymous. However, the terms _palliative care_ and _hospice_ should never be used interchangeably. In the United States, hospice is a critical, focused component of palliative care, with specific eligibility requirements driven by the 1983 Medicare hospice benefit. Hospice is usually provided in the patient's home to allow them to die comfortably surrounded by loved ones. Although fewer than 25% of Americans die at home despite an overwhelming desire to do so, more than 75% of patients on hospice die at home.\n\n【163】National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization\n\n【164】http://www.allhealth.org/briefingmaterials/NHPCO-NHPCOsFactsandFigures-2005Findings-760.pdf\n\n【165】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【166】Thus, hospice is really _the_ service that allows patients to die at home, if they choose to do so.\n\n【167】What Hospice Services Provide\n-----------------------------\n\n【168】Hospice is a team-based approach to care. Typically hospice is provided by an interdisciplinary team comprising a nurse, social worker, home health aides, chaplain, volunteers, and hospice medical director. Hospice has 4 levels of care: routine home care, general inpatient care, continuous care, and respite care. Most hospice care (96%) is routine home care, delivered in the patient's residence to ensure comfort and avoid hospitalization.\n\n【169】http://www.nhpco.org/sites/default/files/public/Statistics\\_Research/Hospice\\_Levels\\_of\\_Care.pdf\n\n【170】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【171】Members of the team visit the patient's home to assess symptoms, adjust medications to alleviate or mitigate symptoms, and provide support to the patient and family. Hospice covers durable medical equipment, such as a hospital bed, commode, and supplemental oxygen provided in the home as well as the cost of all medications related to the hospice diagnosis, including schedule II opioid analgesics. Finally, patients on hospice may access a hospice provider, usually a nurse, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by phone. When phone guidance is insufficient, the hospice provider will come to the patient's home day or night. Reliable, easy access to an expert provider provides comfort and reassurance to family members, who provide the bulk of care to patients, while helping to avoid emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Occasionally, patients on hospice with complex symptoms, such as refractory pain or agitated delirium, do require hospital care. Such patients can remain on hospice under the general inpatient benefit at either an inpatient hospice facility (if available) or a hospital, in which the hospice team visits them daily and continues to manage their care along with the inpatient hospital team. In contrast, the continuous care hospice benefit provides between 8 and 24 hours of medical care, usually nursing care, in the patient's home. The continuous care benefit is typically used to manage a complicated symptom or to allow a patient to remain at home, during a symptom crisis, with ample medical support. The hospice benefit will also provide up to 5 consecutive days of respite care in a facility, often a skilled nursing facility, to relieve stress of family caregivers. In 2012, continuous care and respite care combined accounted for less than 1% of hospice care delivered in the United States.\n\n【172】http://www.nhpco.org/sites/default/files/public/Statistics\\_Research/Hospice\\_Levels\\_of\\_Care.pdf\n\n【173】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【174】When starting hospice, patients choose a primary physician, often their PCP, to oversee their medical care while on hospice. This physician receives updates and changes in the patient's status and gives orders for medications as needed. Many patients fear abandonment by their regular providers when hospice is mentioned. By reassuring their patients that they will remain the physician in charge of their care, PCPs can mitigate this concern. Moreover, able patients on hospice can continue to come in for clinic visits with their PCP and other providers if they desire. However, most hospice benefits do not cover hospitalization unless required for a patient's comfort. In general, hospitalization requires that patients disenroll from hospice and resume prior insurance. Approximately 3% to 6% of patients enrolled in hospice get hospitalized, and many of these patients go on to receive high-intensity care, which indeed may conflict with their preference for comfort measures.\n\n【175】无关删除-2*   Cintron A.\n*   Hamel M.B.\n*   Davis R.B.\n*   Burns R.B.\n*   Phillips R.S.\n*   McCarthy E.P.\n\n【176】Hospitalization of hospice patients with cancer.\n\n【177】无关删除-2_J Palliat Med._ 2003; 6 : 757-768\n\n【178】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (40)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【179】无关删除-2*   Wang S.Y.\n*   Aldridge M.D.\n*   Gross C.P.\n*   et al.\n\n【180】Transitions Between Healthcare Settings of Hospice Enrollees at the End of Life.\n\n【181】无关删除-2_J Am Geriatr Soc._ 2016; 64 : 314-322\n\n【182】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (45)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【183】Limitations of Hospice\n----------------------\n\n【184】To qualify for hospice care, a physician must certify that the patient is expected to die within the next 6 months, if the disease follows its natural course. Once enrolled in hospice, a physician or hospice nurse practitioner must have at least 1 face-to-face visit with the patient in each of the first two 90-day periods, which certifies that the patient continues to meet the prognostic criteria. Patients surviving longer than 6 months require recertification once every 60 days, also accomplished through a face-to-face visit.\n\n【185】*   Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Medicare Hospice Benefit Facts\n\n【186】https://www.cgsmedicare.com/hhh/education/materials/pdf/Medicare\\_Hospice\\_Benefit\\_Facts.pdf\n\n【187】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【188】Occasionally, patients recover unexpectedly and no longer qualify for hospice. Such patients, often dubbed “hospice graduates,” disenroll from hospice and resume their prior medical care. Patients often qualify for hospice before actually being referred. This is partially because physicians notoriously overestimate prognosis,\n\n【189】无关删除-2*   Christakis N.A.\n*   Lamont E.B.\n\n【190】Extent and determinants of error in doctors' prognoses in terminally ill patients: prospective cohort study.\n\n【191】无关删除-2_BMJ._ 2000; 320 : 469-472\n\n【192】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【193】but is also related to readiness of patients and their families to accept hospice. Primary care providers engaged in primary palliative care may help prepare patients and their families for an earlier transition to hospice.\n\n【194】The other major distinction in hospice care is that because of the reimbursement structure, hospice is required only to provide comfort-focused care related to the hospice diagnosis. The Medicare hospice benefit requires patients to forgo treatments aimed at curing their terminal diagnosis. Thus, many hospices will not accept patients receiving disease-directed care (eg, chemotherapy for cancer) because they will not be reimbursed for these therapies, even when the intent is palliative. Such treatments can delay referral to hospice while perpetuating the misconception that hospice is only for the final days of life. Some “open access” hospices allow patients to continue on disease-directed therapy, but this is negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Although receipt of hospice care has increased in recent years, the proportion of patients enrolling within 7 days has also increased.\n\n【195】无关删除-2*   Teno J.M.\n*   Gozalo P.L.\n*   Bynum J.P.\n*   et al.\n\n【196】Change in end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries: site of death, place of care, and health care transitions in 2000, 2005, and 2009.\n\n【197】无关删除-2_JAMA._ 2013; 309 : 470-477\n\n【198】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (771)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【199】Such late enrollment in hospice deprives patients and families of the chance to derive optimal benefits from hospice services\n\n【200】无关删除-2*   Bradley E.H.\n*   Prigerson H.\n*   Carlson M.D.\n*   Cherlin E.\n*   Johnson-Hurzeler R.\n*   Kasl S.V.\n\n【201】Depression among surviving caregivers: does length of hospice enrollment matter?.\n\n【202】无关删除-2_Am J Psychiatry._ 2004; 161 : 2257-2262\n\n【203】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (118)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【204】; timely referral to hospice is key to ensuring patients and families can take advantage of hospice benefits.\n\n【205】Overcoming Barriers to Hospice Use\n----------------------------------\n\n【206】Even among patients and health care professionals who understand the value of hospice, many still equate hospice to “giving up” and/or agreeing to shorten one's life. Reframing hospice as a choice to focus on _how_ one lives rather than _how long_ one lives sometimes can help patients and families accept hospice. Interestingly, care focused on comfort and quality may allow patients to live both better and perhaps a little longer.\n\n【207】无关删除-2*   Connor S.R.\n*   Pyenson B.\n*   Fitch K.\n*   Spence C.\n*   Iwasaki K.\n\n【208】Comparing hospice and nonhospice patient survival among patients who die within a three-year window.\n\n【209】无关删除-2_J Pain Symptom Manage._ 2007; 33 : 238-246\n\n【210】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (346)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【211】When choosing hospice, most patients will also choose to forgo attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but a do-not-resuscitate order is not required. Patients who wish for comfort-focused care but, for some reason, still want the option for attempted resuscitation can be enrolled in hospice. The hospice team will continue to address the issue of code status with the patient and family.

The medical community is recognizing the importance of prioritizing medical treatments that promote quality of life along with interventions primarily aimed at prolonging survival. The expansion of primary palliative care delivered by PCPs will greatly promote symptom management and quality of life for patients throughout the course of a life-threatening illness, not just at the end. The development of new models of integrated palliative care will allow patients and families to consider their own personal goals and quality of life when making choices about the direction of their medical care. When attuned to patients' personal values, primary care providers can help individuals find meaning and joy when living with limited function and/or shortened life expectancy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Their clinical features and in-hospital events were compared with patients who had painful AAD (group 2).\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of the 977 patients in the database, 63 (6.4%) had painless AAD, and 914 (93.6%) had painful AAD. Patients in group 1 were older than those in group 2 (mean ± SD age, 66.6±13.3 vs 61.9±14.1 years; _P_ \\=.01). Type A dissection (involving the ascending aorta or the arch) was more frequent in group 1 (74.6% vs 60.9%; _P_ \\=.03). Syncope (33.9% vs 11.7%; _P_ <.001), congestive heart failure (19.7% vs 3.9%; _P_ <.001), and stroke (11.3% vs 4.7%; _P_ \\=.03) were more frequent presenting signs in group 1.

The major concern of the prisoners is that the staff could fail to ensure that they have received adequate anesthesia during the procedure, particularly during administration of the muscle-paralyzing drug pancuronium and the heart-arresting drug potassium chloride. The thought of being chemically entombed and unable to breathe or cry out is terrifying, and prisoners are aware that a death by concentrated intravenous potassium would be extremely painful (for reasons described below). Having discussed the issue at length with men on death row, I am impressed by their acceptance of the fact of their execution. At the same time, they express intense anxiety about the effects of pancuronium and potassium, and this is why they are asking the courts to either discontinue the use of these 2 drugs or provide properly qualified and equipped practitioners at the bedside to ensure that adequate anesthetic depth is established and maintained. Prisoners are aware that the veterinarian euthanasia laws of most states\n\n【24】Fla Stat §828.01-828.29. Animals: Cruelty; Sales; Animal Enterprise Protection.

They also know that potassium can be used only when an experienced veterinarian is at the bedside providing anesthesia.\n\n【28】*   American Veterinary Medical Association\n\n【29】AVMA guidelines on euthanasia: formerly report of the AVMA panel on euthanasia.\n\n【30】http://www.avma.org/issues/animal\\_welfare/euthanasia.pdf\n\n【31】Date: June 2007\n\n【32】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【33】The truth is that the litigation introduced by prisoners would end immediately if Department of Corrections would agree to meet modern guidelines for “putting a dog to sleep.”\n\n【34】What the courts have been uncovering during the past several years of litigation is that lethal injection is concurrently both a medical procedure and a nonmedical procedure. This view has emerged from review of mountains of documentation and data, including inspections by the courts of lethal injection chambers; review of execution logs, autopsy reports, electrocardiogram and brain electrophysiology tracings, photographs, and video recordings; and review of sworn testimony of physicians, nurses, emergency responders, physician assistants, and lay correctional officers who perform lethal injection.\n\n【35】During litigation, it has been helpful to the discourse to divide the process of lethal injection into 4 steps or phases:\n\n【36】Step 1: venous access\n\n【37】Step 2: induction and subsequent maintenance of general anesthesia achieved with thiopental\n\n【38】Step 3: “cosmetic” paralysis achieved with pancuronium\n\n【39】Step 4: execution achieved with potassium\n\n【40】It is also useful to identify the goals set forth by the Department of Corrections and to divide them into primary (labeled 1 and A because of their equal importance) and subordinate classes. Primary goals are goal 1, death, and goal A, noncruelty. Subordinate goals are (1) avoiding unpleasant visual experiences for observers and staff, (2) rapidity, (3) preservation of staff anonymity, and (4) minimized psychological stress on staff.\n\n【41】Why are courts concluding that this is a useful way to view executions?\n\n【42】We first need to look at step 4 and the assertion that lethal injection constitutes execution by potassium. Thiopental and pancuronium cause death by asphyxia, a slow process that does not comport with goal 2, rapidity. Because of this, the medical examiner who created lethal injection added potassium to speed the process.\n\n【43】*   Denno DW\n\n【44】The lethal injection quandary: how medicine has dismantled the death penalty.\n\n【45】无关删除-2_Fordham Law Review._ 2007; 76 ( Accessed November 5, 2007. ) : 49-128\n\n【46】http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=983732\n\n【47】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【48】Electrocardiographic records from multiple executions demonstrate exactly the sequence of events that would be predicted by the administration of the 3 drugs: essentially normal cardiac electrical activity until the potassium is administered and flows to the heart, at which point there is rapid degeneration to asystole. The prisoner is alive throughout the administration of thiopental and pancuronium and is killed by the potassium. Courts, and expert witnesses from both sides, agree that this is how the process unfolds and that lethal injection as currently structured is execution by potassium.\n\n【49】This finding is important because intravenous injection of the concentrated potassium alone would undisputedly violate goal A in that it would be extremely painful. Concentrated potassium solutions strongly depolarize electrically active cells, including peripheral venous nociceptive fibers, and could also cause intrathoracic pain as the solution courses through the heart and lungs to reach the coronary arteries. Therefore, for the overall process to be humane, some preventive measure needs to be reliably undertaken, and this is the reason for step 2, the induction of anesthesia.\n\n【50】The biologic effects of concentrated intravenous potassium in humans have not been scientifically studied. Case reports of accidental injection of high-dose potassium consistently describe severe pain on injection followed by cardiovascular collapse.\n\n【51】*   Pucino F\n*   Danielson BD\n*   Carlson JD\n*   et al.\n\n【52】Patient tolerance to intravenous potassium chloride with and without lidocaine.\n\n【53】无关删除-2_Drug Intell Clin Pharm._ 1988; 22 : 676-679\n\n【54】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【55】*   Goder R\n*   Habler HJ\n*   Janig W\n*   Michaelis M\n\n【56】Receptive properties of afferent nerve fibres associated with rat saphenous vein.\n\n【57】无关删除-2_Neurosci Lett._ 1993; 164 : 175-178\n\n【58】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (17)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【59】Additionally, Department of Corrections and its experts have expressed concern that potassium might produce muscle contractions that could disturb witnesses and correctional officers and could lead to the false conclusion that the prisoner was suffering. This is the justification given by the prisons for the inclusion of step 3, the induction of cosmetic paralysis by pancuronium.\n\n【60】This brings us to step 2, the administration of thiopental. For execution by potassium to be humane, the human central nervous system must be placed in a state such that the prisoner is insensitive to the extreme pain that would necessarily be experienced if he or she were conscious. Although it is concerning to many anesthesiologists, and indeed offensive to some, that the term _general anesthesia_ is applied to the situation, there simply is no other term that can honestly be used to describe the administration of an intravenous anesthetic drug (thiopental in this case) for the purpose of preventing the experience of anticipated severe pain. Veterinarians clearly articulate the need for a “surgical plane of anesthesia” when potassium is used for animal euthanasia and emphasize the “utmost importance that personnel performing this technique be trained and knowledgeable in anesthetic techniques, and are competent in assessing anesthetic depth.”\n\n【61】*   American Veterinary Medical Association\n\n【62】AVMA guidelines on euthanasia: formerly report of the AVMA panel on euthanasia.\n\n【63】http://www.avma.org/issues/animal\\_welfare/euthanasia.pdf\n\n【64】Date: June 2007\n\n【65】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【66】If thiopental were the only drug being administered, it would not be serving an anesthetic function; instead, it would be functioning to cause death by apnea. However, as currently used, thiopental does not produce death by apnea because it does not produce death; death is caused by potassium.\n\n【67】Administration of general anesthesia, including the induction, maintenance, and continued assessment of anesthetic depth, is done to prevent severe pain; it is a therapeutic procedure and a medical procedure. In contrast, administration of pancuronium to produce cosmetic paralysis and administration of potassium to produce cardiac arrest are not performed with therapeutic intent, and they are not medical procedures. Thus, lethal injection, which is a compilation of multiple steps, is concurrently both a medical and a nonmedical procedure.\n\n【68】What about step 1, the establishment of intravenous access? This is the issue that first brought lethal injection before the US Supreme Court, when a prisoner contested the warden's plan to perform a cutdown procedure, possibly on the day before the execution.\n\n【69】_Nelson v Campbell_ , Commissioner, Alabama Department of Corrections, et al.

Therefore, it must meet a standard necessary to reliably deliver the death-producing drug potassium and at the same time must meet the standard used during clinical provision of general anesthesia. Although I am not sure how to categorize perfectly the intravenous access phase of lethal injection, I think that it is best described as both a medical and a nonmedical procedure.\n\n【73】One of the health care practitioners, possibly the physician, who presided over the botched execution of Angel Diaz in Florida, testified before the Governor's Committee on the Administration of Lethal Injection, There is nothing medical about the event. From this point onward it is NOT a medical procedure. There is nothing medical about it nor to equate to it. An execution has absolutely nothing even remotely connected to medicine. The medical argument in the debate is false when comparing executions with what's done in clinical settings. From that point onward the condemned inmate will not leave the death chamber alive. The event is done as simply as possible to avoid technical problems. It is also done as expeditiously as possible, and as humanely as can be done under the circumstances.\n\n【74】*   The Florida Governor's Commission on the Administration of Lethal Injection\n\n【75】The Florida Governor's Commission on the Administration of Lethal Injection met again February 19, 2007 \\[transcript\\].\n\n【76】http://lethal-injection-florida.blogspot.com/2007/02/transcript-florida-governors-commission.html\n\n【77】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【78】During Mr Diaz's execution, both catheters were improperly positioned in extravascular locations in the soft tissues of his arms, and none of the administered drugs were delivered into the circulation.

If the second intravenous catheter had been functioning properly, Diaz's execution would have appeared serene and humane: pancuronium both produces and conceals excruciating torment. However, Diaz slowly died of the gradual absorption of infiltrated thiopental, pancuronium, and potassium.

They were randomized to receive BB (BB: 13 patients) or β-blockade and losartan (BB-L: 15 patients) for 35 months.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In the BB-L group, aortic root dilation was reduced with treatment, and the annual dilation rate of the aortic root was significantly lower than that of the BB group (0.10 mm/yr vs 0.89 mm/yr; _P_ \\=.02). The absolute aortic diameters at the sinus of Valsalva, annulus, and sinotubular junction showed similar trends, with a reduced rate of dilation in the BB-L group ( _P_ \\=.02, _P_ \\=.03, and _P_ \\=.03, respectively).

The disease occurs when narrowed arteries reduce the blood flow to the arms and legs. PAD can cause leg pain when walking. PAD also increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\n【2】The ankle-brachial index test compares the blood pressure measured at the ankle with the blood pressure measured at the arm. A low ankle-brachial index number can indicate narrowing or blockage of the arteries in the legs.\n\n【3】Ankle-brachial index testing might be done before and right after walking on a treadmill. This is called an exercise ankle-brachial index test. It can find out how badly the arteries are narrowed walking.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】The ankle-brachial index test is done to check for PAD — narrowed arteries that reduce blood flow, usually in the legs.\n\n【6】An ankle-brachial index test might be useful for people who have leg pain while walking. The test also can be useful for people who have risk factors for PAD.\n\n【7】Risk factors for PAD include:\n\n【8】*   History of tobacco use\n*   Diabetes\n*   High blood pressure\n*   High cholesterol\n*   Restricted blood flow (atherosclerosis) in other parts of the body\n\n【9】Risks\n-----\n\n【10】The blood pressure cuffs might cause pain on the arm and leg while they inflate. But this discomfort is temporary and should stop when the air is released from the cuff.\n\n【11】Severe leg pain might require a different imaging test of the arteries in the legs.\n\n【12】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【13】No special preparations are needed for an ankle-brachial index test. The test is painless and similar to having blood pressure taken in a routine medical visit. Wear loose, comfortable clothing. This allows the provider doing the ankle-brachial index test to easily place a blood pressure cuff on an ankle and upper arm.\n\n【14】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【15】### During the procedure\n\n【16】You likely will be asked to rest for 5 to 30 minutes before the test.\n\n【17】Typically, you lie on a table on your back. A care provider measures your blood pressure in both arms and both ankles. This is done using an inflatable cuff and a hand-held ultrasound device that's pressed on the skin. The device uses sound waves to produce images and allows the pulse in the ankle arteries to be heard after the cuff is deflated.\n\n【18】### After the procedure\n\n【19】The ankle-brachial index test should take only a few minutes. No special precautions are needed afterward. Your health care provider will discuss your test result with you.\n\n【20】Results\n-------\n\n【21】The blood pressure measurements from the arms and ankles are used to determine the ankle-brachial index. The index is a ratio of the two measurements.\n\n【22】Based on the number calculated, your ankle-brachial index may show you have:\n\n【23】*   **No blockage (1.0 to 1.4).** An ankle-brachial index number in this range suggests that you probably don't have PAD. But if you have symptoms of PAD, you might have an exercise ankle-brachial index test.\n*   **Borderline blockage (0.90 to 0.99).** An ankle-brachial index number in this range indicates borderline PAD. You might have an exercise ankle-brachial index test.\n*   **PAD (less than 0.90).** An ankle-brachial index number in this range indicates a diagnosis of PAD. You might have more testing, such as ultrasound or angiography, to view the arteries in your legs.\n\n【24】People with hard-to-control or long-standing diabetes or significantly blocked arteries might need to have a blood pressure reading at the big toe (toe-brachial index) to get an accurate test result.\n\n【25】Depending on the severity of the blockage, treatment might involve:\n\n【26】*   Lifestyle changes\n*   Medication\n*   Surgery to treat PAD\n\n【27】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Benign enlargement of the prostate is a problem that can occur in men as they get older. The prostate gland is located below the bladder. As the prostate gland gets larger, certain muscles in the gland may become tight and get in the way of the tube that drains urine from the bladder. This can cause problems in urinating, such as a need to urinate often, a weak stream when urinating, or a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely.\n\n【6】Silodosin helps relax the muscles in the prostate and in the opening to the bladder. This may help increase the flow of urine or decrease the symptoms.\n\n【7】This medicine is usually given only to men.

This breast lump is not cancer. A fibroadenoma happens most often between ages 15 and 35. But it can be found at any age in anyone who has periods.\n\n【2】A fibroadenoma often causes no pain. It can feel firm, smooth and rubbery. It has a round shape. It might feel like a pea in the breast. Or it may feel flat like a coin. When touched, it moves easily within the breast tissue.\n\n【3】Fibroadenomas are common breast lumps. If you have a fibroadenoma, your health care provider may tell you to watch for changes in its size or feel. You may need a biopsy to check the lump or surgery to remove it. Many fibroadenomas need no further treatment.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】A fibroadenoma is a solid breast lump that often causes no pain. It is:\n\n【6】*   Round with distinct, smooth borders\n*   Easily moved\n*   Firm or rubbery\n\n【7】A fibroadenoma often grows slowly. The average size is about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters). A fibroadenoma can get bigger over time. It may be tender or cause soreness a few days before your period. A large fibroadenoma may hurt when you touch it. But most often, this type of breast lump causes no pain.\n\n【8】You can have a single fibroadenoma or more than one fibroadenoma. They can occur in one or both breasts.\n\n【9】Some fibroadenomas shrink over time. Most fibroadenomas in adolescents shrink over many months to a few years. They then disappear. Fibroadenomas may also change shape over time.\n\n【10】Fibroadenomas may get bigger during pregnancy. They might shrink after menopause.\n\n【11】### When to see a doctor\n\n【12】Healthy breast tissue often feels lumpy. Make an appointment with your health care provider if you:\n\n【13】*   Find a new breast lump\n*   Notice other changes in your breasts\n*   Find that a breast lump you had checked in the past has grown or changed in any way\n\n【14】Causes\n------\n\n【15】The cause of fibroadenomas is not known. They might be related to hormones that control your periods.\n\n【16】Less common types of fibroadenomas and related breast lumps may not act the same as typical fibroadenomas. These types of breast lumps include:\n\n【17】*   **Complex fibroadenomas.** These are fibroadenomas that can get bigger over time. They can press on or displace nearby breast tissue.\n*   **Giant fibroadenomas.** Giant fibroadenomas grow quickly to larger than 2 inches (5 centimeters). They also can press on nearby breast tissue or push it out of place.\n*   **Phyllodes tumors.** Phyllodes tumors and fibroadenomas are made of similar tissues. But under a microscope, phyllodes tumors look different from fibroadenomas. Phyllodes tumors typically have features associated with growing faster. Most phyllodes tumors are benign. This means they are not cancer. But some phyllodes tumors may be cancer. Or they could become cancer. Phyllodes tumors often cause no pain.\n\n【18】Complications\n-------------\n\n【19】Common fibroadenomas do not affect your risk of breast cancer. But your risk might go up a bit if you have a complex fibroadenoma or a phyllodes tumor.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

During colposcopy, your doctor uses a special instrument called a colposcope.\n\n【2】Your doctor may recommend colposcopy if your Pap test result is abnormal. If your doctor finds an unusual area of cells during your colposcopy procedure, a sample of tissue can be collected for laboratory testing (biopsy).\n\n【3】You may experience anxiety before your colposcopy exam. Knowing what to expect during your colposcopy may help you feel more comfortable.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Your doctor may recommend colposcopy if a Pap test or pelvic exam revealed abnormalities.\n\n【6】Colposcopy can be used to diagnose:\n\n【7】*   Genital warts\n*   Inflammation of the cervix (cervicitis)\n*   Precancerous changes in the tissue of the cervix\n*   Precancerous changes in the tissue of the vagina\n*   Precancerous changes of the vulva\n\n【8】Risks\n-----\n\n【9】Colposcopy is a safe procedure that carries very few risks. Rarely, complications from biopsies taken during colposcopy can occur, including:\n\n【10】*   Heavy bleeding\n*   Infection\n*   Pelvic pain\n\n【11】### When to call your doctor\n\n【12】Signs and symptoms that may indicate complications include:\n\n【13】*   Bleeding that is heavier than what you typically experience during your period\n*   Chills\n*   Fever\n*   Severe abdominal pain\n\n【14】无关删除-1Call your doctor if you experience any of these signs and symptoms after your colposcopy.\n\n【15】无关删除-1How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【16】无关删除-1To prepare for your colposcopy, your doctor may recommend that you:\n\n【17】无关删除-1*   Avoid scheduling your colposcopy during your period\n*   Don't have vaginal intercourse the day or two before your colposcopy\n*   Don't use tampons the day or two before your colposcopy\n*   Don't use vaginal medications for the two days before your colposcopy\n*   Take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), before going to your colposcopy appointment\n\n【18】无关删除-1### Coping with anxiety before your colposcopy\n\n【19】无关删除-1You may experience anxiety as you wait for your colposcopy exam. Anxiety can make you feel generally uncomfortable.

For instance:\n\n【22】无关删除-1*   Ask your doctor for brochures or pamphlets about colposcopy and what you can expect.\n*   Write down any questions or concerns you have about the procedure, and ask your doctor to review them with you before your colposcopy begins.\n*   Find activities that help you relax, such as exercise, meditation, and being with friends and family.\n*   Ask your doctor if it's OK if you listen to music quietly during the exam.\n\n【23】无关删除-1What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【24】无关删除-1### During the colposcopy\n\n【25】无关删除-1Colposcopy is usually done in a doctor's office, and the procedure typically takes 10 to 20 minutes. You'll lie on your back on a table with your feet in supports, just as during a pelvic exam or Pap test.\n\n【26】无关删除-1The doctor places a metal speculum in your vagina. The speculum holds open the walls of your vagina so that your doctor can see your cervix.\n\n【27】无关删除-1Your doctor positions the special magnifying instrument, called a colposcope, a few inches away from your vulva. Your doctor then shines a bright light into your vagina and looks through the lens of the colposcope, as if using binoculars.\n\n【28】无关删除-1Your cervix and vagina are swabbed with cotton to clear away any mucus. Your doctor may apply a solution of vinegar or another type of solution to the area. This may cause a burning or tingling sensation. The solution helps highlight any areas of suspicious cells.\n\n【29】无关删除-1### During the biopsy\n\n【30】无关删除-1If your doctor finds a suspicious area, a small sample of tissue may be collected for laboratory testing. To collect the tissue, your doctor uses a sharp biopsy instrument to remove a small piece of tissue. If there are multiple suspicious areas, your doctor may take multiple biopsy samples.\n\n【31】无关删除-1Your doctor may apply a chemical solution to the biopsy area to limit bleeding.\n\n【32】无关删除-1### After the colposcopy\n\n【33】无关删除-1If your doctor didn't take a biopsy sample during your colposcopy, you won't have any restrictions on your activity once your exam is complete. You may experience some spotting or very light bleeding from your vagina in the next day or two.\n\n【34】无关删除-1If you had a biopsy sample taken during your colposcopy, you may experience:\n\n【35】无关删除-1*   Vaginal or vulvar pain that lasts one or two days\n*   Light bleeding from your vagina that lasts a few days\n*   A dark discharge from your vagina\n\n【36】无关删除-1Use a pad to catch any blood or discharge.

This review identified 38 patients previously treated with venlafaxine immediate release or extended release and subsequently genotyped for the _2D6_ gene with a commercial genotyping assay. Their dosage was examined along with their _2D6_ genotype to determine whether the presence or absence of a fully functioning _2D6_ allele was associated with their venlafaxine dosage.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of the 38 patients, 5 had a _2D6_ genotype that consisted of 1 inactive allele and 1 allele associated with decreased activity. None of these 5 patients were able to tolerate treatment with more than 75 mg/d of venlafaxine. The remaining 33 patients had at least 1 fully active _2D6_ allele, 26 of whom had been able to tolerate treatment with 150 mg/d or more of venlafaxine ( _P_ <.002).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Genetic variations of the P450 _2D6_ gene may contribute to patient-specific variation in response to treatment with venlafaxine. Physicians should be alert to the possibility that an adverse reaction may indicate a slow metabolizer and consider genotyping such patients.\n\n【8】CYP2D6 ( cytochrome P450 2D6 ), ER ( extended release ), IR ( immediate release )\n\n【9】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【13】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【15】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

This ANCOVA approach was prospectively chosen because it was thought to be the most sensitive method available to detect a difference, and the study was powered assuming this method of analysis.\n\n【6】The letter from Dr Rackley and colleagues questions the appropriateness of this approach and advances a number of arguments to support their position. They initially point out that “the 95% CIs for the 2 study measures overlap.” This is true but has nothing to do with the choice of ANCOVA as an analysis tool; rather it is a function of the way CIs are constructed.\n\n【7】*   Steel RGD\n*   Torrie JH\n\n【8】无关删除-2Principles and Procedures of Statistics.

Therefore, in the region where 1.41D < mean difference <2D, the 2 mean CIs overlap, and yet there is a statistically significant difference in the treatment means. An example may illustrate this. If D is 1.0, the lower treatment mean is 2.0, and the upper treatment mean is 3.9, then the mean difference is 1.9, and the 95% CIs are 1.0 to 3.0 for the lower mean, 2.9 to 4.9 for the upper mean, and 0.49 to 3.31 for the mean difference. In general, although the size of this region varies depending on the statistical test, different numbers of patients in the treatment groups, and different assumptions in calculating sample variances, there should be a region in which the CIs of the means overlap, and the CI for the difference of the means does not cross zero.\n\n【18】The above phenomenon occurred in the statistical analysis of the OBJECT study data. With a _P_ value near .05, it is not unusual for this phenomenon to occur in the presence of a statistically significant difference in the means. In the interest of saving space, the 95% CIs of the treatment differences were not included. If the CIs had been included, they would have shown that the intervals all stayed on 1 side of the zero line, indicating statistical significance.\n\n【19】Rackley et al then compute Student _t_ tests and show the results are not statistically significant. As the study was originally conducted, this type of statistical analysis is a less sensitive measure than the ANCOVA performed. If a _t_ test had been prospectively defined as a primary efficacy analysis, a larger sample size would have been chosen.\n\n【20】Finally, Rackley et al have suggested that outliers skewed the results and that the statistical approach used by Van Kerrebroeck et al\n\n【21】*   Van Kerrebroeck P\n*   Kreder K\n*   Jonas U\n*   Zinner N\n*   Wein A\n*   Tolterodine Study Group\n\n【22】Tolterodine once-daily: superior efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of the overactive bladder.\n\n【23】无关删除-2_Urology._ 2001; 57 : 414-421\n\n【24】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (411)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【25】is more appropriate. The article by Van Kerrebroeck et al was a post hoc analysis of the data from the pivotal trial for extended-release tolterodine. The original intent of that study was to compare the mean values for tolterodine and extended-release tolterodine with placebo; it was not a comparison between 2 active-drug arms. These data were first presented as mean data for all end points, including reductions in urge incontinence, and the results demonstrated mean reductions of 46% and 53% for tolterodine and extended-release tolterodine, respectively, with no statistical significance between the 2 groups. However, the conclusions presented in the article by Van Kerrebroeck et al for this study end point were based on the median values. In planning the OBJECT trial, we examined use of this approach. Applying this approach to previously conducted extended-release oxybutynin trials yielded median reductions in urge incontinence episodes from 96% to 100%. Therefore, we decided not to use this approach in the OBJECT trial because of the real risk of reporting potentially misleading and artificially favorable results. Interestingly, the Food and Drug Administration took the same position, and the information in the package insert of extended-release tolterodine is restricted to the presentation of mean reduction of incontinence episodes. As reported in our article, the study inclusion criteria capped the number of allowable baseline episodes to address the issue of outliers.\n\n【26】We believe that the OBJECT study provides clinicians with the most meaningful comparison of the 2 most commonly used agents for overactive bladder, and the analysis was conducted using the most appropriate statistical analysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Symptoms may return years after a congenital heart defect is treated.\n\n【7】Common congenital heart disease symptoms in adults include:\n\n【8】*   Irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\n*   Blue skin, lips and fingernails (cyanosis)\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Feeling tired very quickly with activity\n*   Swelling of body tissue or organs (edema)\n\n【9】### When to see a doctor\n\n【10】If you're having worrisome symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, seek emergency medical attention.\n\n【11】If you have signs or symptoms of congenital heart disease or were treated for a congenital heart defect as a child, make an appointment to see your health care provider.\n\n【12】Causes\n------\n\n【13】Researchers aren't sure what causes most types of congenital heart disease. Some congenital heart diseases are passed down through families (inherited).\n\n【14】To understand congenital heart disease, it helps to know how the heart typically works.\n\n【15】*   The heart is divided into chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).\n*   The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through blood vessels (pulmonary arteries).\n*   In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and then returns to the left side of your heart through the pulmonary veins.\n*   The left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the aorta and out to the rest of the body.\n\n【16】Congenital heart disease can affect any of these heart structures, including the arteries, valves, chambers and the wall of tissue that separates the chambers (septum).\n\n【17】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【18】Certain environmental and genetic risk factors might play a role in the development of congenital heart disease, including:\n\n【19】*   **Genetics.** Congenital heart disease appears to run in families (inherited). It's associated with many genetic syndromes. For instance, children with Down syndrome often have congenital heart defects. Genetic testing can detect Down syndrome and some other genetic conditions while a baby is still in the mother's womb.\n*   **German measles (rubella).** Having rubella during pregnancy may affect how the baby's heart develops while in the womb.\n*   **Diabetes.** Having type 1 or type 2 diabetes during pregnancy also may affect a baby's heart development. Gestational diabetes generally doesn't increase the risk of congenital heart disease.\n*   **Medications.** Taking certain medications while pregnant can cause congenital heart disease and other birth defects. Medications linked to heart defects include lithium for bipolar disorder and isotretinoin (Claravis, Myorisan, others), which is used to treat acne. Always tell your health care provider about the medications you take.\n*   **Alcohol.** Drinking alcohol while pregnant has been linked to an increased risk of heart defects in the baby.\n*   **Smoking.** If you smoke, quit. Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital heart defects in the baby.\n\n【20】Complications\n-------------\n\n【21】Congenital heart disease can contribute to other health concerns later in life. Complications may occur years after a congenital heart defect is treated.\n\n【22】Complications of congenital heart disease in adults include:\n\n【23】*   **Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias).** Faulty heart signaling causes the heart to beat too fast, too slowly or irregularly. In some people, severe arrhythmias may cause stroke or sudden cardiac death if not treated. Scar tissue in the heart from previous surgeries can contribute to this complication.\n*   **Heart infection (endocarditis).** Bacteria or other germs can enter the bloodstream and move to the inner lining of the heart (endocardium). Untreated, this infection can damage or destroy the heart valves or cause a stroke. If you are at high risk of endocarditis, your care provider may recommend taking antibiotics one hour before dental cleanings. Regular dental checkups are important. Healthy gums and teeth reduce the risk that bacteria will enter the bloodstream.\n*   **Stroke.** A congenital heart defect can allow a blood clot to pass through the heart and travel to the brain, where it reduces or blocks blood supply.\n*   **High blood pressure in the lung arteries (pulmonary hypertension).** Some congenital heart defects send more blood to the lungs, causing pressure to build. This eventually causes the heart muscle to weaken and sometimes to fail.\n*   **Heart failure.** Heart failure (congestive heart failure) means the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\n【24】### Adult congenital heart disease and pregnancy\n\n【25】It may be possible to have a successful pregnancy with mild congenital heart disease. A care provider may tell you not to get pregnant if you have a complex congenital heart defect.\n\n【26】Before becoming pregnant, talk to your health care provider about the possible risks and complications. Together you can discuss and plan for any special care needed during pregnancy.\n\n【27】Prevention\n----------\n\n【28】Some types of congenital heart disease occur in families (inherited). If you have or someone in your family has congenital heart disease, screening by a genetic counselor may help determine the risk of certain heart defects in future children.\n\n【29】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Complete clinical data, radiologic studies (chest radiographs and computed tomographic scans), and histopathologic features were assessed to investigate clinical manifestations and predisposing factors related to bronchopulmonary actinomycosis.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】The series consisted of 6 men and 4 women, with a mean age of 63.5 years; 8 of the patients were smokers. Cough and fever were the most common symptoms. Chest imaging showed mass-like consolidation in 4 patients, bronchial thickening or lung atelectasis with pleural thickening in 2 patients each, and perihilar irregular mass or multiple bilateral nodules in 1 patient each. Primary or metastatic lung cancer was suspected clinically in 8 of the 10 patients. Foreign body-related endobronchial actinomycosis was diagnosed in 6 patients, 5 of whom had HH; only 1 had gastroesophageal reflux-related symptoms. Because of bronchial obstruction, rigid bronchoscopy was performed in 3 patients, lobectomy in 2, and atypical resection in 1. Antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin was given to all patients, with resolution of actinomycosis.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Bronchopulmonary actinomycosis is a rare condition that mimics pulmonary malignancy on clinical and radiologic grounds. Diagnosis relies on an accurate patient history and histopathologic examination. Although further confirmation is required, esophageal HH appears to be a potential predisposing factor.\n\n【8】CT ( computed tomography ), GERD ( gastroesophageal reflux disease ), HH ( hiatal hernia )\n\n【9】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【13】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【15】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

The uterus is the hollow, pear-shaped pelvic organ where fetal development occurs.\n\n【2】Endometrial cancer begins in the layer of cells that form the lining (endometrium) of the uterus. Endometrial cancer is sometimes called uterine cancer. Other types of cancer can form in the uterus, including uterine sarcoma, but they are much less common than endometrial cancer.\n\n【3】Endometrial cancer is often detected at an early stage because it frequently produces abnormal vaginal bleeding. If endometrial cancer is discovered early, removing the uterus surgically often cures endometrial cancer.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Signs and symptoms of endometrial cancer may include:\n\n【6】*   Vaginal bleeding after menopause\n*   Bleeding between periods\n*   Pelvic pain\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Doctors don't know what causes endometrial cancer. What's known is that something occurs to create changes (mutations) in the DNA of cells in the endometrium — the lining of the uterus.\n\n【11】The mutation turns normal, healthy cells into abnormal cells. Healthy cells grow and multiply at a set rate, eventually dying at a set time. Abnormal cells grow and multiply out of control, and they don't die at a set time. The accumulating abnormal cells form a mass (tumor). Cancer cells invade nearby tissues and can separate from an initial tumor to spread elsewhere in the body (metastasize).\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】Factors that increase the risk of endometrial cancer include:\n\n【14】*   **Changes in the balance of female hormones in the body.** The ovaries make two main female hormones — estrogen and progesterone. Fluctuations in the balance of these hormones cause changes in the endometrium.\n\n【15】    A disease or condition that increases the amount of estrogen, but not the level of progesterone, in your body can increase your risk of endometrial cancer. Examples include irregular ovulation patterns, which might happen in polycystic ovary syndrome, obesity and diabetes. Taking hormones after menopause that contain estrogen but not progesterone increases the risk of endometrial cancer.\n\n【16】    A rare type of ovarian tumor that secretes estrogen also can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\n\n【17】*   **More years of menstruation.** Starting menstruation at an early age — before age 12 — or beginning menopause later increases the risk of endometrial cancer. The more periods you've had, the more exposure your endometrium has had to estrogen.\n*   **Never having been pregnant.** If you've never been pregnant, you have a higher risk of endometrial cancer than someone who has had at least one pregnancy.\n*   **Older age.** As you get older, your risk of endometrial cancer increases. Endometrial cancer occurs most often after menopause.\n*   **Obesity.** Being obese increases your risk of endometrial cancer. This may occur because excess body fat alters your body's balance of hormones.\n*   **Hormone therapy for breast cancer.** Taking the hormone therapy drug tamoxifen for breast cancer can increase the risk of developing endometrial cancer. If you're taking tamoxifen, discuss this risk with your doctor. For most, the benefits of tamoxifen outweigh the small risk of endometrial cancer.\n*   **An inherited colon cancer syndrome.** Lynch syndrome, also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is a syndrome that increases the risk of colon cancer and other cancers, including endometrial cancer. Lynch syndrome is caused by a gene mutation passed from parents to children. If a family member has been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, discuss your risk of the genetic syndrome with your doctor. If you've been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, ask your doctor what cancer screening tests you should undergo.\n\n【18】Prevention\n----------\n\n【19】To reduce your risk of endometrial cancer, you may wish to:\n\n【20】*   **Talk to your doctor about the risks of hormone therapy after menopause.** If you're considering hormone replacement therapy to help control menopause symptoms, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits. Unless you've undergone a hysterectomy, replacing estrogen alone after menopause may increase your risk of endometrial cancer. Taking a combination of estrogen and progestin can reduce this risk. Hormone therapy carries other risks, so weigh the benefits and risks with your doctor.\n*   **Consider taking birth control pills.** Using oral contraceptives for at least one year may reduce endometrial cancer risk. The risk reduction is thought to last for several years after you stop taking oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives have side effects, though, so discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor.\n*   **Maintain a healthy weight.** Obesity increases the risk of endometrial cancer, so work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, increase your physical activity and reduce the number of calories you eat each day.\n\n【21】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

However, invasive fungal disease has been associated with prolonged antibiotic use and the presence of an indwelling catheter. Other diseases resulting in impairment of cellular immunity, such as HIV infection, can be a separate risk factor for invasive fungal disease, largely due to an increased risk for invasive yeast disease. Appropriate screening should be instituted in cases in which other explanations for invasive fungal disease have not been identified. Invasive fungal disease has also been associated with prolonged neutropenia, usually regarded as more than 7 days in duration. Specifically, the duration and magnitude of neutropenia are the most important risk factors for development of invasive mold infection.\n\n【91】Three days after transfer to our hospital, the neutropenia resolved, but the patient continued to have daily fever, with maximum temperatures of 39.4°C.

At 2 weeks after the initial presentation, defervescence occurred, and the patient was discharged home on a regimen of oral fluconazole therapy with planned follow-up in 1 month with an infectious disease specialist and repeated imaging to assess the response to treatment.\n\n【117】Discussion\n----------\n\n【118】Our patient represents an unusual case. The duration of his neutropenia immediately following systemic chemoimmunotherapy was longer than what is usually observed in patients treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy. Rituximab is associated with late-onset neutropenia, but this usually occurs months after treatment. Antifungal prophylaxis is not commonly used in patients treated with R-CHOP because this regimen usually does not result in prolonged neutropenia. Although persistent fever after initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy is commonly seen in patients with hepatosplenic candidiasis, it was not certain whether the fever and new hypodense lesions in our patient represented a systemic fungal infection or resistant lymphoma. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of a hepatic lesion was performed both to direct appropriate antimicrobial therapy and to determine whether R-CHOP should be continued once the patient recovered from his infection.\n\n【119】Hepatosplenic candidiasis is an infectious complication that can be seen in patients with the following risk factors: acute leukemia, the presence of intravascular catheters, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and prolonged neutropenia. Before the use of prophylactic antifungal agents became established, hepatosplenic candidiasis was a common finding in patients with prolonged neutropenia. The typical presentation is that of high spiking fever in the setting of prolonged neutropenia, and right upper quadrant pain may also be present. Laboratory evaluation may reveal an elevated alkaline phosphatase level. Magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be more specific than CT in diagnosing hepatosplenic candidiasis.\n\n【120】无关删除-2*   Semelka R.C.\n*   Shoenut J.P.\n*   Greenberg H.M.\n*   Bow E.J.\n\n【121】Detection of acute and treated lesions of hepatosplenic candidiasis: comparison of dynamic contrast-enhanced CT and MR imaging.\n\n【122】无关删除-2_J Magn Reson Imaging._ 1992; 2 : 341-345\n\n【123】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (73)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【124】Characteristic multiple lucencies in the liver, spleen, and sometimes the kidneys are seen on imaging. The lucencies represent microabscesses and may appear to worsen when the patient's neutrophil count recovers. The definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy that shows granulomas with yeast. Tissue culture results are commonly negative, especially in the setting of previous antifungal treatment, and negative findings do not rule out the diagnosis of hepatosplenic candidiasis. Patients frequently remain febrile shortly after initiation of appropriate therapy. Liposomal amphotericin B can be used, especially in unstable or severely ill patients, with transition to oral fluconazole therapy for the completion of the total course of treatment. If the patient's condition is stable at diagnosis, fluconazole can be initiated and continued for the duration of therapy. Antifungal therapy should continue until there is a resolution of the lesions on imaging and the patient improves clinically and should be reinstituted if further immunosuppression is expected.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "01ce3633-3253-49f6-8f73-9a207bf9e350", "title": "Probenecid (Oral Route)", "text": "【0】Probenecid (Oral Route)\nDescription and Brand Names\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Drug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\n【2】### US Brand Name\n\n【3】1.  Benemid\n2.  Probalan\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Probenecid is used in the treatment of chronic gout or gouty arthritis. These conditions are caused by too much uric acid in the blood. The medicine works by removing the extra uric acid from the body. Probenecid does not cure gout, but after you have been taking it for a few months it will help prevent gout attacks. This medicine will help prevent gout attacks only as long as you continue to take it.\n\n【6】Probenecid is also used to prevent or treat other medical problems that may occur if too much uric acid is present in the body.\n\n【7】Probenecid is sometimes used with certain kinds of antibiotics to make them more effective in the treatment of infections.\n\n【8】Probenecid is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Tablet\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【13】### Allergies\n\n【14】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【15】### Pediatric\n\n【16】Probenecid has been tested in children 2 to 14 years of age for use together with antibiotics. It has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems than it does in adults. Studies on the effects of probenecid in patients with gout have been done only in adults. Gout is very rare in children.\n\n【17】### Geriatric\n\n【18】Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. There is no specific information comparing use of probenecid in the elderly with use in other age groups.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【24】*   Ketorolac\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【26】*   Avibactam\n*   Baricitinib\n*   Cephalexin\n*   Citalopram\n*   Deferiprone\n*   Doripenem\n*   Indomethacin\n*   Methotrexate\n*   Naproxen\n*   Pegloticase\n*   Pexidartinib\n*   Phenobarbital\n*   Primidone\n*   Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy\n*   Sodium Phenylbutyrate\n*   Sulbactam\n*   Zalcitabine\n\n【27】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【28】*   Amoxicillin\n*   Aspirin\n*   Bismuth Subsalicylate\n*   Cefditoren Pivoxil\n*   Cefotaxime\n*   Cefpodoxime Proxetil\n*   Cefprozil\n*   Choline Magnesium Trisalicylate\n*   Ciprofloxacin\n*   Enprofylline\n*   Ertapenem\n*   Gatifloxacin\n*   Lorazepam\n*   Magnesium Salicylate\n*   Meropenem\n*   Norfloxacin\n*   Phenprocoumon\n*   Piretanide\n*   Pralatrexate\n*   Sodium Salicylate\n*   Sodium Thiosalicylate\n*   Zidovudine\n*   Zomepirac\n\n【29】### Other Interactions\n\n【30】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【31】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【32】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【33】*   Blood disease or\n*   Cancer being treated by antineoplastics (cancer medicine) or radiation (x-rays) or\n*   Kidney disease or stones (or history of) or\n*   Stomach ulcer (history of)—The chance of side effects may be increased\n\n【34】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【35】If probenecid upsets your stomach, it may be taken with food. If this does not work, an antacid may be taken. If stomach upset (nausea, vomiting, or loss of appetite) continues, check with your doctor.\n\n【36】For patients taking probenecid for gout:\n\n【37】*   After you begin to take probenecid, gout attacks may continue to occur for a while. However, if you take this medicine regularly as directed by your doctor, the attacks will gradually become less frequent and less painful than before. After you have been taking probenecid for several months, they may stop completely.\n*   This medicine will help prevent gout attacks but it will not relieve an attack that has already started. Even if you take another medicine for gout attacks, continue to take this medicine also. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.\n\n【38】For patients taking probenecid for gout or to help remove uric acid from the body:\n\n【39】*   When you first begin taking probenecid, the amount of uric acid in the kidneys is greatly increased. This may cause kidney stones or other kidney problems in some people. To help prevent this, your doctor may want you to drink at least 10 to 12 full glasses (8 ounces each) of fluids each day, or to take another medicine to make your urine less acid. It is important that you follow your doctor's instructions very carefully.\n\n【40】### Dosing\n\n【41】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【42】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【43】*   For treating gout or removing uric acid from the body:\n    *   Adults: 250 mg (one-half of a 500-mg tablet) two times a day for about one week, then 500 mg (one tablet) two times a day for a few weeks. After this, the dose will depend on the amount of uric acid in your blood or urine. Most people need 2, 3, or 4 tablets a day, but some people may need higher doses.\n    *   Children: It is not likely that probenecid will be needed to treat gout or to remove uric acid from the body in children. If a child needs this medicine, however, the dose would have to be determined by the doctor.\n*   For helping antibiotics work better:\n    *   Adults: The amount of probenecid will depend on the condition being treated. Sometimes, only one dose of 2 tablets is needed. Other times, the dose will be 1 tablet four times a day.\n    *   Children: The dose will have to be determined by the doctor. It depends on the child's weight, as well as on the condition being treated. Older children and teenagers may need the same amount as adults.\n\n【44】### Missed Dose\n\n【45】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【46】### Storage\n\n【47】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【48】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【49】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【50】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【51】If you will be taking probenecid for more than a few weeks, your doctor should check your progress at regular visits.\n\n【52】Before you have any medical tests, tell the person in charge that you are taking this medicine. The results of some tests may be affected by probenecid.\n\n【53】For diabetic patients:\n\n【54】*   Probenecid may cause false test results with copper sulfate urine sugar tests (Clinitest®), but not with glucose enzymatic urine sugar tests (Clinistix®). If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.\n\n【55】For patients taking probenecid for gout or to help remove uric acid from the body:\n\n【56】*   Taking aspirin or other salicylates may lessen the effects of probenecid. This will depend on the dose of aspirin or other salicylate that you take, and on how often you take it. Also, drinking too much alcohol may increase the amount of uric acid in the blood and lessen the effects of this medicine. Therefore, do not take aspirin or other salicylates or drink alcoholic beverages while taking this medicine, unless you have first checked with your doctor.\n\n【57】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【58】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【59】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【60】#### Rare\n\n【61】1.  Fast or irregular breathing\n2.  puffiness or swellings of the eyelids or around the eyes\n3.  shortness of breath, troubled breathing, tightness in chest, or wheezing\n4.  changes in the skin color of the face occurring together with any of the other side effects listed here\n5.  or skin rash, hives, or itching occurring together with any of the other side effects listed here\n\n【62】Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【63】#### Less common\n\n【64】1.  Bloody urine\n2.  difficult or painful urination\n3.  lower back or side pain (especially if severe or sharp)\n4.  skin rash, hives, or itching (occurring without other signs of an allergic reaction)\n\n【65】#### Rare\n\n【66】1.  Cloudy urine\n2.  cough or hoarseness\n3.  fast or irregular breathing\n4.  fever\n5.  pain in back and/or ribs\n6.  sores, ulcers, or white spots on lips or in mouth\n7.  sore throat and fever with or without chills\n8.  sudden decrease in the amount of urine\n9.  swelling of face, fingers, feet, and/or lower legs\n10.  swollen and/or painful glands\n11.  unusual bleeding or bruising\n12.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n13.  yellow eyes or skin\n14.  weight gain\n\n【67】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【68】#### More common\n\n【69】1.  Headache\n2.  joint pain, redness, or swelling\n3.  loss of appetite\n4.  nausea or vomiting (mild)\n\n【70】#### Less common\n\n【71】1.

{"seq_id": "99d381a7-fd46-49e9-88f9-06145695727c", "title": "Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)", "text": "【0】Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)\nOverview\n--------\n\n【1】It's normal to feel nervous in some social situations. For example, going on a date or giving a presentation may cause that feeling of butterflies in your stomach. But in social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, everyday interactions cause significant anxiety, self-consciousness and embarrassment because you fear being scrutinized or judged negatively by others.\n\n【2】In social anxiety disorder, fear and anxiety lead to avoidance that can disrupt your life. Severe stress can affect your relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities.\n\n【3】Social anxiety disorder can be a chronic mental health condition, but learning coping skills in psychotherapy and taking medications can help you gain confidence and improve your ability to interact with others.\n\n【4】Social anxiety disorder care at Mayo Clinic\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Feelings of shyness or discomfort in certain situations aren't necessarily signs of social anxiety disorder, particularly in children. Comfort levels in social situations vary, depending on personality traits and life experiences. Some people are naturally reserved and others are more outgoing.\n\n【7】In contrast to everyday nervousness, social anxiety disorder includes fear, anxiety and avoidance that interfere with relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities. Social anxiety disorder typically begins in the early to mid-teens, though it can sometimes start in younger children or in adults.\n\n【8】#### Emotional and behavioral symptoms\n\n【9】Signs and symptoms of social anxiety disorder can include constant:\n\n【10】*   Fear of situations in which you may be judged negatively\n*   Worry about embarrassing or humiliating yourself\n*   Intense fear of interacting or talking with strangers\n*   Fear that others will notice that you look anxious\n*   Fear of physical symptoms that may cause you embarrassment, such as blushing, sweating, trembling or having a shaky voice\n*   Avoidance of doing things or speaking to people out of fear of embarrassment\n*   Avoidance of situations where you might be the center of attention\n*   Anxiety in anticipation of a feared activity or event\n*   Intense fear or anxiety during social situations\n*   Analysis of your performance and identification of flaws in your interactions after a social situation\n*   Expectation of the worst possible consequences from a negative experience during a social situation\n\n【11】For children, anxiety about interacting with adults or peers may be shown by crying, having temper tantrums, clinging to parents or refusing to speak in social situations.\n\n【12】Performance type of social anxiety disorder is when you experience intense fear and anxiety during speaking or performing in public but not in other types of more general social situations.\n\n【13】#### Physical symptoms\n\n【14】Physical signs and symptoms can sometimes accompany social anxiety disorder and may include:\n\n【15】*   Blushing\n*   Fast heartbeat\n*   Trembling\n*   Sweating\n*   Upset stomach or nausea\n*   Trouble catching your breath\n*   Dizziness or lightheadedness\n*   Feeling that your mind has gone blank\n*   Muscle tension\n\n【16】#### Avoiding common social situations\n\n【17】Common, everyday experiences may be hard to endure when you have social anxiety disorder, including:\n\n【18】*   Interacting with unfamiliar people or strangers\n*   Attending parties or social gatherings\n*   Going to work or school\n*   Starting conversations\n*   Making eye contact\n*   Dating\n*   Entering a room in which people are already seated\n*   Returning items to a store\n*   Eating in front of others\n*   Using a public restroom\n\n【19】Social anxiety disorder symptoms can change over time. They may flare up if you're facing a lot of changes, stress or demands in your life. Although avoiding situations that produce anxiety may make you feel better in the short term, your anxiety is likely to continue over the long term if you don't get treatment.\n\n【20】#### When to see a doctor\n\n【21】See your doctor or a mental health professional if you fear and avoid normal social situations because they cause embarrassment, worry or panic.\n\n【22】Causes\n------\n\n【23】Like many other mental health conditions, social anxiety disorder likely arises from a complex interaction of biological and environmental factors. Possible causes include:\n\n【24】*   **Inherited traits.** Anxiety disorders tend to run in families. However, it isn't entirely clear how much of this may be due to genetics and how much is due to learned behavior.\n*   **Brain structure.** A structure in the brain called the amygdala (uh-MIG-duh-luh) may play a role in controlling the fear response. People who have an overactive amygdala may have a heightened fear response, causing increased anxiety in social situations.\n*   **Environment.** Social anxiety disorder may be a learned behavior — some people may develop significant anxiety after an unpleasant or embarrassing social situation. Also, there may be an association between social anxiety disorder and parents who either model anxious behavior in social situations or are more controlling or overprotective of their children.\n\n【25】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【26】Several factors can increase the risk of developing social anxiety disorder, including:\n\n【27】*   **Family history.** You're more likely to develop social anxiety disorder if your biological parents or siblings have the condition.\n*   **Negative experiences.** Children who experience teasing, bullying, rejection, ridicule or humiliation may be more prone to social anxiety disorder. In addition, other negative events in life, such as family conflict, trauma or abuse, may be associated with this disorder.\n*   **Temperament.** Children who are shy, timid, withdrawn or restrained when facing new situations or people may be at greater risk.\n*   **New social or work demands.** Social anxiety disorder symptoms typically start in the teenage years, but meeting new people, giving a speech in public or making an important work presentation may trigger symptoms for the first time.\n*   **Having an appearance or condition that draws attention.** For example, facial disfigurement, stuttering or tremors due to Parkinson's disease can increase feelings of self-consciousness and may trigger social anxiety disorder in some people.\n\n【28】Complications\n-------------\n\n【29】Left untreated, social anxiety disorder can control your life. Anxieties can interfere with work, school, relationships or enjoyment of life. This disorder can cause:\n\n【30】*   Low self-esteem\n*   Trouble being assertive\n*   Negative self-talk\n*   Hypersensitivity to criticism\n*   Poor social skills\n*   Isolation and difficult social relationships\n*   Low academic and employment achievement\n*   Substance abuse, such as drinking too much alcohol\n*   Suicide or suicide attempts\n\n【31】Other anxiety disorders and certain other mental health disorders, particularly major depressive disorder and substance abuse problems, often occur with social anxiety disorder.\n\n【32】Prevention\n----------\n\n【33】There's no way to predict what will cause someone to develop an anxiety disorder, but you can take steps to reduce the impact of symptoms if you're anxious:\n\n【34】*   **Get help early.** Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait.\n*   **Keep a journal.** Keeping track of your personal life can help you and your mental health professional identify what's causing you stress and what seems to help you feel better.\n*   **Set priorities in your life.** You can reduce anxiety by carefully managing your time and energy. Make sure that you spend time doing things you enjoy.\n*   **Avoid unhealthy substance use.** Alcohol and drug use and even caffeine or nicotine use can cause or worsen anxiety. If you're addicted to any of these substances, quitting can make you anxious. If you can't quit on your own, see your health care provider or find a treatment program or support group to help you.\n\n【35】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.\n\n【6】Captopril works by blocking a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, the blood vessels relax. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.\n\n【7】Captopril is also used to help treat heart failure. It is also used in some patients after a heart attack. After a heart attack, some of the heart muscle becomes damaged and weak. The heart muscle may continue to weaken as time goes by. This makes it more difficult for the heart to pump blood. Captopril may be started within the first few days after a heart attack to increase survival rate.\n\n【8】Captopril is also used to treat kidney problems caused by diabetes (diabetic nephropathy).\n\n【9】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【10】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【11】*   Tablet\n\n【12】Before Using\n------------\n\n【13】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of captopril in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【18】### Geriatric\n\n【19】No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of captopril in geriatric patients. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require an adjustment of dose in patients receiving captopril.\n\n【20】### Breastfeeding\n\n【21】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【22】### Drug Interactions\n\n【23】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Lean controls were recruited from a research website. Neuropathy was defined by the Toronto consensus definition of probable neuropathy. We compared nine anthropometric measurements between obese participants with and without neuropathy. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore associations between these measures, and other metabolic risk factors, and neuropathy.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We recruited 138 obese individuals and 46 lean controls. The mean age (SD) was 45.1 (11.3) years in the obese population (76.1% female, n=105) and 43.8 (12.1) years in the lean controls (82.2% female, n=37). The prevalence of neuropathy was 2.2% (n=1) in lean controls, 12.1% (n=4) in obese participants with normoglycemia, 7.1% (n=4) in obese participants with pre-diabetes, and 40.8% (n=20) in obese participants with diabetes ( _p_ ≤.01). Waist circumference was the only anthropometric measure that was larger in those with neuropathy (139.3 cm vs 129.1 cm, _p_ \\=.01). Hip-thigh (71.1 cm vs 76.6 cm, _p_ <.01) and mid-thigh (62.2 cm vs 66.3 cm, _p_ \\=.03) circumferences were smaller in those with neuropathy. The body mass index was comparable between patients who were obese with and without neuropathy ( _p_ \\=.86). Waist circumference (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.75), systolic blood pressure (OR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.49 to 5.61), and triglycerides (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.70) were significantly associated with neuropathy.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Normoglycemic obese patients have a high prevalence of neuropathy indicating that obesity alone may be sufficient to cause neuropathy.

We also included beneficiaries with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as disease controls and beneficiaries without AS or IBD as unaffected controls. We excluded those treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in this period. We followed up each group for new diagnosis claims for hematologic malignancies until September 30, 2015.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We included 12,451 beneficiaries with AS, 234,905 with IBD, and 10,975,340 unaffected controls, with a mean follow-up of 9.9, 9.3, and 8.0 years, respectively. We identified 297 hematologic malignancies in the AS group, 4538 malignancies in the IBD group, and 128,239 malignancies in unaffected controls. The standardized incidence ratio in AS vs unaffected controls was 1.39 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.61) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 1.50 (95% CI, 1.17 to 1.92) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 1.52 (95% CI, 1.12 to 2.06) for multiple myeloma. Risks of acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia were not elevated in AS, and there were too few cases of Hodgkin lymphoma to compute risks. Risks were comparable to those of beneficiaries with IBD. We also performed a systematic literature review of the risk of hematologic malignancy in AS, focusing on age associations, which have not been previously examined. We identified 21 studies in the systematic literature review, which included mainly young or middle-aged patients. Results suggested that AS was largely not associated with an increased risk of hematologic malignancies. Two cohort studies reported an increased risk of multiple myeloma in AS.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The risks of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma are increased among elderly patients with AS.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ALL ( acute lymphocytic leukemia ), AML ( acute myeloid leukemia ), AS ( ankylosing spondylitis ), CLL ( chronic lymphocytic leukemia ), CML ( chronic myeloid leukemia ), CMS ( Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ), IBD ( inflammatory bowel disease ), ICD-9-CM ( International Classification of Diseases ), Ninth Revision ( Clinical Modification ), NSAID ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ), SIR ( standardized incidence ratio ), TNFi ( tumor necrosis factor inhibitor )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "e0c51ebc-5075-41e3-8271-7160d4b6a331", "title": "Impacted wisdom teeth", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Impacted wisdom teeth are third molars at the back of the mouth that don't have enough room to emerge or develop normally.\n\n【2】Wisdom teeth are the last adult teeth to come into the mouth (erupt). Most people have four wisdom teeth at the back of the mouth — two on the top, two on the bottom.\n\n【3】Impacted wisdom teeth can result in pain, damage to other teeth and other dental problems. In some cases, impacted wisdom teeth may cause no apparent or immediate problems. But because they're hard to clean, they may be more vulnerable to tooth decay and gum disease than other teeth are.\n\n【4】Impacted wisdom teeth that cause pain or other dental complications are usually removed. Some dentists and oral surgeons also recommend removing impacted wisdom teeth that don't cause symptoms to prevent future problems.\n\n【5】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【6】Impacted wisdom teeth don't always cause symptoms. However, when an impacted wisdom tooth becomes infected, damages other teeth or causes other dental problems, you may experience some of these signs or symptoms:\n\n【7】*   Red or swollen gums\n*   Tender or bleeding gums\n*   Jaw pain\n*   Swelling around the jaw\n*   Bad breath\n*   An unpleasant taste in your mouth\n*   Difficulty opening your mouth\n\n【8】### When to see a doctor\n\n【9】See your dentist if you experience symptoms in the area behind your last molar that may be associated with an impacted wisdom tooth.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Wisdom teeth (third molars) become impacted because they don't have enough room to come in (erupt) or develop normally.\n\n【12】Wisdom teeth usually emerge sometime between the ages of 17 and 25. Some people have wisdom teeth that emerge without any problems and line up with the other teeth behind the second molars. In many cases, however, the mouth is too crowded for third molars to develop normally. These crowded third molars become trapped (impacted).\n\n【13】An impacted wisdom tooth may partially emerge so that some of the crown is visible (partially impacted), or it may never break through the gums (fully impacted). Whether partially or fully impacted, the tooth may:\n\n【14】*   Grow at an angle toward the next tooth (second molar)\n*   Grow at an angle toward the back of the mouth\n*   Grow at a right angle to the other teeth, as if the wisdom tooth is \"lying down\" within the jawbone\n*   Grow straight up or down like other teeth but stay trapped within the jawbone\n\n【15】Complications\n-------------\n\n【16】Impacted wisdom teeth can cause several problems in the mouth:\n\n【17】*   **Damage to other teeth.** If the wisdom tooth pushes against the second molar, it may damage the second molar or increase the risk of infection in that area. This pressure can also cause problems with crowding of the other teeth or require orthodontic treatment to straighten other teeth.\n*   **Cysts.** The wisdom tooth develops in a sac within the jawbone. The sac can fill with fluid, forming a cyst that can damage the jawbone, teeth and nerves. Rarely, a tumor — usually noncancerous (benign) — develops. This complication may require removal of tissue and bone.\n*   **Decay.** Partially impacted wisdom teeth appear to be at higher risk of tooth decay (caries) than other teeth. This probably occurs because wisdom teeth are harder to clean and because food and bacteria get easily trapped between the gum and a partially erupted tooth.\n*   **Gum disease.** The difficulty cleaning impacted, partially erupted wisdom teeth increases the risk of developing a painful, inflammatory gum condition called pericoronitis (per-ih-kor-o-NI-tis) in that area.\n\n【18】Prevention\n----------\n\n【19】You can't keep an impaction from occurring, but keeping regular six-month dental appointments for cleaning and checkups enables your dentist to monitor the growth and emergence of your wisdom teeth. Regularly updated dental X-rays may indicate impacted wisdom teeth before any symptoms develop.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Aptivus\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Tipranavir is used in combination with ritonavir (Norvir®) to treat an infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is usually given to patients who have received HIV treatment in the past.\n\n【6】Tipranavir will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. Tipranavir will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.\n\n【7】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【8】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【9】*   Capsule, Liquid Filled\n\n【10】Before Using\n------------\n\n【11】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【12】### Allergies\n\n【13】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【14】### Pediatric\n\n【15】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of tipranavir in children younger than 2 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【16】### Geriatric\n\n【17】Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of tipranavir have not been performed in the geriatric population, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving tipranavir.\n\n【18】### Breastfeeding\n\n【19】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【22】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【23】*   Alfuzosin\n*   Amiodarone\n*   Astemizole\n*   Bepridil\n*   Cisapride\n*   Colchicine\n*   Dihydroergotamine\n*   Ergonovine\n*   Ergotamine\n*   Flecainide\n*   Grazoprevir\n*   Isavuconazonium Sulfate\n*   Levoketoconazole\n*   Lovastatin\n*   Lurasidone\n*   Methylergonovine\n*   Midazolam\n*   Naloxegol\n*   Pazopanib\n*   Pimozide\n*   Propafenone\n*   Quinidine\n*   Rifampin\n*   Romidepsin\n*   Sildenafil\n*   Simvastatin\n*   St John's Wort\n*   Terfenadine\n*   Tolvaptan\n*   Triazolam\n\n【24】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

Limiting your exposure to the sun and using sunscreen agents when in the sun may help prevent early wrinkling of the skin and skin cancer. There are two kinds of sunscreen agents: chemical and physical. Chemical sunscreen agents protect you from the sun by absorbing the ultraviolet (UV) and visible sun rays, while physical sunscreen agents reflect, scatter, absorb, or block these rays.\n\n【8】Sunscreen agents often contain more than one ingredient. For example, products may contain one ingredient that provides protection against the ultraviolet A (UVA) sun rays and another ingredient that protects you from the ultraviolet B (UVB) sun rays, which are more likely to cause sunburn than the UVA sun rays. Ideally, coverage should include protection against both UVA and UVB sun rays.\n\n【9】The sun protection factor (SPF) that you find on the label of these products tells you the minimum amount of UVB sunlight that is needed with that product to produce redness on sunscreen-protected skin as compared with unprotected skin. Sunscreen products with high SPFs will provide more protection against the sun.\n\n【10】Sunscreen products are available with and without your doctor's prescription. If you are using this medicine without a prescription, carefully read and follow any precautions on the label.\n\n【11】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【12】*   Stick\n*   Lotion\n*   Spray\n*   Cream\n*   Liquid\n*   Ointment\n*   Gel/Jelly\n\n【13】Before Using\n------------\n\n【14】### Allergies\n\n【15】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【16】### Pediatric\n\n【17】Infants under 6 months of age should be kept out of the sun. Sunscreen agents should not be used on infants under 6 months of age because of increased chance of side effects. Children 6 months of age and older should be kept out of the sun or have limited exposure to the sun. Sunscreen agents with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 should be applied during exposure to the sun. Lotion sunscreen products are preferred for use in children. Alcohol-based sunscreen products should be avoided because they can cause irritation.\n\n【18】### Geriatric\n\n【19】It is believed that the elderly, who spend little time in the sun and use sunscreen agents frequently, may be at risk for vitamin D deficiency (which may result in bone disease and fracture), although this has not been proven. To help you get enough vitamin D, it is recommended that you eat food rich in vitamin D, such as fortified milk or fatty fish. Your doctor may also advise you to take vitamin D supplements. Check with your doctor about this.\n\n【20】### Drug Interactions\n\n【21】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicine.\n\n【22】### Other Interactions\n\n【23】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【24】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【25】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【26】*   Skin conditions or diseases, especially those caused or worsened by exposure to light—Worsening of skin condition may occur.\n\n【27】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【28】Sunscreen agents are for external use only. These products usually come with patient directions. Read them carefully before using any product.\n\n【29】In choosing the sunscreen product, you may consider the following:\n\n【30】*   Type of Activity—Take precautions when you are in places of higher elevations (mountains) or on reflective surfaces (concrete, sand, snow, or water), as these may increase the likelihood of sun damage to the skin. Use a sunscreen with ultraviolet A/ultraviolet B (UVA/UVB) coverage and with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher. Activities that make you sweat, such as outdoor jobs (gardeners, construction workers), outdoor sports (tennis) or exercise, prolonged sunbathing, or water sports such as swimming, water-skiing, or wind surfing, may result in the removal of the sunscreen agent from the skin. Use a water-resistant or waterproof sunscreen agent with SPF of 15 or more. When possible, also wear a hat, long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and UV-opaque sunglasses. Wearing UV-opaque sunglasses when you are in the sun is also necessary because the sun rays can cause cataracts.\n*   Age—Do not use sunscreen agents on infants younger than 6 months of age. For children 6 months of age and older, use a lotion form of sunscreen with broad spectrum and SPF of 15 or higher. Avoid using alcohol-based sunscreen products for this age group.\n*   Site of application—For the ear and nose, use a physical sunscreen agent. For the lips, use a gel-based lip sunscreen or lip balm.\n*   Skin condition—If your skin is dry, use a cream or lotion form of sunscreen agent. If your skin is oily, use an alcohol or gel-based sunscreen. Avoid using alcohol-based sunscreens on eczematous or inflamed skin.\n\n【31】The following are skin types (complexions) and the appropriate sunscreen agent that should be used:\n\n【32】*   Very fair; always burns easily; rarely tans—Use SPF 20 to 30.\n*   Fair; always burns easily; tans minimally—Use SPF 12 to 20.\n*   Light; burns moderately; tans gradually (light brown)—Use SPF 8 to 12.\n*   Medium; burns minimally; always tans well (moderate brown)—Use SPF 4 to 8.\n*   Dark; rarely burns; tans profusely (dark brown)—Use SPF 2 to 4.\n\n【33】Before every exposure to the sun, apply an appropriate sunscreen product that protects you against ultraviolet (UV) sun rays. For maximum sun protection, sunscreens should be applied uniformly and thickly to all exposed skin surfaces (including the lips, using lip sunscreen or lip balm). Sunscreen products containing aminobenzoic acid, lisadimate, padimate O, or roxadimate should be applied 1 to 2 hours before sun exposure. Other sunscreen products should be applied 30 minutes before sun exposure, unless otherwise directed by the package instructions. Lip sunscreens should be applied 45 to 60 minutes before sun exposure.\n\n【34】Because most sunscreens are easily removed from the skin, you should reapply these products liberally every 1 to 2 hours for adequate protection. You should reapply sunscreen especially after swimming or heavy perspiration. Lip sunscreens should be reapplied liberally at least once every hour while you are in the sun and also before and after swimming, after eating and drinking, and during other activities that remove it from the lips.\n\n【35】Keep sunscreen products (e.g., sprays) away from the eyes.\n\n【36】Some sunscreen agents contain alcohol and are flammable. Do not use near heat, near open flame, or while smoking.\n\n【37】Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average dose of sunscreen agents.\n\n【38】*   For topical dosage forms (cream, gel, lotion, lip balm, oil, spray, and stick):\n    *   For sunburn (prevention):\n        *   Adults, teenagers, and children 6 months of age and older—Apply liberally and evenly to exposed area(s) of skin (including the lips, using lip sunscreen or lip balm) before sun exposure. Reapply when needed.\n        *   Infants younger than 6 months of age—Use is not recommended.\n\n【39】### Storage\n\n【40】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【41】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【42】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【43】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【44】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【45】If rash or irritation develops, stop using the sunscreen and check with your doctor.\n\n【46】Sunscreen agents containing aminobenzoic acid, lisadimate, padimate O, or roxadimate may discolor and stain light-colored fabrics yellow.\n\n【47】In addition to using sunscreen agents, it is advisable to minimize exposure to the sun from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. (11 a.m. to 3 p.m. daylight savings time) when the sun is at its strongest. Take extra precautions also on cloudy or overcast days and around reflective surfaces such as concrete, sand, snow, or water, since these surfaces can reflect the sun's damaging rays. Wear protective clothing including a hat, long-sleeved shirt, and long pants. Sunglasses also should be worn to avoid sun damage to the eyes (cataract formation). Avoid sunlamps and tanning parlors because these can damage the skin and eyes as direct sunlight can.\n\n【48】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【49】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【50】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【51】#### Rare\n\n【52】1.  Acne\n2.  burning, itching, or stinging of the skin\n3.  early appearance of redness or swelling of the skin\n4.  late appearance of rash with or without weeping blisters that become crusted, especially in sun-exposed areas, and may extend to unexposed areas of the skin\n5.  pain in hairy areas\n6.  pus in the hair follicles\n\n【53】Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:\n\n【54】#### More common\n\n【55】1.  Drying or tightening of the skin\n\n【56】Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients. If you notice any other effects, check with your healthcare professional.\n\n【57】无关删除-1Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

A total of 1002 patients undergoing TAVR were included. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data in the youngest group were compared with those of patients 76 to 86 years and older than 86 years. Patients were followed up for up to 2 years.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Compared with patients 75 years or younger (reference group), patients aged 76 to 86 years and older than 86 years had nonsignificantly different 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.41-1.38; _P_ \\=.37 and odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.62-2.60; _P_ \\=.51, respectively) and 1-year mortality (hazard ratio (HR), 0.72; 95% CI, 0.48-1.09; _P_ \\=.12 and HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.88-1.40; _P_ \\=.34, respectively).

The Society of Thoracic Surgeons 30-day mortality score was lower in younger patients who, however, had a significantly higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( _P_ \\=.005 vs the intermediate group and _P_ \\=.02 vs the older group) and bicuspid aortic valves ( _P_ \\=.02 vs both older groups), larger left ventricles, and lower ejection fractions.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In the present registry, mortality at 2 years after TAVR among patients 75 years or younger was higher compared with that of patients aged 75 to 86 years and was not markedly different from that of patients older than 86 years. The findings are attributable at least in part to a greater burden of comorbidities in the younger age group that are not entirely captured by current risk assessment tools.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ), HR ( hazard ratio ), LV ( left ventricular ), MACE ( major adverse cardiovascular events ), OR ( odds ratio ), SAVR ( surgical aortic valve replacement ), STS ( Society of Thoracic Surgeons ), TAVR ( transcatheter aortic valve replacement )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

It's caused by compression of the nerve that provides sensation to the skin covering your thigh.\n\n【2】Tight clothing, obesity or weight gain, and pregnancy are common causes of meralgia paresthetica. However, meralgia paresthetica can also be due to local trauma or a disease, such as diabetes.\n\n【3】In most cases, you can relieve meralgia paresthetica with conservative measures, such as wearing looser clothing. In severe cases, treatment may include medications to relieve discomfort or, rarely, surgery.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Meralgia paresthetica may cause these symptoms affecting the outer (lateral) part of your thigh:\n\n【6】*   Tingling and numbness\n*   Burning pain\n*   Decreased sensation\n*   Increased sensitivity and pain to even a light touch\n\n【7】These symptoms commonly occur on one side of your body and might intensify after walking or standing.\n\n【8】### When to see your doctor\n\n【9】See your doctor if you have symptoms of meralgia paresthetica.\n\n【10】Causes\n------\n\n【11】Meralgia paresthetica occurs when the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve — which supplies sensation to the surface of your outer thigh — is pinched (compressed). The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve only affects sensation and doesn't affect your ability to use your leg muscles.\n\n【12】In most people, this nerve passes through the groin to the upper thigh without trouble. But in meralgia paresthetica, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve becomes trapped — often under the inguinal ligament, which runs along your groin from your abdomen to your upper thigh.\n\n【13】Common causes of this compression include any condition that increases pressure on the groin, including:\n\n【14】*   Tight clothing, such as belts, corsets and tight pants\n*   Obesity or weight gain\n*   Wearing a heavy tool belt\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Fluid accumulation in the abdomen causing increased abdominal pressure\n*   Scar tissue near the inguinal ligament due to injury or past surgery\n\n【15】Nerve injury, which can be due to diabetes, trauma after surgery or seat belt injury after a motor vehicle accident, for example, also can cause meralgia paresthetica.\n\n【16】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【17】The following might increase your risk of meralgia paresthetica:\n\n【18】*   **Extra weight.** Being overweight or obese can increase the pressure on your lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.\n*   **Pregnancy.** A growing belly puts added pressure on your groin, through which the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve passes.\n*   **Diabetes.** Diabetes-related nerve injury can lead to meralgia paresthetica.\n*   **Age.** People between the ages of 30 and 60 are at a higher risk.\n\n【19】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Data were pooled and analyzed for risedronate at 5 mg and at 15 mg once daily and compared with placebo. The results of the once-weekly dosages (35 or 50 mg) were assessed separately.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】A total of 2483 patients were randomized: 622 to placebo, 628 to risedronate at 5 mg/d, 609 to risedronate at 15 mg/d, 310 to risedronate at 35 mg once weekly, and 314 to risedronate at 50 mg once weekly.

We analyzed how trends in obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease prevalence as well as several health behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, and exercise) varied between health care professionals and the general US population from 2002 to 2013, using nationally representative data collected by the National Health Interview Survey. We estimated multivariate logistic regressions of each disease and behavior adjusted for age, race, sex, geographic region, and year. Although rates of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension were lower among health care professionals compared with the overall population, disease was still common among health care professionals and increased over time at a rate similar to that of the overall population. For example, obesity prevalence was lower among health care professionals but increased similarly from 2002 to 2013 (health care professionals, 20.5% in 2002 to 22.1% in 2013; other occupations, 28.4% to 31.7%; _P_ \\=.64 for difference in trend).

Erectile function is primarily a vascular phenomenon, triggered by neurologic controls and facilitated by appropriate hormonal and psychological components. Recent advances in the understanding of the physiology of penile vasculature and its role in male sexual performance have influenced the clinical approach to ED. The pathophysiological alterations leading to impotence in diabetic men include vasculogenic, neurogenic, and hormonal etiologies. A clinical work-up, including a thorough history and physical examination, is an important aspect of ED management. Biochemical evaluations to rule out secondary causes like hypogonadism and thyroid abnormalities are suggested. Oral medications acting through phos-phodiesterase inhibition in penile vasculature have revolutionized treatment of impotence in diabetic men. Because of a high success rate in treating ED of various etiologies, these agents are the treatment of choice for most patients. Safety and efficacy of vacuum-constriction devices, intraurethral suppositories, intracavernosal injections, and other therapies are discussed. A clinical algorithm for the evaluation and management of ED is provided for use in the primary care setting.\n\n【1】CAD ( coronary artery disease ), cGMP ( cyclic guanosine monophosphate ), ED ( erectile dysfunction ), NO ( nitric oxide ), NOS ( NO synthase ), PDE5 ( type 5 cGMP phosphodiesterase ), PGE1 ( prostaglandin E1 )\n\n【2】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【3】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【4】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【5】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【6】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【8】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【9】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Avonex\n2.  Avonex Pen\n3.  Rebif\n4.  Rebif Rebidose\n5.  Rebif Rebidose Titration Pack\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Interferon beta-1a injection is used to treat the relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. This medicine will not cure MS, but it may slow some of the disabling effects and decrease the number of relapses of the disease. Interferons are natural substances that are produced in the body to help fight infections. Interferon beta-1a is a synthetic (man-made) version of these substances.\n\n【6】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Solution\n*   Kit\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:\n\n【11】### Allergies\n\n【12】Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.\n\n【13】### Pediatric\n\n【14】Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of interferon beta-1a injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.\n\n【15】### Geriatric\n\n【16】Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of interferon beta-1a injection have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of interferon beta-1a injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution in patients receiving interferon beta-1a injection.\n\n【17】### Breastfeeding\n\n【18】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【19】### Drug Interactions\n\n【20】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【21】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【22】*   Methotrexate\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.\n\n【24】*   Zidovudine\n\n【25】### Other Interactions\n\n【26】Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.\n\n【27】### Other Medical Problems\n\n【28】The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【29】*   Alcohol abuse, history of or\n*   Angina (severe chest pain) or\n*   Autoimmune disorders (eg, autoimmune hepatitis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia) or\n*   Bone marrow problems (decreased amounts of red or white blood cells in your body), history of or\n*   Congestive heart failure or\n*   Depression or mental problems, history of or\n*   Heart disease (eg, cardiomyopathy) or\n*   Heart rhythm problems (eg, arrhythmia) or\n*   Liver disease or\n*   Seizures or epilepsy, history of or\n*   Thyroid problems—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\n\n【30】*   Allergy to human albumin, history of—Should not be used in patients with this condition.\n\n【31】*   Infection—May decrease your body's ability to fight an infection.\n\n【32】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【33】A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. This medicine is given as a shot under your skin (usually in the stomach, back of the upper arm, buttocks, or thighs) or into a muscle (usually in the thigh). A nurse or other trained health professional should watch the first Avonex® injection you give yourself.\n\n【34】If you are injecting interferon beta-1a yourself, use it exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not change your dose or dosing schedule without checking first with your doctor. The exact amount of medicine you need has been carefully worked out. Using too much will increase the risk for side effects, while using too little may not improve your condition.\n\n【35】You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. Do not inject into skin areas that are irritated, reddened, bruised, infected, or scarred in any way.\n\n【36】Check the injection site after 2 hours for redness, swelling, and tenderness.\n\n【37】Use only the brand of this medicine that your doctor prescribed. Different brands may not work the same way.\n\n【38】Rebif® comes as an autoinjector or a prefilled syringe. It works best if you use it at the same time (usually in the late afternoon or evening) on the same 3 days (eg, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) at least 48 hours apart each week.\n\n【39】Avonex® comes as a prefilled autoinjector pen or a prefilled syringe.\n\n【40】Use a new needle or syringe each time you inject your medicine. Do not use any other needle for the prefilled autoinjector pen.\n\n【41】Each package of medicine contains a Medication Guide and a sheet called Instructions for Use. Read this information carefully and make sure you understand:\n\n【42】*   How to prepare the injection.\n*   How to use disposable syringes or autoinjectors.\n*   How to store the syringes or autoinjectors.\n\n【43】Allow Avonex® prefilled autoinjector pens and prefilled syringes and Rebif® autoinjector to warm to room temperature before injection by removing from the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Do not heat them in a microwave oven or in hot water.\n\n【44】You may also receive other medicines (fever medicine, pain medicine) to help prevent or lessen flu-like symptoms (eg, fever, cough, chills, body aches) that may occur during treatment with this medicine.\n\n【45】### Dosing\n\n【46】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【47】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【48】*   For injection dosage form:\n    *   For multiple sclerosis:\n        *   Adults—\n            *   Avonex®: At first, 7.5 micrograms (mcg) injected into a muscle once a week on the same day (eg, every Monday at bedtime). Your doctor will increase your dose by 7.5 mcg each week for the next 3 weeks until you reach 30 mcg weekly.\n            *   Rebif®: At first, 4.4 or 8.8 mcg injected under the skin 3 times a week. Your doctor will adjust your dose as needed.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\n【49】### Missed Dose\n\n【50】If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【51】Avonex®: If you miss a dose, give it as soon as you can. Go back to your regular schedule the following week. Do not use this medicine 2 days in a row.\n\n【52】Rebif®: If you miss a dose, give it as soon as you can. Skip the next day and give your regular dose 48 hours later. Go back to your regular schedule the following week. Do not use this medicine 2 days in a row.\n\n【53】### Storage\n\n【54】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【55】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【56】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【57】Store in the refrigerator. Do not freeze.\n\n【58】Store prefilled autoinjector pens or prefilled syringes in the refrigerator. Do not freeze. If refrigeration is not available, Rebif® prefilled syringes may be kept for up to 30 days at room temperature, away from heat (temperatures above 77 degrees F) and direct light. Avonex® prefilled autoinjector pens and prefilled syringes may be stored for up to 7 days at room temperature, away from heat (temperatures above 77 degrees F) and direct light.\n\n【59】Put the used needles into a hard, closed container that the needles cannot poke through. Keep this container away from children and pets.\n\n【60】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【61】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【62】This medicine may cause some people to be anxious, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors. It may also cause some people to have suicidal thoughts and tendencies or to become more depressed. If you or your caregiver notice any of these side effects, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【63】Check with your doctor right away if you have dark urine, persistent loss of appetite, flu-like symptoms, headache, continuing vomiting, general feeling of tiredness or weakness, light-colored stools, right upper stomach pain or tenderness, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.\n\n【64】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.\n\n【65】This medicine may lower the number of white blood cells in the blood. This will increase your chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:\n\n【66】*   If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.\n*   Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.\n*   Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.\n*   Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.\n*   Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects, such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.\n*   Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.\n\n【67】This medicine may cause redness, pain, or swelling at the injection site. Some patients have developed serious skin infection or damage (necrosis), including a permanent depression under the skin at the injection site. Contact your doctor right away if you notice depressed or indented skin, blue-green to black skin discoloration, or pain, redness, or sloughing (peeling) of the skin.\n\n【68】This medicine commonly causes a flu-like reaction, with aching muscles, chills, fever, headaches, joint pain, and nausea. Using your shot at bedtime may allow you to sleep through the symptoms. Your doctor may want you to take a medicine to help control the pain or fever (eg, acetaminophen or ibuprofen). Carefully follow your doctor's instructions about how to prevent or treat these symptoms.\n\n【69】Thrombotic microangiopathy, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome may occur while you are using this medicine. Tell your doctor right away if you have black, tarry stools, blood in the urine, difficulty with speaking, fever, pinpoint red spots on the skin, seizures, stomach pain, unusual bleeding or bruising, or yellow eyes or skin.\n\n【70】This medicine contains albumin, which comes from human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them, although the risk is low. Human donors and donated blood are both tested for viruses to keep the transmission risk low. Talk with your doctor about this risk if you are concerned. The Avonex® prefilled autoinjector pen and prefilled syringe do not contain albumin which comes from donated human blood.\n\n【71】The tip cap of the Avonex® prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before you start using this medicine.\n\n【72】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【73】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【74】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【75】#### More common\n\n【76】1.

However, we think that Dr Saitz overstated our position when he wrote that we “suggested that AWS _should be treated by specialists,_ in part because protocols can fail in the hands of physicians from diverse specialties” \\[italics added\\]. We did not intend to convey such a message; we wrote that patient care “ _is best_ delivered by specialists in chemical dependency, _acting in concert_ with the primary medical or surgical service” \\[italics added\\]. We think that there is considerable difference between these 2 sentences. Indeed, in the very next sentence within our editorial we made the point that Dr Saitz raised: “However, such care is often unavailable because of the shortage of appropriate specialists and lack of mechanisms to reimburse their input.”\n\n【1】We wholeheartedly agree with Dr Saitz that generalist physicians will, by default, be caring for alcohol-dependent patients admitted to hospitals. As well, we agree that these generalist physicians and the patients they care for will benefit from appropriately developed and applied protocols. However, as shown by Hecksel et al, the safety and efficacy of such protocols cannot be assumed, and, when they are shown to be lacking, strategies must be developed to ensure that patient care is not suffering from well-intentioned but misconceived or misapplied protocols.\n\n【2】Again, we thank Dr Saitz for his insightful comments and welcome the chance to further explain our views on protocol-driven medical care.\n\n【3】Article info\n------------\n\n【4】### Identification\n\n【5】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/83.6.730\n\n【6】### Copyright\n\n【7】© 2008 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

In the accompanying editorial, it is unclear how Berge and Morse derived their point that care of patients with AWS is best delivered by specialists in chemical dependency.

{"seq_id": "c33948b0-d4f9-4144-8b1f-6f567fa8615a", "title": "Morning-after pill", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】The morning-after pill is a type of emergency birth control (contraception). Emergency contraception is used to prevent pregnancy for women who've had unprotected sex or whose birth control method has failed.\n\n【2】The morning-after pill is intended for backup contraception only, not as a primary method of birth control. Morning-after pills contain either levonorgestrel (Plan B One-Step) or ulipristal acetate (ella).\n\n【3】Levonorgestrel is available over-the-counter without a prescription; ulipristal acetate is available only with a prescription.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Morning-after pills can help prevent pregnancy if you've had unprotected sex — either because you didn't use birth control, you missed a birth control pill, you were sexually assaulted or your method of birth control failed.\n\n【6】Morning-after pills do not end a pregnancy that has implanted. They work primarily by delaying or preventing ovulation.\n\n【7】Keep in mind that the morning-after pill isn't the same as mifepristone (Mifeprex), also known as RU-486 or the abortion pill. This drug terminates an established pregnancy — one in which the fertilized egg has attached to the uterine wall and has begun to develop.\n\n【8】Risks\n-----\n\n【9】Emergency contraception is an effective option for preventing pregnancy after unprotected sex, but it isn't as effective as other methods of contraception and isn't recommended for routine use. Also, the morning-after pill can fail even with correct use, and it offers no protection against sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【10】The morning-after pill isn't appropriate for everyone. Don't take a morning-after pill if:\n\n【11】*   You're allergic to any component of the morning-after pill\n*   You're taking certain medications that can decrease the effectiveness of the morning-after pill, such as barbiturates or St. John's wort\n\n【12】If you're overweight or obese, there's some indication that the morning-after pill won't be as effective in preventing pregnancy as it is for women who aren't overweight.\n\n【13】Also, make sure you're not pregnant before using ulipristal. The effects of ulipristal on a developing baby are unknown. If you're breast-feeding, ulipristal isn't recommended.\n\n【14】Side effects of the morning-after pill, which typically last only a few days, might include:\n\n【15】*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Dizziness\n*   Fatigue\n*   Headache\n*   Breast tenderness\n*   Bleeding between periods or heavier menstrual bleeding\n*   Lower abdominal pain or cramps\n\n【16】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【17】For maximum effectiveness, emergency contraception should be started as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse, and within 120 hours. You can take emergency contraceptive pills anytime during your menstrual cycle.\n\n【18】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【19】To use the morning-after pill:\n\n【20】*   Follow the morning-after pill's instructions. If you use Plan B One-Step, take one Plan B One-Step pill as soon as possible and less than 72 hours after unprotected sex. If you use ella, take one ella pill as soon as possible and less than 120 hours after unprotected sex.\n*   If you vomit within two hours after taking the morning-after pill, ask your health care provider if you should take another dose.\n*   Don't have sex until you start another method of birth control. The morning-after pill doesn't offer lasting protection from pregnancy. If you have unprotected sex in the days and weeks after taking the morning-after pill, you're at risk of becoming pregnant. Be sure to begin using or resume use of birth control.\n\n【21】Using the morning-after pill may delay your period by up to one week. If you don't get your period within three to four weeks of taking the morning-after pill, take a pregnancy test.\n\n【22】Normally, you don't need to contact your health care provider after using the morning-after pill. However, if you have bleeding or spotting that lasts longer than a week or develop severe lower abdominal pain three to five weeks after taking the morning-after pill, contact him or her. These can indicate a miscarriage or that the fertilized egg has implanted outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube (ectopic pregnancy).\n\n【23】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "edf318e8-0038-45ec-821d-8ec1c6a4c0c2", "title": "42-Year-Old Male Methamphetamine User With Dysarthria and Facial Droop", "text": "【0】42-Year-Old Male Methamphetamine User With Dysarthria and Facial Droop\nA 42-year-old man presented to the emergency department after the sudden onset of left hand numbness and tingling, dysarthria, and right-sided temporal region pain that began 30 minutes previously. On his way to the hospital, the patient had developed bilateral flank pain. He denied any significant medical history or history of similar symptoms and stated he had been in his usual state of health until the sudden onset of symptoms that brought him to the emergency department. He denied taking any medications and had no history of stroke, head trauma, recent bleeding, chest pain, back pain, palpitations, fevers, or chills. On direct questioning, he admitted to methamphetamine use. He usually administered methamphetamine intravenously; his most recent use was 2 days before presentation. He denied any history of sexually transmitted diseases. He stated that he regularly lifted weights but had not had any neck strains.\n\n【1】The patient was afebrile and had a blood pressure of 120/76 mm Hg and a regular heart rate of 102 beats/min. Neurologic examination showed minimal left hand clumsiness, mild left lower facial weakness, and minimal dysarthria; fundi appeared normal. Cardiac examination revealed no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Findings on chest examination were normal, with the exception of mild costovertebral angle tenderness. Findings on abdominal, testicular, and extremity examinations were normal.\n\n【2】*   1.\n\n【3】    **_Which one of the following best explains the patient's neurologic symptoms?_**\n\n【4】    *   a.\n\n【5】        _Subarachnoid hemorrhage_\n\n【6】    *   b.\n\n【7】        _Cerebral vasospasm_\n\n【8】    *   c.\n\n【9】        _Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)_\n\n【10】    *   d.\n\n【11】        _Partial simple seizure_\n\n【12】    *   e.\n\n【13】        _Acute ischemic stroke_\n\n【14】Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage usually have a “thunderclap” headache or lose consciousness, rarely present without headaches, and often lack focal neurologic deficits. On physical examination, they may have photophobia and nuchal rigidity. Our patient had neither a headache nor physical examination findings consistent with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral vasospasm usually manifests with uncontrolled hypertension and typically requires an inciting event such as hypertensive urgency or a delayed response to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our patient's blood pressure was within a normal range. He had no immediate inciting event and denied recent methamphetamine use that could have led to hypertensive urgency.\n\n【15】Intracerebral hemorrhage most commonly occurs either in older patients with a history of hypertension or in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. This patient was relatively young, had not received anticoagulation therapy, and had normal blood pressure. Patients with partial simple seizure typically do not have headaches and present with a focal neurologic deficit that resolves and then recurs; this did not fit the clinical picture of our patient. Acute ischemic stroke can present with headache and fluctuating neurologic deficits and is the diagnosis most consistent with our patient's history.\n\n【16】Electrocardiography revealed a normal sinus rhythm in our patient. An emergent complete blood cell count and a coagulation panel were performed, with normal findings. Levels of electrolytes were normal, but levels of creatinine were elevated to 2.1 mg/dL. Findings on chest radiography were unremarkable.\n\n【17】*   2.\n\n【18】    **_Which one of the following would be most appropriate as the next step in the management of this patient?_**\n\n【19】    *   a.\n\n【20】        _Computed tomography (CT) of the head without radiocontrast agent_\n\n【21】    *   b.\n\n【22】        _Computed tomography of the head with radiocontrast agent_\n\n【23】    *   c.\n\n【24】        _Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast agent_\n\n【25】    *   d.\n\n【26】        _Administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)_\n\n【27】    *   e.\n\n【28】        _Discharge from the emergency department with close outpatient neurology follow-up_\n\n【29】Computed tomography of the head without radiocontrast agent is initially indicated in patients with suspected stroke and reliably distinguishes acute ICH from ischemia. It is nearly 100% sensitive for ICH and approximately 90% sensitive for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Computed tomography of the head with radiocontrast agent would be unnecessary and perhaps unsafe in a patient with an elevated creatinine level. Although MRI is an option for evaluating patients with stroke, it is more expensive and time-consuming. The time involved in performing an MRI may preclude its use in a patient who is undergoing emergent evaluation for an ischemic stroke. If a diagnosis of ischemic stroke is made, treatment with intravenous tPA is indicated if the acute stroke is of less than 3 hours' duration in patients with persistent neurologic deficits. Intravenous tPA is not indicated in patients with a history of ICH, ischemic stroke within the previous 3 months, recent head injury or intracranial surgery, recent surgery, recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding, specific laboratory abnormalities (platelet count, <50 × 10  /L; international normalized ratio, >1.7; blood glucose level, >400 mg/dL or <50 mg/dL), or radiographic evidence of acute ischemia, ICH, or any other intracranial abnormality that could explain the neurologic deficit (eg, an intracranial mass). Discharging the patient from the hospital at this time would be inappropriate because he has complex symptomology without an established diagnosis.\n\n【30】No acute intracranial pathology was evident on CT of the brain without contrast agent. By the time the CT was completed, the patient's neurologic symptoms had resolved, but the bilateral flank pain persisted. Because the patient's neurologic deficits had resolved, fibrinolytic treatment was not given. Further diagnostic work-up was indicated.\n\n【31】The vascular neurology service was consulted; in accordance with their recommendations, the patient began taking one 325-mg tablet of aspirin orally and underwent an MRI of the brain and magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck. These studies revealed 3 small acute cortical infarcts in the right frontal parietal region and poor filling of the right common carotid arteries (both internal and external) compared with those on the left. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 1.\n\n【32】*   3.\n\n【33】    _Which one of the following diagnoses best explains all of these findings?_\n\n【34】    *   a.\n\n【35】        _Endocarditis_\n\n【36】    *   b.\n\n【37】        _Atrial fibrillation_\n\n【38】    *   c.\n\n【39】        _Isolated carotid artery dissection_\n\n【40】    *   d.\n\n【41】        _Systemic vasculitis_\n\n【42】    *   e.\n\n【43】        _Aortic dissection_\n\n【44】Although the patient is an admitted intravenous drug user, he had no fevers, no leukocytosis, a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and no murmur, making a clinical diagnosis of endocarditis unlikely. There was no history of palpitations, the heart rate was regular, and electrocardiography showed no rhythm disturbances, making a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation unlikely. Although an isolated carotid artery dissection would explain the patient's neurologic symptoms, this diagnosis would not explain his renal findings. Systemic vasculitis is another consideration because it can involve any organ system and mimic other diseases. However, this patient's acute presentation would argue against vasculitis involving the central nervous system because vasculitis usually presents as a subacute illness that evolves over weeks to months and is typically accompanied by an elevated sedimentation rate. Vasculitis is not commonly limited to renal and neurologic involvement with no other clinical manifestations. Acute aortic dissection with extension into the carotid and renal arteries could explain this patient's acute clinical findings.\n\n【45】A diagnosis of aortic dissection was suspected even though the patient continued to deny chest and back pain. No difference was observed in pulse pressures in his arms.\n\n【46】*   4.\n\n【47】    _Which one of the following is the most appropriate test to confirm the suspected diagnosis in this patient?_\n\n【48】    *   a.\n\n【49】        _Transthoracic echocardiography_\n\n【50】    *   b.\n\n【51】        _Abdominal CT with contrast agent_\n\n【52】    *   c.\n\n【53】        _Computed tomographic angiography_\n\n【54】    *   d.\n\n【55】        _Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)_\n\n【56】    *   e.\n\n【57】        _Chest radiography_\n\n【58】Transthoracic echocardiography has a low sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of aortic dissection. Image quality can be affected by obesity, emphysema, mechanical ventilation, or small intercostal spaces. Because of its poor sensitivity, this modality is not generally used in diagnosis. Abdominal CT and CT angiography both have an extremely high sensitivity and specificity for acute aortic dissection. They are noninvasive, readily available in most emergency departments, and quickly completed. However, both modalities require the use of an intravenous contrast agent, and our patient already had an elevated creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. Thus, neither is an ideal first-line test in our particular patient. Transesophageal echocardiography has a high sensitivity and specificity for acute aortic dissection, overcomes many of the limitations of transthoracic echocardiography, provides a higher degree of anatomic detail, can be performed at the bedside, and does not require arterial access, intravenous contrast agent, or ionizing radiation, making it the appropriate next step in confirming a diagnosis in our patient.\n\n【59】Chest radiography is a good starting point because it can reveal a widened mediastinum; however, it is not very sensitive for aortic dissection and so cannot be used to exclude this condition. In our patient, chest radiography would not be a good selection because findings on previous chest radiography were normal.\n\n【60】Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a dissection flap in the proximal ascending aorta. Although the patient had acute renal insufficiency, discussion with the cardiothoracic surgery and vascular neurology services led to a decision to perform CT of the thorax and abdomen with contrast agent to further evaluate the extent of dissection. This study was performed, revealing a type A aortic dissection that extended through the thoracic aorta. The 2 left renal arteries arose from the false lumen, and a superior right renal artery arose near the junction of the true and false lumens.\n\n【61】*   5.\n\n【62】    _Which one of the following would be the most appropriate intravenous therapy in this patient's initial management?_\n\n【63】    *   a.\n\n【64】        _Enalaprilat_\n\n【65】    *   b.\n\n【66】        _Esmolol_\n\n【67】    *   c.\n\n【68】        _Hydralazine_\n\n【69】    *   d.\n\n【70】        _Heparin_\n\n【71】    *   e.\n\n【72】        _Nitroprusside_\n\n【73】Initial management of all aortic dissections involves lowering the blood pressure and decreasing the velocity of left ventricular contraction. These interventions decrease aortic shear stress and minimize the propagation of the dissection. Enalaprilat affects the renal vasculature and may cause a dangerous decrease in blood pressure in renal arteries that already feed into the false lumen. β-Blockers are the initial agent of choice because they decrease both the volume of contraction and systemic blood pressure. Esmolol is an appropriate choice given its short half-life in the event pressure drops too much. Hydralazine is commonly used to quickly lower blood pressure. However, it is often accompanied by a reflex tachycardia that can increase the derivative of raw blood pressure, increasing the pressure gradient of the vessel. Heparin is contraindicated in aortic dissection because of increased risk of aortic rupture and catastrophic bleeding. Heparin is also relatively contraindicated in acute stroke because of the risk of hemorrhagic conversion. Nitroprusside is an arterial and venous dilator that can be rapidly titrated to effect. It should not be used unless accompanied by β-blockers because vasodilation alone may induce reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to enhanced ventricular contraction and increased aortic shear stress.\n\n【74】The patient was treated with intravenous esmolol and taken to surgery. He underwent successful repair of a thoracoabdominal aortic dissection with ascending transverse arch repair and aortic valve root resuspension with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Although his hospital stay was complicated by difficulty weaning him from the ventilator, he eventually recovered. His renal function returned to baseline with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. He was instructed on the importance of blood pressure control and the necessity of avoiding methamphetamine use. After a 15-day hospital stay, he was discharged and experienced a successful outpatient recovery.\n\n【75】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【76】The incidence of aortic dissection, an uncommon but potentially catastrophic entity, is approximately 2.6 to 3.5 per 100,000 person-years.\n\n【77】*   Clouse WD\n*   Hallett Jr, JW\n*   Shaff HV\n*   et al.\n\n【78】Acute aortic dissection: population-based incidence compared with degenerative aortic aneurysm rupture.\n\n【79】无关删除-2_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2004; 79 : 176-180\n\n【80】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (458)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【81】If the dissection is not treated, mortality rates during the first 24 to 48 hours are as high as 1% to 2% per hour\n\n【82】*   Nienaber CA\n*   Eagle KA\n\n【83】Aortic dissection: new frontiers in diagnosis and management, part I: from etiology to diagnostic strategies.\n\n【84】无关删除-2_Circulation._ 2003; 108 : 628-635\n\n【85】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (507)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【86】; therefore, early and accurate diagnosis and treatment are crucial for survival.

Weakening of these layers usually leads to a tear in the intima that permits entry of blood between the intima and adventitia. Driven by persistent intraluminal pressure, the dissection process extends a variable length along the aortic wall. The blood-filled space between the dissected layers of the aortic wall becomes the false lumen.\n\n【92】Aortic dissections are classified by whether they originate in the ascending aorta, within centimeters of the aortic valve, or in the descending aorta, just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. Three major classification systems are used to define the location and extent of aortic involvement: DeBakey types I, II, and III; Stanford types A and B; and the anatomic categories _proximal_ and _distal_ . DeBakey types I and II involve the ascending aorta and are grouped together for simplicity with Stanford type A and the anatomic category proximal. DeBakey type III involves the descending aorta and is grouped with Stanford type B and the anatomic category distal. Most intimal tears occur in the ascending aorta.\n\n【93】According to the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD),\n\n【94】*   Hagan PG\n*   Nienaber CA\n*   Isselbacher EM\n*   et al.\n\n【95】The International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD): new insights into an old disease.\n\n【96】无关删除-2_JAMA._ 2000; 283 : 897-903\n\n【97】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2800)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【98】the most important predisposing factors for acute aortic dissection are systemic hypertension (72%) and atherosclerosis (31%). However, these factors were less important in young patients; IRAD analysis showed that only 34% of patients younger than 40 years had a history of hypertension and only 1% had a history of atherosclerosis. Our patient was found to be normotensive on presentation, as were most of the younger patients in the IRAD analysis. Interestingly, our patient was an admitted methamphetamine user, and an association between methamphetamine use and aortic dissection has been documented by 1 case report series.\n\n【99】*   Wako E\n*   LeDoux D\n*   Mitsumori L\n*   Aldea GS\n\n【100】The emerging epidemic of methamphetamine-induced aortic dissections.\n\n【101】无关删除-2_J Card Surg._ 2007; 22 : 390-393\n\n【102】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (29)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【103】The median age in that series was 39.5 years, with blood pressures ranging from the normotensive to hypertensive range on initial presentation.

Chest radiography classically shows a widened mediastinum. However, the IRAD analysis showed no findings of widened mediastinum or abnormal aortic contour in 21.3% of patients presenting with acute aortic dissection. The imaging modalities of choice in diagnosis of acute aortic dissection are CT and TEE. Both modalities have a sensitivity and specificity greater than 90%. More readily available in most emergency departments, CT is completed quickly. Readily available in many larger centers, TEE can be completed quickly at the bedside, which makes it ideal for evaluating unstable patients.\n\n【120】When all modalities are available, CT should be considered first in the evaluation of suspected aortic dissection in light of its accuracy, safety, speed, and convenience. When CT identifies a type A dissection, the patient may be taken directly to the operating room, where TEE can be performed to assess the anatomy and competence of the aortic valve without delaying emergent surgery. Patients with uncomplicated type B dissections may be managed medically. According to IRAD data, type B dissections have a 10% in-hospital mortality rate with medical management alone and a 60% to 80% 5-year survival rate.\n\n【121】Patients with type A dissections require urgent surgery to avoid death as a consequence of intrapericardial rupture, cardiac tamponade, or myocardial infarction.

The anal canal is a short tube at the end of your rectum through which stool leaves your body.\n\n【2】Anal cancer can cause signs and symptoms such as rectal bleeding and anal pain.\n\n【3】Most people with anal cancer are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. Though combining anal cancer treatments increases the chance of a cure, the combined treatments also increase the risk of side effects.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Anal cancer signs and symptoms include:\n\n【6】*   Bleeding from the anus or rectum\n*   Pain in the area of the anus\n*   A mass or growth in the anal canal\n*   Anal itching\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Talk to your doctor about any signs and symptoms that bother you, especially if you have any factors that increase your risk of anal cancer.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Anal cancer forms when a genetic mutation turns normal, healthy cells into abnormal cells. Healthy cells grow and multiply at a set rate, eventually dying at a set time. Abnormal cells grow and multiply out of control, and they don't die. The accumulating abnormal cells form a mass (tumor). Cancer cells invade nearby tissues and can separate from an initial tumor to spread elsewhere in the body (metastasize).\n\n【11】Anal cancer is closely related to a sexually transmitted infection called human papillomavirus (HPV). Evidence of HPV is detected in the majority of anal cancers. HPV is thought to be the most common cause of anal cancers.\n\n【12】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【13】Several factors have been found to increase the risk of anal cancer, including:\n\n【14】*   **Older age.** Most cases of anal cancer occur in people age 50 and older.\n*   **Many sexual partners.** People who have many sexual partners over their lifetimes have a greater risk of anal cancer.\n*   **Anal sex.** People who engage in receptive anal sex have an increased risk of anal cancer.\n*   **Smoking.** Smoking cigarettes may increase your risk of anal cancer.\n*   **History of cancer.** Those who have had cervical, vulvar or vaginal cancer have an increased risk of anal cancer.\n*   **Human papillomavirus (HPV).** HPV infection increases your risk of several cancers, including anal cancer and cervical cancer. HPV infection is a sexually transmitted infection that can also cause genital warts.\n*   **Drugs or conditions that suppress your immune system.** People who take drugs to suppress their immune systems (immunosuppressive drugs), including people who have received organ transplants, may have an increased risk of anal cancer. HIV — the virus that causes AIDS — suppresses the immune system and increases the risk of anal cancer.\n\n【15】Complications\n-------------\n\n【16】Anal cancer rarely spreads (metastasizes) to distant parts of the body. Only a small percentage of tumors are found to have spread, but those that do are especially difficult to treat. Anal cancer that metastasizes most commonly spreads to the liver and the lungs.\n\n【17】Prevention\n----------\n\n【18】There is no sure way to prevent anal cancer. To reduce your risk of anal cancer:\n\n【19】*   **Practice safer sex.** Practicing safe sex may help prevent HPV and HIV, two sexually transmitted viruses that may increase your risk of anal cancer. If you choose to have anal sex, use condoms.\n*   **Get vaccinated against HPV.** A vaccine to protect against HPV infection is available. It's recommended for adolescents, including both boys and girls, but may be given to adults, too.\n*   **Stop smoking.** Smoking increases your risk of anal cancer. Don't start smoking. Stop if you currently smoke.\n\n【20】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Intraoperative echocardiograms, surgical reports, and pathology reports were reviewed.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 382 patients (54±16 years, 82% men), there were 207 (54%) tricuspid (TAV), 167 (44%) bicuspid (BAV), 5 quadricuspid, and 3 unicuspid aortic valves. Isolated AR mechanisms (n=116, 30%) included cusp prolapse (n=44, 11%), restriction/retraction (n=33, 9%), aortic root dilatation (n=33, 9%), perforation (n=5, 1%), and fenestration (<1%); mixed mechanisms were present in 266 (70%). The most common mixed mechanism was root dilatation and prolapse (27% BAV vs 16% TAV, _P_ \\=.01). Valve repair (AVr) was performed in 31% BAV and 23% TAV ( _P_ \\=.06). Aortic surgery was more common in BAV (37% vs 27%, _P_ <.001). Overall, root dilatation was associated with AVr. In TAV, cusp prolapse and restriction/retraction were associated with replacement; in BAV, prolapse was associated with AVr. AR etiology was idiopathic in 43% TAV patients, 47% of whom had root dilatation.\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】BAV accounted for 44% of surgical referrals for AR and, compared with TAV, was more often associated with prolapse, root dilatation, and mixed mechanisms of AR.

In affected patients, postprandial glucose may be an early indicator of glucose intolerance or a prediabetes condition, which may be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than impaired fasting glucose level. Treating patients who have early signs of hyperglycemia, including elevated postprandial glucose level, with intensive glucose control that does not lead to weight gain, and ideally may be associated with weight reduction, may be vital to preventing or reducing later cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Because hypoglycemia is an important complication of current DM treatments and may cause acute secondary adverse cardiovascular outcomes, not causing hypoglycemia is mandatory. Given that weight loss can significantly lower cardiovascular risk and improve other cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 DM and that medications are available that can result in weight reduction without leading to hypoglycemia, the successful treatment of patients with type 2 DM should be individualized and should address the complete pathophysiologic process. This review is a hypothesis article that presents arguments against general approaches to the treatment of type 2 DM. An algorithm is presented in which the goal for managing patients with type 2 DM is to lower the blood glucose level as much as possible for as long as possible without causing hypoglycemia. In addition, body weight should ideally be improved, reducing cardiovascular risk factors and avoiding therapeutic inertia.\n\n【1】ACCORD ( Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ), ADA ( American Diabetes Association ), ADVANCE ( Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release and Controlled Evaluation ), BMI ( body mass index ), BP ( blood pressure ), CHD ( coronary heart disease ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), DM ( diabetes mellitus ), DPP-4 ( dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ), EASD ( European Association for the Study of Diabetes ), FPG ( fasting plasma glucose ), GLP-1 ( glucagon-like peptide 1 ), HbA1c ( hemoglobin A1c ), HDL-C ( high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), IFG ( impaired fasting glucose ), IGT ( impaired glucose tolerance ), KORA ( Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg ), LDL-C ( low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), LEAD ( Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), MONICA ( MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease ), NHANES ( National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ), PPG ( postprandial glucose ), PROACTIVE ( PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial In macroVascular Events ), TC ( total cholesterol ), VADT ( Veterans Administration Diabetes Trial )\n\n【2】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【3】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【4】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【5】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【6】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【8】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【9】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Mortality was ascertained from death certificates. Data were collected from January 1, 1994, through March 31, 2011. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking habit, total physical activity, long-standing illness, prevalent CVD, and occupation.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】There were 2302 CVD deaths during 532,251 person-years of follow-up (mean ± SD, 9±4 years). A total of 15,002 (25%) participants were categorized as obese (BMI ≥30). Leisure-time physical activity was inversely associated and BMI was positively associated with CVD mortality. Compared with those who reported meeting physical activity guidelines including some vigorous-intensity physical activity and who had a normal BMI (18.5-24.9) (reference group), the CVD mortality hazard ratio was not significantly different in the obese who also reported meeting physical activity guidelines including some vigorous-intensity physical activities (1.25; 95% CI, 0.50-3.12). Compared with the reference group, the CVD mortality hazard ratio was more than 2-fold in the obese who reported meeting physical activity guidelines, including only moderate-intensity physical activities (2.52; 95% CI, 1.15-2.53).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】This large, statistically powerful study suggests that vigorous-intensity leisure-time physical activity is important in reducing CVD mortality risk in the obese.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BMI ( body mass index ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), HR ( hazard ratio ), HSE ( Health Survey for England ), MET ( metabolic equivalent ), SHS ( Scottish Health Survey )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Charts were reviewed by a neurologist blinded to KCSF results. Specificity and sensitivity for MS diagnosis were evaluated to establish a diagnostic cutoff value for KCSF in the retrospective cohort and then validated in the prospective cohort.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Retrospective and prospective subgroups, respectively, included MS (n=85, 70), non-MS (n=615, 585), and undetermined diagnosis (excluded, n=2, 2). The retrospective data established a KCSF cutoff value of 0.1 mg/dL to be comparable to OCB testing. In the retrospective subgroup, KCSF vs OCB sensitivities for diagnosis of MS were 68.2% vs 75.0% ( _P_ \\=.08) and specificities were 86.1% vs 87.6% ( _P_ \\=.27). The KCSF area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.772 (95% CI, 0.720 to 0.824), and for OCB was 0.813 (95% CI, 0.764 to 0.861). The prospective cohort was then used to validate the diagnostic KCSF value of 0.1 mg/dL; KCSF vs OCB sensitivities were 78.6% for both ( _P_ \\>.99) and specificities were 87.1% vs 89.4% ( _P_ \\=.09).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The KCSF value of 0.1 mg/dL is a valid alternative to OCB testing, offering a standardized quantitative measure, eliminating human error, reducing cost and turnaround time, with no significant difference in sensitivity and specificity. This study provides class I evidence that a KCSF value of 0.1 mg/dL can be used in place of OCB testing to support the diagnosis of MS.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AUC ( area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ), BBB ( blood-brain barrier ), CIS ( clinically isolated syndrome ), CNS ( central nervous system ), CSF ( cerebrospinal fluid ), FLC ( free light chain ), IEF ( isoelectric focusing ), IRB ( institutional review board ), KCSF ( κ free light chain in cerebrospinal fluid ), MS ( multiple sclerosis ), NRI ( net reclassification index ), OCB ( oligoclonal band ), ROC ( receiver operating characteristic )\n\n【11】Intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis is commonly found in multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as other infectious and autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) pathologic states with a humoral immune response.\n\n【12】无关删除-2*   Andersson M.\n*   Alvarez-Cermeno J.\n*   Bernardi G.\n*   et al.\n\n【13】Cerebrospinal fluid in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: a consensus report.\n\n【14】无关删除-2_J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry._ 1994; 57 : 897-902\n\n【15】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【16】无关删除-2*   DeCarli C.\n*   Menegus M.A.\n*   Rudick R.A.\n\n【17】Free light chains in multiple sclerosis and infections of the CNS.\n\n【18】无关删除-2_Neurology._ 1987; 37 : 1334-1338\n\n【19】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【20】无关删除-2*   Fortini A.S.\n*   Sanders E.L.\n*   Weinshenker B.G.\n*   Katzmann J.A.\n\n【21】Cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

These disadvantages to OCB testing prompt consideration for a more objective standardized test to assist in the diagnosis of MS. Measurement of immunoglobulin κ free light chains (FLCs) in CSF (KCSF) has been shown to potentially reflect intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis and have comparable sensitivity and specificity to OCB testing, though these studies may have been limited by small sample size or low statistical power.\n\n【62】*   Bonnan M.\n\n【63】Intrathecal IgG synthesis: a resistant and valuable target for future multiple sclerosis treatments.\n\n【64】_Mult Scler Int._ 2015; 2015 : 296184\n\n【65】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【66】无关删除-2*   Gurtner K.M.\n*   Shosha E.\n*   Bryant S.C.\n*   et al.\n\n【67】CSF free light chain identification of demyelinating disease: comparison with oligoclonal banding and other CSF indexes.\n\n【68】无关删除-2_Clin Chem Lab Med._ 2018; 56 : 1071-1080\n\n【69】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【70】无关删除-2*   Presslauer S.\n*   Milosavljevic D.\n*   Brucke T.\n*   Bayer P.\n*   Hübl W.W.\n\n【71】Elevated levels of kappa free light chains in CSF support the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.\n\n【72】无关删除-2_J Neurol._ 2008; 255 : 1508-1514\n\n【73】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【74】无关删除-2*   Presslauer S.\n*   Milosavljevic D.\n*   Huebl W.\n*   et al.\n\n【75】Validation of kappa free light chains as a diagnostic biomarker in multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome: a multicenter study.\n\n【76】无关删除-2_Mult Scler._ 2016; 22 : 502-510\n\n【77】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【78】无关删除-2*   Presslauer S.\n*   Milosavljevic D.\n*   Huebl W.\n*   Parigger S.\n*   Schneider-Koch G.\n*   Bruecke T.\n\n【79】Kappa free light chains: diagnostic and prognostic relevance in MS and CIS.\n\n【80】_PLoS One._ 2014; 9 e89945\n\n【81】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【82】KCSF absolute concentration, and associated formulas with multiple analytes such as CSF κ index and κ coefficient, seem to perform equally when compared with OCB testing.\n\n【83】无关删除-2*   Presslauer S.\n*   Milosavljevic D.\n*   Brucke T.\n*   Bayer P.\n*   Hübl W.W.\n\n【84】Elevated levels of kappa free light chains in CSF support the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.\n\n【85】无关删除-2_J Neurol._ 2008; 255 : 1508-1514\n\n【86】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【87】无关删除-2*   Presslauer S.\n*   Milosavljevic D.\n*   Huebl W.\n*   et al.\n\n【88】Validation of kappa free light chains as a diagnostic biomarker in multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome: a multicenter study.\n\n【89】无关删除-2_Mult Scler._ 2016; 22 : 502-510\n\n【90】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【91】无关删除-2*   Presslauer S.\n*   Milosavljevic D.\n*   Huebl W.\n*   Parigger S.\n*   Schneider-Koch G.\n*   Bruecke T.\n\n【92】Kappa free light chains: diagnostic and prognostic relevance in MS and CIS.\n\n【93】_PLoS One._ 2014; 9 e89945\n\n【94】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【95】Although the BBB function is theoretically age related and could add a variation factor to the absolute KCSF value, in practice, our preliminary study with 325 samples did not support this assumption.\n\n【96】*   Bonnan M.\n\n【97】Intrathecal IgG synthesis: a resistant and valuable target for future multiple sclerosis treatments.\n\n【98】_Mult Scler Int._ 2015; 2015 : 296184\n\n【99】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【100】In the clinical laboratory setting, KCSF has a significant logistic advantage because it is an automated quantitative measure easy to perform and eliminates the need for serum coupling. Using 2 large paired CSF/serum patient cohorts, we first established a valid diagnostic cutoff for KCSF with similar sensitivity and specificity to OCB testing in the diagnosis of MS in a retrospective cohort and validated these findings in a prospective cohort of samples.\n\n【101】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【102】### Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents\n\n【103】Data were collected with institutional review board (IRB) approval (IRB protocol 15-000480 and IRB 08-007810).\n\n【104】### Classification of Evidence\n\n【105】This study meets class I criteria for rating the diagnostic accuracy of an alternative biomarker for MS, KCSF.\n\n【106】### Samples and Patients\n\n【107】The study had 2 cohorts, a retrospective cohort for establishing a diagnostic KCSF cutoff value and a prospective cohort for validation of that established value. Specimens for both cohorts of the study included paired CSF and serum samples from residual waste specimens of previously physician-ordered OCB testing as part of clinical care. The aim of this sample selection was to reflect the diversity in the real clinical setting rather than having a focused group. All consecutive samples with available clinical data and a valid consent for research were included. The retrospective and prospective subgroups, respectively, included MS (n=85, 70), non-MS (n=615, 585), and undetermined diagnosis (excluded, n = 2, 2).\n\n【108】Chart review was performed by a neurologist blinded to KCSF results (R.S.S., S.J.P. or A.K.) but not to the OCB results because they were part of the medical history charting. Diagnosis of MS in both the retrospective and prospective arms was based on the 2010 revised McDonald criteria because the revised 2017 criteria were not published at the time of initiation of the study. Accordingly, the OCB result was not a criterion for the diagnosis of MS. Chart review included demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data for the patients. All chart reviews for both arms of the study were completed before data analysis. The retrospective cohort included a total of 702 participants collected consecutively from August 1, 2012, to May 31, 2016, from which a diagnostic cutoff for KCSF was established. The prospective validation cohort included a total of 657 subjects collected consecutively from August 1, 2017 to December, 31 2017. Power calculations showed that a sample size of 567 participants was needed to detect a difference in sensitivities for the prediction of MS from 85% to 78% using a 2-sided McNemar test with 80% power and 5% level of significance, assuming a 7.5% discordant rate and 21% prevalence of MS.\n\n【109】### Laboratory Measurements\n\n【110】Paired patient CSF and serum specimens were tested according to manufacturer instructions along with the laboratory’s standard operating procedure for the Oligoclonal Banding Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) Testing IgG-IEF gel assay (SPIFE IgG IEF kit cat. no. 3389) using the Helena SPIFE 3000 platform.

Paired CSF and serum nephelometric measurements for IgG and albumin in CSF and serum specimens were generated using a BNII nephelometric system (Siemens). The KCSF measurements were run on the BNII nephelometer and used Freelite Human Kappa reagent kits (The Binding Site). The laboratory was blinded to any clinical data. Samples used for this study were frozen at −20°C or −80°C until batched testing was performed.\n\n【116】### Data Analysis: Establishing Medical Decision Points for CSF FLC Analysis\n\n【117】The KCSF and OCB values are summarized as median and range and number (percentage) of 2 or more bands, respectively, with those with demyelinating diagnoses (MS group) compared with those with nondemyelinating diagnoses (non-MS group) using Wilcoxon rank sum test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. The KCSF positivity and clinical sensitivity and specificity of varied cutoffs were determined using patient clinical diagnosis of the MS group as true positives in both the retrospective and prospective cohorts.\n\n【118】From this, a medical decision point (cutoff) was created for KCSF through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. For this assessment, the dependent variable was patient group (MS or non-MS) and the independent variable was a given KCSF cutoff in a logistic regression. The optimal point balancing sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the point from the ROC curve that minimizes the distance from perfect sensitivity and specificity. Our final clinical recommendation for KCSF positivity was chosen to be the KCSF concentration that most closely matched the sensitivity and specificity of OCB of 2 or more.\n\n【119】For OCB, the 2017 McDonald criterion of 2 unique bands was used as the primary definition of a positive test result. Because the clinical practice in our institution used to report 4 or more bands as the critical value to define disease until July 2020, this cutoff was also assessed. For these assessments, a logistic regression with patient group as dependent variable and an appropriate indicator variable for number of OCB as independent variable were used.\n\n【120】Score 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for sensitivity, specificity, and overall agreement.

Because OCB of 2 or more bands are part of the revised 2017 McDonald criteria, the KCSF value that most closely matched the clinical sensitivity and specificity of that MS marker was selected for further analyses. The KCSF concentration of 0.1 mg/dL or greater had the clinical sensitivity and specificity (68.2% and 86.1%, respectively) to detect patients with MS, with a diagnostic odds ratio of 13.3, which was statistically most similar to the sensitivity and specificity of detecting 2 OCB (75.0% and 87.6%, respectively; _P_ \\>.08; Table 3 ).

This measure was evaluated to assess potential added sensitivity or specificity for MS diagnosis. The test added no improvement in diagnostic sensitivity. The combination OCB cutoff of 4 or more bands (previously used in our practice) and CSF IgG index of 0.85 or greater demonstrated the highest specificity for MS, though with reduced sensitivity compared with other test combinations or cutoffs.

In this analysis, OCB as a screening test for all patients was compared with a strategy reflex algorithmic approach (KCSF screening followed by OCB if KCSF was ≥0.06 mg/dL). For this cost analysis, we combined the patients in both the retrospective and prospective cohorts and then selected the first patient observation (n=1343) because 16 patients had been represented more than once. The Medicare reimbursement rates for 2018 (cost to the payor) were used as the standardized cost for the OCB ($27.39) and KCSF tests ($16.79). All 1343 patients would traditionally have had only the OCB test, resulting in a total cost of $36,784.77. Using the reflex algorithm, 980 patients (73%) needed only the KCSF test, whereas 363 (27%) needed both tests, resulting in a total cost of $32,575.49, thus saving $4,209.28 total ($3.13 per patient), a relative cost reduction for Medicare of approximately 11%. Turnaround time to deliver results would dramatically change from an average of 4 hours for OCB tests to 20 minutes for KCSF tests. With automation of testing, laboratory technologist training is standardized and personnel effort, although not formally assessed, is substantially reduced.\n\n【188】Discussion\n----------\n\n【189】Second to trauma, MS is the most frequent cause of permanent acquired neurologic disability in young adults.\n\n【190】无关删除-2*   Ramagopalan S.V.\n*   Sadovnick A.D.\n\n【191】Epidemiology of multiple sclerosis.\n\n【192】无关删除-2_Neurol Clin._ 2011; 29 : 207-217\n\n【193】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【194】The need for early and accurate diagnosis of MS is supported by the evidence that early treatment has a greater impact than later treatment in delaying disease progression.\n\n【195】无关删除-2*   Harding K.\n*   Williams O.\n*   Willis M.\n*   et al.\n\n【196】Clinical outcomes of escalation vs early intensive disease-modifying therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis.\n\n【197】无关删除-2_JAMA Neurol._ 2019; 76 : 536-541\n\n【198】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【199】无关删除-2*   Filippini G.\n*   Del Giovane C.\n*   Clerico M.\n*   et al.\n\n【200】Treatment with disease-modifying drugs for people with a first clinical attack suggestive of multiple sclerosis.\n\n【201】_Cochrane Database Syst Rev._ 2017; 4 : CD012200\n\n【202】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【203】Accordingly, the 2017 McDonald criteria reintroduction of intrathecal IgG OCBs as a substitute for dissemination in time,\n\n【204】无关删除-2*   Thompson A.J.\n*   Banwell B.L.\n*   Barkhof F.\n*   et al.\n\n【205】Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: 2017 revisions of the McDonald criteria.\n\n【206】无关删除-2_Lancet Neurol._ 2018; 17 : 162-173\n\n【207】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【208】could lead to early diagnosis in some cases that would have otherwise been diagnosed as CIS.\n\n【209】The role of the humoral immune system in both the pathogenesis and lesion maintenance in MS has been increasingly more evident in the literature and supported by the evidence of the favorable outcome of anti–B-cell drugs such as ocrelizumab and rituximab in the disease.\n\n【210】无关删除-2*   Longbrake E.E.\n*   Cross A.H.\n\n【211】Effect of multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies on B cells and humoral immunity.\n\n【212】无关删除-2_JAMA Neurol._ 2016; 73 : 219-225\n\n【213】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【214】无关删除-2*   Franciotta D.\n*   Salvetti M.\n*   Lolli F.\n*   Serafini B.\n*   Aloisi F.\n\n【215】B cells and multiple sclerosis.\n\n【216】无关删除-2_Lancet Neurol._ 2008; 7 : 852-858\n\n【217】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【218】无关删除-2*   Gasperi C.\n*   Stuve O.\n*   Hemmer B.\n\n【219】B cell-directed therapies in multiple sclerosis.\n\n【220】无关删除-2_Neurodegener Dis Manag._ 2016; 6 : 37-47\n\n【221】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【222】无关删除-2*   Mulero P.\n*   Midaglia L.\n*   Montalban X.\n\n【223】Ocrelizumab: a new milestone in multiple sclerosis therapy.\n\n【224】_Ther Adv Neurol Disord._ 2018; 11 ( 1756286418773025 )\n\n【225】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【226】无关删除-2*   Palanichamy A.\n*   Jahn S.\n*   Nickles D.\n*   et al.\n\n【227】Rituximab efficiently depletes increased CD20-expressing T cells in multiple sclerosis patients.\n\n【228】无关删除-2_J Immunol._ 2014; 193 : 580-586\n\n【229】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【230】The pathophysiologic role of the ongoing inflammatory process in the CNS is evident by the presence of CSF-specific IgG immunoglobulins (OCB).\n\n【231】无关删除-2*   Kostulas V.K.\n*   Link H.\n*   Lefvert A.K.\n\n【232】Oligoclonal IgG bands in cerebrospinal fluid.

Clinical laboratory testing rigorous quality controls is essential.\n\n【353】Although OCB were re-incorporated in the 2017 McDonald revised criteria, we report here an alternative with no significant difference in performance for diagnosing MS with clear advantages for the performing laboratory. With that in mind, a new laboratory MS panel was introduced in addition to classical OCB testing. The new panel offered by Mayo Clinic Laboratories uses KCSF as a screening test for CNS immunoglobulins synthesis. Any KCSF result less than 0.06 mg/dL is considered a true negative value and interpreted as such. No additional test is performed in those cases. Any test showing a positive KCSF (>0.1 mg/dL) result or what we may call a “borderline” (0.06-0.1 mg/dL) result is reflexed to OCB testing so that any potential diagnosis of MS includes the 2017 McDonald criteria recommended test for confirmation. At the cutoff of 0.06 mg/dL, KCSF has higher sensitivity than OCB testing, so we would not miss equivocal cases. Invariably, there are cases in which KCSF is positive and OCB is negative and the clinician needs to balance the laboratory results with the clinical picture.\n\n【354】Similar issues are encountered when OCB and the CSF IgG index are both measured, results are discrepant, and clinicians have to interpret the result. In this instance, when either measure of intrathecal IgG synthesis is detected, the result is interpreted as positive. The goal with this reflex approach starting with KCSF testing is to establish the reliability of the KCSF as a stand-alone test while still being efficient in filtering out true negative tests. Finally, performing only the KCSF test on patients with KCSF concentrations less than 0.06 mg/dL saves an average of $3.13 per patient tested, not to mention the savings in laboratory workflows and operations. This analysis is a conservative estimate of the cost savings, not including the possibility of eliminating a concurrent serum sample or testing for CSF IgG index in addition to KCSF and OCB testing, which we demonstrate here, does not add significant value to the diagnosis of MS.\n\n【355】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【356】In summary, we show class I evidence that quantitative measurement of KCSF using a cutoff of 0.10 mg/dL is not significantly different from the performance of OCB testing using a cutoff of 2 or more bands as positive, and could be applied as an alternative, faster, and cost-effective test without the limitations of OCB tests. Testing for evaluation of a demyelinating condition using KCSF as an initial screening test with a reflex approach to OCB when borderline or positive results (≥0.06 mg/dL) are found reduces turnaround time for results, overall cost, and may serve as a convenient check until laboratories and clinicians alike get familiar with the value of KCSF in routine practice. The importance of finding a uniformly objective standardized method for assessing intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis would prove important in both the clinical and research settings, and this is our recommendation based on the large data set we evaluated.\n\n【357】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【358】The authors thank Jody L.

In the multivariate model including android fat mass, gynoid fat mass, and other covariates, higher android fat mass was positively associated with clustered risk (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.88-2.64), but gynoid fat mass was not associated with clustered risk (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72-1.03). Analyses for individual risk factors demonstrated similar results.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Fat stored in different regions has differential influences on cardiometabolic risk in youth.

This model, called OB Nest, aimed to demedicalize the experience of pregnancy by providing a supportive and empowering experience that fits within patients' daily lives. To explore this topic, we invited women to use self-monitoring tools, a text-based smartphone application to communicate with their care team, and moderated online communities to connect with other pregnant women. Through observations of tool use and patient- and care team–provided feedback, we found that self-measurement and access to a fetal heart monitor provided women with confidence and joy in the progress of their pregnancies while shifting their position to being an active participant in their care. The smartphone application gave women direct access to their care team, provided continuity, and removed hurdles in establishing communication. The online community platform was a space where women in the same obstetric clinic could share nonmedical questions and advice with one another. This created a sense of community, leveraged the knowledge of women, and provided a venue beyond the clinic visit for information exchange. These findings were integrated into the design of the Mayo Clinic OB Nest model. This model redistributes care based on the individual needs of patients by providing self-measurement tools and continuous flexible access to their care team. By enabling women to meaningfully participate in their care, there is potential for cost savings and improved patient satisfaction.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CFI ( Mayo Clinic Center for Innovation ), HCD ( human-centered design ), OB ( obstetric )\n\n【4】Between 2004 and 2010, the cost of prenatal care drastically increased in the United States.

Pregnant women lose many productive hours in seeking this traditional model of care as well.

The first phase began with semistructured interviews with 20 patients and partners and approximately 100 hours of observation in the outpatient and inpatient settings. To obtain the care team perspective, ongoing conversations were had with individuals representing various roles in the OB and midwife care teams. In this phase, the selection of these individuals was largely by convenience.\n\n【100】The second phase of the HCD method began with a preliminary analysis of the data collected through the first phase, revealing several themes or opportunities for further exploration. Working closely with various representatives from the OB department over several ideation sessions, the team identified and then selected from a wide range of potential design concepts to be rapidly prototyped and iterated in the OB practice to validate the designs in situ. Through these small studies, design concepts are positioned as probes to further enhance our understanding of the unique needs of women experiencing low-risk prenatal care. During this phase, the team observed the execution of each concept and interviewed participants toward the completion of their experience. Data collected through this phase were analyzed and synthesized into insights that informed the final integrated design concept. The 3 components expounded on in this article—self-monitoring, online communities, and text-based communication—are integral in the design and conceptualization of the OB Nest model of care. For each of these components, postexperience debriefing was performed with the participants. Selection for these interviews was largely related to the availability of the participants.\n\n【101】### Patient Selection\n\n【102】Patient and care team acceptance was the main criteria for design validation. Patients were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: absence of factors that would suggest a high-risk pregnancy, proficiency in written and spoken English, older than 18 years, less than 5 months in gestation, and receiving Mayo Clinic prenatal care. Women who were identified by their OB care team as high risk, who were not proficient in English, or who were not at an appropriate gestational stage were excluded. This patient population was primarily local to Rochester, Minnesota, where the race/ethnicity of the population is largely white (85%), with a median household income of $64,554.\n\n【103】2011-2015 American community survey 5-year estimates.\n\n【104】https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk\n\n【105】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【106】Ninety-one percent of residents older than 25 years have graduated from high school, and 41.3% have a bachelor' degree or higher.\n\n【107】This qualitative study was deemed an institutionally sanctioned mechanism for improvement of clinical flow and activities by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, which guided data collection methods.\n\n【108】### Components of the OB Nest Model of Care\n\n【109】#### Self-monitoring\n\n【110】The OB Nest model was designed with the intent of offering pregnant women a more flexible care experience while maintaining patient safety and quality of care. Establishing patient competence with traditionally office-bound tools allowed for the continuous collection of patient data, which would normally be only sparsely available to the patient and care team. To explore this method, 6 pregnant women were taught how to self-measure important clinical parameters, such as weight, fundal height, and blood pressure. Women were also given a handheld fetal Doppler device (Natus Nicolet Elite 200 Doppler with digital display; Natus Medical Inc), which allowed them to assess fetal heart rate at their leisure, providing reassurance during periods of minimal fetal movement. Participants in this experience were selected largely from the group of women with upcoming visits scheduled in the OB department and willing to be interviewed at the completion of their experience. In addition, the number of participants was determined by availability and access to self-monitoring equipment.\n\n【111】In addition, 4 private drop-in stations were created where women could freely access these same devices on their own schedules as an additional way to demonstrate to the OB care teams on a broader scale that women could build competency with these devices. Because of patient confidentiality and logistical constraints, it was not possible to get an exact number of drop-in participants, but through anonymous write-in comments left in the rooms and the amount of supplies that needed to be refilled over time, more than 50 women used these stations over 8 months. Of these interactions, 10 women were interviewed about their experiences using these devices.\n\n【112】#### Text-Based Communication\n\n【113】To provide pregnant women with more flexibility in care team contact, they were provided with a more direct line of communication with their care team. This was facilitated by the development of an encrypted digital application, allowing women to communicate questions and concerns directly to their care team, outside of their face-to-face appointments. A nurse within the care team was the primary responder and would triage any concerns requiring a physician or midwife. To select patients for this experience, the team called patients currently receiving Mayo Clinic OB care and screened participants based on the eligibility criteria mentioned previously herein. An additional inclusion criterion for this experience was access to either the Internet or a smartphone. Nine of the 15 participants were interviewed about their experiences.\n\n【114】#### Online Communities\n\n【115】Medical issues arising during early pregnancy are often untreatable by current medical technology, as traditional care models focus on diagnostics and screening of the mother and newborn. This leads to a relative sparsity of care team contact in the first trimester.\n\n【116】*   Rubin R.\n\n【117】Long-held prenatal beliefs challenged.\n\n【118】http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2004-02-02-prenatal-usat\\_x.htm\n\n【119】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【120】However, not all questions or concerns during a healthy pregnancy are medical in nature, and a sickness model of care affords little time or opportunity to address these important issues.\n\n【121】Ironically, such nonmedical concerns tend to occur early on in pregnancy, especially in primipara, when there is surfeit of uncertainty and fear due to dramatic changes in physiology and physiognomy. Indeed, in the case of women experiencing low-risk pregnancies, this may be most of their perceived prenatal care needs. A mismatch between the need for support and regular follow-up may then fuel a sense of disinterest and abandonment by the care team ( Figure 1 ). Although the population-specific needs of primipara, particularly those experiencing low-risk pregnancies, have gone mostly unrecognized by the medical community, it is worth noting that currently more than 45% of women receiving prenatal care in the United States are experiencing their first pregnancy. This emphasizes the importance of medical guidance of both medical and nonmedical concerns in early pregnancies.\n\n【122】*   Gao G.\n\n【123】Americans' Ideal Family Size Is Smaller Than It Used to Be.\n\n【124】Pew Research Center , Washington, DC 2015\n\n【125】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【126】Figure 1 This image represents the disconnect between the anxiety typically experienced by women throughout their pregnancies and the support they perceive from their obstetric (OB) care team. Because the care model was designed around a patient's medical need rather than emotional need, women feel a lack of support during their first trimester and then, conversely, later in pregnancy feel inconvenienced by the frequency of interactions.\n\n【127】无关删除-2*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【128】The misalignment, however, stretches beyond primipara. Because the current American care model is centered around the potential effectiveness of medical interventions, it tends to undervalue the emotional need of pregnant women. This results in a care model that is inflexible to patients' individual needs. Women who were more confident in their pregnancies may, therefore, feel inconvenienced by the frequency of their follow-up visits, and less confident women, perhaps due to personality or history, fail to receive the attention they need and deserve.\n\n【129】To explore this issue further, 63 women experiencing prenatal care at Mayo Clinic were invited to join an online community. Within these spaces, moderated by a nurse or midwife, groups of pregnant women could consult with one another concerning their questions and thoughts regarding pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood. Ongoing feedback was collected through the online platforms, and 25 women were interviewed either individually or in groups about their experiences. The team recruited patients via phone who were currently receiving Mayo Clinic OB midwifery care using the eligibility criteria mentioned previously herein. In addition, to be eligible, each patient needed to have access to the Internet either at home or at work. We intended to recruit as many women as possible to stimulate group engagement within these online communities, and therefore, no participation limit was set.\n\n【130】### Analysis Methods\n\n【131】Because the intent was to identify opportunities to design a care model that aligns with patient needs, we collected data through the following activities: semistructured ethnographic interviews, systematic in-clinic observation, care team feedback sessions, and observations of use behaviors and patient-provider communication through online tools. These data were synthesized using an HCD method called Affinity Diagramming, which is a structured method for mapping ideas into logical, cohesive groups.\n\n【132】无关删除-2*   Holtzblatt K.\n*   Wendell J.B.\n*   Wood S.\n\n【133】Rapid Contextual Design.\n\n【134】Elsevier , Philadelphia, PA 2005\n\n【135】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【136】无关删除-2*   Martin B.\n*   Hanington B.\n*   Hanington B.M.\n\n【137】Universal Methods of Design.\n\n【138】Rockport Publishers , Beverly, MA 2012\n\n【139】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【140】This inductive, bottom-up method enables the design team to identify themes and insights from multiple data sources that are then interpreted and reframed as design opportunities. These design opportunities serve as the underlying rationale for solution options that then undergo further development and iteration.\n\n【141】Results\n-------\n\n【142】The findings articulated in this section describe themes and opportunities discovered through synthesis of the qualitative data captured through this project.\n\n【143】### Self-monitoring\n\n【144】Patients who exchanged prenatal care measurements with their care team reported an increased sense of control, confidence, and reassurance. During ongoing feedback sessions, the care team commented that the multitude of measurements collected by the patient in the comfort of their home (blood pressure, fetal heart rate, weight, and fundal height) inspired similar confidence in the continued normalcy of the pregnancy as onsite visits. Having the tools and knowledge to be experts on their own pregnancy has broadly been perceived by patients as an empowering experience. Moreover, it created an opportunity to shift away from a sickness model of care and a typically paternalistic communication style. As patients interacted with their care team, we observed high levels of engagement, such as articulating norms and trends in blood pressure levels and forming hypotheses between collected measures and health behaviors. Patients also described satisfaction with their care and communication with their care team. Self-monitoring of the fetal heart rate was not only a reassuring and joyous experience, interviews revealed that it allowed for meaningful participation in the pregnancy for both prospective parents and helped to foster a bond with the fetus among the family.\n\n【145】### Text-Based Communication\n\n【146】In traditional prenatal care models, one of the primary mediums for communication is phone-based. Logistically, this often involves several relays between nonmedical and medical personnel before the patient is able to speak to a known care team member. During interviews, women commented that they felt inconvenienced having to repeat, often multiple times, their private and personal health details with additional personnel who were unknown to the patient. In addition, these phone calls would have to be returned by the care team at a later time, which was often when the women were no longer in a private setting to receive their call. By following patients through the course of their care, we observed that this barrier contributed to preventing low-threshold care seeking, with the undesirable result that women would delay their questions and concerns until their upcoming clinic visits with either their doctor or midwife.\n\n【147】Through the use of this text-based communication, women reported that they had a private space to share questions and concerns outside of visits with a designated point person. Moreover, they reported that a direct line of communication with a nurse on their care team fostered a trusted partnership throughout the pregnancy. The nurses and patients noted that the knowledge of help within reach contributed to a sense of continuous care, which is especially important in a flexible care model. Because this communication was text-based, it left a trace of interactions that showed both patients and the care team that information was recorded and reviewed. Women, particularly those who worked outside of the home, also commented that they appreciated the added convenience and privacy of this communication method over phone-based communication. Not only were communication hurdles removed, written correspondence ensured accuracy of information relay, and a low threshold for care seeking. Because the communication was asynchronous, women stated that they felt at ease knowing that they had a place “to hold their questions” and “get them out of their head,” as opposed to waiting until office hours to contact the clinic. The following patient quote exemplified the experience of connected support: “Just knowing this was there was a subconscious comfort – even though you wouldn't know it because I didn't use it that much.”\n\n【148】Recently, secure messaging systems and tools are becoming more widely used in health care organizations. By giving women access to this text-based application, it became evident that in the new model of care, 1 or 2 nurses should be assigned early in pregnancy as the primary point of contact for nonvisit care. In addition, these nurses should be given a text-based platform for easy communication and care continuity.\n\n【149】### Online Communities\n\n【150】During interviews, patients responded favorably overall to having an online community where their own experience and knowledge about pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood were welcomed. Women were respected and empowered for their active contribution as a resource to others rather than being a passive recipient of care. Women reported feeling a bond in sharing their pregnancy experiences and self-care ideas. In addition, although online pregnancy forums are widely available, the participants commented that they appreciated having a moderated online community provided by their care team. The space became a way for the care team not only to expand their impact and reach but also to validate and leverage the expertise of its patients, helping reposition the care team from authoritative expert to supportive partner. Finally, the team saw the potential for these online communities to serve an important transitional role that could bridge the gap between prenatal and postpartum care and ease some of the isolation commonly experienced by women during this phase.\n\n【151】Discussion\n----------\n\n【152】In this project, we reported the outcomes of efforts to validate a series of design concepts, which are a combination of tools collectively referred to as the OB Nest model. This participatory care model, as visualized in Figure 2 , was designed to demedicalize the healthy pregnancy experience and endeavor to evolve from an inflexible linear model to a mother- and family-centric model.\n\n【153】Figure 2 Visual representation of the patient experience in the OB Nest model. By providing women convenient access to answers and reassurance, women perceive continuous support from their obstetric (OB) care team. This reduces patient anxiety throughout the experience, particularly in early pregnancy, while also reducing the reliance on in-person visits. This allows for care to be more adaptive and flexible to patients' needs.\n\n【154】无关删除-2*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【155】Although most women experience pregnancy without substantial complications, the goals of prenatal care remain the detection, management, and amelioration of those complications when they do arise. In envisioning a less medicalized experience for low-risk pregnancies, strategies considered were always within a framework that could equal or even exceed the ability of on-site care to detect complications. If complications develop, a patient's care can be readily converted to a medical model of intervention, which at that point is clearly justified.\n\n【156】Previous studies have demonstrated that a reduced prenatal care visit schedule did not produce suboptimal outcomes.\n\n【157】无关删除-2*   Munjanja S.P.\n*   Lindmark G.\n*   Nyström L.\n\n【158】Randomised controlled trial of a reduced-visits programme of antenatal care in Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\n【159】无关删除-2_Lancet._ 1996; 348 : 364-369\n\n【160】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (117)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【161】无关删除-2*   McDuffie R.S.\n*   Beck A.\n*   Bischoff K.\n*   Cross J.\n*   Orleans M.\n\n【162】Effect of frequency of prenatal care visits on perinatal outcome among low-risk women: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【163】无关删除-2_JAMA._ 1996; 275 : 847-851\n\n【164】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【165】*   Marsh G.N.\n\n【166】New programme of antenatal care in general practice.\n\n【167】无关删除-2_Br Med J (Clin Res Ed)._ 1985; 291 : 646-648\n\n【168】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (22)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【169】However, a reduced visit schedule in prenatal care may leave patients dissatisfied.\n\n【170】无关删除-2*   Sikorski J.\n*   Wilson J.\n*   Clement S.\n*   Das S.\n*   Smeeton N.\n\n【171】A randomised controlled trial comparing two schedules of antenatal visits: the antenatal care project.\n\n【172】无关删除-2_BMJ._ 1996; 312 : 546-553\n\n【173】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (156)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【174】无关删除-2*   Henderson J.\n*   Roberts T.\n*   Sikorski J.\n*   Wilson J.\n*   Clement S.\n\n【175】An economic evaluation comparing two schedules of antenatal visits.\n\n【176】无关删除-2_J Health Serv Res Policy._ 2000; 5 : 69-75\n\n【177】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (19)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【178】This may, in part, be due to a perceived sense of disinterest and disengagement of the care team between scheduled visits. The OB Nest model sought to investigate a model in which visits are redistributed over the prenatal period according to the needs of patients while providing continuous access to the care team and responsive engagement for both emergent and nonemergent needs ( Figure 3 ). The intent behind the design of this model is not to keep women from coming to the clinic. Instead, it is to anticipate their needs and provide access to reassurance in a way that fits patients' lives. The place of care becomes home based instead of clinic based, and the pregnant woman is no longer a passive recipient of care but instead an engaged partner. This shifts the role of the clinic and physician/midwife from expert to supportive partner, enabling the overall prenatal care experience to be more empowering. In addition, by reducing the overall emphasis on in-clinic visits and leveraging the entire care team, this model, under a bundled reimbursement model, offers the potential for a lower-cost alternative to traditional care ( Table ). Although it is possible for patients to be seen electronically as often, if not more within the OB Nest model than they would have been seen in the office visits of the traditional care model, this care can more easily be distributed among the full care team. In addition, these patients can access the other self-service tools in the OB Nest model for support and reassurance.\n\n【179】Figure 3 Visual representation of how the OB Nest model (represented in Figure 2 ) is designed to map to the full continuum of women's medical and nonmedical needs.

The OB Nest model establishes the nurse as the primary point person early in pregnancy, establishing a consistent and coherent model for access to information and, when necessary, medical care. A proactive plan of care early in pregnancy generated a partnership between the care team and the patient through regular remote “check-ins.” The nurse then serves as the primary contact for the woman's nonvisit care experience, providing continuity of care between visits. This nonvisit care experience includes the self-monitoring of key prenatal care metrics, starting at appropriate gestational milestones.\n\n【185】Through this qualitative study that sought to validate the design of a new model of care for women experiencing low-risk pregnancy, we found that the OB Nest model has the potential for the following benefits to women as well as to the practice: (1) lower cost of care, (2) increased access for higher-acuity patients, (3) decreased loss of productivity for the pregnant patient population, (4) greater connections and stronger relationships between patients and their care team, (5) increased patient satisfaction, (6) increased continuity of care, (7) facilities savings, and (8) increased provider engagement and satisfaction. The result of this exploration was the design of an integrated care model. The benefits of the OB Nest model applied to a larger population of women were confirmed in a subsequent randomized clinical trial.\n\n【186】无关删除-2*   Ridgeway J.L.\n*   LeBlanc A.\n*   Branda M.\n*   et al.\n\n【187】Implementation of a new prenatal care model to reduce office visits and increase connectivity and continuity of care: protocol for a mixed-methods study.\n\n【188】_BMC Pregnancy Childbirth._ 2015; 15 : 323\n\n【189】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (24)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【190】Moving away from a sickness model of care can be challenging to hospital philosophy and logistics. However, the application of the insights and tools presented herein may well extend beyond the scope of just low-risk pregnancies, or OB all together. The principles behind this participatory care model could also be well suited for other physiologic or chronic medical conditions.\n\n【191】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【192】In summary, the OB Nest project used an iterative HCD approach to explore opportunities to envision a new, low-risk prenatal care model that is supportive, is empowering, and fits within patients' daily lives. The use of patient-centric care models such as OB Nest have the potential to transform OB care in the United States by providing a more desirable, participatory experience for expectant mothers and their care teams while providing high-quality care at lower cost.\n\n【193】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【194】We thank the staff and providers who are engaged in the OB Nest project, especially Anne Baron, RN, Christine Domask, MS, RN, and Ronda Fishbaugher, RN.\n\n【195】Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------\n\n【196】*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJhOTk5NzViYTBkNTEwNTNlMGM1N2Y0M2NmN2I5NmY2NyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDIyNDA2fQ.NoTOKLiRbQxt3sCgk2WZwg5PsLDbueCRimqmfJGU7tXDZjJYE5uthPGQkcIQav8NONTrb8ZNKx5eRtL-arcNvxObGbclYKLdso41eGPcK9281JIF\\_XqvWyMlMqsIo61VuhPj1F8QyNDUFU4kqklX1RYzEGC618kF2\\_1rdNySNgm\\_qDjIVDgsLWbx4lC0Udac16i5plK523za1EUPz-5pFqY1qBm4pwxMIuEPooRvU-w0v5-jTWIBgmzWxMBEbDFvrmpqE49trS9kcbFKkWgiBbIHrYqeTzNndFO4nVGlUwivI4SaRtVZB2wL88v85KLAvCpGuBVnFvZi6lY7zXgbxw\n\n【197】    Download .mp4 (112.22 MB)\n\n【198】    Help with .mp4 files\n\n【199】    Supplemental Video", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The pain may interrupt sleep. Hanging the legs over the edge of the bed or walking may temporarily relieve the pain.\n\n【11】### When to see a doctor\n\n【12】Call your health care provider if you have leg pain, numbness or other symptoms of peripheral artery disease.\n\n【13】Causes\n------\n\n【14】Peripheral artery disease is often caused by a buildup of fatty, cholesterol-containing deposits (plaques) on artery walls. This process is called atherosclerosis. It reduces blood flow through the arteries.\n\n【15】Atherosclerosis affects arteries throughout the body. When it occurs in the arteries supplying blood to the limbs, it causes peripheral artery disease.\n\n【16】Less common causes of peripheral artery disease include:\n\n【17】*   Blood vessel inflammation\n*   Injury to the arms or legs\n*   Changes in the muscles or ligaments\n*   Radiation exposure\n\n【18】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【19】Smoking or having diabetes greatly increases the risk of developing peripheral artery disease.Other things that increase the risk of peripheral artery disease include:\n\n【20】*   A family history of peripheral artery disease, heart disease or stroke\n*   High blood pressure\n*   High cholesterol\n*   High levels of an amino acid called homocysteine, which increase the risk for coronary artery disease\n*   Increasing age, especially after 65 (or after 50 if you have risk factors for atherosclerosis)\n*   Obesity (a body mass index over 30)\n\n【21】Complications\n-------------\n\n【22】Complications of peripheral artery disease caused by atherosclerosis include:\n\n【23】*   **Critical limb ischemia.** In this condition, an injury or infection causes tissue to die. Symptoms include open sores on the limbs that don't heal. Treatment may include amputation of the affected limb.\n*   **Stroke and heart attack.** Plaque buildup in the arteries can also affect the blood vessels in the heart and brain.\n\n【24】Prevention\n----------\n\n【25】The best way to prevent leg pain due to peripheral artery disease is to maintain a healthy lifestyle. That means:\n\n【26】*   Don't smoke.\n*   Control blood sugar.\n*   Eat foods that are low in saturated fat.\n*   Get regular exercise — but check with your care provider about what type and how much is best for you.\n*   Maintain a healthy weight.\n*   Manage blood pressure and cholesterol.\n\n【27】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Participants were instructed to repeat 5 or more sets of fast and slow walking for 3 minutes each at 70% or more and 40% e V ˙ O 2 peak for walking, respectively, per day for 4 or more d/wk. This study was conducted from April 1, 2005, through February 29, 2008.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Interval walking training increased e V ˙ O 2 peak by 14% and decreased LSD score by 17% on average ( _P_ <.001). During 5-month IWT, fast and slow walking times were 88±65 SD and 100±86 min/wk, respectively, but varied among participants. We divided participants into approximately 10 bins for 6 minutes each of fast and slow walking times per week up to 60 min/wk, and above this time, approximately 8 bins for 30 or 60 minutes each of fast and slow walking up to the maximal time. We found that both e V ˙ O 2 peak and LSD score improved as fast walking time per week increased up to 50 min/wk ( _R_  \\=0.94; _P_ <.001 for e V ˙ O 2 peak ; _R_  \\=0.51; _P_ \\=.03 for LSDS) but plateaued above this time. In contrast, improvement in neither e V ˙ O 2 peak nor LSDS was positively correlated with slow or total walking time per week. Multiple regression analyses confirmed that fast walking time per week was the major determinant of improvements in e V ˙ O 2 peak ( _P_ <.001) and LSD score ( _P_ \\=.001).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】High **\\-** intensity walking time during IWT is a key factor to increase e V ˙ O 2 peak and decrease LSD score in middle-aged and older people.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BMI ( body mass index ), DBP ( diastolic blood pressure ), eV˙O2peak ( estimated peak aerobic capacity ), HR ( heart rate ), IWT ( interval walking training ), LSD ( lifestyle-related disease ), SBP ( systolic blood pressure ), V˙O2peak ( peak aerobic capacity )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Ultram ER\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Tramadol is used to relieve moderate to moderately severe pain, including pain after surgery. The extended-release capsules or tablets are used for chronic ongoing pain.\n\n【6】Tramadol belongs to the group of medicines called opioid analgesics. It acts in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.\n\n【7】When tramadol is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Capsule, Extended Release\n*   Solution\n*   Tablet\n*   Tablet, Extended Release\n*   Capsule, Extended Release, 24 HR\n*   Suspension\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Do not break, crush, chew, snort, or inject it.\n\n【46】### Dosing\n\n【47】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【48】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【49】*   For chronic pain:\n    *   For oral dosage form (extended-release capsules):\n        *   Adults—At first, 100 milligrams (mg) once a day.

You can also check the DEA web site for locations. Here is the link to the FDA safe disposal of medicines website: www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/ensuringsafeuseofmedicine/safedisposalofmedicines/ucm186187.htm\n\n【58】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【59】It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of treatment to make sure the medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【60】Do not use this medicine if you are using or have used an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) such as isocarboxazid \\[Marplan®\\], linezolid \\[Zyvox®\\], phenelzine \\[Nardil®\\], selegiline \\[Eldepryl®\\], tranylcypromine \\[Parnate®\\]) within the past 14 days.\n\n【61】You should not take other medicines that also contain tramadol. This includes Conzip®, Qdolo, Ryzolt™, Ultram®, or Ultracet®. Using these medicines together may increase your chance for more serious side effects.\n\n【62】Check with your doctor before using this medicine with alcohol or other medicines that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The use of alcohol or other medicines that affect the CNS with tramadol may worsen the side effects of this medicine, such as dizziness, poor concentration, drowsiness, unusual dreams, and trouble with sleeping. Some examples of medicines that affect the CNS are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicines, medicine for depression, medicine for anxiety, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics.\n\n【63】This medicine may cause sleep-related breathing problems (eg, sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoxemia). Your doctor may decrease your dose if you have sleep apnea (stop breathing for short periods during sleep) while using this medicine.\n\n【64】Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Check with your doctor right away if your baby has an abnormal sleep pattern, diarrhea, a high-pitched cry, irritability, shakiness or tremors, weight loss, vomiting, or fails to gain weight. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using this medicine.\n\n【65】Tramadol is highly metabolized in the body. Some people change tramadol to a stronger product (O-desmethyltramadol) more quickly than others. These individuals are called \"ultra-rapid metabolizers of tramadol\". Contact your doctor immediately if you experience extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing. These symptoms may indicate that you are an \"ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol.\" As a result, there is too much O-desmethyltramadol in the body and more side effects of O-desmethyltramadol than usual. Children may be especially sensitive to this effect (eg, serious breathing problems, death). Do not give this medicine to:\n\n【66】*   Children younger than 12 years of age.\n*   Children younger than 18 years of age who have had surgery removal of tonsils or adenoids.\n*   Children 12 to 18 years of age who have a high risk for breathing problems (eg, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, lung disease).\n\n【67】If a nursing mother is an ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol, it could lead to an overdose in the nursing baby and cause very serious side effects.\n\n【68】For nursing mothers using this medicine:\n\n【69】*   Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about taking tramadol or about how this medicine may affect your baby.\n*   Call your doctor if you become extremely tired and have difficulty caring for your baby.\n*   Your baby should generally nurse every 2 to 3 hours and should not sleep more than 4 hours at a time.\n*   Check with your doctor, hospital emergency room, or local emergency services (eg, \"call 9-1-1\") immediately if your baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, difficulty breathing, or limpness. These may be symptoms of an overdose and need immediate medical attention.\n\n【70】Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.\n\n【71】This medicine may cause some people to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors. It may also cause some people to have suicidal thoughts and tendencies or to become more depressed. Make sure your doctor knows if you have trouble sleeping, get upset easily, have a big increase in energy, or start to act reckless. Also tell your doctor if you have any sudden or strong feelings, such as feeling nervous, angry, restless, violent, or scared. Let your doctor know if you or anyone in your family has bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disorder) or has tried to commit suicide.\n\n【72】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, or certain skin conditions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis). These reactions can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you or your child have a rash, itching, blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, fever or chills, cough, red irritated eyes, red skin lesions, often with a purple center, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in the mouth or on the lips, trouble breathing or swallowing, unusual tiredness or weakness, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat while you are using this medicine.\n\n【73】This medicine may cause some people to become drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.\n\n【74】This medicine may cause adrenal gland problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have darkening of the skin, diarrhea, dizziness, fainting, loss of appetite, mental depression, nausea, skin rash, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting.\n\n【75】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. Also, lying down for a while may relieve dizziness or lightheadedness. If this problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor right away.\n\n【76】This medicine may cause hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood). Check with your doctor right away if you have coma, confusion, decreased urine output, dizziness, fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, increased thirst, muscle pain or cramps, nausea or vomiting, swelling of the face, ankles, or hands, trouble breathing, or unusual tiredness or weakness.\n\n【77】Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, blurred vision, chills, cold sweats, coma, confusion, cool, pale skin, depression, dizziness, fast heartbeat, headache, increased hunger, nausea, nervousness, nightmares, seizures, shakiness, slurred speech, or unusual tiredness or weakness. These may be symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar level).\n\n【78】Before having any kind of surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment, tell the doctor or dentist in charge that you are taking this medicine. Serious side effects can occur if your doctor or dentist gives you certain medicines without knowing that you have been taking tramadol.\n\n【79】If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once. Your doctor may also give naloxone and other medicines to treat an overdose. Signs of an overdose include: seizures, difficult or trouble breathing, irregular, fast or slow, or shallow breathing, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, pinpoint pupils of the eyes, or trouble breathing.\n\n【80】Do not change your dose or suddenly stop using this medicine without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, including stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, nausea, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble with sleeping.\n\n【81】Using too much of this medicine may cause infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children.\n\n【82】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【83】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【84】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【85】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【86】#### Less common\n\n【87】1.  Abnormal or decreased touch sensation\n2.  blisters under the skin\n3.  bloating\n4.  blood in the urine\n5.  blood pressure increased\n6.  blurred vision\n7.  change in walking and balance\n8.  chest pain or discomfort\n9.  chills\n10.  dark urine\n11.  difficult urination\n12.  dizziness or lightheadedness when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting position\n13.  fainting\n14.  fast heartbeat\n15.  frequent urge to urinate\n16.  gaseous stomach pain\n17.  indigestion\n18.  irregular heartbeat\n19.  loss of memory\n20.  numbness and tingling of the face, fingers, or toes\n21.  pain in the arms, legs, or lower back, especially pain in the calves or heels upon exertion\n22.  pain or discomfort in the arms, jaw, back, or neck\n23.  pains in the stomach, side, or abdomen, possibly radiating to the back\n24.  pale, bluish-colored or cold hands or feet\n25.  recurrent fever\n26.  seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there\n27.  seizures\n28.  severe cramping\n29.  severe nausea\n30.  severe redness, swelling, and itching of the skin\n31.  stomach fullness\n32.  sweating\n33.  swelling of the hands, ankles, feet, or lower legs\n34.  trembling and shaking of the hands or feet\n35.  trouble performing routine tasks\n36.  weak or absent pulses in the legs\n37.  yellow eyes or skin\n\n【88】#### Incidence not known\n\n【89】1.

More than this, however, what makes her a pioneer is that she developed a new way of working with glass. She titled it _filet de Verre,_ a process that encompasses pulling glass into threads, which at first was done by hand and later was refined with the use of a mechanical tool and glass rods.\n\n【11】Masters of Studio Glass: Toots Zynsky website. http://tootszynsky.org/about .

It has a visible weft and raw-edged, uncut fringe, as if it has just been removed from the loom and piled on the floor. It also holds a sense of mystery, as it is clearly a solid piece of glasswork exposed by the light that passes through it and reflects around it. Nature takes a claim to it as well. Bi-valved sea shells and flower petals reminiscent of tulips reside in the undulating shape of _Rallegrare Serena._ It speaks of strength and fragility. Zynsky notes that this is one of the qualities that attracts her to glass: “the fact that it breaks.”\n\n【19】Masters of Studio Glass: Toots Zynsky website. http://tootszynsky.org/about .

During cryotherapy, thin metal probes are inserted through the skin and into the prostate. The probes are filled with a gas that causes the nearby prostate tissue to freeze.\n\n【2】Cryotherapy might be used to treat early-stage prostate cancer that's confined to one part of the prostate if other treatments aren't an option for you. Cryotherapy for prostate cancer can also be used when the cancer has returned after initial treatment.\n\n【3】In the past, cryotherapy for prostate cancer was associated with more long-term side effects than were other prostate cancer treatments. Advances in technology have reduced these side effects. But long-term sexual dysfunction is still a concern with this treatment.\n\n【4】Why it's done\n-------------\n\n【5】Cryotherapy freezes tissue within the prostate gland. This causes the prostate cancer cells to die.\n\n【6】Your doctor may recommend cryotherapy for prostate cancer as an option at different times during your cancer treatment and for different reasons. Cryotherapy might be recommended:\n\n【7】*   As the initial treatment for cancer if your cancer is confined to your prostate and other treatments aren't an option for you\n*   As a treatment for prostate cancer that comes back after your initial treatment\n\n【8】Cryotherapy for prostate cancer generally isn't recommended if you:\n\n【9】*   Previously had surgery for rectal or anal cancer\n*   Have a condition that makes it difficult or impossible to monitor the prostate with an ultrasound probe during the procedure\n*   Have a large tumor that can't be treated with cryotherapy without damaging surrounding tissue and organs, such as the rectum or bladder\n\n【10】Researchers are studying whether cryotherapy to treat one part of the prostate might be an option for cancer that's confined to the prostate. Termed focal therapy, this strategy identifies the area of the prostate that contains the most aggressive cancer cells and treats that area only. Studies have found that focal therapy reduces the risk of side effects. But it's not clear whether it offers the same survival benefits as treatment to the entire prostate.\n\n【11】Risks\n-----\n\n【12】Side effects of cryotherapy for prostate cancer can include:\n\n【13】*   Erectile dysfunction\n*   Pain and swelling of the scrotum and penis\n*   Blood in the urine\n*   Loss of bladder control\n*   Bleeding or infection in the area treated\n\n【14】Rarely, side effects can include:\n\n【15】*   Injury to the rectum\n*   Blockage of the tube (urethra) that carries urine out of the body\n\n【16】How you prepare\n---------------\n\n【17】Your doctor may recommend a fluid solution (enema) to empty your colon. You may receive an antibiotic to prevent infection during the procedure.\n\n【18】What you can expect\n-------------------\n\n【19】### During cryotherapy for prostate cancer\n\n【20】Cryotherapy for prostate cancer is done in the hospital. You may be given a drug called a general anesthetic to put you in a sleep-like state. Sometimes a regional anesthetic is used so that you'll remain aware of your surroundings but won't feel anything in the treatment area.\n\n【21】Once the anesthetic takes effect, your doctor:\n\n【22】*   Places an ultrasound probe in your rectum.\n*   Places a catheter inside the tube (urethra) that carries urine out of the body. The catheter is filled with a warming solution to keep the urethra from freezing during the procedure.\n*   Inserts several thin metal probes or needles through the area between the scrotum and the anus (perineum) into the prostate.\n*   Watches the images generated by the ultrasound probe to ensure correct placement of the needles.\n*   Releases a gas to circulate through the probes or needles that causes freezing in the prostate tissue.\n*   Monitors and controls the temperature of the needles and the amount of freezing within the prostate gland.\n*   May place a catheter into your bladder through your lower abdomen to assist in draining urine after cryotherapy.\n\n【23】### After cryotherapy for prostate cancer\n\n【24】You'll likely be able to go home the day of your procedure, or you may spend the night in the hospital. The catheter may need to remain in place for about two weeks to allow for healing. You might also be given an antibiotic to prevent infection.\n\n【25】After the procedure, you may experience:\n\n【26】*   Soreness and bruising for several days where the probes or needles were placed\n*   Blood in your urine for several days\n*   Problems emptying your bladder and bowels, which usually resolve over time\n\n【27】Results\n-------\n\n【28】After cryotherapy for prostate cancer, you'll have regular follow-up exams as well as periodic imaging scans and laboratory testing to check your cancer's response to treatment.\n\n【29】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Responders (2042) underwent assessment of systolic and diastolic function using echocardiography. The current analyses included all participants with DM and were compared with a group of participants without DM matched 1:2 for age, sex, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Baseline characteristics and laboratory and echocardiography findings between groups were compared along with rates of mortality due to various cardiovascular conditions.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We identified 116 participants with DM and 232 matched participants without DM. Those with DM had a higher body mass index and plasma insulin and serum glucose levels. Although left ventricular ejection fractions were similar, E/e' ratio (9.7 vs 8.5; _P_ \\=.001) was higher in DM vs non-DM. During a follow-up of 10.8 (interquartile range, 7.8-11.7) years, participants with DM had a higher incidence of heart failure (HF); hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence limits, 1.2-3.6; _P_ \\=.01) and 10-year Kaplan-Meier rate of 21% (22 of 116) vs 12% (24 of 232) compared with those without DM. We also examined the subgroup of participants without diastolic dysfunction. In this subgroup, those with DM had an increased risk for HF; hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence limits, 1.0-6.3; _P_ \\=.04).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In this cohort, participants with DM have an increased incidence of HF over a 10-year follow-up period even in the absence of underlying diastolic dysfunction. These findings suggest that DM is an independent risk factor for the development of HF and supports the concept of DM cardiomyopathy.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BMI ( body mass index ), CAD ( coronary artery disease ), DCM ( diabetic cardiomyopathy ), DM ( diabetes mellitus ), E ( passive transmitral left ventricular inflow velocity ), e′ ( tissue Doppler imaging velocity of the medial mitral annulus during passive filling ), EF ( ejection fraction ), HF ( heart failure ), HR ( hazard ratio ), HTN ( hypertension ), LA ( left atrial ), LV ( left ventricular ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), NT-proBNP ( N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide ), REP ( Rochester Epidemiology Project ), ROS ( reactive oxygen species )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\n\n【29】*   Asthma or\n*   Bradycardia (slow heartbeat) or\n*   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe or\n*   Heart block or\n*   Heart failure—Should not use in patients with these conditions .\n\n【30】*   Blood vessel disease (especially blood vessels of the brain) or\n*   Stroke, history of—Use with caution. This medicine may worsen these conditions .\n\n【31】*   Diabetes or\n*   Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) or\n*   Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)—May cover up some of the signs and symptoms of these diseases, such as a fast heartbeat .\n\n【32】*   Lung disease—Use with caution. May cause difficulty with breathing in patients with this condition .\n\n【33】*   Myasthenia gravis—May worsen symptoms of this condition, such as muscle weakness .\n\n【34】Proper Use\n----------\n\n【35】Shake the medicine well just before each use .\n\n【36】To use the eye drops (solution):\n\n【37】*   First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed and apply pressure to the inner corner of the eye with your finger for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.\n*   Immediately after using the medicine, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.\n*   To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed. Serious damage to the eye and possible loss of vision may result from using contaminated eye medicines .\n\n【38】If your doctor ordered two different eye medicines to be used together, wait several minutes before using the second medicine. This will help prevent the second medicine from “washing out” the first one .\n\n【39】You should not use this medicine if you have contact lenses in your eyes. Remove your contact lenses before you use this medicine, and wait 15 minutes before putting the lenses back in .\n\n【40】### Dosing\n\n【41】The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【42】The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\n【43】*   For ophthalmic solution dosage form (eye drops):\n    *   For glaucoma or ocular hypertension:\n        *   Adults—One drop in the affected eye(s) two times a day.\n        *   Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor .\n\n【44】### Missed Dose\n\n【45】If you miss a dose of this medicine, apply it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule.\n\n【46】### Storage\n\n【47】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【48】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【49】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【50】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【51】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【52】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects .\n\n【53】If itching, redness, swelling, or other signs of eye or eyelid irritation occur, stop using this medicine and check with your doctor. These signs may mean that you are allergic to this medicine .\n\n【54】Metipranolol may cause heart failure in some patients. Check with your doctor right away if you are having chest pain or discomfort; dilated neck veins; extreme fatigue; irregular breathing; an irregular heartbeat; shortness of breath; swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs; weight gain; or wheezing .\n\n【55】This medicine may cause changes in your blood sugar levels. Also, this medicine may cover up signs of low blood sugar, such as a rapid pulse rate. Check with your doctor if you have these problems or if you notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests .\n\n【56】Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. You may need to stop using this medicine several days before having surgery .\n\n【57】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【58】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\n\n【59】Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\n\n【60】#### Incidence not determined\n\n【61】1.  Bloody nose\n2.  blurred vision\n3.  burning, dry, or itching eyes\n4.  changes in vision\n5.  chest pain or discomfort\n6.  cough producing mucus\n7.  difficult or labored breathing\n8.  difficulty in moving\n9.  difficulty seeing at night\n10.  difficulty swallowing\n11.  discharge, excessive tearing\n12.  fast, slow, irregular, pounding, or racing heartbeat or pulse\n13.  headache\n14.  hives\n15.  increased sensitivity of eyes to sunlight\n16.  itching\n17.  lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting\n18.  muscle pain or stiffness\n19.  nausea\n20.  nervousness\n21.  pain in forehead\n22.  pain or discomfort in arms, jaw, back, or neck\n23.  pain, swelling, or redness in joints\n24.  pounding in the ears\n25.  puffiness or swelling of the eyelids or around the eyes, face, lips, or tongue\n26.  redness, pain, swelling, or itching of the eye, eyelid, or inner lining of eyelid\n27.  shortness of breath\n28.  skin rash\n29.  sweating\n30.  tightness in chest\n31.  unusual tiredness or weakness\n32.  wheezing\n33.  vomiting\n\n【62】Get emergency help immediately if any of the following symptoms of overdose occur:\n\n【63】#### Symptoms of overdose\n\n【64】1.

There is no specific information comparing use of ophthalmic ofloxacin in the elderly with use in other age groups.\n\n【19】### Breastfeeding\n\n【20】There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.\n\n【21】### Drug Interactions\n\n【22】Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.\n\n【23】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.\n\n【24】*   Bepridil\n*   Cisapride\n*   Dronedarone\n*   Levoketoconazole\n*   Mesoridazine\n*   Pimozide\n*   Piperaquine\n*   Saquinavir\n*   Sparfloxacin\n*   Terfenadine\n*   Thioridazine\n*   Ziprasidone\n\n【25】Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

Lipmann is credited with formulating the general rules for the biotechnology of energy transmission and was a major participant in deciphering the cellular, catalytic, and energetic mechanisms needed to understand how the body builds and renews itself.\n\n【2】Lipmann, whose father was a lawyer, was born on June 12, 1899, in Königsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Lipmann's uncle was a pediatrician and had a great influence on Lipmann's decision to become a physician. Lipmann entered the University of Königsberg in 1917, but his education was interrupted when he served in the German army medical corps during the last months of World War I (1914–1918). After the war, he enrolled at the University of Munich (Germany) and later at the University of Berlin (Germany), from which he received an MD degree in 1924. After receiving his medical degree, he changed his interest to biochemistry. He worked under the direction of Otto Meyerhof (1884–1951) at the University of Berlin and received a PhD degree in 1927.\n\n【3】In 1927, Lipmann became a research assistant to Meyerhof at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin. When Meyerhof moved to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, Lipmann accompanied him, serving as his assistant from 1927 to 1931. In 1931, Lipmann returned to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin to become an assistant to Albert Fischer, who taught him to grow fibroblasts in an in vitro culture, a technique useful in studies of cellular metabolism. In 1932, Lipmann joined Fischer in a new laboratory at the Biological Institute of the Carlsberg Foundation in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he remained until 1939.\n\n【4】In 1939, Nazi control and aggression in Denmark prompted Lipmann to emigrate to the United States, where he became associated with Cornell Medical School in New York City and worked with American biochemist Vincent Du Vigneaud (1901–1978), winner of a 1955 Nobel Prize for the first synthesis of a polypeptide hormone. Lipmann remained at Cornell University until 1941, when he left to become a physician and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1944. From 1949 to 1957, he served as director of the biochemical research department and professor of biological chemistry at the Harvard Medical School.\n\n【5】In 1941, Lipmann proposed the theory of a metabolic dynamo, with adenosine triphosphate as the general link between energy generation and utilization. In the course of his studies on the chemical nature of the active acetate (the building block of lipids) and an intermediary of carbohydrate oxidation, he discovered a new coenzyme, the acetyl-carrying coenzyme A. In 1947, he isolated and named the coenzyme, and in 1953, he determined its molecular structure. Now, coenzyme A is known to be bound to acetic acid as the end product of sugar and fat breakdown in the absence of oxygen. Coenzyme A is one of the most important substances involved in cellular metabolism. It helps in the conversion of amino acids, steroids, fatty acids, and hemoalobin into energy.\n\n【6】In 1957, Lipmann moved to the Rockefeller Institute (now Rockefeller University) in New York City, where he served as a teacher and researcher until his death on July 24, 1986, in Poughkeepsie, NY, at the age of 87 years.\n\n【7】Although Lipmann's major work was in the classification of energy-producing phosphates, he also did research on the thyroid gland, fibroblasts, the Pasteur effect (in the presence of oxygen, anaerobic glycolysis is suppressed), glycolysis in embryo cell metabolism, and the mechanism of peptide and protein synthesis.\n\n【8】In 1995, Grenada issued a stamp in his honor. The stamp is 1 of a set of 9 honoring Nobel laureates.\n\n【9】Article info\n------------\n\n【10】### Identification\n\n【11】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/75.1.30\n\n【12】### Copyright\n\n【13】© 2000 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Qtern\n\n【4】### Descriptions\n\n【5】Saxagliptin and dapagliflozin combination is used together with proper diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. Saxagliptin helps to control blood sugar levels by making the pancreas gland release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar when there is too much sugar in the blood. Dapagliflozin works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. This medicine does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.\n\n【6】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【7】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【8】*   Tablet\n\n【9】Before Using\n------------\n\n【10】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Keep from freezing.\n\n【50】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【51】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【52】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【53】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【54】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits, especially during the first few weeks that you take this medicine. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.\n\n【55】Pancreatitis (swelling and inflammation of the pancreas) may occur while you are using this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have sudden and severe stomach pain, chills, constipation, nausea, vomiting, fever, or lightheadedness.\n\n【56】Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain or tightness, decreased urine output, dilated neck veins, extreme fatigue, irregular breathing, irregular heartbeat, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, trouble breathing, or weight gain. These may be signs of heart failure.\n\n【57】Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur with this medicine. This is more common if you have kidney disease, low blood pressure, or if you are taking a diuretic (water pill). Taking plenty of fluids each day may help. Drink plenty of water during exercise or in hot weather. Check with your doctor if you have severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that does not stop. This may cause you to lose too much water.\n\n【58】Ketoacidosis (high ketones and acid in the blood) may occur while you are using this medicine. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Your doctor may give you insulin, fluid, and carbohydrate replacement to treat this condition. Tell your doctor right away if you have nausea, vomiting, trouble breathing, increased thirst or urination, or stomach pain.\n\n【59】This medicine may increase risk of having urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis or urosepsis. Check with your doctor right away if you have bladder pain, bloody or cloudy urine, difficult, burning, or painful urination, or lower back or side pain.\n\n【60】This medicine may cause vaginal yeast infections in women and yeast infections of the penis in men. This is more common in patients who have a history of genital yeast infections or in men who are not circumcised. Women may have a vaginal discharge, itching, or odor. Men may have redness, itching, swelling, or pain around the penis, or a discharge with a strong odor from the penis. Check with your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms.\n\n【61】This medicine may cause a rare but serious bacterial infection, called necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier's gangrene, which can cause damage to the tissue under the skin in the area between and around the anus and genitals (perineum). Fournier's gangrene may lead to hospitalization, multiple surgeries, or death. Check with your doctor right away if you have fever, unusual tiredness or weakness, or pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling of the area between and around your anus and genitals.\n\n【62】This medicine may cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This is more common when this medicine is taken together with certain medicines. Low blood sugar must be treated before it causes you to pass out (unconsciousness). People feel different symptoms of low blood sugar. It is important that you learn which symptoms you usually have so you can treat it quickly. Some symptoms of low blood sugar include: behavior changes that are similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, cool, pale skin, difficulty with thinking, drowsiness, excessive hunger, a fast heartbeat, headaches that continue, nausea, shakiness, slurred speech, or unusual tiredness or weakness. Talk to your doctor about how to treat low blood sugar.\n\n【63】Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your medicine, overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual. High blood sugar can be very serious and must be treated right away. It is important that you learn which symptoms you have in order to treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat high blood sugar.\n\n【64】This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, or certain skin conditions. These reactions can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, fever or chills, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat while you are using this medicine.\n\n【65】This medicine may cause severe joint pain. Call your doctor right away if you have severe joint pain with this medicine.\n\n【66】This medicine may cause bullous pemphigoid. Tell your doctor if you have large, hard skin blisters while using this medicine.\n\n【67】Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. You may need to stop using this medicine for at least 3 days before you have surgery. This medicine may affect the results of certain medical tests (eg, urine glucose tests may not be accurate).\n\n【68】Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.\n\n【69】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【70】Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.

Based on the American Heart Association’s Life’s Simple 7 metrics, participants were classified as having poor, intermediate, or ideal PA.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】After adjustment for possible confounding factors, ideal PA was associated with lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (β, −0.15; 95% CI, −0.15 to −0.002) and a lower prevalence of CAC (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51-0.96) compared with poor PA. During a median of 12.8 years of follow-up, there were 164 incident CHD events (3.3/1000 person-years). Ideal PA was associated with a lower rate of incident CHD compared with poor PA (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31-0.98).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In a large community-based African American cohort, ideal PA was associated with lower inflammation levels, a lower prevalence of CAC, and a lower rate of incident CHD. These findings suggest that promotion of ideal PA may be an important way to reduce the risk of subclinical and future clinical CHD in African Americans.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AHA ( American Heart Association ), BMI ( body mass index ), CAC ( coronary artery calcification ), CHD ( coronary heart disease ), CV ( cardiovascular ), hs-CRP ( high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ), JHS ( Jackson Heart Study ), PA ( physical activity )\n\n【11】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【15】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【17】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "1128317e-6a54-4835-8bf5-a72e94d09188", "title": "Encephalitis", "text": "【0】Overview\n--------\n\n【1】Encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is inflammation of the brain. There are several causes, including viral infection, autoimmune inflammation, bacterial infection, insect bites and others. When inflammation is caused by an infection in the brain, it's known as infectious encephalitis. And when it's caused by your own immune system attacking the brain, it's known as autoimmune encephalitis. Sometimes there is no known cause.\n\n【2】In some cases, encephalitis can be life-threatening. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important because it's difficult to predict how encephalitis will affect each individual.\n\n【3】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【4】Encephalitis may cause many different symptoms including confusion, personality changes, seizures or problems with movement. Encephalitis also may cause changes in sight or hearing.\n\n【5】Most people with infectious encephalitis have flu-like symptoms, such as:\n\n【6】*   Headache.\n*   Fever.\n*   Aches in muscles or joints.\n*   Fatigue or weakness.\n\n【7】Typically, these are followed by more-severe symptoms over a period of hours to days, such as:\n\n【8】*   Stiff neck.\n*   Confusion, agitation or hallucinations.\n*   Seizures.\n*   Loss of sensation or being unable to move certain areas of the face or body.\n*   Irregular movements.\n*   Muscle weakness.\n*   Problems with speech or hearing.\n*   Loss of consciousness, including coma.\n\n【9】In infants and young children, signs and symptoms also might include:\n\n【10】*   Bulging in the soft spots of an infant's skull, known as fontanels.\n*   Nausea and vomiting.\n*   Stiffness affecting the whole body.\n*   Poor feeding or not waking for a feeding.\n*   Irritability.\n\n【11】In cases of autoimmune encephalitis, symptoms may develop more slowly over several weeks. Flu-like symptoms are less common, but can sometimes happen weeks before more-severe symptoms start. Symptoms are different for everyone, but it's common for people to have a combination of symptoms including:\n\n【12】*   Changes in personality.\n*   Memory loss.\n*   Problems understanding what is real and what is not, known as psychosis.\n*   Seeing or hearing things that aren't there. These are called hallucinations.\n*   Seizures.\n*   Changes in vision.\n*   Sleep problems.\n*   Muscle weakness.\n*   Loss of sensation.\n*   Problems walking.\n*   Abnormal movements.\n*   Bladder and bowel problems.\n\n【13】### When to see a doctor\n\n【14】Get immediate care if you are experiencing any of the more-severe symptoms associated with encephalitis. A severe headache, fever and change in consciousness require urgent care.\n\n【15】Infants and young children with any signs or symptoms of encephalitis should receive urgent care.\n\n【16】Causes\n------\n\n【17】In approximately half of patients, the exact cause of encephalitis is not known.\n\n【18】In those for whom a cause is identified, there are two main types of encephalitis:\n\n【19】*   **Infectious encephalitis.** This condition occurs when a virus or other agent directly infects the brain. The infection may affect one area or be widespread. Viruses are the most common causes of infectious encephalitis, including some that can be passed by mosquitoes or ticks. Very rarely, encephalitis may be caused by bacteria, fungus or parasites.\n*   **Autoimmune encephalitis.** This condition occurs when your own immune cells mistakenly attack the brain or make antibodies targeting proteins and receptors in the brain. The exact reason why this happens is not completely understood. Sometimes the abnormal immune response can be triggered by benign or cancerous tumors, known as paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis. Other types of autoimmune encephalitis such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) can be triggered by infection in your body. This is known as post-infectious autoimmune encephalitis. In many instances, no definitive trigger for the abnormal immune response is identified.\n\n【20】### Common viral causes\n\n【21】The viruses that can cause encephalitis include:\n\n【22】*   **Herpes simplex virus (HSV).** Both HSV type 1 — associated with cold sores and fever blisters around your mouth — and HSV type 2 — associated with genital herpes — can cause encephalitis. Encephalitis caused by HSV type 1 is rare but can result in significant brain damage or death.\n*   **Other herpes viruses.** These include the Epstein-Barr virus, which commonly causes infectious mononucleosis, and the varicella-zoster virus, which commonly causes chickenpox and shingles.\n*   **Enteroviruses.** These viruses include the poliovirus and the coxsackievirus, which usually cause an illness with flu-like symptoms, eye inflammation and abdominal pain.\n*   **Mosquito-borne viruses.** These viruses can cause infections such as West Nile, La Crosse, St. Louis, western equine and eastern equine encephalitis. Symptoms of an infection might appear within a few days to a couple of weeks after exposure to a mosquito-borne virus.\n*   **Tick-borne viruses.** The Powassan virus is carried by ticks and causes encephalitis in the Midwestern United States. Symptoms usually appear about a week after a bite from an infected tick.\n*   **Rabies virus.** Infection with the rabies virus, which is usually transmitted by a bite from an infected animal, causes a rapid progression to encephalitis once symptoms begin. Rabies is a rare cause of encephalitis in the United States.\n\n【23】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【24】Anyone can develop encephalitis. Factors that may increase the risk include:\n\n【25】*   **Age.** Some types of encephalitis are more common or more-severe in certain age groups. In general, young children and older adults are at greater risk of most types of viral encephalitis. Similarly, some forms of autoimmune encephalitis are more common in children and young adults, whereas others are more common in older adults.\n*   **Weakened immune system.** People who have HIV/AIDS, take immune-suppressing medicines or have another condition causing a weakened immune system are at increased risk of encephalitis.\n*   **Geographical regions.** Mosquito- or tick-borne viruses are common in particular geographical regions.\n*   **Season of the year.** Mosquito- and tick-borne diseases tend to be more common in summer in many areas of the United States.\n*   **Autoimmune disease.** People who already have an autoimmune condition may be more prone to develop autoimmune encephalitis.\n*   **Smoking.** Smoking increases the chances of developing lung cancer, which in turn increases the risk of developing paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis.\n\n【26】Complications\n-------------\n\n【27】The complications of encephalitis vary, depending on factors such as:\n\n【28】*   Your age.\n*   The cause of your infection.\n*   The severity of your initial illness.\n*   The time from disease onset to treatment.\n\n【29】People with relatively mild illness usually recover within a few weeks with no long-term complications.\n\n【30】### Complications of severe illness\n\n【31】Inflammation can injure the brain, possibly resulting in a coma or death.\n\n【32】Other complications may last for months or be permanent. These complications can vary widely in severity and can include:\n\n【33】*   Persistent fatigue.\n*   Weakness or lack of muscle coordination.\n*   Personality changes.\n*   Memory problems.\n*   Hearing or vision defects.\n*   Speech impairments.\n\n【34】Prevention\n----------\n\n【35】The best way to prevent viral encephalitis is to take precautions to avoid exposure to viruses that can cause the disease. Try to:\n\n【36】*   **Practice good hygiene.** Wash hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before and after meals.\n*   **Don't share utensils.** Don't share tableware and beverages.\n*   **Teach your children good habits.** Make sure they practice good hygiene and avoid sharing utensils at home and school.\n*   **Get vaccinations.** Keep your own and your children's vaccinations current. Before traveling, talk to your health care provider about recommended vaccinations for different destinations.\n\n【37】### Protection against mosquitoes and ticks\n\n【38】To minimize your exposure to mosquitoes and ticks:\n\n【39】*   **Dress to protect yourself.** Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants if you're outside between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active, and when you're in a wooded area with tall grasses and shrubs where ticks are more common.\n*   **Apply mosquito repellent.** Chemicals such as DEET can be applied to both the skin and clothes. To apply repellent to your face, spray it on your hands and then wipe it on your face. If you're using both sunscreen and a repellent, apply sunscreen first.\n*   **Use insecticide.** The Environmental Protection Agency recommends the use of products containing permethrin, which repels and kills ticks and mosquitoes. These products can be sprayed on clothing, tents and other outdoor gear. Permethrin shouldn't be applied to the skin.\n*   **Avoid mosquitoes.** Refrain from unnecessary activity in places where mosquitoes are most common. If possible, avoid being outdoors from dusk till dawn, when mosquitoes are most active. Repair broken windows and screens.\n*   **Get rid of water sources outside your home.** Eliminate standing water in your yard, where mosquitoes can lay their eggs. Common problems include flowerpots or other gardening containers, flat roofs, old tires, and clogged gutters.\n*   **Look for outdoor signs of viral disease.** If you notice sick or dying birds or animals, report your observations to your local health department.\n\n【40】### Protection for young children\n\n【41】Insect repellents aren't recommended for use on infants younger than 2 months of age. Instead, cover an infant carrier or stroller with mosquito netting.\n\n【42】For older infants and children, repellents with 10% to 30% DEET are considered safe. Products containing both DEET and sunscreen aren't recommended for children because reapplication — which might be necessary for the sunscreen component — will expose the child to too much DEET.\n\n【43】Tips for using mosquito repellent with children include:\n\n【44】*   Always assist children with the use of mosquito repellent.\n*   Spray on clothing and exposed skin.\n*   Apply the repellent when outdoors to lessen the risk of inhaling the repellent.\n*   Spray repellent on your hands and then apply it to your child's face. Take care around the eyes and ears.\n*   Don't use repellent on the hands of young children who may put their hands in their mouths.\n*   Wash treated skin with soap and water when you come indoors.\n\n【45】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Some reasons are increased outdoor air pollution, particularly ozone and diesel exhaust particles; more time spent indoors in tight, inadequately ventilated buildings; and physicians becoming more likely to use the diagnosis of “asthma.”\n\n【6】In response to this increase, organizations in several countries have convened expert panels to prepare guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma. As a result of considerable peer critique, updated revisions of the recommendations have become remarkably consistent internationally. Published reports stress the careful process of consideration by which the panels reached their conclusions. The guidelines are primarily evidence-based and rely heavily on meta-analyses. Also, because of the variability among different patients and in the same patient at different times, the guidelines stress the importance of carefully tailoring the management to fit the individual. The guidelines provide primary care physicians with advice on the best way to provide each patient with effective cost-efficient control of this chronic lymphocytic-eosinophilic inflammatory disease of the airways.\n\n【7】*   Boulet L-P\n\n【8】Asthma guidelines and outcomes.\n\n【9】无关删除-2in: Adkinson Jr, NF Yunginger JW Busse WW Bochner BS Holgate ST Simons FER 6th ed.

This prospective 2-year placebo-controlled study of the possible adverse effects of daily inhalation of aerosol fluticasone, a topical corticosteroid, on bone mineral density and function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and on development of cataracts or glaucoma showed that the low dose advised for mild, persistent asthma had no adverse effect. The dose that was 5 times higher, advised for severe asthma, had a minimal, transient effect on cortisol production. At the end of the 2-year study, baseline blood cortisol concentrations and cortisol response to stimulation by corticotropin were normal. Can the results of this study be extended to other topical corticosteroids and to other aerosol delivery systems? Not necessarily. Although it is impractical to conduct large-scale prospective controlled trials comparing all the different available formulations, the results reported from most studies of different inhaled corticosteroids and different delivery systems have shown similar efficacy and safety. The critical point is that inhaled corticosteroids do not have the clinically important adverse effects on bone mineral density, cortisol production, and glucose metabolism caused by equivalently effective doses of oral glucocorticoids like prednisone.\n\n【79】An important point in the study by Kemp et al is the use of a metered dose inhaler propelled with chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). Because of environmental concerns about CFC damage to the ozone layer, this delivery system is rapidly being supplanted by dry powder delivery systems or metered dose inhalers with the corticosteroid dissolved in hydrofluoroalkane. These newer delivery systems usually require a lower dose to control asthma compared with CFC metered dose inhalers and provide better deposition in the smaller airways that may reduce the poorly reversible obstruction from airway remodeling in patients with more severe disease. However, efficacy of aerosol treatment depends substantially less on the device than it does on the patient's skill in using it. As physicians, we take it for granted that all patients can swallow a pill, but we should not assume that all patients can use an inhaler. Using an inhaler is like riding a bicycle; it is a skill that has to be learned by coaching and experience.\n\n【80】Reasons that patients do not follow the advice from guidelines include a lack of education, particularly that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease and the importance of controlling the environmental causes of the inflammation; a lack of feeling that they are active participants in their care; a belief that inhaled corticosteroids are not needed during asymptomatic periods; and a concern about adverse effects. Not surprisingly, patients with asthma severe enough to require hospital care are more likely to comply.\n\n【81】*   Chambers CV\n*   Markson L\n*   Diamond JJ\n*   Lasch L\n*   Berger M\n\n【82】Health beliefs and compliance with inhaled corticosteroids by asthmatic patients in primary care practices.\n\n【83】无关删除-2_Respir Med._ 1999; 93 : 88-94\n\n【84】无关删除-2*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (164)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【85】For some, the cost of medications is a substantial barrier.\n\n【86】What else can be done to improve compliance besides convincing primary care physicians that control of airway inflammation is safe and effective?

We sought to characterize the PA level and differences in activity level during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the year 2019 in recipients of CIEDs enrolled in the BIOTRONIK CERTITUDE registry.\n\n【45】Methods\n-------\n\n【46】### Data Sources\n\n【47】The CERTITUDE program was established to analyze data for US patients implanted with a BIOTRONIK CIED collected via the BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring remote cardiac device monitoring system (BIOTRONIK SE & Co. KG, Berlin, Germany), which gained initial US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2001, and has been described previously.\n\n【48】*   Lazarus A.\n\n【49】Remote, wireless, ambulatory monitoring of implantable pacemakers, cardioverter defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization therapy systems: analysis of a worldwide database.\n\n【50】_Pacing Clin Electrophysiol._ 2007; 30 : S2-S12\n\n【51】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【52】The CERTITUDE registry consists of approximately 50,000 US patients implanted with 60,000 market-released BIOTRONIK implantable loop recorder, pacemaker, cardiac resynchronization therapy with a pacemaker (CRT-P), ICD, and cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) devices with BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring capability. These patients have provided authorization for the use of their data for research purposes. The Advarra Institutional Review Board (Columbia, MD) reviewed and approved the CERTITUDE program, which granted a Waiver of Informed Consent and a Full Waiver of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Authorization. A steering committee of independent physicians reviews investigator-initiated CERTITUDE proposals before execution. A charter establishes the conduct of the CERTITUDE Steering Committee and BIOTRONIK personnel.\n\n【53】The CERTITUDE registry dataset consists of remote monitoring transmission data for these 60,000 CIEDs, supplemented by device registration and demographic data obtained from the BIOTRONIK US device-tracking database. Remote monitoring data from January 2019 to August 2020, including PA, atrial arrhythmia burden (atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation burden), heart rate variability, mean ventricular heart rate, and corresponding demographic and device registration data were evaluated for this study.\n\n【54】### Study Population\n\n【55】Individuals from the CERTITUDE registry implanted with a BIOTRONIK pacemaker, CRT-P, ICD, or CRT-D on or after January 1, 2010, were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Patients with an eligible device implanted after December 31, 2018, patients without at least one remote transmission per month in January to August of 2019 and 2020 (eg, missing remote transmission, patient death, and device explant without replacement), and patients who underwent a procedure to change device type during the study time period (eg, ICD to CRT-D) were excluded.\n\n【56】### Home Monitoring Parameters\n\n【57】Patient PA is reported daily as a percentage value, representing the time in a state of \"activity\" determined by comparing the acceleration measured by a capacitive single-axis accelerometer at ∼0.4 Hz to a threshold value. The accelerometer collects PA data independent of the programming of rate-responsive mode. PA values were converted to minutes per day, and activity data obtained within the first 45 days of the device implant were excluded due to potential restrictions on activity for patients immediately after the implantation. Heart rate variability is assessed based on the standard deviation of the 5-minute mean normal to normal interval over the recorded time based on the atrial P-P rate. Mean ventricular heart rate reports the daily mean ventricular rate calculated using sensed ventricular events, paced ventricular events, premature ventricular contractions, and ventricular rate stabilization events. The atrial arrhythmia burden (atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation burden) is reported as a percentage value, representing the time per day spent in device-detected atrial tachyarrhythmia.\n\n【58】### Statistical Analysis\n\n【59】Continuous variables were reported using means with SD, whereas categorical variables were reported using frequencies with percentages. Paired _t_ tests (two-tailed) were used to compare continuous variables between months for 2020 and 2019. Using a reduction threshold of 10 min/d between 2019 and 2020, subjects were classified as above or below the threshold, and a two-tailed binomial proportional test was conducted to determine if a majority of subjects had higher reductions between the periods. Plots of weekly averages were generated for continuous variables across the study's total time frame (January 1, 2019, to August 31, 2020), and for January to August, stratified by year. Spearman's rank-order correlation was used to assess the correlation between PA and atrial arrhythmia burden in each month of 2020. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) using a significance level of 0.05.\n\n【60】Results\n-------\n\n【61】### Physical Activity\n\n【62】A total of 21,660 individuals from the CERTITUDE registry were implanted with a BIOTRONIK pacemaker, CRT-P, ICD, or CRT-D, meeting all eligibility requirements. Figure 1 details the derivation of the study cohort. The baseline characteristics of the cohort are presented in Table 1 . The mean age of the cohort was 72.6±11.6 years, and 12,411 (57.3%) were male. The mean follow-up duration, defined as first-to-last remote transmission, was 1.66±0.01 years (607.0±3.64 days), and a total of 12.3 million days with transmission were analyzed. The mean transmission number of days per individual was 568.66±3.64 days, and the mean transmission completeness per individual during the follow-up period was 93.5%. The mean daily and weekly duration spent being physically active in January through August in 2020 is compared with 2019 in Table 2 and Figure 2 A, respectively. A significant decline in time spent being physically active was noted following the pandemic declaration in 2020, with a maximum mean reduction of -24.5±36.3 minutes ( _P_ <.0001) observed in April 2020 compared with 2019. PA in 2020 increased from April to May, with PA for all months in 2020 at lower levels than 2019. More than half of the cohort experienced a reduction in PA of 10 minutes or more in March through August 2020, consistent with widespread effect across the cohort ( Table 2 ).\n\n【63】Figure 1 Flow chart showing the derivation of the study cohort.

Heart rate variability represented by variability in the atrial rate was lower in March through August 2020 than corresponding months in 2019 ( Supplementary Table 1 ). However, these changes were small and of unknown clinical significance. The burden of atrial arrhythmia progressively increased throughout the study ( Supplementary Figure , available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ). There was no correlation between PA and atrial arrhythmia burden in each month of the pandemic ( Supplementary Table 2 , available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ).\n\n【92】Discussion\n----------\n\n【93】Using data from a large patient cohort from the BIOTRONIK CERTITUDE registry, we report a significant decrease in device-detected PA following the global COVID-19 pandemic declaration in March 2020, compared with the same period in 2019.

Besides, the timing and severity of the COVID-19 infection peak have also varied between states. Despite these variations from state to state, we observed a parallel reduction in PA in all regions of the country. However, the majority of the states had stringent restrictions in the months of March and April compared with the rest of the study period, which corresponded to the most significant decline in recorded PA. This observation may be secondary to self-imposed quarantine in patients with chronic diseases due to public knowledge of the reported higher mortality and need for intensive care unit support in individuals older than 60 years and those with known cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【111】无关删除-2*   Wang D.\n*   Hu B.\n*   Hu C.\n*   et al.\n\n【112】Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China.\n\n【113】无关删除-2_JAMA._ 2020; 323 : 1061-1069\n\n【114】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (15144)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【115】无关删除-2*   Williamson E.J.\n*   Walker A.J.\n*   Bhaskaran K.\n*   et al.\n\n【116】Factors associated with COVID-19–related death using OpenSAFELY.\n\n【117】无关删除-2_Nature._ 2020; 584 : 430-436\n\n【118】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (3444)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【119】For instance, Guo et al\n\n【120】无关删除-2*   Guo T.\n*   Fan Y.\n*   Chen M.\n*   et al.\n\n【121】Cardiovascular implications of fatal outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n【122】无关删除-2_JAMA Cardiol._ 2020; 5 : 811-818\n\n【123】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2630)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【124】reported that patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases had higher mortality and a higher likelihood of myocardial injury with COVID-19 infection.

Pathogens of particular concern include extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and multidrug-resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ . Classic agents used to treat these pathogens have become outdated. Of the few new drugs available, many have already become targets for bacterial mechanisms of resistance. This review describes the current approach to infections due to these resistant organisms and elaborates on the available treatment options.\n\n【1】ESBL ( extended-spectrum β-lactamase ), IV ( intravenously ), KPC ( Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase ), MDR ( multidrug-resistant ), MIC ( minimum inhibitory concentration )\n\n【2】Antimicrobial resistance has been shaping the field of infectious diseases since the discovery of penicillin. Many of the advances in antimicrobial drug development have resulted from efforts to combat ever-evolving mechanisms of resistance that render existing agents obsolete, thus prompting the search for new molecules that promise to be more effective and more resilient. Yet, the hope for a magic all-encompassing antimicrobial agent has long passed, and the number of new antimicrobial agents in the drug development pipeline is a small fraction of what it used to be.\n\n【3】Nowhere is the concept of antimicrobial resistance better portrayed than with the gram-negative bacilli, which have proven to be tough adversaries for clinicians and researchers alike. Of the 6 famous ESKAPE pathogens ( _Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter_ species, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , and _Enterobacter_ species) recognized as the most important emerging threats of this century, 4 are gram-negative bacilli ( _K pneumoniae, Acinetobacter_ species, _P aeruginosa_ , and _Enterobacter_ species).\n\n【4】*   Peterson LR\n\n【5】Bad bugs, no drugs: no ESCAPE revisited.\n\n【6】无关删除-2_Clin Infect Dis._ 2009; 49 : 992-993\n\n【7】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (115)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【8】This review will address 3 major types of multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative pathogens: extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and MDR _P aeruginosa_ . The resistance mechanisms exhibited by these organisms and the epidemiology of the infections they cause will be discussed. Existing and emerging therapeutic approaches to each type of organism will then be surveyed.\n\n【9】MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE\n------------------------\n\n【10】Production of β-lactamase is the most commonly encountered mechanism of resistance of bacterial pathogens to β-lactam antibiotics. Many enzymes have been described, encoded either by chromosomal genes or by genes located on movable elements such as plasmids and transposons.

Central to this approach is the recognition that delayed therapy correlates with increased mortality even when a patient is considered clinically stable at the time of initial evaluation.\n\n【390】*   Tam VH\n*   Rogers CA\n*   Chang KT\n*   Weston JS\n*   Caeiro JP\n*   Garey KW\n\n【391】Impact of multidrug-resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ bacteremia on patient outcomes.\n\n【392】无关删除-2_Antimicrob Agents Chemother._ 2010; 54 : 3717-3722\n\n【393】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (134)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【394】Because the treatment of serious _P aeruginosa_ infections is frequently empirical until the organism is isolated and susceptibility testing performed, high resistance rates raise the likelihood of administering inappropriate initial therapy, hence contributing to the observed high mortality rates.\n\n【395】**Antibiotic Options.** When used in the appropriate dosage, the following agents have shown reliable activity against _Pseudomonas_ isolates.\n\n【396】**_Antipseudomonal Penicillins_ .** Ticarcillin should be dosed at 3 g IV every 4 hours and piperacillin at 4 g IV every 4 hours.\n\n【397】**_β-Lactam/β-Lactamase Inhibitor Combinations_ .** Ticarcillin-clavulanate should be dosed at 3 g of ticarcillin and 0.1 g of clavulanic acid IV every 4 hours, and piperacillin-tazobactam should be dosed at 4 g of piperacillin and 0.5 g of tazobactam IV every 6 hours or 3 g of piperacillin and 0.375 g of tazobactam IV every 4 hours.\n\n【398】**_Cephalosporins_ .** Ceftazidime should be dosed at 2 g IV every 8 hours and cefepime at 2 g IV every 8 hours.

PubMed ( http://www.pubmed.gov ) provides free access to the largest biomedical resource available and is updated daily. Clinicians can use this resource to find answers to focused clinical questions quickly and efficiently. The purpose of this article is to assist clinicians in the development of the basic skills required to use PubMed to make informed clinical decisions.\n\n【1】av ( arteriovenous ), MeSH ( Medical Subject Heading ), NLM ( National Library of Medicine )\n\n【2】The amount of medical information doubles every 5 years.\n\n【3】*   Mattox DE\n\n【4】Welcome to ARCHIVES CME.\n\n【5】_Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg._ 2000; 126 : 914\n\n【6】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (11)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【7】For practicing clinicians, staying abreast of advances in medicine is becoming a major challenge. To continue to provide the best possible patient care, clinicians must have access to resources that will assist them in making clinical decisions. Although several commercial products are available that synthesize large amounts of medical information into easily digestible reviews, these services frequently rely on overviews conducted by experts and may not be current. Furthermore, clinicians may have specific clinical questions that are better answered with a single article or systematic review rather than a broad topical review.\n\n【8】PubMed, a resource developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Library of Medicine (NLM), provides free access to MEDLINE (MEDLARS Online) and other databases to any person who has Internet access.\n\n【9】*   National Library of Medicine\n\n【10】PubMed overview.\n\n【11】Available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query/static/overview.html\n\n【12】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【13】MEDLINE is the NLM database of all published biomedical literature relevant to clinical practice. It is updated daily and contains more than 11 million references dating back to the 1960s from more than 4000 selected journals from 70 countries. Clinicians seeking information can search PubMed through Entrez, a text-based search and retrieval system at http://www.pubmed.gov . Entrez also provides access to other research-oriented databases.\n\n【14】The purpose of this article is to introduce clinicians to this powerful resource. We use clinical cases to highlight several important features, and we encourage readers to conduct the searches online as they work through the examples. All the actions that readers should complete are in italics. The names of the features in PubMed are capitalized.\n\n【15】CASE 1\n------\n\n【16】A 45-year-old man presents with a 10-month history of burning epigastric pain that has not improved with a proton-pump inhibitor. Findings on upper endoscopy are normal, but _Helicobacter pylori_ serology is positive. You ask yourself, “In patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia, does the treatment of _Helicobacter pylori_ improve symptoms?”\n\n【17】### Developing Well-Built Clinical Questions: Key to Successful Searching\n\n【18】The most successful searches are accomplished if users select the most precise terms for the search. Finding numerous, apparently irrelevant articles is likely to discourage the clinician from looking further. These terms are best defined by learning to ask “well-built clinical questions.”\n\n【19】*   Oxman AD\n*   Sackett DL\n*   Guyatt GH\n*   Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group\n\n【20】Users' guides to the medical literature, I: how to get started.\n\n【21】无关删除-2_JAMA._ 1993; 270 : 2093-2095\n\n【22】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (596)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【23】Such questions are constructed by breaking down questions that arise from a clinical encounter into 4 components: (1) patient/problem, (2) intervention, (3) comparison intervention, and (4) outcome. For the aforementioned clinical question, the patient/problem would be “non-ulcer dyspepsia,” the intervention would be “treatment of _Helicobacter pylori_ infection,” the comparison intervention would be “no treatment,” and the outcome would be to “improve symptoms.” These phrases can be used as PubMed search terms to retrieve relevant citations that will assist in making the appropriate clinical decision. At least 2 terms should usually be entered to begin the search (ie, _“helicobacter pylori_ “ and “non-ulcer dyspepsia”), but more can be entered to increase search relevance.\n\n【24】### PubMed Homepage\n\n【25】_Logon to Pubmed_ ( http://www.pubmed.gov ).\n\n【26】The PubMed homepage ( http://www.pubmed.gov ) provides users with a Query box, a text box into which search terms are entered ( Figure 1 ). The black menu bar above the Query box provides access to other databases. The homepage provides a Features bar that allows users to set Limits on searches and Preview the number of results that a search will retrieve before displaying the citations. The History feature is available after the first search and reviews the results of up to 100 prior searches. PubMed also provides users with an electronic Clipboard that can be used to compile up to 500 citations from multiple searches. The Clipboard erases the contents after 1 hour of inactivity. Users can visualize the search techniques employed by PubMed with the Details feature. The Features bar and Query box are available from every screen. PubMed also provides resources such as an Overview, online Help, and frequently asked questions (FAQ) on the blue sidebar on the left-hand side of each screen.\n\n【27】Figure 1 Entrez at http://www.pubmed.gov .\n\n【28】无关删除-2*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【29】_Type “helicobacter pylori” in the Query box and select the Go button._\n\n【30】Citations are displayed from the newest to the oldest in a default Summary format. PubMed will search back to 1966 unless a date limit is specified. The drop-down menu Display allows the user the option of viewing the retrieved citations in a variety of formats. The number of citations are shown on the gray bar, and the first 20 are shown by default. More citations can be displayed by selecting the desired number with the drop-down menu on the left. The number of pages of citations is also displayed on the gray bar, and specific pages can be reviewed by selecting the blue numbers on the right. Users can save the references and display them as a text file. This text file can be imported easily into commercially available reference manager software.\n\n【31】### Boolean Operators\n\n【32】PubMed searches can be refined by using multiple search terms connected by Boolean operators: AND, OR, and NOT. Boolean operators must be entered in upper case. The operator AND selects the references that contain both search terms, OR selects the references that contain either search term, and NOT selects the references that contain the first term but not the second term. NOT should be used carefully, if at all. NOT is an absolute, and it can have unintended effects. For example, the query “heart attack NOT smoke” might eliminate articles in which the subjects are smoking, and it would also eliminate articles dealing with secondhand smoke, nonsmoking, or smoking cessation. PubMed processes all Boolean operators in a left-to-right sequence unless closed off by parenthesis, eg, helicobacter pylori AND (non-ulcer dyspepsia OR gastritis).\n\n【33】_Enter “helicobacter pylori_ AND _non-ulcer dyspepsia” in the Query box and select Go._\n\n【34】### Limits\n\n【35】PubMed allows users to refine searches further by imposing Limits, including publication type, age and sex of research subjects, date of publication, language, human or animal, or journal subsets.\n\n【36】_Select the following limits from the drop-down menus: randomized-controlled trial; middle aged, 45-64; English; human; and male. Select Go. Look for an article that answers your clinical question._\n\n【37】A check mark will be displayed in front of Limits to signify that limits are imposed for the results of this search. The specific Limits are displayed beneath the Features bar. Placing Limits on the search decreases the number of citations that need to be reviewed to answer your clinical question. Clicking on a citation title “hyperlinks” (ie, different-colored text that links to other Web pages) to the abstract. The user can connect to the full-text article online by selecting the journal icon displayed at the top of the abstract display. In some instances, the article is available or will be after a certain period. In most cases, however, access to the full text is limited to those individuals and institutions subscribing to the electronic version of the publication. For individuals without access to a medical or hospital library, articles can be ordered through the NLM through Loansome Doc (explored in more detail through the Order Documents or the NLM Gateway hyperlink on the blue sidebar on the left-hand side of the screen).\n\n【38】### CASE 2\n\n【39】A 47-year-old woman with cachexia and a history of chronic alcoholism presents with a 3-day episode of epigastric pain, anorexia, and nausea. Findings on a diagnostic evaluation are normal except for elevated pancreatic enzymes and an albumin level of 1.5 g/dL. After 24 hours, she feels hungry, but a general surgeon recommends continued bowel rest. You are concerned about her nutritional status and wish to start feedings. You ask yourself, “In patients with acute pancreatitis, does enteral versus parenteral nutrition decrease the length of hospitalization?”\n\n【40】### Search Filters\n\n【41】PubMed allows users to search for articles using Clinical Queries and Systematic Reviews search filters. These can be accessed through the Clinical Queries hyperlink on the sidebar on the left-hand side of the screen ( Figure 2 ). Clinical Queries are validated search strategies to locate articles on therapy, diagnosis, etiology, or prognosis.\n\n【42】*   Haynes RB\n*   Wilczynski N\n*   McKibbon KA\n*   Walker CJ\n*   Sinclair JC\n\n【43】Developing optimal search strategies for detecting clinically sound studies in MEDLINE.\n\n【44】无关删除-2_J Am Med Inform Assoc._ 1994; 1 : 447-458\n\n【45】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (569)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【46】These “filters” or “hedges” are designed to allow clinicians to search by maximizing either the specificity or the sensitivity of the search. The Systematic Reviews search filter will locate articles identified as systematic reviews, meta-analyses, reviews of clinical trials, clinical reviews, guidelines, evidence-based medicine, and consensus development conferences. Either filter can be used by selecting the button in front of it. Search terms need to be entered in the Query box on the bottom of the Clinical Queries page. Searches can be further refined by imposing Limits on the retrieved citations.\n\n【47】Figure 2 Clinical Queries search filters.\n\n【48】无关删除-2*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【49】_On the Clinical Queries search filter page, select Clinical Queries,_ ” _therapy,_ “ _and_ ” _sensitivity_ .” _Type_ ” _acute pancreatitis AND enteral nutrition AND hospital” in the Query box and select Go. Look for an article that answers your clinical question._\n\n【50】For this search we entered an additional term for outcome (ie, hospital) instead of 2 terms as we have done before. Entering more search terms may assist in increasing the search relevance.\n\n【51】### CASE 3\n\n【52】An 82-year-old man with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding from arteriovenous (av) malformations presents again with hematochezia, anemia, and orthostatism. He was previously found not to be a surgical candidate, and you wonder about additional therapeutic options when your colleague mentions estrogen therapy. You are unaware of the evidence and ask yourself, “In patients with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to av malformations, does hormonal therapy result in fewer episodes of bleeding and fewer transfusions than treatment with placebo?”\n\n【53】_Type in “av malformations AND estrogens” and select Go. As you look through the retrieved references, you will note that the articles do not answer your clinical question._\n\n【54】### Using MeSH Terms to Construct Searches\n\n【55】The language of medicine is rich. Concepts can be described by using a wide range of synonyms. Case 3 illustrates the pitfalls of depending on familiar key words alone. MeSH ( _M_ edical Subject _H_ eading) is NLM's hierarchical vocabulary that is used for indexing articles in PubMed, with more specific terms organized underneath more general terms. MeSH contains more than 19,000 terms and is updated annually to adapt to changes in medicine and medical terminology. Subject analysts examine each journal article indexed in PubMed and assign the most specific MeSH terms applicable, usually 10 to 12. This provides a reliable way to retrieve citations that use different terminology for the same concept because it indexes articles based on content rather than on the words of the authors.\n\n【56】Two additional features of PubMed capitalize on the MeSH vocabulary and increase the search yield, providing distinct advantages over other commonly used search engines. One of these features of PubMed is “automatic term mapping.” For each phrase that users enter into the query line, PubMed attempts to translate the terms by matching them against term libraries in a consistent manner. PubMed first checks them against a library of MeSH terms, then journal names, then commonly used phrases, and finally against author names. If PubMed finds the term in one of these libraries, it conducts the search by using this phrase in the appropriate search field (ie, author name field, MeSH term field, etc) and also searches for it as a text word in all search fields.\n\n【57】The other feature of PubMed that increases search yield is “automatic term explosion.” Journal articles are entered into PubMed with both MeSH headings (eg, estrogens) and Subheadings. For example, for an article on the use of estrogen as a therapeutic intervention, the subheading “therapeutic use” would be used to characterize a publication more completely. MeSH Subheadings are further grouped into families of subheadings (to see MeSH Subheading categories, hyperlink to Help through the blue sidebar and see MeSH Subheadings and Families of MeSH Subheading Explosions). When PubMed searches for a term, it automatically “explodes” or includes the more specific terms (eg, “estrone” and “estriol” for the term “estrogen”) and all the MeSH Subheadings in the family of subheadings. This effectively increases the search yield. Any time during a search, users can see how PubMed has executed the search by selecting Details in the features menu.\n\n【58】_Hyperlink through the MeSH Browser on the blue sidebar on the left-hand side of the screen. Type in “av malformation” in the Query box, select Go. Select “arteriovenous malformation” from the list of provided terms and select Browse this term._\n\n【59】PubMed was not able to translate your term but instead generated a list of other possible terms to use in the search. Additionally, PubMed defined the term “arteriovenous malformation” and displayed where it appears in the MeSH hierarchy.\n\n【60】_Hyperlink to “vascular diseases” to explore the MeSH terms included under this MeSH heading._\n\n【61】Notice that 2 terms could be used to obtain evidence to answer your clinical question: “arteriovenous malformation” and “angiodysplasia.”\n\n【62】_Hyperlink to “angiodysplasia.” Select Add._\n\n【63】PubMed begins to construct the search in the window ( Figure 3 ).\n\n【64】Figure 3 Constructing search strategies with MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) terms.\n\n【65】无关删除-2*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【66】_Hyperlink to “vascular diseases” and hyperlink to “arteriovenous malformations.” Add this term but change the Boolean operator to OR. Type “estrogens” in the top Query box and select Go. Select the Boolean operator AND, select Add. Press PubMed Search to execute the search._\n\n【67】If you are interested in a higher level of evidence (ie, randomized-controlled clinical trial), you can set Limits to clinical trial. At the right of the screen is a link entitled Related Articles. This PubMed feature searches for similar citations by using a complex algorithm that scans titles, abstracts, and MeSH terms.\n\n【68】ADDITIONAL FEATURES\n-------------------\n\n【69】PubMed provides all users with the option to register for the Cubby, which is free of charge. This feature allow users to store and update searches. First-time users must register and select a unique password for access. This resource might be used to conduct systematic reviews because it allows users to update searches quickly, which can be kept in the Cubby indefinitely.\n\n【70】ADVANCED FEATURES\n-----------------\n\n【71】PubMed provides many other advanced features that will assist interested clinicians in finding the evidence necessary to make informed clinical decisions. We encourage users who become more comfortable with basic features to challenge themselves to use the Help, Overview, and Tutorials that are available through the blue sidebar on the left- hand side of the screen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Also known as hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy, Stickler syndrome is usually diagnosed during infancy or childhood.\n\n【2】Children who have Stickler syndrome often have distinctive facial features — prominent eyes, a small nose with a scooped-out facial appearance and a receding chin. They are often born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate).\n\n【3】While there is no cure for Stickler syndrome, treatments can help control symptoms and prevent complications. In some cases, surgery may be needed to correct some of the physical abnormalities associated with Stickler syndrome.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The signs and symptoms of Stickler syndrome — and the severity of those signs and symptoms — can vary widely from person to person, even within the same family.\n\n【6】*   **Eye problems.** In addition to having severe nearsightedness, children who have Stickler syndrome often experience cataracts, glaucoma and retinal detachments.\n*   **Hearing difficulties.** The extent of hearing loss varies among people who have Stickler syndrome. It usually affects the ability to hear high frequencies.\n*   **Bone and joint abnormalities.** Children who have Stickler syndrome often have overly flexible joints and are more likely to develop abnormal curvatures of the spine, such as scoliosis. Osteoarthritis can begin in adolescence.\n\n【7】### When to see a doctor\n\n【8】Regular follow-up visits, as well as yearly visits to doctors specializing in eye disorders, are crucial to monitor any progression of symptoms. Early treatment can help prevent life-altering complications. Hearing should be checked every six months in children through age 5 and then yearly thereafter.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Stickler syndrome is caused by mutations in certain genes involved in the formation of collagen — one of the building blocks of many types of connective tissues. The type of collagen most commonly affected is that used to produce joint cartilage and the jellylike material (vitreous) found within the eyes.\n\n【11】Risk factors\n------------\n\n【12】Your child is more likely to be born with Stickler syndrome if either you or your partner has the disorder.\n\n【13】Complications\n-------------\n\n【14】Potential complications of Stickler syndrome include:\n\n【15】*   **Difficulty breathing or feeding.** Breathing or feeding difficulties may occur in babies born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), a small lower jaw and a tendency for the tongue to drop back toward the throat.\n*   **Blindness.** Blindness can occur if retinal detachments aren't repaired promptly.\n*   **Ear infections.** Children with facial structure abnormalities associated with Stickler syndrome are more likely to develop ear infections than are children with normal facial structure.\n*   **Deafness.** Hearing loss associated with Sticker syndrome may worsen with time.\n*   **Heart problems.** Some people with Stickler syndrome may be at higher risk of heart valve problems.\n*   **Dental problems.** Most children who have Stickler syndrome have abnormally small jaws, so there often isn't enough room for the full complement of adult teeth. Braces or, in some cases, dental surgeries may be necessary.\n\n【16】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.\n\n【6】No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective than vaginal rings. Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.\n\n【7】This medicine will not prevent HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.\n\n【8】This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.\n\n【9】This product is available in the following dosage forms:\n\n【10】*   Insert, Extended Release\n\n【11】Before Using\n------------\n\n【12】In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may cause unwanted side effects.\n\n【40】This medicine is to be used only in the vagina. This combination medicine is contained in a ring that is placed into your vagina. The ring will slowly release small amounts of the medicine for your body to absorb.\n\n【41】This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\n【42】NuvaRing® is used in a 4 week cycle. You may start using the vaginal ring on the first day of your menstrual period or between the second and fifth day, keeping it in place for 3 weeks.\n\n【43】Once the ring is in place inside your vagina, you should not be able to feel it. If you feel uncomfortable, the ring may not be inserted far enough. Gently push the ring farther into your vagina. If you feel pain, talk to your doctor.\n\n【44】Check for the presence of the ring inside your vagina regularly (including before and after having sex).\n\n【45】The ring may move down into the lower part of your vagina accidently. This can happen if you strain to have a bowel movement. Use your finger to gently push the ring back into place. If the ring comes all the way out of your vagina, rinse it off with warm water and put it back in. Call your doctor if the ring comes out several times.\n\n【46】Remove the vaginal ring after 3 weeks on the same day of the week and time it was inserted. During the 1-week break, you will usually have your menstrual period. Another ring will be inserted after a week.\n\n【47】While using this medicine, you may need to use an additional form of birth control method (eg, condom, spermicide) during the first 7 days to prevent pregnancy.

Blepharitis usually affects both eyes along the edges of the eyelids.\n\n【2】Blepharitis commonly occurs when tiny oil glands near the base of the eyelashes become clogged, causing irritation and redness. Several diseases and conditions can cause blepharitis.\n\n【3】Blepharitis is often a chronic condition that's difficult to treat. Blepharitis can be uncomfortable and unsightly. But it usually doesn't cause permanent damage to your eyesight, and it's not contagious.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】Blepharitis signs and symptoms are typically worse in the morning. They include:\n\n【6】*   Watery eyes\n*   Red eyes\n*   A gritty, burning or stinging sensation in the eyes\n*   Eyelids that appear greasy\n*   Itchy eyelids\n*   Red, swollen eyelids\n*   Flaking of the skin around the eyes\n*   Crusted eyelashes\n*   Eyelid sticking\n*   More frequent blinking\n*   Sensitivity to light\n*   Blurred vision that usually improves with blinking\n\n【7】When to see a doctor\n--------------------\n\n【8】If you have blepharitis signs and symptoms that don't seem to improve despite good hygiene — regular cleaning and care of the affected area — make an appointment with your doctor.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】The exact cause of blepharitis isn't clear. It might be associated with one or more of the following:\n\n【11】*   Seborrheic dermatitis — dandruff of the scalp and eyebrows\n*   Infection\n*   Clogged or malfunctioning oil glands in your eyelids\n*   Rosacea — a skin condition characterized by facial redness\n*   Allergies, including allergic reactions to eye medications, contact lens solutions or eye makeup\n*   Eyelash mites or lice\n*   Dry eyes\n\n【12】Complications\n-------------\n\n【13】If you have blepharitis, you might also have:\n\n【14】*   **Eyelash problems.** Blepharitis can cause your eyelashes to fall out, grow abnormally (misdirected eyelashes) or lose color.\n*   **Eyelid skin problems.** Scarring can develop on your eyelids from long-term blepharitis. Or the eyelid edges might turn inward or outward.\n*   **Excess tearing or dry eyes.** Abnormal oily secretions and other debris shed from the eyelids, such as flaking associated with dandruff, can build up in your tear film — the water, oil and mucus solution that forms tears.\n\n【15】    Abnormal tear film interferes with keeping your eyelids moist. This can irritate your eyes and cause symptoms of dry eyes or excess tearing.\n\n【16】*   **Stye.** A stye is an infection that develops near the base of the eyelashes. The result is a painful lump on the edge of your eyelid. A stye is usually most visible on the surface of the eyelid.\n*   **Chalazion.** A chalazion occurs when there's a blockage in one of the small oil glands at the margin of the eyelid, just behind the eyelashes. This blockage causes inflammation of the gland, which makes the eyelid swell and redden. This can clear up or turn into a hard, nontender bump.\n*   **Chronic pink eye.** Blepharitis can lead to recurrent bouts of pink eye (conjunctivitis).\n*   **Injury to the cornea.** Constant irritation from inflamed eyelids or misdirected eyelashes can cause a sore to develop on your cornea. Not having enough tears could increase your risk of a corneal infection.\n\n【17】删除1:<u>By Mayo Clinic Staff</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Minot—Nobel Prize for the Treatment of Pernicious Anemia\nGeorge R. Minot was born in Boston, Mass, on December 2, 1885. He was a great-grandson of Dr James Jackson (1777-1867), cofounder of the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1821. His father was a private practitioner and taught at Harvard Medical School. Minot attended private schools in Boston and graduated from Harvard College in 1908. He enrolled at Harvard Medical School, and during his junior year, he demonstrated that a patient considered to have pernicious anemia actually had congenital hemolytic anemia. After graduation in 1912, Minot became a “house pupil” (intern) at the Massachusetts General Hospital. He became interested in diseases of the blood and began taking meticulous histories of the dietary habits of patients with anemia. He was a resident at the Johns Hopkins University and worked in the laboratory of William H. Howell (1860-1945), who was interested in the coagulation of blood and had identified heparin. As a resident, Minot determined that delayed coagulation in patients with jaundice who had bleeding tendencies was due to a decreased level of prothrombin.\n\n【1】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【5】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【7】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【8】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?

The pain radiated to her back, did not worsen with postural changes, and was associated with shortness of breath. Because of her recent diagnosis of PE, she sought further evaluation. She had been compliant with her medication regimen (twice daily apixaban, the only medication she was taking) for the past month. Her medical history was remarkable for hyperlipidemia and obstructive sleep apnea. She reported no history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes, hypertension, or tobacco use. On presentation, vital signs revealed a body mass index of 36 kg/m  , heart rate of 80 beats/min, blood pressure of 205/89 mm Hg, temperature of 36.8°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, and normal oxygen saturation while breathing room air. Physical examination findings were notable for normal heart sounds, clear lung auscultation, and symmetric peripheral pulses. Initial electrocardiography (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with no ST-segment changes. Laboratory evaluation revealed the following (reference ranges provided parenthetically): white blood cell count, 7.8 × 10  /L (3.4 to 9.6 × 10  /L); hemoglobin, 13.5 g/dL (11.6 to 15.0 g/dL); platelet count, 136 × 10  /L (157 to 371 × 10  /L); sodium, 143 mmol/L (135 to 145 mmol/L); potassium, 4.1 mmol/L (3.6 to 5.2 mmol/L); and creatinine, 0.88 mg/dL (0.59 to 1.04 mg/dL). Additionally, her N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level was 84 pg/mL (10 to 227 pg/mL), and her initial high-sensitivity troponin concentration was 340 ng/L (≤10 ng/L). Chest radiography revealed no acute abnormalities.\n\n【1】*   1.\n\n【2】    **Based on the available clinical data, which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ underlying etiology of this patient’s presenting symptoms?**\n\n【3】    *   a.\n\n【4】        Pneumonia\n\n【5】    *   b.\n\n【6】        Acute pericarditis\n\n【7】    *   c.\n\n【8】        Aortic dissection\n\n【9】    *   d.\n\n【10】        PE\n\n【11】    *   e.\n\n【12】        ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\n\n【13】Pneumonia is an unlikely diagnosis in the absence of fever, leukocytosis, cough, and infiltrates on chest radiography and would not typically present this acutely. Additionally, our patient did not have the typical pleuritic chest pain that improves with leaning forward and findings of diffuse ST-segment elevation on ECG to suggest acute pericarditis.\n\n【14】Aortic dissection is a medical emergency classically presenting as severe, tearing chest pain. The triad of abrupt, stabbing thoracic or abdominal pain, unequal pulses, and evidence of aortic or mediastinal widening on chest radiography is suggestive of aortic dissection.\n\n【15】无关删除-2*   von Kodolitsch Y.\n*   Schwartz A.G.\n*   Nienaber C.A.\n\n【16】Clinical prediction of acute aortic dissection.\n\n【17】无关删除-2_Arch Intern Med._ 2000; 160 : 2977-2982\n\n【18】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (289)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【19】With our patient’s symmetric peripheral pulses and unremarkable findings on chest radiography, her presenting symptoms are unlikely to be due to dissection.\n\n【20】Although PE is classically associated with tachycardia, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain, many patients with PE present with little to no symptoms.

In addition, a large enough PE can result in right ventricular (RV) strain leading to troponinemia. Although our patient had reportedly been compliant with her apixaban, PE should still be considered in this moderate-risk patient with a PE just 1 month previously in the setting of likely undiagnosed ovarian malignancy.\n\n【26】The diagnosis of STEMI in females requires elevation in cardiac biomarkers along with greater than 1-mm ST elevation in contiguous leads (or >1.5 mm in V <sub>2 </sub> and V <sub>3 </sub> ) on ECG. Our patient had normal ECG findings, but with her increasing troponin levels, a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) remains a strong possibility, especially in the absence of right-sided heart failure and a normal N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, arguing against severe RV strain–associated troponinemia. Our patient was thus admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of PE vs acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\n【27】*   2.\n\n【28】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ next step in management?**\n\n【29】    *   a.\n\n【30】        Low-intensity heparin infusion\n\n【31】    *   b.\n\n【32】        Moderate-intensity heparin infusion\n\n【33】    *   c.\n\n【34】        Aspirin plus clopidogrel plus moderate-intensity heparin infusion\n\n【35】    *   d.\n\n【36】        High-intensity heparin infusion\n\n【37】    *   e.\n\n【38】        Aspirin plus clopidogrel plus high-intensity heparin infusion\n\n【39】Given the fairly high concern for PE, anticoagulation with heparin must be initiated immediately. Deciding on the intensity of the heparin infusion initially rests on the suspected etiology of the patient’s symptoms along with the consideration of adverse effects.

A repeat ECG revealed new subtle ST elevations in the inferior leads, and the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent evaluation for an evolving STEMI.

It is commonly believed that, within a matter of weeks, telemedicine was widely and successfully implemented and that medicine is forever changed. The experience on the ground, however, is more nuanced, with both positive and negative experiences for patients and clinicians. Advanced models of team-based care with in-room support (aTBC) have developed over the past decade, with strategic delegation of tasks to uptrained support staff, allowing physicians to provide undivided attention to their patients and greater access to care for their populations. Herein, we describe our initial experiences with telemedicine in the context of many years practicing in aTBC models. Our experience demonstrates that when implementing telemedicine visits, it is important to avoid a reflex reversion to the outmoded model of the physician alone in the room with the patient and instead bring forth the safety, quality, and satisfaction advantages associated with aTBC. We provide a practical “how-to” guide for implementing telemedicine visits; outline logistical details of representative video and audio visits from our own practices; describe new opportunities for family engagement, care coordination, and comanagement across specialties; and outline a research agenda going forward to further knowledge of the risks and benefits and optimal application of health care on a telemedicine platform.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】aTBC ( advanced team-based care ), CMS ( Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ), EHR ( electronic health record ), MA ( medical assistant )\n\n【4】Adoption of telemedicine has been accelerated by necessity with the onset of COVID-19. The common narrative is that COVID-19 happened, and within a matter of weeks, telemedicine was widely implemented, all is rosy, and medicine is forever changed.

In 1 of our clinics (J.J.), approximately one-half of all planned video visits in the first several weeks failed for a combination of reasons, including technology breakdowns and limitations to patient understanding of the process.\n\n【68】Clinicians experienced many frustrations, including network and platform reliability issues, patient and clinician Internet and Wi-Fi limitations, insufficient device battery life, poor audio and video quality, and multiple virtual platforms, causing confusion for clinicians and patients.\n\n【69】无关删除-2*   Lam K.\n*   Lu A.D.\n*   Shi Y.\n*   Covinsky K.E.\n\n【70】Assessing telemedicine unreadiness among older adults in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【71】无关删除-2_JAMA Intern Med._ 2020; 180 : 1389-1391\n\n【72】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (321)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【73】For some virtual-visit platforms, patients need a patient portal account, which only approximately one-half of our patients (J.J.) have, and some also require the patient to download a special app. Some physicians reported to us, and in the literature,\n\n【74】*   Nabhan C.\n\n【75】The virtual visit.\n\n【76】无关删除-2_JAMA Cardiol._ 2020; 5 : 1089-1090\n\n【77】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (1)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【78】that it could take 20 to 40 minutes of staff time to help the patient establish a connection before the video visit. Physicians in safety-net clinics might spend one afternoon calling their patients to set up for the next afternoon’s official audio or video visit (Personal communication, Dr. Mark Linzer, May 12, 2020). In addition, some physicians report that virtual visits are more superficial and less satisfying, with reduced ability to read facial and body expressions and no access to the therapeutic touch that comes with examining a patient.\n\n【79】In our experience, patient adoption was initially motivated primarily by patients’ concern for their health (“Do I have COVID?” or “I don’t want to come to the office and risk being exposed to COVID”) rather than patients’ embrace of technology to connect with their physicians in a novel way. Over time, some of our patients were also motivated by the desire to resume care for their non-COVID issues and yet remained fearful that it was not safe to come in.\n\n【80】Distracted Doctoring\n--------------------\n\n【81】We experienced unexpected hazards with the early implementation of telemedicine. The “doctor-does-it-all” mentality, pervasive in our history, re-emerged, even among pioneers in aTBC. Most, if not all, of the tasks of preparing our patients and the medical record for in-office visits, which were previously completed by our practice support (medical assistants, nurses, and clerical staff), were handed back to physicians, who were now alone “in the room” with their patients. In addition, there is new work associated with establishing and maintaining a video connection. This led to significant inefficiencies, uncompleted standard workflows, cognitive overload, and frustration among patients and clinicians alike. There was an assumption that this additional work could be performed by physicians while patients continued to talk with us and that such multitasking would be without consequence. And yet, we are aware of the perils of this time-pressured divided attention: the risks of skipping steps and taking shortcuts, mistyping and clicking, incomplete ordering, documentation inaccuracies, and working in the wrong chart.\n\n【82】We were transforming on the fly. Initially, we did not have the standard operating procedures, robust training, and adequate experience practicing aTBC in virtual visits. Not only did the physicians and advanced-practice providers have experience gaps, so did our clinical support teams. As we develop new models of TBC for telemedicine, we are building on our experiences with aTBC for in-office visits.\n\n【83】In-Office Advanced Team-Based Care\n----------------------------------\n\n【84】In aTBC, 2 medical assistants (MAs) or nurses are paired with a physician and serve as navigators for the patient. During the office visit, the upskilled MA or nurse stays with the patient from the beginning to the end of each appointment. During the pre-visit rooming process, the nurse or MA performs agenda setting, medication review, care gap closure and updates the history, pends refills, performs pre-charting, and obtains vital signs. When the physician enters the room, the nurse or MA assists with retrieval of information and visit-note documentation, pends additional orders, and completes billing forms: all in real time per physician direction. During the post-visit, the nurse or MA reviews the visit and next steps with the patient; engages the patient in self-management support, as appropriate; and arranges for the next visit, along with specified pre-visit laboratory testing. Soon thereafter, the physician reviews and signs off on the note, orders, and billing information. Because they were present during the patients’ appointments, the MA or nurse is also able to more capably coordinate care and respond to issues that arise between visits.\n\n【85】This model is associated with higher-quality care, better documentation, increased access and productivity, and greater staff and physician satisfaction.\n\n【86】无关删除-2*   Hopkins K.\n*   Sinsky C.A.\n\n【87】Team-based care: saving time and improving efficiency.\n\n【88】无关删除-2_Fam Pract Manag._ 2014; 21 : 23-29\n\n【89】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【90】无关删除-2*   Anderson P.\n*   Halley M.D.\n\n【91】A new approach to making your doctor-nurse team more productive.\n\n【92】无关删除-2_Fam Pract Manag._ 2008; 15 : 35-40\n\n【93】无关删除-2*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【94】*   Jerzak J.\n\n【95】_Restoring joy in practice through team based care.

We recommend physicians and their teams develop workflows that continue the gains achieved in aTBC and avoid reversion to the unsafe “doctor-does-it-all” model. It is crucial that staff continue to provide this support whether the visit is face to face or virtual ( Table 1 ). For practices that have experience with aTBC, a similar model of virtual in-room support increases staff engagement in patient care and frees the physician to give undivided attention to the patient because of the enhanced documentation and EHR support. For practices with less robust staffing, or limited experience with TBC, enhanced virtual rooming by the MA or nurse, including setting up and starting documentation before physician involvement, still provides significant improvement in efficiency and a decrease in the burden of EHR work for the physician. Care-gap closure, medication review, and updating of the medical history are examples of work that can be done during virtual rooming by the staff, even if they are unable to provide in-room support.\n\n【109】Table 1 Models of Teamwork for Virtual Visits\n\n| Model of teamwork | Description | Workflow | Most appropriate- use cases |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team-based care with synchronous (real-time) “in-room” support | Video or phone visit with nurse or MA present from start to finish of appointment | 1.Pre-visit: Nurse or MA virtually rooms patient (agenda setting; medication reconciliation, care-gap closure; home vital signs; preliminary review of pre-visit lab results) and pre-charting, as appropriate.2.Visit: Nurse/MA stays online, drafting visit note, pending orders and completing billing forms in real time, per physician/APP direction.3.Post-visit: Nurse/MA reviews visit and next steps with patient, engages patient in self-management support, as appropriate, and arranges for next visit, either in person or virtually, along with pre-visit lab testing. The physician/APP reviews and signs off on the note, orders and billing information. | All visit types, unless the patient requests the nurse or MA to leave during a portion of the visit. |\n| Team-based care with asynchronous support | Nurse/MA present during pre-visit and sometimes also during post-visit | 1.Pre-visit: Nurse/MA virtually rooms patient (agenda setting, medication reconciliation, care gap closure, home vitals, pre-visit lab result preliminary review) and pre-charting, as appropriate. (This may include pulling up a problem-focused template and drafting the majority of the visit documentation, along with pending the next appointment with pended pre-visit lab).2.Visit: Nurse/MA virtually hands off the patient to the physician for an appointment immediately to follow or the following day, and exits.3.Post-visit: The physician/APP may modify the visit note documentation and orders, although the much of data entry is anticipated to be accomplished during pre-charting by the Nurse/MA | Straightforward, single problem acute or chronic visits (ie, URI or controlled hypertension) |\n\n【111】APP = advanced practice provider; MA = medical assistant; URI = upper respriratory infection.\n\n【112】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【113】We share representative experiences implementing aTBC within both video and phone visits from our practices ( Appendix 2 , available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ).\n\n【114】Novel Visits Made Possible With Telemedicine\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【115】Technology has the potential to support novel clinical encounters in the future that bring family members, staff, and even other physicians “into the room” in a way that is not possible in purely in-office visits. For example, for complex medical and family decision making, such as end-of-life planning, a daughter from out of state could attend her mother’s visit virtually. During the shut-down phase of a contagious pandemic, all parties may be virtual; during ordinary times, the patient, staff, and physician may be in office with the out-of-state daughter joining by video.\n\n【116】In addition, we envision the possibility of better care coordination as we become adept at cross-specialty hybrid visits. For example, a patient and his cardiologist are considering when to schedule heart valve surgery. The patient also requires radiation therapy for prostate cancer. The cardiology team could set up an appointment with patient and family, and video conference in the oncologist, so that the family had confidence that the physicians involved in their care were all “on the same page” and that the order of interventions was optimized.\n\n【117】Finally, there may be circumstances in which, for efficiency or for control of infection, it is better for the nurse or MA in aTBC to perform support virtually, outside of the examination room, but still “inside the room” via video conferencing technology during an in-person appointment between the patient and physician, limiting the number of people in close physical proximity without compromising the benefits of aTBC.\n\n【118】Logistic Pearls\n---------------\n\n【119】### Let Patients Choose Their Visit Type\n\n【120】Some patients, when offered a video visit, will prefer an in-office appointment. Allowing patients to choose their visit type, within reason—making exceptions, for example, during COVID when a patient has upper respiratory symptoms or when community COVID rates are high, making an inperson visit unsafe—is a patient-centered approach. We provide guidance to help match the encounter type to the visit platform ( Appendix 3 , available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ).\n\n【121】### Track Appointment Type Demand\n\n【122】Some physicians prefer to schedule patients into different session blocks, depending on whether the appointment is virtual or in person. In doing so, it is important for unit leaders to track appointment type demand so that this can be matched to supply. One of our organizations (K.H.) was surprised to learn that fill rates for virtual visits were lower than fill rates for in-person visits. In fact, some patients preferred to wait longer for the next available in-office visit rather than schedule a sooner video visit, a trend we are watching closely. As a result of these observations, we shifted the balance of appointment-type offerings.\n\n【123】### Schedule Realistic Time Slots for Virtual Visits\n\n【124】It may take more time to accomplish the same care in a video visit compared with in-office visit, owing to the associated logistics and the limitations of communication via a 2-dimensional screen. We have learned that it is unlikely that we can do everything we would accomplish in an in-office visit in a virtual visit in the same amount of time, especially when the physician is acting solo. By contrast, as we re-engage our staff to provide full support during virtual visits, we are finding that time requirements for physicians in these visits is coming closer to the time required for in-office visits. Staff involvement in virtual visits is critical for optimal efficiency.\n\n【125】### Support Patients in Gaining Familiarity With the Technology, and Establish Expectations\n\n【126】It can be helpful to have a team member call patients ahead of their first virtual visits to walk them through the process. This is also a good time to set up mutual expectations: for example, regarding the length of the visit (“We will have 15 minutes with you tomorrow, so I’d like to be sure we understand what your priorities are for that visit”) and its location (“We find it works best, when possible, if you can be in a quiet, private location where you won’t be disturbed.”) One physician reported on his early experience with telemedicine during COVID “Several minutes in, I learned the patient was having a pedicure during our visit” (Personal communication, Dr. Yul Ejnes, May 9, 2020). We’ve also had several examples of patients driving while doing a virtual visit, a practice that we do not recommend for either patient or physician.\n\n【127】### Consider Simulated “Practice Visits” for Clinical Teams\n\n【128】At one of our organizations (K.H.) we held simulated “practice virtual visits” among our team, with one of us serving as the patient. This allowed physicians and support staff to experience the virtual platform from both sides. We learned to navigate the platform and troubleshoot technical problems. We are considering offering patients a “practice virtual visit” to let them test drive the platform technology before the actual visit.\n\n【129】### Have a Backup Plan for Technology Failures\n\n【130】Having technical support available in real time and on site in the office is valuable at go live. It is important to have a backup plan if the technology fails or user error prevents an adequate connection. Our default backup (K.H.) was initially a phone call, now it is Apple FaceTime, Google Duo, or Doximity Dialer, rather than a phone call.\n\n【131】### Help the Patient Assist With the Physical Examination\n\n【132】Until we have accessories for smart phones and computers that assist in the virtual physical examinations, we can enlist the help of the patient: for example, to check patients' pulses, show them how to feel the radial artery pulse, and then ask them to count out loud every time they feel a beat. For dermatologic concerns, ask the patient to send pictures ahead of the appointment. (It is difficult to see skin lesions by video camera, and patients often have difficulty aiming the camera and optimizing the lighting.) For neurologic examinations, patients can be asked to do tasks associated with daily living, such as putting on their shoes, during the visit. There are, however, some aspects of the physical examination that are not feasible or may be unsafe to perform virtually.\n\n【133】The specific needs for physical examination can be anticipated in the pre-visit phone call or portal message, which, if done the day before, allows patients time to practice taking their pulse, to send in a picture of the skin lesion, or ensure that the camera is adjusted so that the activity of interest can be viewed.\n\n【134】### Respect Boundaries for Patients\n\n【135】Some patients may find it intrusive to have their physician and team peer into their home or to have their family members or coworkers overhear confidential conversations. During an initial pre-visit setup call, the patient can be instructed on the use of artificial backgrounds, if desired.\n\n【136】### Respect Boundaries for Physicians\n\n【137】Physicians may be concerned about breeches of their own privacy when conducting visits from home, wondering about the risk of patients inadvertently achieving access to personal information. What else might they see or hear that physicians would rather they not?\n\n【138】#### Some Suggestions\n\n【139】Choose a quiet location, with a low likelihood for audible and visual distractions. Check for adequacy of Internet and Wi-Fi signals. Have chargers available for any devices and equipment, as well as a backup power source. Consider using the “Do Not Disturb” feature on your device. Be aware of what may be visible through your camera in the background and that sound and audio connections with the patient may be active before or after you think they are. Use virtual backgrounds and headphones. Understand the potential for unintended consequences of doing virtual visits from a personal device (potential access to your phone number, email address, device IP one address, or other personal information).\n\n【140】### Scheduling Tips\n\n【141】When telemedicine is delivered from home, there is a risk that the physician will feel “on the clock” most of the time. We suggest maintaining a weekly schedule of telemedicine sessions, just as one would have for in-office visits, rather than handling visits in random fashion at any time.\n\n【142】Some physicians schedule virtual visits and in-person visits within the same schedule block. This allows patients the flexibility to convert from 1 visit type to the next at the last minute and provides the physician some variety in the course of their days. It also requires staying precisely on time or developing a system in which the assistant calls the patient within a prespecified window of time when the team is ready to begin that patient’s appointment.\n\n【143】An alternative approach is to cohort all in-person visits and all virtual visits into specific time blocks. This allows the physician and the team to focus on particlur visit types within a certain block of time, which may enhance efficiency. It may even allow the physician and team to manage these visits off site (ie, from home), if desired. By limiting the number of staff members in the clinic at any given time, this can also be helpful with maintaining safe physical distancing in the office.\n\n【144】### Use the Flexibility of Virtual Care to Your Advantage\n\n【145】There may be times when physicans may have minor illnesses or may be off work because of exposure. The flexility of virtual visits allows the physician to provide patient care from home, avoiding significant disruptions and delays in care.\n\n【146】Research Agenda\n---------------\n\n【147】There is a paucity of evidence about the safety, efficacy, and unintended consequences of this new mode of clinical interaction with patients. Likewise, we are only beginning to explore some of the novel opportunities for enhanced connection and communication. Our first few months’ experience with telemedicine has raised more questions than answers about the pros and cons of virtual visits ( Appendix 4 , available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ). We believe it is important to approach telemedicine with an open mind; to not assume equivalency of efficacy, safety, and strength of relationships resulting from in-office vs virtual visits; and to consider new opportunities this platform brings. In Table 2 , we outline questions that can inform a research agenda, with an emphasis on optimizing workflows and teamwork, overcoming logistic hurdles, and understanding the impact of remote care on quadruple aim\n\n【148】无关删除-2*   Zulman D.M.\n*   Verghese A.\n*   et al.\n\n【149】Tele-presence 5.\n\n【150】https://medstanfordedu/presence/initiatives/stanford-presence-5/tele-presence-5html. 2020\n\n【151】无关删除-2*   Google Scholar\n\n【152】无关删除-2*   Bodenheimer T.\n*   Sinsky C.\n\n【153】From triple to quadruple aim: care of the patient requires care of the provider.\n\n【154】无关删除-2_Ann Fam Med._ 2014; 12 : 573-576\n\n【155】无关删除-2*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1953)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【156】outcomes of quality, cost, and patient and care-team experience.\n\n【157】Table 2 Research Agenda for Telemedicine in Ambulatory Care\n\n|  | Research question |\n| --- | --- |\n| Logistic | What types of visit are most appropriate for in person vs virtual care?

Our intial experience suggests that telemedicine, implemented without attention to workflow, risks eliminating—rather than enhancing—teamwork and, by returning to a solo-hero model, risks introducing new hazards. These early days also suggest novel opportunities to bring family members from afar or other clinicians involved in the patient’s care “into the room” and thus improve patient and family centeredness and enhance care coordination.\n\n【163】Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------\n\n【164】无关删除-2*   Download .docx (.02 MB)\n\n【165】    Help with docx files\n\n【166】    Appendix\n\n【167】*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJmNzdlNzU3NjFjNjhiMmE3NjAwMTQ3NTMxOGYyMzVmZiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDA2NDA1fQ.ENg1IyN4sq0L4tdN-4KdmIYiVkyElSswrYm9ARIIdMp\\_6JVumwU\\_i4WsPYhL\\_TSaqf2-kiDCrrRtovM4yEQTlY1WfXnZ54qZYjESjxb8c2alR1d1YNeEJFdfZ6557nmKksA3RkPe097zWT2OOm1lT7NlvV592hbeBrLCFoM1klfXo809cCLMGV44mtPsm2-JMTuK--nc2b1RLFmNOTo0IZK5m7\\_W2LhSWXlcYLWgKSNz4VU93okYzlmTu2qjX23ZuIUr-moUFe149sizO-ZymEpgUQxOi4EhCVthhopN8iu9hqKN79c1akXDqg4DOsODbOWc5S3n\\_3x9oXKJXgv1zA\n\n【168】    Download .mp4 (71.47 MB)\n\n【169】    Help with .mp4 files\n\n【170】    Video 1", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.\n\n【51】If you miss one white pill, take it as soon as you can. Then take your next pill at the regular time. This means, you may take two pills in one day. Use a second form of birth control until you have been taking white pills for seven days in a row.\n\n【52】If you miss two white pills in a row during Week 1 or 2, take two pills as soon as you can. Take two more pills on the next day. Then go back to your regular schedule of taking one pill every day. Use a second form of birth control until you have been taking white pills for seven days in a row.\n\n【53】If you started this medicine on Day 1 of your period and you miss two white pills in a row during Week 3, throw out the rest of your pills and start a new pack the same day. If you miss three or more white pills in a row during any week, throw out the rest of your pills and start a new pack the same day. Use a second form of birth control until you have been taking white pills for seven days in a row.\n\n【54】If you started this medicine on the Sunday after your period started and you miss two white pills in a row during Week 3, keep taking one pill every day until the next Sunday. Then throw away the rest of your pills and start a new pack on that same Sunday. Use a second form of birth control until you have been taking white pills for seven days in a row.\n\n【55】If you started this medicine on the Sunday after your period started and you miss three or more white pills in a row during any week, keep taking one pill every day until the next Sunday. Then throw away the rest of your pills and start a new pack on that same Sunday. Use a second form of birth control until you have been taking white pills for seven days in a row.\n\n【56】If you miss your pills and change your schedule, you may not have a period for that month. Make sure your doctor knows if you miss your period two months in a row, because you may be pregnant.\n\n【57】You could have light bleeding or spotting any time you do not take a pill on time. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to have bleeding.\n\n【58】### Storage\n\n【59】Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\n【60】Keep out of the reach of children.\n\n【61】Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\n【62】Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\n【63】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【64】It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly and does not cause unwanted effects.

Correlations were performed between echocardiographic measures of PH and clinical variables. Cumulative survival probabilities for patients with PH were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared to a historical cohort of patients with PLCH using time-dependent proportional hazard regression.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of the 17 patients, PH (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure \\[PASP\\] at rest, >35 mm Hg) was present in 15. Thirteen patients (6 men; median PASP, 67 mm Hg; range, 41.2-90.6 mm Hg) had no other known causes of PH. All patients were smokers. Nine patients had a PASP of more than 50 mm Hg. An inverse correlation was found between the forced vital capacity and PASP ( _r_ \\=–0.61; _P_ \\=.03); no correlation was found between PASP and other pulmonary function parameters. Seven patients with a PASP greater than 65 mm Hg had an enlarged right ventricle with impaired systolic function. The development of PH in patients with PLCH was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 22.8; 95% confidence interval, 7.6 to >68.9; _P_ <.001).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Severe PH occurs in PLCH, correlates with the forced vital capacity, and has a significant impact on survival. Clinicians should consider echocardiographic screening for PH in all dyspneic patients with PLCH.\n\n【8】DLCO ( diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide ), FEV ( forced expiratory volume in 1 second ), FVC ( forced vital capacity ), PASP ( pulmonary artery systolic pressure ), PH ( pulmonary hypertension ), PLCH ( pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis ), RV ( residual volume ), TLC ( total lung capacity )\n\n【9】无关删除-1To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】无关删除-1### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】无关删除-1Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】无关删除-1One-time access price info\n\n【13】无关删除-1*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】无关删除-1### Subscribe:\n\n【15】无关删除-1Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】无关删除-1Already a print subscriber?
